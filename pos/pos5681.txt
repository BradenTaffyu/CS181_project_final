2020 early access review swiftly thrust in to this hostile world i found myself with a retinue of eight eight loyal yet untrained men that slogged on foot as i traversed the land atop an old work horse unaligned to any house or lord we made our coin in the local villages settling family feuds escorting cattle from village to village and in a few extreme circumstances taking up arms with the pissants to repel marauding bands of deserters it wasn t long before more fighting men joined my flock over the weeks we collected weapons armour and fame a capable retinue of forty both militia armed with spear sword and axe as well as archers and skirmishers alas not capable enough accosted by a larger group not mere looters but the dreaded bandits of the forest eagle eyed archers skilled in their craft out numbered we were picked off from afar my loyal retinue dropping on the flanks as their shields could protect them no longer arrows burst what little armour protected them and claimed their lives before we could even see the foe my own horse was claimed i fell next came the charge we met our foe with even less men now we fought hard and bloodied our blades but it wasn t enough soon enough i looked around me to realise that my men were dead and dying one was even fleeing the battlefield it was too late for me surrounded and bloodied i was beaten captured and dragged across the unforgiving wilderness a slave to be pawned or worked to an early grave i would recommend this experience just avoid the dreaded forest bandits
