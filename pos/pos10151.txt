2019 deep in the tropical rainforest a small colony of outcasts tend to their rice fields the ardent sun beating down upon them as they work when suddenly a cry rings out of the brush they are under attack the meek villagers run for their homes and hope that the gang of brigands approaching will go away but 1 man stands tall a champion of the defenceless steps forth unto the brush racking his shotgun as he does so come get me you sons of muffalos he shouts aloud he continues forth to meet the savages head on one jumps out from trees on his right the man turns toward the charging savage and fires his 12ga directly into his chest dropping him dead instantly with no refuge a second appears from a bush and begins to draw his bow racking his shotgun for a second time the man proceeds to walk resolutely toward the savage who has begun to loose arrows at him see you in damnation barbarian he mutters before firing again as the man watches the second drown in his own blood a whistle through the air pierces his ears before a roaring boom a wry smile appears upon the man s face as he begins to charge a new foe a foe with a grenade launcher explosions begin to ring out almost constantly combined with trees and splintered shrapnel flying through the jungle the man s heart beating ever harder as he races to close the distance on the third individual he racks the third shell of his shotgun as he draws closer brushing aside fauna and shrapnel alike three shells three kills the man comments to himself before firing in the split second he took to fire the individual had fired back and a grenade was whistling through the air the man s shotgun blast landed on target and the foe man began to collapse but before he could watch him hit the ground a loud explosion ripped violently next to him tearing his leg off and sending shrapnel into his entire left side when the man later woke he found himself in the village they had prevented him from bleeding out and had fitted him with a peg leg he reached over to the bedside and simply lit a smokeleaf joint the same man would later go on to lose his other leg to a thrumbo attack though not without plunging a sword into its neck and winning the overall fight of course before his second artificial limb could be fitted he discharged himself from the medical tent and aided the villagers in fighting an approaching wildfire we honour his valour and all that he has done for our colony his name was zeiph
