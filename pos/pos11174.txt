2020 two point hospital announcement try not to die really late to the review on this bullfrog memories and company chat before review this was with out a doubt one of the games i looked forward to most of 2018 used to love bullfrog back in the day even lived down the road from their guildford offices after ea purchased bullfrog in 1997 offerings took a decline in quality then were shelved permanently standard ea rip westwood maxis bullfrog insert many other great companies here when i heard that two point studios were forming in farnham down the road with mark webley and gary carr at the helm theme hospital bullfrog i was hyped when the game finally released it was what i had hoped for a true spiritual successor to theme hospital with the same albeit improved gameplay and wacky humour that the original had the fear i had is that they would get bought out again and ruined like in the past then in 2019 they announced they had been purchased after only 2 years of being in business i was initial bummed out and a bit sad but then i found out that sega had purchased them as a subsidiary my love for sega is so strong at the moment for them publishing incredible games like two point hospital and motorsport manager and also brining the incredible yakuza series to the western pc market when i heard this i was pleased for two point studios and cannot wait to see what the future holds for them they have already teased the idea of making games within the two point world based off of old bullfrog titles we may get a remake of the original theme park not world or inc please the gameplay for theme hospital veterans will feel familiar and you will be able to jump right in and feel at home the game has had so many quality of life improvements over the original and has steam workshop to add community items and music packs if you want a real nostalgia blast add this music pack theme hospital music remastered instead of just moving from hospital to hospital around the game board like in theme hospital this time you make a foundation once you complete a level you can move to the next hospital but your original hospital remains as you left it and you can go back and play it anytime you wish loads of hospitals all with different challenges and illnesses a cavalcade of new illnesses no bloaty head slack tongue or invisibility here from mock star great freddie mecury joke to headcrabidness half life headcrab yes the crazy illnesses and ways they are cured is a silly and fun as the original theme hospital friends leader boards the superbug project which allows you to assist your friends to unlock kudosh and special items yearly trophy awards the team at two point studios are very active within the community listening to community suggestions and bug fixes etc they just added room templates which is awesome their social media team even surprised me the other day by sharing my screenshot on facebook got some love from two points social media team 3 community created artwork for two point hospital by trail dave that was a nice surprise just casually scrolling though facebook and seeing my screenshot pop up as an og theme hospital player i really don t have anything bad to say about this game its a nostalgia bomb and just a fantastic game i cannot wait to see what is next from two point studiostrail dave players are reminded to stay hydrated
