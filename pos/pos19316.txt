2022 i am compelled to write a review for this one prior to purchasing it on steam i had a good run with it on game pass and that was when i decided that i had to buy it you already know all the goods about it and probably even the ugly bits i am here to ask you folks to not judge the game based on the individual reviews this game is being compared with aoe 2 in literally every aspect which is a good thing as well as a bad thing everything starting from the menu down to every single detail is being compared to the its predecessor i personally think that this is unfair because majority of you including me love aoe 2 and hate to part away from the nostalgia on it s own this is a pretty solid entry to the franchise the playerbase is sound and the gameplay is fun while being innovative there is lots to love in age 4 as there are bits which aren t upto the mark most of the bugs have been fixed and there has been some decent amount of polish since launch though it lacks a few basic functions which are being added on a monthly basis i think that at the time of writing the review age 4 is a great rts game which resonates with the spirit of the franchise compared at the launch the player base has reduced but it doesn t really affect the queue times takes me 30s 1min because you can cross play with the guys using gamepass if i had to guess there are probably 13 18k players playing this game at any given time if you add in the figures from steam and gamepass the playerbase on steam however is recovering slowly with each update and sale if you look past the toxicity that the game has developed around itself and a few manipulative reviews opinions i think this is a darn good aoe game which most of us will be playing for years to come
