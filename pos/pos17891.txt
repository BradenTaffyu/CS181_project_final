2023 coming from coh2 it s a good game i am really enjoying multiplay so far just needs a few things polishedmajor balancing flamethrowers have stupid range tank tracking is very quick prefer slower and more sturdy audio need some deeper explosions and varied tracks in game ui the main assets look nice but the alerts don t fit the aesthetic overall greatly enjoying my time playing it
