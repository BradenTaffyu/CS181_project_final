2023 i m going to recommend this game because of how many of the bad ideas from the first game are less annoying here like employee happiness is a lot less micromanagement now being able to expand and build new campus buildings is really great love that far less traffic jams due to the nature of what s being simulated a college vs a hospital just have queues that build in different ways and long gone are the 50 people in line for one general practitioner now it s private tutors healing counseling but it s very forgiving and only partially necessary except one idea should die forever whoever decided the heating and cooling junk from tph needed to be carried over to this game should be fired from a cannon i can t think of anything fun about it and the heaters and acs block items in extremely silly ways that stuff should just be assumed just like it s assumed your rooms have lighting and plumbing take out the prison architect stuff like that i beg of you
