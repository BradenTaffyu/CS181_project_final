2016 i totally recommend this game before the promised 1 11 update i played for almost 90 hours with little break my job allows me to do so haha this last version helps with a issue personally i don t care too much about this aspect thus i wouldn t call this a issue with the replayability after the 80th hour i felt that there was little to nothing to really do in the game anymore i reached a point were the only thing at my horizon was to make my farm huge in profit maybe f ck my marriage by getting way too well with the others in town and finish some unfinished quests this is were the lack of replayability would bleed a little the potential of the game there was no way to move your buildings once built in your farm you would have to in order to reorganize your farm for aesthetics or to time optimization move everything animals included maybe sell them to demolish the building in question so you could rebuild it with your new and improved farming techniques after the 3rd year though you would have to use your golden guts to do so i hadn t courage haha it was going to be too complicated by this time some players would probably create a new save and start over i tried but missed my old farm before my 1st hour in the new save with a new character was completed i decided to wait for the 1 1 update it was on its way with the sensation though that the game had already lived up for it s price for the concept and idea of the game was beautifully thought and executed if the 1 1 update s fate were to never see the light of the day i would already be satisfied maybe even dreaming with a stardew valley 2 but it came i got back to the game and i m happy to tell that this free update does much more for the game the replayability for the characters of the town and for your farm than most of the paid dlcs of most games nowadays does this update actually makes the game looks way too much cheap haha you can now reorganize easily your farm do some new quests expand the farm in new ways with new buildings and interact with some characters that previously to this update wasn t possible now also the game has different farm maps that totally represents the different ways to play and profit in stardew valley this feature totally valorizes the replayability of the game since selecting different farm maps in different saves will surely change completely how you play your farm at least i would recommend this game even before the update i played for almost 90 hours and was completely satisfied but with the 1 1 this game is a must have specially if you miss good harvest moon games and have a crush on rpg do not fear your money will be valorized with this game and i don t even talked about the incoming co op mode haha expanding a little about the incoming co op mode lappro this is the result of your request i was just thinking that it might be a good idea to wait for more information to come out before it since i don t know exactly how it will work out so this part of the review is more of a reflection of what the future could bring haha there is already a way to play it co op using mods but i haven t tried it yet saw some gameplays with it and for me the bugs would much rather damage my hype than satisfy it making a long story short the distributor chuckle fish is working on translation as well as the co op mode while the creator concerned ape is fully focused in creative content he alone worked on this 1 11 update maybe taking in consideration the work so far invested is safe to say that with the co op mode will come as well some new content to deepen the multiplayer experience i say this because while i would love to play with my bride i can see the game becoming too easy as well since the simple possibility to share the tasks would nearly double your energy bar meaning that you would do twice in a day what you normally would be able to this taking in consideration only a 2 players co op if it allow more to join well the logic is simple do apply here all this though would not in any way ruin the experience exploring the dungeons to gather resources or fight some creatures to complete some quests or expanding your farm with more people will surely be entertaining with the 1 11 update came somethings that can be used to create some hostility in your farm a map and a spell i haven t tried it yet but it makes enemy creatures come to your farm at night i ll certainly try these new features with my bride i will expand my review with these information and more once the devs give us some new updates towards the incoming mode off topic sorry for any typos english is not my native language
