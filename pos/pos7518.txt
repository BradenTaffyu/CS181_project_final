2022 everyone who pre ordered this on steam including myself have had access to this since release including all the dlc as it dropped you had to go through the community page and find the link each time it was a dark and lonely time but the few of us survived shady ubisoft business practises aside now that it is on steam and on sale it s worth a buy if you like the anno series or city production managers in general everyone s rating in the anno series is pretty much the same this is the best anno game besides for me it s the best anno game besides anno 2070 it does everything previous anno games have done with a whole load of other systems and features added in dlc for dlc recommendations i would buy the season passes if they are cheaper or just the dlc contained in those passes the rest is cosmetic trash
