2017 it seems i ve never written a review for d os2 and with the steam awards wanting us to update a review i might as well let me start by stating that divinity original sin 2 is my all time favorite game i adored the first one i m worshippping the second this isn t a game that ll hold your hand this isn t a game that s easy and laid back this is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it out it has multiple difficulty settings so if tactical turnbased combat isn t your strongest suit there are easier modes for you but the harsh combat isn t the only thing that makes this game hard it s the quests the world there is no handholding you got to figure out what to do you got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on and boy are there many quests to focus on some seem absolutely random some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery i love that i love that the first act has you stuck on an island a jail and your job is to break out and how would one do this there isn t just one way or two or three there are more than that way more and it s up to you to figure out the way there are five races human dwarf elf lizard and undead each brings with their own talents and experience in the game you might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your race you might need to find another way into a town because they don t like dwarves it s extremely immersive and playing it as a coop makes it even so i m not sure i have words to describe to you how amazing this game is i like difficult games i played this on tactical which is hard and on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours reloading repositioning changing skills reloading over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss it was one of the most amazing experiences i ve had in gaming all year just that little bit of having to figure out how something works there are character tags and talents that you can choose that really makes this into an immersive rpg pet pal allows you to talk to animals that sad dog over there cheer him up and he ll help you that nasty fire elemental guess what she needs your help you can have a talent that makes you stink and people dislike you because of it larian studios is a dev team to follow i cannot wait to see what comes next voice acting wasn t in the original budget there was partial voice acting but somehow they managed to make the entire game voice acted without starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months it was a surprise untill launch and i give them major props for doing this
