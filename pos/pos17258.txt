2019 i basically only play the multiplayer so i will only comment on that aspect twwhii multiplayer experience isn t particularly balanced as there is a certain pay to win pay to compete aspect with the never ending amount of dlcs but if you ignore that it offers one the most comprehensive and fun multiplayer experiences among total war games in multiplayer you basically have a set amount of funds and build an army to face your opponent there s no extra decision making in army composition apart from that no reinforcements resource gathering objectives etc it s merely a head on deathmatch some factions hard counter others so it can be a big disantvantage and there is also a definite hierarchy in the power levels of factions with some being quite stronger than others overall the multiplayer learning curve is not particularly steep given that this isn t the first rts game you played the mechanics are fairly simple compared to other rts games i ve played such as the wargame series although given its over 100 distinct match ups it does offer a lot of artificial complexity mainly in the way of knowing about relative unit performance combat is statistical by nature so there is a lot of rng involved e g units having a hit chance that s dictated by melee attack and melee defence and damage reduction that s dictated by armour sadly the game is not patched that often as the devs are not mp focused and have currently and in the past introduced power creeped units which they took their time to bring down a notch having said that there s a lot of faction and unit variety and also a big map pool so it keeps things fresh lastly it has one of the most toxic mp community i ve seen in any game apart from league of legends but generally if you like the warhammer setting or played other tw games it s definitely a buy at least during steam sales
