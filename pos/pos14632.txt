2020 buy this game i don t think i ve ever reviewed a game before so this will probably be a not so good review i currently sit upon 175 hours of playtime plus about 50h before i had it on steam i aquired it for free if you know what i mean and i have purchased every dlc i m going to start with the negatives first because even though i absolutely love this game it still has it s flaws negative pricing it is a point that many people before me have brought up and many people will after me it is absolutely insane how expensive this gets when buying all additional content i hope that this is something that we will not see more of in future titles dialogue or lack thereof i have only played civ v and civ vi and one thing i cherished from civ v is the recorded voice lines everytime a civ talked to you also the text dialogue gets repetetive quick world congress an aspect i certainly miss from civ v is the ability to down vote a resolution and also embargo i feel that there is certainly a shortage of fun resolutions grievances and denouncing this is an amazing addition to the game however many a times have i had a surprise war declared on me and i believe it is then my right to exterminate that civ so i do aaaand get 150 grievances against me from every civ then denounced then war i think that sums up the negatives for me personally this game is amazing fun and you easily lose track of time having to plan out your cities or your warfare while keeping citizens safe and happy is the key concept and something that everybody does different i would definitely say that i prefer this art and graphic style over civ 5 s but that s just me i play with mods and cheats because no game is ever good enough for me without me being able to act a god and getting to play the game my way and my rules just adds to the fun civ 6 vanilla is something i rarely play but when i do i get my ass handed to me but it s still fun like i said this is my first review so i apologize that it s not very good to summarize buy this game be it on sale or not it s extremely fun and you completely lose track of your surroundings you probably wont regret it unless you have commitment issues cause you gotta commit to this game
