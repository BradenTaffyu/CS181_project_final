2023 it begs the question how can an honest review be made with such little game time and with the game having just been released quite frankly it is just so refreshing for me to see the effort made to help visually impaired and make their product accessible perhaps for everyone but at least most of all to my family the ease it was just to set up the games visuals is in my opinion the best i ve seen so far no pun intended also the artwork for the characters are still done in a lovable style i remember from their preceding titles which made me happy to go ahead and purchase their season pass i think this company deserves the respect they give others and now they deserve my money thank you for this christmas gift please have my money and my yes vote as my gift to you its the least i can do
