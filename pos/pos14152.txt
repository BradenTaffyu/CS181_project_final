2017 early access review you want to fight with food poisoning and get all base wiped out only because water treatment is not enough you always wanted to have all your pupils suffocate because you forget that corbon dioxide is heavier than oxygen you like to dig and make all those cosy rooms with masterpiece art so this game is for you dwarf fortress taught me that losing is fun and this game even not nearly being as hard as one mentioned gives you the same fun from losing and making your base prosper sure there is still lot work ahead and hopefully there will be many more features implemented but even now game is fun to play a lot hours and is bug free at least for me
