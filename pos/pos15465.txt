2022 i have to say i am pleasantly surprised with the quality of this game as a professional mechanic for 6 years and a lifetime automotive enthusiast i can say this game fully satisfies those interests it takes all the aspects that i loved about being a mechanic and leaves out things i hated while also adding in all the things i love about cars as a hobby the cars and parts are detailed and accurate but also simplified so as not to become totally unmanageable the visuals are beautiful and it s so rewarding to see the results of an old rust bucket being fully restored i would say i m 100 the target audience for a game like this but i think a lot of people who wouldn t expect to like a game like this would actually find enjoyment out of it and you don t need any prior automotive experience or education the process is intuitive and systematic enough that anyone would be able to do the work play the game for those with no background knowledge i think this would be a fun way to become familiar with how cars are put together to the team thank you very much for your efforts putting together such a great game
