2020 nier automata what can i say about this game that hasn t been said already if you ve ever heard anything about nier before and have high expectations let me just say you will get everything you were hoping for and more much much more this game is a beautifully crafted masterpiece of storytellin g and gameplay that will leave you questioning your own existence and what it means to be a l ive this was my first experience with a game by yoko taro and let me just say i was fascinated by the way nier is constantly changing one moment you re playing a top down space invaders type shooter the next your in a side scrolling platf o rmer and then what you really end up getting is a fairly large open world action rpg that s seamlessly interconnected between it s many map segments not only that but you also have a change in pe r spective after you ve finished the game for the first time replaying the story through the eyes of someone else this change in perspective gives you a whole new take on what you previously thought was the stor y but in reality was just a piece of the puzzle to unravel the true story these changes along with the 26 endings that the game has for you to discover kept the game feel fresh and helped reduce some of that repetitiveness that these games tend to have graphics wise the game itself is beau t iful to look at if you know what i mean from the moment you enter the ruined city you are treated to a spectacular post apocalyptic world filled with run down architecture overgrown vegetation and stunning waterfalls as you progress in the story you ll discover more and more areas like a castle in the middle of a lush forest sand dunes in the desert and my favorite a disnleyand style amusement park each one of them just as stunning as the one before this on it s own is already great but when you pair it with the s o undtrack it just takes thing to a whole new level which takes me to my next point another thing that kept me mes m erized throughout my entire experience with nier was it s soundtrack which i can only describe it as nothing short of amazing the ost is composed almost entirely in chaos language which is a made up language created by emi evans that tries to imagine how many languages combined into one would sound like a thousand years from now and let me just say that the result is incredible the only thing i can think to say to try to describe the ost is that this is not music that you hear this is music that you feel and not only that but in some boss fights the music is so perfectly synced with the battle that it actually forms part of the fight as well making it feel more a live however n o game is perfect and there are a few things that i would have liked to see fixed the biggest issue that i had wasn t so much about the game itself but rather its port to pc it took me more then a few hours to find a custom k eybind that felt comfortable while playing and even then i had the constant strain on my pinky because of the shift button for the pod fire action i had this issue mainly because you cant customize the mouse buttons at all in fact the mouse is never even referenced in any of the setting another thing that kept bugging me was the fact that every time i alt tabbed out of the game the screen setting would default back to windowed mode this was especially annoying because every time i went back into the game i had to go into the setting and manually sw i tch it back to fullscreen like i said though this is more about the port and not the game itself in the end i don t feel like i enjoyed the game any less because of this long story short if you haven t given nier automata a shot then i strongly urge you to this is one of those games that tra n scends beyond being just a game and really makes you think about life in ways that maybe you wouldn t have thought of before if and when you reach the true ending you will be faced with an very difficult decision the likes of which i had never seen in a game that affects not only yourself but also other people playing this game around the world this decision is not only closely tied to the story and philosophy of the game but also on how you perceive human interaction as an in d ividual so give yourself a chance and live the experience of nier automata
