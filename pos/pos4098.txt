2017 early access review updated review after another 400 hours of gameplay and this isn t even out of early access yet new stuff gets added every week i ve just started on some end game content but even playing on normal mode allows for dozens of different strategies this is a very fair game in the sense that a highly skilled player can win almost every time despite the fact that the cards you draw and the rewards you get after every fight depend on rng and yet the game does not feel too easy either goty 2017 2018original review if you re new to this genre deckbuilding roguelikes are great you gain power as you progress up the spire by adding and removing cards from your deck and then you use your deck to fight monsters sometimes cycling through all the cards several times in a fight you can try and build combo decks once you have played a few times you ll be able to anticipate what cards you might find in shops or as monster loot in future and influence your deck in that way the monster variety is good and the game is always a challenge if you have played dream quest monster slayers before this game is not just a clone it s new and different you can have encounters where you fight multiple enemies you can use consumable items during fights you manage your resources differently in fights and the monsters are fairer and have less rng you can see what they are going to do on their turn before they do it i m not even sure the monsters use a deck of cards to decide what to do also navigating the overworld is pretty simple leaving you to focus on what matters either way you will enjoy this game
