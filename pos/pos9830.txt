2017 early access review i generally do not leave reviews for a game least of all for one in early access first and biggest issue and perhaps the only gripe that i have with this game is the instability of your saves between builds pro tip if you are planning to have a modded playthrough and you should totally revamps the gameplay make a vanilla save prior to adding any modsnow for the actual review of this game i have spent a total of 128 hours in this game making it my 4th most played game ever and that time is split between two playthroughs the first one i had to end because of the aformentioned reason i generally do not admit to save scumming but in this game i did so shamelessly not because i was afraid of losing valuable members of my tribe but because i couldn t bear to continue without them spend enough time in this game and their patterns become yours the one more day rule applies here way more than your would first believe and soon enough the sun in rising and even the real world clock that you can enable in the hud does little to nothing to stop this complusion to continue now for the reason to buy this game is hard and random and gets harder and randommer the more you play every decision you make creates a snowball and before you know it you have created this monster of a settlement cleared out one small tile at a time reason not to buy the level of involvement you get out of the game is based on the amount of time you invest in it seeing as the game is in early access any update to the core build or any mods that you might add could end up wasting hours of progress making that save unplayable as in the save will not load i went 3 months without playing pricesely for this very reason final note make sure you are willing to live with the decisions that you make in this game the following is the story that unfolded in my tribe that led me to get to the end game i was happy to keep on playing the game with no real end even though i had my spaceship built but my hand was forced i had 3 married couples in my tribe one guy i had named him the miner as he was good at mining started an affair with another female in the tribe causing destress to him and his wife and the female he was having an affair with a few days past and the miner s wife started an affair with another male member for the tribe a few bedroom re assignement later the wife and husband are sleeping in different rooms with their lovers but the writing is on the wall this can t continue and soon enough the relationships will keep on getting too complicated to the point where it would be just utter chaos so i load everyone except the miner s mistress into the pods and then right before lift off i extract the guy who was having the affair with the miner s wife i didn t want for all of this effort to go to waste and thought it would be a good ending in paper atleast the last two members of the tribe deciding to stay behind with bountiful food and farmland and animals to take care off i though i would imagine them living in this rimworld providing sanctuary to those that need it most only the game does not end with the launch the credits roll begining with list of people who made it out in the ship and who were left behind the usual thanks and what not continue the music keeps playing then you are taken back to your settlement the game keeps on going and you are faced with your decision the stupidity of mine did not occur until i saw the two go into seperate rooms in my haste to get my first launch going i left the two halfs of a broken marraige that had nothing to do with each other they had little to no relationship with each other i check their social and see the name of their respective lover with dead next to their name the realization dawn on me for the ones who were left behind the ones who left might as well be dead i quit the game i need a break from this don t even bother saving it 09 10 broke my heart into a thousand pieces and i love you with all of them
