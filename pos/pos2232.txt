2020 like all reviews this will be mostly opinion based if you liked fallout 4 s exploring and and scavenging chances are you will love this game the good giant map with tons of thngs to do great atmosphere that can really immerse the player big and relatively convenient crafting system base building is simple and effective can be setup almost anywhere npc s and quests are pretty good the bad multiplayer which means random people doing their own thing sometimes near you which wouldnt be to bad if it had no text chat got a question just wanna talk to people wanna ask around to group up or do quests well to bad thats forbidden lag which is to be expected in a game like this same with the occational server crash again because of multiplayer expect things to be dragged out a bit grinding is part of the game suprisingly i encountered very few bugs but they are there so beware its a bethesda game after all the lore got butchered to make it fit its an abomination dont consider this a fallout game i guess i should mention the abortion that is the atomstore wether you want to spend extra money on an already fullprice game is your own decision i wanted to but all i found was ugly overpriced garbage still all things considered this game is pretty damn good now you can easely get a your money s worth if you like exploring and looting but please never forget bethesda released this game one year to early to make a quick buck they used the early buyers as test subjects for their alpha they overpriced their atomshop they sold shoddy overpriced merchandise and they failed at the basics of consumer proctection by leaking their contact informations its a final prodcut now but nobody should ever forget the disgusting practice bethesda used here
