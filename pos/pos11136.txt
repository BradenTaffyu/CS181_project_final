2020 pretty fun and addicting game diseases are hilarious and creative the only problem this game has that the bigger the hospital the less fun it is at least for me at a certain level the place gets too big to plan out every detail you just spam rooms and call it a day also infections on big hospitals are just impossible to actually deal with the game has a problem with the mid to late game progression neverless it s super fun and i would definitely recommend it for people who like management building games
