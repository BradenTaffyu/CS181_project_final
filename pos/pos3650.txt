2021 a wonderful game i ve waited 6 years and nearly turned 18 by the time it released i ve had a blast playing it i spent months delaying finishing it because i didn t want to rush but the ending was more emotional than i could have ever expected i suggest playing it blind on my first run i got the true ending with the secret cutscene at the end once you ve done a full run i totally recommend going to the other endings and route omori s endings are def well done as they re able to make you feel the full weight of what you ve done and how your choices led you to what ending you got i also love how it also gives you enough room to think about your own ending when it comes to the true ending but one thing is clear omori is a game about trauma guilt friendships love and forgiveness omori is most certainly a game about how forgiveness isn t always easy that forgiveness towards yourself is probably the most difficult and perhaps the hardest thing to do how no matter if someone else forgives you or not all you can do is ask for it and accept what happens in hope of finding peace a game about how mistakes can turn a person s life around how mistakes can burden you and warp your mind a game about how sometimes you have to face the truth if you want to find peace and most certainly a game about how doing something bad does not make you a bad person and that no one can punish you more than you already punish yourself spoilers from this point onwards be warned the true ending is a painful reminder that even the best ending isn t the happiest in some stories the way it cuts off right as you re about to cut off and lets you think would you forgive sunny and basil would you forgive yourself and after all the time you ve spent with everyone how would they react the way guilt fears and trauma are tied in together so well the plot twist wasn t what at all i might have expected basil s role was also a surprise to me the fact also that you cannot avoid uncomfortable tasks like stabbing yourself or can t run away from battles that make you uncomfortable are all ways to really allow us to connect with sunny omori and relate to him we ve all been in uncomfortable positions that we couldn t escape from and had to face head on as someone with ptsd and trauma a lot of what sunny experienced hit home which is also what made my experience so much more emotional never have i played a game that had my emotionally invested the entire time while making me feel like i was in the protagonist s shoes i also have to add the fact that the title screen changes during certain points is what i love games that force you to come face to face with whats going on no matter what is really another way to drive home that you cant escape the true ending with blue skies and sunny the sunny bad ending where omori has sunny jump off the roof with nothing but blue skies if you open the game the sunny ending where basil possibly kills himself because if you fought him he wounds sunny s eye with a gardening tool which can be seen on his fight sprite he was probably gonna use it on himself and you walk out with something guilt of mari s death following you causing omori to reappear on the title screen being in black space causing the white background to turn black and red it s all a reminder of the choices you made and the guilt he feels it was worth every day of waiting
