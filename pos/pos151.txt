2016 i don t typically write reviews but i felt inclined to do one for this game it really does feel like an old school harvest moon but brought up to date the gameplay is pretty much exactly what you would expect out of this type of game the combat is a little wonky but still fun the game does kind of chuck you in without much of an explanation and those are honestly the only two downsides i could give it the pros more than outweigh the cons i haven t been this hooked on a harvest moon esque game since the original but to me the largest selling point is the one person developing this game actually cares the first 2 days the game is out there has already been 4 updates fixing issues everyone asked to be fixed the game has been shown an amazing amount of love even after everyone had already paid for it a developer and a lot of fun all there is to really say about this game
