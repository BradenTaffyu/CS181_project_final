2021 early access review i have updated this review to add extra critisism after the time i have spent with this game i have decided to review it i would like to start by saying that it is worth playing but only if you have time on your hands and are a patient player otherwise the game might feel like it s too slow too long or and too difficult which i ll get to so let s start this off with what the game looks like from the outside from the outside this game looks like it could be just a car mechanic simulator with freeroam and the ability to die well it s kinda like that but still very different unlike with my experience with car mechanic simulator this game is much slower much more difficult at first and i would say shorter but i guess not because i have managed to squeeze over 450 hours out of it the most out of any game i have on steam the rest of it just seems like it s set at finnish countryside after the effects of an economic depression where you are living trying to build a car with all the parts in the garage this is true the main point of this game is to build a car that the player character s parents have left to rot in the garage and for some reason it s completely dismantled it s never explained why it s like that it just is like that for gameplay reasons the parents also left a note on the kitchen s fridge where they mention that they are not home and are not coming home until they feel like coming back home and that if the player doesn t build the car it will be sent to the junkyard however if the player does build the car and get it successfully inspected they can keep it so after making a new save file you spawn in and start exploring and eventually figure out where the car is unless you know where it is before you start playing the game you are given no instructions not even a tiny hint of how things work aside from that note mentioned earlier about the main objective you can see some things like the small poster ad for the rally sprint race and an area map but that s about it the game itself is kind of a puzzle at first especially if you don t understand the references and the finnish language as some things are not translated the car building can also be punishing unless you know what to do the thing that is the cherry on top in the difficulty for this game is the driving and when you crash your car this should say enough for the difficulty basically the driving in this game is actually incredibly rewarding to get it right the dirt roads around per j rvi are quite bumpy which can make driving difficult in some cases especially when using a keyboard i recommend an gamepad or a steering wheel setup as they can make the inputs you make more precise precision is required in some cases to avoid crashing crashing in this game can lead to an easy death depending on your vehicle and whether you used the seatbelt that specific vehicle came equipped with which increases the chances of surviving a crash by an noticeable amount some vehicles have an higher chance of leading to death due to some possibly lacking safety features also the gearbox functions just like it was designed from the factory so there s no way to force the gears in an car with a manual stick shift gearbox to suddenly be an automatic without game mods this means that you have shift the gears in most of the cars with the only optional shifting assist being auto clutch which means that you still have to shift the gears so in short it s highly rewarding but also punishing if not done properly while most cars behave similarly when they get up to speed they do have some noticeable handling differences in between them you will notice several differences with them all but the ffb is not different between them then there s the main gameplay aside from the driving the gameplay that surrounds the driving and car building is all good it s nothing spectacular to the point where it takes the spotlight completely away from the car building and driving but i feel like good enough to make the other portions of the gameplay feel more important to the game than the main gameplay basically on top of having to take care of your car and other vehicles you might use you need to also take care of yourself do all the stuff your character needs to stay alive but also make sure that you pay the bills avoid getting in trouble with the law making money to pay for all the services you need to pay for and much more then there s the stuff that makes the gameplay feel more fun but also might upset the balance of your character s health or cause trouble with the law these include getting drunk and driving drunk stealing the video poker machine from the pub playing cards speeding punching innocent people etc these might get you in some trouble financially or legally but they can be fun to do one of the things that the player can do to support themselves is doing occasional jobs that they receive from phone calls when the player picks up the phone while it s ringing they get asked by someone to do something for them and the location of either the place to complete the job is marked on the map with a dart the tools required to complete the job are not marked on the map when the job is completed the person that called for the job to be completed hands over some cash and the dart is removed from the map these jobs are the main way of making money in this game the game does have an ending to it which is optional it requires certain criteria to be met and i will not go over it in this review but besides that there s no real end to this game you just build the car to be something you would like it to be like an rally machine or an decently fast car on the drag strip or maybe you just want to be reverted to it s factory specifications over time this leads to the game becoming repetitive which can be fixed by installing mods all of the gameplay elements aside graphically it s very outdated the trees are noticeably just 2d sprites the polygon count is low for many objects especially humanoids the textures are fairly low quality although that doesn t mean that they didn t put effort into them the engine is pushed to it s limits which means that it s barely running just half of the fps count that many powerful computers could do in 2016 2017 which is still respectable but overall if you are looking for great graphics this is not it graphics aside it has an good soundtrack a lot of the songs are made for this game which is promising to hear if you haven t heard any of the songs and it lives up to being an specifically made soundtrack although some of it was still songs from the past not made for the game those songs selected for the game without them being made for the game doesn t make it any worse though if anything i think it would be weird to have some of these songs removed i have tried the 24 11 2016 version by using the depotdownloader which doesn t work anymore but i did notice some things that just are better in that version i will say that they should bring back the van and truck for the player and i will say that breaking the windshield on a vehicle that has a breakable one without having to worry about a bee hitting you in the eye and blinding you was the more fun choice also why are the old tires in the mansion now it literally doesn t make any sense it doesn t add to the lore or have anything else going for it there s nothing that tells that they are there and it just makes the game more monotonous as there s no other wheels in the garage but oh it s not meant to be fun what kind of an excuse is that also the things that the player could pull off to avoid the police getting involved have gotten limited overall this game is fun although you need to have time to get the ball rolling and the graphics just don t cut it anymore numerical rating 7 5 10
