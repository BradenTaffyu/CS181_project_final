2021 playing this game has eventually turned into a need in order to listen to podcasts and the like i ve spent more time in this game doing the same things over and over than i d ever want to publicly admit the modding community in steam workshop and other places like promods are fantastic to help create more community driven content which can include extra areas of the map that can add a lot of new locations my only complaint if i had to make one is that it can be difficult to play depending on the setup looking at some people who stream the game it seems to get the full immersive experience requires some extra hardware such as a steering wheel shifters and even head tracking which can be a big expense having played the game with a wheel and shifter no headtracking i have to say it is a really good experience always looking forward to new dlc though i do wish that third party map mods were quicker to include them so it didn t break compatibility but that s hardly the developer s fault
