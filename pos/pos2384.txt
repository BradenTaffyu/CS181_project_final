2020 so fallout 76 it s clear that this is not a fallout game that fans expected and wanted with how badly received the game was at launch it s only reasonable if people would rather stay away from this game but hear me out i never played the vanilla game but it seems that the game is finally shaping up nicely with the wastelander update after numerous patches and content addition the game receives a well received overall review scores on steam at the moment one thing that people need to understand is that fallout 76 is basically an open world survival crafting game first and foremost painted in fallout coat and it does a great job at it in fact i think it s probably the best and most polished game compared to hundreds of other games in the same genre out there the production value is not even comparable from visuals voice acting quests combat encounters loots and crafting everything are above the competitors the quests are your regular fallout 4 fare with main side and miscellaneous quests there are choices in the main quests but i don t expect anything too deep in the rpg mechanics especially since the special works entirely different in this game there s one thing that i d like to point out though the writing and quest design are definitely better than fallout 4 seems like they hired a new writer for this lack of voiced protagonist helps too since there s no limitation to the dialogue choices now anyway 76 is mostly fallout 4 but with prettier graphics and online elements in which you can see other players around you it sounds simple but the online part is very important to help enhancing the experience in 76 there s no save scumming nor cheating like with mods so exploring and finding stuff are meaningful and rewarding every single thing you do does matter because it can help to improve your character in a single player fallout character progression doesn t really matter as your main goal is to beat the game but in a multiplayer environment there s this urge to get better so that you can show off to people especially since there are numerous social aspects in the game from grouping up to trading completing events and objective with other players seamlessly is quite a joy too while there is an in game cash shop you can earn the premium currency by simply playing the game i ve earned a few hundreds atoms from just playing so far and i can use it to buy anything in the cash shop ultimately it s really a new kind of fallout when you accept the game as it is it s a spin off not a mainline game you ll understand why there are people who enjoy it it s also very casual friendly and it s interesting how the community is shaped in a positive manner i find myself enjoying the game a lot than i anticipated
