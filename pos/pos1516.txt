2017 early access review once you get into the game you can t stop playing it has so much to offer and the atmosphere is great the most negative reviews are about the slow progress yes progress isn t the fastest and new stuff never makes everyone happy but it happens and this game already great in it s current state some might also give project zomboid a negative review because they expected to jump into the game and play it like every other zombie game but that s not the case you have to invest time to learn explore and master the different mechanics and possibilities i love it the zombies feel like a constant threat because a single scratch can cause your early end also you feel an unbelieveable relieve if an attack hasn t infected you so far one of my favorite situations in that game was in a multiplayer session a large horde was hunting me and i took a wrong turn and ended up in a dead end bathroom zombies banging at my door my final moments of my life all a matter of time but i knew my friends were looking for me they came in just in time and saved me it was glorious all in all i still wait for some features but i already had around 100h of fun in this game worth every penny try the demo and play it at least an hour to decide wether you like it or not damn seriously this game has a demo don t waste your time on reading all the reviews check it out yourself
