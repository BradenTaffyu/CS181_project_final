as an actual truck driver this sim is very well made it has actually helped me understand backing a little more though the trailer behavior isn t exactly like real life real life is easier happy to see all the work going into this with the updates yall put out like how yall go out and talk to real companies to get in person experience for truck models highly recommend this simulator good as a chill game you can play alone or go online and crash into stuff with friends if you cant handle long driving times there s even a setting to make the drive feel shorter customize your truck with new available parts you earn by leveling up leveling up just makes them available to buy at a truck shop last note for those trying to get same dlc as friends go to the store page scroll down to content for this game click the drop down view all and you will see the whole list content with blue bar on left side are the ones you purchased in a bundle so that should help anyone wanting to play the same as friends there s even the add all dlc to cart if you just want everything available that s what i do just make sure it doesn t add dlc that you already have just throwing money away at that point have fun drivin
