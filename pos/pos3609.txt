2023 this might sound hilarious and pathetic but this game literally sent me to get a therapy appointment lately for a couple of years i have been neglecting my life engaging in too much escapism doing stuff like playing video games all day including omori to ignore my mental issues after while going through heavy grief but this beautiful ending the good one made me realize that even though it s not easy at all and it requires a lot of strength it s better to try to face your traumas head on rather than pretending they don t exist and everything is fine well it s not like i was stupid enough to not realize that before but it s hard to get out of that loop and ask for help yet omori managed to slap me so hard that i thought okay that s it i m getting help i can t keep going at it like sunny because i saw too much of my own behavior in the main character s story decisions relationships hell a couple of times i also haven t gotten out of my house for several months and it did not look good from an outsider perspective that was quite uncomfortable for me i too accidentally damaged my friendships because i had fallen too deep into my own sulking and isolated myself without realizing that the extent of my self hatred ended up affecting my friends too and they didn t deserve that but i guess it s not easy to be a good friend when your mind is too busy creating a parallel reality where time doesn t pass and also trying to convince you to end your life hopefully this time with the help of my therapist my life might get better 3ok enough venting on steam wtf what a loser sorry but this game is important to me now here s an actual review pros beautiful artstyle compelling story lovely characters some better than others fun gameplay well i m a rpg fan so i might be biased cons omocat didn t milk her beautiful artstyle in this platform by adding trading cards points shop items so i can t buy and wear an animated kel avatar like god intended me to that sucks p s btw a considerable part of the fandom is toxic as hell if you love this game interact with fans at your own risk
