2017 early access review day 1 little cabin by the river coming along night 1 moans heard in distance no contact sit huddled in the dark waiting for the moans to stop day 2 come across a few slow ones pick them off with a bow arrow loot bodies and build a second floor to my cabin night 2 a moaning visitor appears bashing down my front door a spiked club to the face quiets everything down day 3 cabin complete with a nice catwalk that overlooks my front door now i ll see them coming night 3 they re running front door breaks down but catwalk door holds out live to fight another day day 4 dug a trench around the cabin and filled it with spike traps that should do the trick night 4 trench did the trick day 5 defenses are good enough time to focus on getting guns built a forge and scavenged for extra food to stock up for a long night night 5 trench still working out with my bow day 6 forge completed and makeshift gun crafted they won t stand a chance night 6 they didn t stand a chance day 7 stocking up on ammo and other supplies got some blueprints but not enough materials to craft any of it night 7 trench did not do the trick apparently spider zombies are a thing and my catwalk was a nice ladder to my face ripall in all a good game even if it has been early access for a while now i consider it well worth the money when on sale for 10
