2023 do not be sorry be better do not mistake my silence for lack of grief anger can be a weapon if you can control it use it there are no good gods boy thought i taught you that the road ahead is no place for a boy you must be a warrior the gods care nothing for them men should not pray to monsters keep your expectations low boy and you will never be disappointed fate is another lie told by the gods nothing is written that cannot be unwritten close your heart to their desperation close your heart to their suffering do not allow yourself to feel for them they will not feel for you
