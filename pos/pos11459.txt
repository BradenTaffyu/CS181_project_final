2015 early access review this game is amazing it is the 1 survival game on steam in my opinion at this time it combines the building modularity of minecraft with the crafting of day z or rust the survival aspects are well done and you really do have to keep your well being in mind while you play rather than it being an occasional annoyance like many other survival games looting is very fun and there are enough items that you don t feel like you see the same stuff over and over for quite some time there is as good mix of low level crafting 1 item into another and high level multiple items crafted together to make a new one you can really make a good base and there are many options for entrenching yourself at a location you can even build a little motorcycle and explore way easier this game truely morphs over time and you go from a shivering naked husk of a person to a badass apocolypse surviver in a strong base who can do almost whatever they want but still feel a severe threat on the 7 day attacks every week 7 days you will be swarmed with a massive attack of zombies this really changes how the game flows compared to most survival games so many other games get boring after a few hours when you cap out your tech tree but the progression is so detailed and varied and these attacks so intense that you never quite feel like king of the mountain for long really the only complaint with this game is that the graphics are not great the player models right now are very ugly but you cover up with armor and that actually looks cool this game will also get a lot of updates over time so you may not want to get in on this until more releases come out or the game releases definitely recommend and once they nail down the random world generation and some optimization this will be an amazing survival game for a group of players
