2022 tw wh3 is a shadow in comparision to this in its current state if you were deciding between the two pick this one the campaigns are fantastic engaging and immersive the battles are exciting spectacular and visually appealing the dlc is probably the only negative as there is a lot and they do enhance the experience dramatically skaven are my favourite faction decimating infantry from afar with gattling cannons is just perfection buy now yes yes
