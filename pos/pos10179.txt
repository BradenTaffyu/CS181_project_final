2017 early access review a genre defining game in the base building and survival game two fyi points this is very much of a game that you need to set goals for it s possible to set the difficultly far too low and simply breeze through many phases of a bases development and planning and hit a hard wall game is still in active development and mechanics are still under active development but the modding community is stepping up to expand and polish the game my two gripes are that large learning curve the complexity of the game doesn t come for free and you can be learning new things hundreds of hours in despite large systems of automation manual orders are often required to get the exact behavior out of your pawns
