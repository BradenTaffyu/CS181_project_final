2020 don t be fooled by the ads and videos you watch where the people are using awesome and modern looking vehicles you will not reach those easily however personally i have had a mild taste of somewhat high tier and i really can t enjoy it my main issue with the higher tiers is if you suck like i do then you ll end up going in with a high tier tank or plane and without realizing it your lions will reach zero lions are required to repair a vehicle so that you may use it again to fix this you can play a lower tier pay money or do what many of the other players do which is get in a bomber plane and play endless matches grinding for those sweet sweet lions there is some slight bias especially around mid tier for the germans and russians i have a friend with 800 hours and i ve played with him mid tier american mid tier tanks are very poor with low pen capability many of the german tanks will whiff you shells off like your throwing nickles at it this game is like an abusive relationship you can t stop playing even though a majority of the time your not having fun this game will have you crawling back to gajins doorstep just to get a kick in the head and the temptation to buy your way through the grind this game is freebut to have fun you will likely have to pay or sell your soul and drop thousands of hours why is it positive cause i can t give it up send helpsorry for the poorly formatted review i don t usually write such comprehensive reviews about games
