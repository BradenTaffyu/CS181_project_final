2014 early access review tabletop simulator is ideal for all players who are even slightly interested in board games with a focus on physics sandbox gameplay where you are free to abide by the rules or cheat playing with friends feels fun and satisfying the game is still in beta and i ve encountered a few bugs while playing however the developpers are really close to the community and listen to feedback the bugs are being fixed every update and while it s still far from a finished product it is shaping up really fast pros physics sandbox this is a must for sandbox games lovers revives the old board games we love and allows you to play online with friends table flipping who wouldn t dream of flipping a table after losing a game of chess great platform for custom board games while it doesn t support workshop content or 3d models yet importing images allows you to create your own games or play games you love that weren t included with the purchase great looking models and shaders cons needs some polishing currently has noticeable bugs and can be ressource heavy at times does not include liscenced games obviously but unfortunate although once again custom content not as fun without friends to play with while you can play with strangers and still have a lot of fun i get headaches from laughing too much playing games with strangers not everyone will enjoy it as much as playing with people they know i would recommend grabbing the game with friends if you can
