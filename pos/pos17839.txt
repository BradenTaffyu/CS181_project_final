2023 to start i will clarify this is my own opinion and may not end up being yours if you buy it i was very hesitant to buy the game as leading up to it and on launch i heard mostly negative things if we don t count people who are paid to make reviews on games it was on sale so after playing a bunch of coh2 recently i decided why not and worst case i can likely return if under 2hrs of game time this is coming from a direct switch of coh2 to coh3 literally played a few games hopped off bought downloaded played for a few hours i think a lot of the negative reviews are centered around it not being a complete game on launch i think the unfortunate thing is that s a reality in today s gaming age a lot of games aren t complete on launch anymore i think compared to when coh and coh2 launched this game has a lot of content granted i mainly focus on singleplayer so skirmishes against ai and campaign 4 factions at the start loads of units already lots of community content including a camera zoom out a bunch of new modes maps etc the game play i find is a lot slower than coh2 it s like they ve slowed down the unit speed on tanks and infantry which when i think about it isn t terrible makes it a bit easier to try and work out battles and stuff makes it feel more impactful when your tank finally arrives to the front line in general i ve really enjoyed my experience so far i think you genuinely have to try and not look at the game on a comparison level with a game that s 10 years old and has had time to be polished new content released etc i know it s really hard to do as i found myself making comparisons constantly and trying to figure out hey what s new what s similar etc now there are a few things missing that seem like odd omissions that i hope are on the way and it s just a matter of time before they are added for example unless i ve missed it you can t force a team weapon that s in building house to face a certain way they only do it automatically the cpu difficulty seems like it might need a bit of adjusting but i feel like i d need more playtime to have that argument or maybe i m just a bit better at this one than coh2 not sure i won t bother sitting here and listing stuff it has vs stuff it doesn t i m sure there are plenty of reviews that cover that stuff i ve got my graphics on low and the game runs pretty well on my store bought pc from 4 6 years ago in general i find the game runs well i ve really enjoyed my time i ll get my moneys worth out of this game and i m excited to see what s coming next again my personal opinion but hopefully this helps shed some light in between the onslaught of negative reviews i really do think if we stop trying to compare it to coh2 it s a solid game and has lots of promise to get better hopefully they do a good job edit much later on my opinion still stands love this game still some work to be done but very happy with my purchase finally working through the italian campaign and i really don t get the hate for it there s so much variety with the mini skirmishes you play against ai surround their base and hold the points for them to retreat wave defense basic vp matches bit of axis and allies board gameplay i still don t really pvp so not much to comment on there but i still recommend much later on
