2017 a surprise to be sure but a welcome one found this game browsing a friend s screenshots and looked neat grabbed it not sure what i was getting into highly surprised and happy to say it is now one of my favorite games not a game you expect to finish or win but more into roleplaying and seeing what happens to the empire and species you ve created i ve spent way too long just making up races empires homeworlds and enjoying the wonderfully flavorful anomolies kind of like side quests that make the randomly generated galaxies a brand new experience every time mod support in the workshop is a massive bonus to content an excellent game for those who enjoy 4x empire building strategy and roleplay
