2023 43 hours in and i m ready to give a brief review first and foremost i wholeheartedly recommend this game are there same flaws yes but the game is a great step forward and brings a lot of quality of life changes over company of heroes 2 which i have almost 3000 hrs in the good at its core company of heroes 3 plays a lot like company of heroes 1 which is a good thing this faster tempo feels right and it was one of the major tripping point of company of heroes 2 however it takes this faster tempo and applies some great tweaks that keep the game flowing these tweaks include auto reinforce toggle buttons double click auto build for base building auto vaulting over coveras for the factions they all play well though right now it seems the us has the most depth in regards to variety of ways to play the faction with three different support building and three battlegroups to mix and match you have nine different ways to play there is a flaw with the brits that i ll mention in the next section the bad the camera zoom come on relic just let us zoom out a bit more there are mods that fix this but we shouldn t need it while the sounds are great themselves its still missing some of the situational awareness ques that you get from coh1 and coh2 this isn t a huge issue more that its inconsistant the brits need some sort of defensive emplacement perhaps bofors its the only thing missing in their line up and they really do need something like it trenches are missed relic a few bugs nothing game breaking most issues i ve run into are with the lobby making and party forming
