2022 early access review if you are a car truck boat plane enjoyer there is absolutely no reason why you wouldn t like this game if you enjoy games such as euro truck simulator asetto corsa farming simulator furidashi dirt rally this is like all of those games in one probably not farming simulator i wish i had purchased this earlier i have always had a dream of owning a scrap yard or something where i could just do stupid all day with cars put 20lb of boost in a pigeon i ended up purchasing it last january on an impulse i recommend trying out rigs of rods before purchasing it was made by part of the same dev team and is free it is like beamng but with much much worse graphics less cars and overall worse the controls take a bit of getting used to which can be aggravating i spent a lot of time playing much much much car games because i did not know about beamng i am never disappointed with the level of detail with most games i can find something where oh damn that would be really cool if they had that but not with beamng i am continually impressed with the details this game has shocking similarity to real life crashes you can find videos on youtube you might think this game is just crashing cars into each other but it is not you can do drag races drive rally cars do time trials play with friends beammp trucking police chases demolition derby and much more the car customization is extremely detailed and you have a large selection of cars in the base game i want to thank the devs for still updating this game a lot of games end up getting abandoned you get a new update about every season winter spring summer that they always add something really cool in new cars maps etc there is a large community of modders that are constantly making new maps and vehicles to try out i have played so much of this in my school zoom meetings i feel that 25 base price is a little steep but that is most likely because i am a cheap mfer i guess the current trend in gaming is to have 60 70 80 dollar games so i am not complaining apologies for the rambling buy it
