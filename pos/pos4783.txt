2017 fallout 4 is the perfect example of why people should stop overhyping anything is it the fallout title we all wanted no is it a bad game no it s a weak title from the series because of the simplification of the rpg elements and making it far more casual still it has the best gameplay in the series a beautiful world with a lot of lore small stories truth be told bethesda never understood the fallout universe the first two fallout titles were actually a really clever example of retrofuturism in bethesda s games the idea seems to be that fallout takes place in a world where the bombs fell in the 1950s or rather in a world where the culture of the 1950s lasted an extra 120 years and even endured through the apocalypse and that s what the world of fallout is it s not the 1950s it s the year 2077 as the people of the 1950s would have imagined it a great video explaining the ideas behind the original fallout lore youtube video bethesda never understood fallout views 1 851 511 want to read this as an article with footnotes sources and links see it on my blog in order to enjoy it you have to look at it as a great shooter in the fallout universe to this day new vegas holds the top and i hope bethesda can learn from their mistakes
