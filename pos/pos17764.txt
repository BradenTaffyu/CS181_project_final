2023 total war pharaoh should not have been the most expensive total war at launch absolutely that aside the amount of flak and hate this game had received before even the beta was out is astounding simply because it wasn t medieval 3 rome 3 or another empire so many claim that this game is a troy clone yet troy suffered greatly until the mythos update and this game plays well at launch or the fact that both games play in completely different ways some say that this is the worst release of total war when rome 2 dropped practically unplayable or something more recent the bugginess of warhammer 3 when it first dropped the complaints of the lack of naval battles is ironic considering none of the warhammers or the three kingdoms total war lacked it as well unit hiring is different i feel that native units fit the bronze age period very well and reflects the lands that that army has gone or fought through the outpost system is a nice addition allowing for a bit of extra travel in a turn a strong garrison more legitimacy etc the legacies and ambitions aspect to the game is very nice and something that could be beneficial in future total wars the changing weather during battles is a great touch and the layout of some desert battles can be used to your advantage if you manage to take the high rolling dunes plateaus or narrow rocky passes that may spawn especially like the adding of religious building and trading end goals along with painting the map the map is a tough nut to crack i do wish they also included minoans or other bronze age greeks but just getting to canaan let alone up to the hittites from upper egypt is a grind the map is bigger than it seems at first glance i also greatly enjoy the cut scenes and preferred them to the animated ones like in past titles for the more cinematic feel they impart though this time period is not the first i would have asked for the game did get me to look into some history of the ramessid dynasty so that i understood some of the games lords and the players of the 19th dynasty of pharaohs more along with this tumultuous time in history i do believe that ca sofia put a lot of character and heart into this game it is a shame that such a hefty price tag was slapped on it and so many are quick to judge the game without truly giving it a chance i hope that this doesn t turn ca away from the historical titles that go so well in this game franchise
