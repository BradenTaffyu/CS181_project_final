2016 so i told myself when i reached 100 hours on this game i would write a review well here i am so i got this game around summmer 2015 after wanting it for a long time the game had just left early access and was in beta i just want to point out that i am very attatched to this game i adore this game most of my summer was spent playing this before you say that isn t possible i would like to point out my hours didn t add up as i ran the game from the exe rather than steam i would and have recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the feel of success science exploration engineering space cute green creatures who you shall become the merciless god of as you stack them on top of each other and use them as landing gear the only slightly bad thing about this game is the learning curve i know the 1 1 update added loads of tutorials cuz the old ones were exeedingly bad but you will spend around 5 10 hours before you can do anything useful needless to say though it is worth it and soon you will conquer the solar system or y know just abuse the various bugs the game has that s cool anyway thanks for reading this review if it helps someone buy the game or spread the word or anything then i m glad simple concept
