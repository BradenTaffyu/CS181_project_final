2023 enjoyable but flawed this game fell short of being something incredible i don t believe i m one of many with this perception of hogwarts legacy but it may prove interesting to some nonetheless long review below the good it s a nice visual game some parts of it look magical indeed the gameplay works and functions well from start to finish the story has a few interesting moments but nothing that will blow you away there won t be anything you won t see coming the spells feel great combat was one of my favourites aspects of the game the devs did their job right on this front a magical adventure for harry potter fans it is the best of all harry potter games really immersive in some parts fun in others and an overall good game all in all your money won t be wasted here there s plenty of content to go around for everyone soundtrack and sound in general is authentic to what the wizarding world should be the bad it s a shame that many rpgs that are open world learned nothing from skyrim witcher and red dead redemption everything is so scripted to the point of comedy as a result of that it won t take more than several hours to realise how bland and empty hogwarts is the best way to describe this is by comparing it to the tv series westworld for those who have seen it you feel like you re really trying to role play in a fake world the same animations will play in the castle over and over the same npcs with the same lines you get to experience all yearly seasons but besides some changes in the castle and around it the npcs react to nothing their garbs won t change according to the weather immersion breaking when you go outside of the castle in summer you ll spot two students playing a game that s a very nice moment to see the npcs have activities around the castle however you ll reach winter and the same students are playing the same game in their same outfits outside in the courtyard even at night time at 0 degrees c temperature the same orchestra music that you first hear when you go across the hall will be playing throughout all seasons through all day night cycles it goes from a wondrous special moment to a tedious run faster so it ll bother you less for an rpg one of its priorities should be to establish or at least try to make something remotely natural for the npcs to do there s many more such situations but i won t go further into that progression is tied to the main story you cannot interact with your dorm colleagues or anyone around the castle unless it s a quest or a silly side quest the house you pick doesn t matter you ll only get 1 quest per house and it ll vary the looks of your outfit i chose ravenclaw but was shown around by a weasly i was expecting to have someone from my own dorm to be my friend guide to lead me through the castle your choices in the game have no consequence cast avada kadavra wherever you want because nobody cares it s hilarious at times i understand that the developers are trying so hard to be progressive but in their pursuit of fulfilling an agenda they made the setting of 1800s scotland feel like 2023 woke hollywood you ll hear the name of sirona and how special she is more times than you ll enter her tavern enemies around the world you d expect the forbidden forest and any other place in the world to be somewhat different from each other since it s an rpg the enemies around the castle would be of a lower level while the forbidden forest would have tougher or more dangerous enemies that s not the case you ll fight humans spiders frogs wolves trolls goblins and that s it there won t be a special enemy type anywhere in this world no interesting side quests or random events hogwarts legacy doesn t have a natural side quest in it you re exploring and suddenly you come across something well kinda some merchant who needs his pet rescued or kill more poachers that s all you ll get the motivation to do these menial side missions is even lower due to the interchangeably awful voice acting and writing it feels like if it s not the writing that s off it s the acting and vice versa i would say the acting isn t as bad as it could ve been but the writing reaches lower echelon bethesda more often than not the hud is cluttered and breaks immersion no memorable characters besides sebastian no matter the graphical settings the game has issues around hogwarts and especially hogsmead lots of stuttering textures loading in late so on and so forth it s got technical issues still as of june 2023 conclusion despite most of its flaws and shortcomings hogwarts legacy is a strong game that many people will grow fond of it does the main part right gameplay decent story graphics and depicts the world of harry potter better than other harry potter games i strongly believe it wouldn t have been as successful if it weren t for huge controversies or if it didn t have the harry potter theme around it it s a 7 8 10
