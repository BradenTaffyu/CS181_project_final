2017 40 hours in and i ve finally left fort joy and reached the mainland says it all really i thought i was quite far in but turns out i ve just scratched the surface the depth is awesome this is really the first game of this specific genre i have played and i m glad i took the risk on it incredibly immersing enviroments music story and characters you really feel part of this world combat is very deep and i actually restarted the game twice before i was happy enough with my build and companions takes a bit of time if you are new to this series to get used to how classes and roles work and how you should be building your team but once you get the hang of it it s fairly straightforward the only negative i felt was that the journal gave a lack of direction on quests and objectives in general but as soon as you stop treating them like quests and more like parts of a dynamic story it doesn t really matter you can fail some or do things wrong and that s okay it s part of your story often doing the wrong thing can get you some nice loot or information that helps you in some other way love it
