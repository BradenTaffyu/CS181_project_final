this game is amazing as long as you understand it i read the bad reviews some of them make sense but most of them don t they don t understand that this game is about innovation and repetition over multiple play throughs it could take 2 10 50 100 or even 1000 you have to solve problems that you might not even know about before they happen otherwise it could be too late to turn back even after you solve a problem a new one occurs meaning you always have to be on the lookout managing priority food water oxygen as well as some others i won t spoil this isn t a game about discovery except it is the discovery of what kind of colony you want how much you care about your dupes and of solutions no one has ever thought of before and even if you watch tutorial even if you ve seen play throughs it s not as easy as it looks and you will still have to innovate weather that be the design of your base or the automation and even sustainability remember this game is procedurly generated so you can always hop on and play again
