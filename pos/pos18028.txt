2018 overall rating at launch 4 10overall rating now 9 10it was unplayable without mods at launch now it s everything it should have been and it s fantastic kudos to ca for supporting this game and improving it over the years while i wasn t at all amused by the dlc policy early on i now support the policy as long as it allows ca to continue improving the game and bringing in fresh content i also really appreciate the regular free lcs if you love total war games or historical rts tbs games this game has become a must buy i can imagine myself playing this for many years to come
