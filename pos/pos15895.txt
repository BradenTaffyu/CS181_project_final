2022 very good game i have a suggestion for an achievement on the big hand statue in the desert if you leave the distal finger phalanges and the distal thumb phalanx uncleaned it should have an achievement called who s been in the cheese puffs again because the sand kinda looks like cheese dust for me the satisfying part was not washing the dirt off but seeing whatever was underneath and also getting the ding sounds when you complete something and when you complete a level and it shows you a time lapse and also the best part is when you make a lot of progress in one day it gives you a sense of accomplishment oh and the lore
