2018 like my reviews go follow my curator page as a younger gamer i never got to experience games like diablo 2 or baldur s gate in their prime and by the time i was old enough to understand and appreciate the rpg genre the gaming industry moved onto 3d first third person rpgs like fallout 3 and oblivion eventually crpgs made a comeback and i jumped onto that hype train only to be pretty disappointed as other crpgs haven t quite hit the spot for me i saw this game get released on steam and chose not to buy it because i thought i d be underwhelmed yet again that was a huge mistake while divinity original sin 2 suffers from some very serious flaws the game s strengths are done so well that the fairly popular claim that this game is one of the best rpgs of all time is completely justified graphicsas was the case with the first game the visuals are surprisingly pretty even though the overall tone of this game is rather dark especially compared to d os 1 it still retains some of the first game s light hearted charm and this can be reflected in the bright cartoony visuals the main characters are all interesting and unique visually and the character creation system itself is incredibly deep from an appearance standpoint aside from some occasional frame drops the game is pretty impressive visually gameplaydivinity original sin 2 s biggest strength one that makes it one of the all time greats is its incredible amount of player choice this is reflected in almost every aspect of the game the addition of physical and magic armor means that you re going to need to think a little bit more when it comes to party composition and prioritizing targets while simply stunlocking an enemy to death isn t as effective now on top of this with the sheer amount of skills in the game there are so many different ways to approach a situation for example you could hack away at a troll or you could turn him into a chicken and teleport him into a pit of lava or you could summon a monster one that s just as large as that troll on top of a fire causing the monster to be infused with fire and have the two duke it out with each other the variety in skills adds so much depth to the already refined turn based combat mechanics of the first game while some skills and talents are better than others the classes overall are pretty fairly balanced and offer you a lot of wiggle room to make your characters more well rounded and the weaker skills talents are still playable at least the game is also difficult but it very rarely felt unfair even then thanks to the incredible amount of choice in this game you can easily exploit these unfair fights where the game falls flat gameplay wise however is the final boss without going into spoilers it takes the biggest strengths of this game and throws them out the window turning into an absolute mess where you barely get to do anything overall though aside from the final boss everything in the gameplay department is perfect the combat mechanics are deep and incredibly fun the game overall is mostly fairly balanced the armor system makes the game more interesting and the sheer amount of choice makes just about anything possible the gameplay alone makes this game worthwhile at full price and the enhanced edition should hopefully make it even better storyunfortunately on the other end of the spectrum the weakest part of divinity original sin 2 is its story while the writing is good and the pacing starts off fairly consistent this all goes out the window for the last third of the game from the big climax in act 3 and onward the pacing goes all over the place act 3 as a whole is over extremely quickly while act 4 is drawn out some more but still fairly easy to blow through as mentioned before the final boss takes the biggest strengths and throws them out the window and this includes the writing as an example of this one of my party members told my character that he would support me no matter what decision i made only to get mad at me for choosing something he apparently didn t support this happened over the span of about 30 seconds and i m not exaggerating that either all of the character development of your party members is thrown aside for some reason and it makes the finale that much more frustrating on top of this none of the endings are satisfying while i understand the approach they tried to take the drop in quality of the writing made all of them feel stupid and nullified all the progress you made in the game however everything else is great fort joy was brilliant and i loved watching the island slowly open up for you to explore as you escaped it driftwood while definitely a lot slower paced was filled to the brim with entertaining quests and the classic d os charm plus the amount of player choice is also reflected here you can talk your way out of a situation in a wide variety of different ways and your decisions do have weight to them overall while the first two acts of the game are incredible the last two are not as great and will likely leave you disappointed audioremember how i said that almost everything in this game could be changed by the player well i wasn t kidding you can choose your character s instrument which plays during the battle to the music when you kill an enemy i also personally find it pretty impressive how much of this game is voice acted with the exception of a few conversations almost everything has competent voice acting another pleasant suprise was how much i enjoyed the soundtrack while i liked the first game s music not much stuck out for me aside from the classic tavern music and the main menu theme in this game however i found myself humming along to music like the lady vengeance theme and the tavern battle theme while neither of these things are major highlights to the game they re both done very well and do make the experience significantly more entertaining as a result replayabilityas choice is this game s biggest strength the replayability for d os 2 is very high moreso than most other rpgs in my opinion there s no way you can see or do everything in a single playthorugh plus the party member quests are entertaining enough that you ll probably want to see them through for every character plus with the inclusion of the excellent game master mode even if you don t do multiple playthroughs of the game you ll be spending hours on top of hours in this game there s so many different combinations of classes and skills that experimenting is incredibly fun and so you ll definitely have a lot of motivation to play through the game again verdictto conclude while divinity original sin 2 suffers from things like frame drops and an incredibly weak finale the game s strengths overshadow its weaknesses so much that i still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might even be remotely interested people weren t kidding this truly is one of the best rpg games ever made and the enhanced edition has the potential to make it the best graphics 9 5 10gameplay 9 5 10story 7 5 10audio 9 0 10replayability 8 5 10 9 5 10 amazing personal pick incredibly large amount of player choice deep and entertaining
