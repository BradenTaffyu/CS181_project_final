2017 intro stardew valley is easily one of the most amazing games i ve ever played it lets you enjoy the role of a farmer in a small town socialize with its inhabitants and witness an outstanding story that clearly clarifies this game s genius pros i am a sucker for pixel graphics and by all means the spritework here is great and very well made fun and insanely addicting in a very good way you basically get sucked into this game and spend countless hours playing it because it s so incredibely fun you get to socialize with the villagers and get to know each and every one of their different interesting personalities this is done by the friendship function in the game that is composed of ten hearts socializing unfolds new dialogues stories and great scenes regarding each of them individually eventually there are villagers that you can even marry and set up a family with explore endless floors with a satisfying amount of monsters and loot fishing mechanic is pretty much fun and challenging but can be boring at times very simple and comfortable interface and mechanics cons planting and watering plants manually can be a bit tiring at first but shortly after you progress on your farm these methods are no longer an issue since you can accomplish these automatically rather than manually obviously this game wasn t made for this so i can t blame the developers but the fighting mechanic feels dull and rather unappealing but you get used to it conclusion and rating this game is highly recommended it is easily one of the best games i ve ever played
