age of mythology retold is a very well done remaster of one of the best rts games of all time they ve made changes to the ui graphics voices character models maps character portraits etc there are some quality of life improvements like being able to auto queue units if you want there is a setting to turn it off if you prefer the old style of having to train everything manually they ve put in a lot of work and thankfully it s paid off if you ve played the original just a fan of rts games or curious at all this is worth picking up the classic build gather resources and building up armies is still here some of the new visuals look amazing especially how buildings get destroyed you get the original games campaign and the expansions skirmish mode and multiplayer there are already plenty of mods to check out and looking at how the aom community has been making mods for the last 20 years there should be some really interesting ones that come to aom retold aom retold is one of the best remasters to one of the best games ever made i own and still played aom ee i still have my original aom discs and after playing this remaster i highly recommend it i ll be putting a lot of hours into this one too
