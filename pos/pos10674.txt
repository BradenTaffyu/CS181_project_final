2021 over the hundreds of hours i personally have put into hearts of iron iv i ve come to love it for what it is a superb strategy game containing the complexities of war in the early modern era of world war 2 but do not let that scare you away from this game paradox games do have a tendency to not be entirely noob friendly in my experience but hoi4 hearts of iron iv is the easiest to learn of the ones that i ve played the only detriment to hoi4 is the laughably bad a i complexity of warhoi4 is by far the most engaging strategy game i ve played so far it succeeds in capturing the essence of what it must feel like being the commander of all a country s forces to win world war 2 as either side you must coordinate your air force your navy and your army and each of those branches have their own methods of achieving success you can obtain naval supremacy and land marines on the island of iwo jima or alternatively dominate the skies and land paratroopers behind enemy lines perhaps you want to attempt a breakthrough using the heaviest armored tanks available to you or send waves upon waves of soldiers to shatter the enemy lines ultimately there are strategies that will fail and strategies that will succeed it is up to you to discover them ease of learningin other paradox games such as europa universalis 4 there are game mechanics that might not be readily understood game mechanics such as splendor over extension prestige rivals etc in hoi4 things are fairly simple to understand for example there are two types of factories in hoi4 civilian and military factories civilian factories can be used to build other factories radar stations fortifications infrastructure and other buildings or you can trade civilian factories for resources military factories produce the guns tanks artillery anything one might use for warfare once you understand that there s not much more you have to understand you might choose to create an elite infantry unit of 40 width for that division you might require some 1 400 guns and 140 artillery so how do you make them you simply assign military factories to build them and provided you have the resources to build them they will begin to rapidly build up your arsenal a i predictabilitythe a i in hoi4 is the one area that leaves one to desire more the a i can be flat out stupid at times perhaps they put so many troops on your frontline they suck out all the supply starving your own forces though in my experience the bigger detriment is the predictable nature of the a i it s not so hard to defend against a naval invasion from the a i once you successfully repel the first attempt because the a i is likely to continue invading the same province now albeit building coastal forts to repel the invaders may not be the wisest use of your civilian factories however it is one strategy that can succeed if you find that the americans keep trying to invade normandy just build some coastal forts there is a difficulty settings in this game however it does not change the behavior of the a i instead it gives them various bonuses or harms them in certain ways depending on how difficult you want the game to be but that can t replace the overpowered nature of the human mind conclusionoverall hoi4 is a fun engaging experience there s countless scenarios one can attempt along with an abundance of nations to play as perhaps my favorite part of this game is playing as some minor nation that didn t play a huge role historical in ww2 and seeing what impact i can have on the game given that i know the war is coming could south africa have liberated all of africa within the first year of the war could hungary have defeated the combined air force of the allies if spain had joined the war on germany s side would the mediterranean have turned into an axis lake with so many questions beginning with what if or could there s hundreds of hours worth of answering to do i have not yet played a multiplayer game i would imagine that would be quite fun to participate in as players would prove a greater challenge than the a i ever could overall i give this game an 8 10
