early access review ok so game is great we all know that it has it s downsides but i m a glutton for punishment and i will do the things it s basically ending up being my version of my bored game kind of like my father playing solitaire on his computer in his downtime you re bored you move the things around run around like an idiot tell the customers to stop buying all of your toilet paper rinse repeat after a while it gets grindy a bit too much it feels to get money for upgrades but it s mindless work just to get that last achievement and what s the point of achievements if you don t have to work for them i m 131 hours into this game by the time i made this review and still have a long ways to go hopefully this game dev will save me and update this game before i complete that achievement i m completely addicted and it s my hyper focus cannot stop til i complete send hepl or updates or something and stop buying all of my toilet paper thanks yes i realize this review helped exactly zero people but i love this game you might like it too especially if you re bored all the time and need mindless distractions from life just make sure you have enough toilet paper
