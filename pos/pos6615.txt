2019 ive never been so passionate about trucks in my life i sit at night sometimes listening to a trucker sim radio station in my modded hatsune miku truck and my similarly modded pikachu plush toy sit in my passengers chair never has a game made me feel so good i may have a 500k loan to repay i may constantly crash into walls and do stupid stuff that gets my beloved truck and trailer damaged but this game doesnt ever make me worried about it if you too would like a hatsune miku truck to drive across europe then this game is probably the one for you
