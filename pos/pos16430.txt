2016 early access review i would describe this game to a friend as sruvival in finland while you build a car the first time i saw footage of this game i imeadiatly thought of the car mechanic simulator series but this is somehow completely different the mix of building gathering resources and surviving is pretty good yes the game needs work but its still in development and so far with my setup i havent found any big issues yeti will take my hat of for the team behind this amazing game for comming up with the idea keep up the good work
