2015 pros you have a solar system a box of rocket parts and a species of suicidal green men who love exploring and explosion and your mission is to help them rocket science made easy ksp is the easiest way to understand and learn about everything space related from designing and building rockets or planes to orbital mechanics docking and rendezvous and the means of traveling to other celestial bodies an overwhelming depth let s be honest your first attempt at launching a rocket will be disastrous and you won t go anywhere even close to space but from failures you will learn to arise from the ashes and achieve more and more greater stuff soon you will be on your first suborbital trajectory have your first kerbal astronaut in space and so on and so on and yet you have no clue of the possibilities that await you but with logic and lots of explosions trial error seems to be a leading motive at the kerbal space center you will always advance somehow be rewarded for your achievements ksp does not have integrated achievements that tell you what virtual master piece of a task you just completed and yet everything you accomplish feels more fulfilling than it ever felt before you are behind the success or failure of whatever you do a humorous touch very early in the game you will realize that those small green guys that are somehow in the fashion of the minions of despicable me you command are very keen to progress in their space program they are also a little bit clumsy and as you can imagine the combination results in a lot of explosion but kerbals like nothing more than explosions and therefore failure will never feel devastating a devouted developer squad who is responsible for ksp is working hard to improve their game continiously what started years ago in an early alpha version of the game has developed contionously and even now after the official release there is a steady flow of updates additions and fixes similar to skyrim the game is easily moddable and has a tremendous amount of mods that are easily installable and often high quality cons we re gonna need a rescue mission you will lose this game is definitely no game that guides you from a to z like many other newer games do and on your journey there will be loss of material parts rockets and kerbals but this is just part of the experience and the process of learning the in game tutorials offer you a sufficient start and if you further want to increase your knowledge and limits there is always the possibility to watch videos or read guides both of those are out there in great quality
