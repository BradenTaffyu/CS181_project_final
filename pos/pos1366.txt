2020 early access review this game is a complete experience of zombie apocalypse natural disasterslet me tell you a short story i m a cop i woke up one day to loud noises on my door as i slowly walked towards the door crash a man rolled through my window and two other followed soon after i ran back to my bedroom where i left my gun i close the door behind me as i look for the ammo banging on the door starts and i can hear the hinge giving in i stop and realized i left my ammo on the kitchen counter but there s no turning back now i strap my survival pack while i look for any weapon crash another man rolled through my bedroom s window i grab a golf club and bash his head while he s still on the ground as the blood splatters all over the walls and myself the door finally gives and three zombies storm the room i can t fight them all so i jump through the window the glass cuts and lodges itself inside my hand i run through the street dripping blood as as my now former room mate s body stumbles in my direction i run between houses climbing over fences and using bushes to break line of sight i m panicked and i almost got grabbed as i can t see anything broader than a tunnel five minutes later i m hiding inside an abbandoned garage i m calmer now as i take a look at my hand the cut is pretty ugly and it s dripping blood i open my backpack and take a small medkit box out i grab the tweezer and pull the shards out i screamed and felt sick out of pain i grab some sterile tissue and soak it in alcohol another scream and faint vision as i rub the bloody cut now comes the hard part i look for a suture needle in my kit quickly realizing i forgot to put it there that s a problem a bandage wont do much good but that s the best i can do it right now i use a roll of bandage around my hand and quickly pack everything inside my bag i take a look around the carage hoping for some luck but it s not my day i eat some chips and drink a pepsi trying not to throw up i take some painkillers but it s not enough i decide to wait until darkness so i can sneak my way into the drugstore three blocks down the street i can t sleep i m in too much pain i play with a deck of cards trying not to get depressed i smoke a cigarette while i listen to steps wandering outside i hear banging on the walls it could be here maybe it could be on the house next door i hold my breath trying not to give myself away eventually it stops and i can t hear them anymore my clock reads 21 00 as i carefully peak through the windows i haven t heard anything in a while so i decide to start my journey towards the drugstore my bandage is soaked in blood and i think it s starting to smell funny it s a moonless night light rain and it s pitch dark perfect conditions they can t see me and the noise from the rain will keep them from me almost there as i cross the street i noticed a small horde they re agitated because of the rain i duck inside a bush while i wait for them to move it s cold as the devil s heart and i m wearing no coat my eyes and throat start to get sore as i patiently wait two hours for them to move the path is now cleared but the rain is gone i take excessive care but i make to the drug store i can hear moaning behind the counter but i don t care checking it i ran through the shelves and i found my desired needles i quickly pack it inside my back along some hand sanitizer when suddenly atchooo i sneeze the moans got louder and closer i can hear them closing in i dash through the door stumbling on a couple of walkers i could probably beat them into a pulp earlier but i m too weak now i tried leading them away from the drugstore but the earlier horde is closing in now it s time for me to go as i run some walker stumbles on a car and the alarm goes off that s not good i run into the darknessfour days later i m holed inside a house all doors and windows boarded up i m running a fever sweating and vomiting my hand is aching but i don t mind taking the putried bandage off i know i have a bad infection tried cleaning it but i passed out of pain last time i found some herbs yesterday but it s too bad right now i m too weak and i m running out of dogfood the water and power stopped working last night so i have to hurry before the meds get spoiled three hours later i m crouch inside the same bush now looking at some 50 walkers banging around the drugstore leaning themselves against that car the alarm is going nuts and it makes my head hurts i know of another drugstore downtown but i can t go there right now the place is crawling with walker but at night i might have a chance two hours later i m on my way downtown but it starts raining i m weak and running a fever i can t stay out here i start to look around when i hear bang bang bang gunfire i run to the first house i can find and run to the top floor i lock the door behind me and hide myself as i hear what seems to be a thousando zombies marching through the street i m too tired i can t see straight and i can barely carry my own weight i take a couple of painkillers and lay myself on the bed while i wait for the sun to set i m too tired so i decide to take a nap i close my eyes as i drift into the dark comfort my body stops aching and i feel like that s the best bed i ve ever slept on the sun sets but i won t rise at least not for a couple of hours hungry for the next survivor that s how i died
