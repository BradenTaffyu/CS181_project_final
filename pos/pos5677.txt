2021 early access review this game is the perfect follow up for anyone who loved warband or the original mount blade it s still in early access but i think if you like me have borderline exhausted warband this is the next step although it is a lot more complicated than its predecessors and the game does introduce you to its new systems fairly well there are some things you should be made aware of before you start 1 the entire game revolves around a clan mechanic no longer are you a starting adventurer with nothing and no one now you have a clan you rise and fall with your clan when you die yes you can die you take over as someone else from your clan there is now an actual reason for getting married but the clan system can take away some of the fun of warband where it was just you starting the game you have several siblings whose lives you are in charge of and because of this it can feel micromanagy at times clan tiers are a thing and the game locks you out of some of the more fun aspects of warband like starting your own kingdom until you hit a certain clan tier so just bear with it 2 the whole trade system is weird in warband to become a merchant you just had to buy and sell goods and open an enterprise here you can make caravans for yourself and buy multiple workshops right now they re pretty nerfed so check out the mod community 3 kingdom management is a lot more complicated whether you are a vassal or a monarch there s a lot going on so don t feel bad for looking things up or pausing the game just to read through the kingdom screen press k this isn t crusader kings but it can still be overwhelming 4 mods work with native unlike in warband for the most part mods here affect your native gameplay and some work with new updates and some don t i recommend playing the game for about thirty hours without mods then adding a few in but like any elder scrolls veteran can tell you try adding one at a time in case it starts crashing your game 5 years pass quickly i ve had warband playthroughs where i conquer calradia in about a year and a half here it s much different years pass quick and you ll still probably be doing the first two missions by the end of year two on your first playthrough 6 there is a story kind of like skyrim the game locks you out of the fun stuff until you do the early story quests and one of them can be a nightmare feel free to look up guides because at this point most of the mods to help you with it do not work with the current update written october 26 2021 there is a point to the story it explains why the world is the way it is but i don t blame you for just doing sandbox after your third or fourth start 7 the game is early access things change all the time things are buffed and nerfed like no other don t be discouraged the modding community is great and there are a ton of things to help right now workshops are dead in the water but there are mods to make them not be a bane when they should be a boon please don t feel weird or bad for using cheats after you have to restart because an update killed your perfect playthrough or you re using an op mod because you re last character was almost king of all calradia but now because you re a sturgian you re getting culture penalties everywhere just don t sweat it overall this is one of the most fun games i ve ever played and it is a true sequel to the original games if you think you can live with the early access features pick it up if not just wait and if you ve never played a mount blade game before i would recommend either starting here or warband warband might be a more consistent experience but if it doesn t hook you pick this game up on the cheap
