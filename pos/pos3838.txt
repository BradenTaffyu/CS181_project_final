2020 a great tactical turn based rpg gameplay similar to xcom on a fundamental level but diverges once the build customization crafting taming and other mechanics come into play here s a quick rundown of the features 9 recruitable characters each with their own personality skills and play style 3 classes for each character base class 2 advanced classes each plays differently and comes with a unique set of abilities beast taming drone building satisfying and can be leveled and customized just like characters mastery system is highly flexible and allows you to build a character for any play style or role crafting system is deeply integrated into the game and pretty extensive ai doesn t cheat and instead uses the same underlying systems as your own characters skills masteries leveling etc this makes them challenging but fair tactically they will cc you take cover hide overwatch smoke etc can replay any mission and pick different choicesstory the presentation is a bit like an anime but it doesn t detract from the overall enjoyment there is quite a bit of dialogue and some missions offer choices though consequences are usually restricted to that particular mission also unlike xcom every mission even side quests is part of the greater story and tied more or less to the main plot line i should mention that the story is deeper than it might appear at first sight characters have their own motivations and reasons for helping you and interestingly they have their own views on each other no character exists within their own bubble personally i can t wait to see where the game takes it from here note the english translation is not perfect there will be awkward phrases some weird descriptions and other inconsistencies which a native or educated speaker will notice though they are getting better with an ingame tool to suggest better translations and the forum suggestions being implemented quickly length with 70 missions and late game missions taking 1 2 hours it s around 100 hours for an average player to finish the game if you want to get into the crafting system taming getting rare masteries epic legendary gear and other end game activities then expect much more multiplayer rather barebones at this point there s email chat trading planned to be expanded on you don t miss anything important if you play in offline mode but switching from offline to online is not possible just the reverse another point worth mentioning is the dedication and community involvement of the developer team monitoring feedback replying to comments and fixing bugs quickly much appreciated
