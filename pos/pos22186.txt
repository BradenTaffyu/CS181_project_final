2017 before this review starts i know i screwed up the dark souls ii review so i apologized for that one dark souls iii is a rpg game created by from software and published by bandai namco entertainment formerly bandai namco games the game sets in interconnected world of lothric the whole throughout of the playthrough you will find similar area from the predecessors the enemies the npc weapons and armor for long time dark souls fan the lore is still cryptic as usual and you will find the lore understandable if you know what is going on during cutscenes and dialogs the game is running with bloodborne engine which is a great thing so let s talk about the changes in this game changes the changes for dark souls iii is somewhat accessible accessible as in upgrading armor is removed so pretty much you can wear whatever you like fashion souls iii combat system is great but power stancing from dark souls ii is gone the poise ugh it s completely obsolete no matter what you wear covenant system seems to have a nice change where you can change at any time without losing the covenant gameplay okay i am going to do a positive side i am not sure if it is a fixed difficulty where for the first 11 hours i feel like this game is easy fast forward it can be friggin hard and take 20 tries to take down the boss the enemies and bosses do have their own unique attack patterns as usual so it is not the best to play agressive i have not played the sorcerer or pyromancer yet but i am assuming they are still powerful but not as overpowered from the predecessors the item system is improved the official soundtrack of dark souls iii it s a 10 out of 10 the combat system is extensive you can change variety of weapons my favorite weapons so far is great scythe and any twinblades the multiplayer is now better than ever i can t tell you how much i love the matchmaking options system where you can put the password so one of your friends don t get summoned by randoms and play offline system this is the best dark souls multiplayer yet i am done with positive side now i am going to talk about the negative side everytime i beat any boss fight the bonfire spawns at the boss fight area how many friggin bonfires are there in total i feel like dark souls iii is being generous to players because it doesn t feel like an actual difficult game from predecessors i really do understand that people who never played dark souls before i found new game plus to be more easier than playing on your first playthrough it s disappointing and i wish they could ve done something to new game plus like damage modifiers enemy health pool and usual stuff to make the game difficult the poise in this game like i said feels nothing to me the performance issues seems to be minor at times even hard froze fps spikes that s it the items in this game can be worthless the pvp it s really annoying how people play as in chasing the invader but getting baited by pve enemies the meta can be broken newcomers will find it difficult when getting invaded by seasoned players so it s best to play offline on matchmaking options forgot to say that the pvp is riddled with cheaters and modders verdict man i got to say that i am still sad that i finished the trilogy need to get the season pass to play the ashes of ariandel and the ringed city the combat system lore bosses and items are great but performance issues are minor boss fight area bonfires are unnecessary and poise system is obsolete this game made me want to come back and sink more hours into the game for builds pvp and pretty much s h i tposting memes for me hail yung maestro the conclusion was satisfying and i am glad that i finished the souls series i will give this game a 9 out of 10 a great solid recommendation for newcomers and veterans alike
