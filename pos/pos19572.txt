2019 this is without a doubt the greatest fallout game ever created obsidian are the masters of fallout as far as this reviewer is concerned bethesda should give the exclusive rights to develop all fallout games to obsidian the story is fantastic the way factions work is incredibly immersive the dlc is to die for particularly dead money most others will say lonesome road is the greatest but i personally love the dead money story line and even nearly 10 years later this game feels fresh and refreshing it feels as though your actions and play style do truly affect the way the game unfolds a contrast to the very linear and repetitive feeling of fallout 4 the locations and their dungeons are unique and obviously crafted with careful skill there are a million and one interesting little side quests with which you may distract yourself the aesthetic is immersive and appropriate for the setting i sincerely can t say enough good things about this game my only complaints are there isn t a remaster and there isn t a new dlc or expansion being released every other week 10 10 i will continue to revisit and replay this game until my computer no longer runs
