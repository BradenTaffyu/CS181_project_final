2014 early access review update it s been quite a while since i made my original review and while the vast majoriy of what i said then still applies there are a few things that have changed all for the better the game still has wonderful softbody physics scratches still do not appear on the pain and the game still eats up a lot of my time however i can gladly say that beamng drive now provides a much better driving experience all the cars handle very realistically not necessarily nicely however as a lot has been overhauled you now have control over tire pressure tires will heat up the engine will heat up suspension has been completely overhauled and generally the game handles a lot better on top of that there are several new official maps and vehicles and lots of quality mods available beamng driver still isn t the best looking game on the market and still has places to grow but it s still certainly worth picking up and it keeps getting better and better original review as someone who s been doing small track racing in beat up 4 cylinders since i was 11 i know a few things about damage modeling i m very picky with car games especially ones centered around carnage beam ng is in my opinion one of if not the best soft body car physics sandbox games out there the damage portrayed is pretty darn close to the real thing while it s not perfect it s as close as 2014 technology can really let us experience since it s still in alpha scratches and rubs don t appear on the side of the cars but i certainly hope they will when the game is finished however while the damage modeling is wonderful as far as a driving experience beamng drive doesn t deliver if you want tight accurate and realistic car control look elsewhere as of aug 14 14 beamng drive isn t great to drive the controls are sort of laggy rear wheel drive vehicles are near impossible to drive and the standard transmision is rather awkward that being said this game is still in developement and i certainly recomend picking it up as is demolition derbies are sort of possible but just messing around is tons of fun i certainly enjoy it and i want this game to become fully polished so buy it and help it become the perfect driving simulator sandbox thing
