2023 it is an excellent game but it is not for everyone literally the game is to drive drive drive you must have strong mind to endure that as it can become tedious or very monotonous as simulation experience is 10 10 however not being a triple aaa game loses touch in terms of graphics and scenery something i really liked is the simulation of secondary factors such as similar driving fatigue something i did not like but could implement would be to make stops to eat and be more awake to endure more on long roads another implementation that i really liked was that you can put your own playlist to make the road more educational in conclusion i highly recommend the game if you like driving being inside a cabin watching the instrument panel and everything is educational having to stop to rest or to refuel is an excellent detail i recommend it but with dlc maps because it does not have many open places and with dlc your experience changes a lot
