2023 what why how in the two weeks i ve had this game i ve clocked up 70 hours in it eh i do find myself asking why no seriously why it isn t often anymore that a game manages to grab my attention to such a degree but of out of my immense steam library what in the f is it about this particular game that did it the game manages to be quite immersive even with kinda graphics a screenshot of american truck simulator by poopfeels the game is unquestionably beautiful however the graphics are dated the gameplay is about as monotonous as i imagine truck driving in real life really is the physics and handling are pleasant enough but there s nothing all that interesting or groundbreaking there while some of the oversize and special transports will give you a run for your money and reversing in general is exactly as much of an exercise in anger management as its real life counterpart there isn t much of a challenge or difficulty to this game you know how every once in a while when you re playing gta you just decide to drive like a normal law abiding citizen this is that kind of experience as a full game on its own you can of course choose to drive like a homicidal madman here as well which does bring its own unique pleasures to be fair but the game isn t really set up to facilitate that too much for the most part its quite relaxing and has a meditative quality to it it is a roadtrip game it s a game about seeing sights or just some of the everyday and ordinary but from places you ve never been or will ever be the world design is quite spectacular and has a surprising amount of depth and detail to it bring me that horizon a screenshot of american truck simulator by poopfeels there s a progression system of sorts but other than some unlockable trucks it only has as much focus as you yourself put into it you can kinda manage your own fleet and employees but this is only as important as you decide it is the community has some fantastic modded content and also runs dedicated internet radio stations for this game which is pretty rad none of this i don t think actually explains how this game is such a massive time sink but for now i just want to play it more
