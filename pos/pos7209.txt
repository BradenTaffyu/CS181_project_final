2021 early access review one of the better craft survival games i m normally pretty apathetic towards the genre but since its early days raft has been a welcome staple in the play rotation with my friends and i the balance between surviving scavaging exploring and creation is bang on the game loop directing attention where needed without becoming tedious or overstaying its welcome there s a great sense of progression and accomplishment as you create new equipment and tools to make your survival and exploration more efficient and in my regular circle we never feel overly pressured or stressed to just stay alive the procedural nature of the game is random enough that we re keen to check out new islands as they approach to mine resources but also feel comfortable skipping them and moving out without fear of missing out but i think what i love most of all and what has kept raft in our rotation is the meaty content added with each of the major chapter updates we ve genuinely looked forward to each chapter as with each update we know we re on a multi island adventure of discovery there s a real sense of progression as we unravel the narrative through notes and collectables while also unlocking new crafting recipes and gear to enhance the functionality of our raft because of how balanced these updates are these upgrades indeed make our survival easier and more efficient but not enough to break the game so much explore new farming resource and activity options setting ourselves up for the next chapter whenever it comes we genuinely can t wait for the next chapter huge kudos to the team for nailing the gameplay loop so well with such a clever aesthetic tone and feel that is just the right balance in all the right areas also as a side the three of us adore the artistic attention to detail on all the craftables and new raft equipment you all have done a great job at making them crazy patched together bits and pieces of rubbish and junk that seem like they might just work as intended love it
