2022 still one of the best total war games imo shame it got axed when it has so much going for it this is simply put the most fun i ve ever had on the campaign map and it s due to the way the in depth mechanics of the campaign work the diplomacy system is deep accessable and rewarding to use the spying and subterfuge system lets you pull off schemes that would make sun tzu applaud the character relationships are dynamic and help create stories as well as changing how you play the economic possibilities are amazing as you can literally buy your way to emperorship with enough smart deals and good commandery management climbing the ranks of nobility through prestige feels good as you customize your government to suite your play style either covering up for a factions weaknesses or enhancing their existing strengths and each faction does have their own unique weaknesses and strengths that they specialize in making the replayability very high now as much as i love gushing about the game it would be irresponsible to not talk about the weaknesses unit variety is not the highest there are essentially 4 or 4 5 rosters in the game if you own the requisite dlcs these are the han base game roster the yellow turban remnant yellow turban dlc roster the original yellow turban rebellion mandate of heaven dlc roster and the nanman furious wild dlc roster there s also the bandits base game after a rework who get a small selection of kinda crappy base units and then access to a lot of units from the other rosters through their unique technology tree though you can only recruit a limited number of these outside of that every faction except the shi xie flc faction has about two to three units but some of these are better than others second big con is that well some of the dlc isn t worth it as they add either only a couple new factions or take place in a completely different time period cough eight princes cough adding on to this is that some of the dlc and flc factions are not up to par with the base game factions either because the have gimmicky mechanics or because they lack something nearly every other faction has for example shi xie flc has no unique units and also lacks a unique building tree liu yan flc has no unique building tree and has an unintuitive inheritance mechanic meanwhile sun ce technically dlc if you want to start as him has a different mechanic from his father sun jian and two additional unique units but aside from the two units and his fates divided storyline you re essentially playing the same faction and arguably a less fun version of it in summary i would definitely advise getting this game but be very picky when it comes to the dlc
