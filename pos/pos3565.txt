2019 i can t recommend this game enough such a neatlly creafted lore with subtle details and a very well laid out plot such lovely characters with a few premium wtf moments such an ingenious addition of fourth wall breaking behaviours it s what i call a metagame a game that is a game whilst pretending it is about to burst into reality at any moment and i love metagames just a thing i want to address controls sometimes stiff when moving the soul around the bullet board always unforgivable i can t understand for the life of me why the wasd configuration wasn t provided as an option i found myself crossing my wrists on the keyboard hitting the directional arrows with the left hand while pressing z x and c with the right one i mean in my opinion this is serious wasd for directions and j k and l for commands would have been perfect graphically it is true that a great game doesn t need great graphics and undertale is a perfect example of this assertion but with a slighty better graphics undertale would have been way more visually enjoyable if i can say so battle sprites and movements still are pretty cool and for some is amazing plotwise i just cleared the true pacifist route and i am troubled at the thougth that i should now attempt genocide there s this small part of me that keeps saying leave them alone and another part that says let s destroy everything for the heck of it best character flowey the most intriguing best boss undyne the most enthralling best wtf moment undyne cooking lesson awfully funny and weird best feels asriel dreemurr second form best boss track can t decide between death by glamour mettaton megalovania sans and spider dance muffet honestly all of the undertale ost is a masterpiece please try it you won t regret it
