2023 product received for free i played this game in vanilla mode already over 130 hours and to be honest i like vanilla in this case i will not compare csii with c s as they are two very different games and c s had 8 years time to get new features bug fixes code mods and assets therefore these two games have a totally different base to work with csii is completely new coded not simply reused code that got polished a bit and be sold as a new game it is a new game we all know csii struggles right now with the performance but being involved deeply in the testing i know that co is working on this as they already stated in their very open announcements would it have been better to postpone the release abit from a consumer point of view most likely but is it a bad game is it horrible coded no not at all it absolutely needs performance tuning no question but this says nothing about the game core mechanics and these define how enjoyable a game is in the long run once the performance issues are fixed because of this i ll write about the good core mechanics the game have and that are a solid base for former development the simulation handles many aspects of a realistic simulator in a good way e g industrial areas warehouses are automatically build where they are needed and this smoothes out the traffic in the areas a lot the painting of industrial areas for farming livestock and so on is a great base adding different textures in future will make this even nicer looking the traffic itself including accicdents and rush hour system is manageable and the pathfinding in most cases is already very good tweaks will be needed to make the lane switches in last second appear less often just as in real life their should be still people driving this crazy city services like firefighter and police work over all good sometimes not enough firefighter trucks are sent out but this can be optimized later w o too much work adding later animated police officers firefighters and others doing there job would make it ofc looking more realistic the district city service options are good working too the milestone and unlock system is imho a good way to direct the city the way you want and i can see here options to add way more things in future the road builder is one of the greatest tools in csii even though it have a steep learning courve to master all functions and need some additional options force ground elevated bridge tunnel and handle zoning are imho the most important ones the road update tool to add grass trees and walls should use multiplyer keys to e g update a full road only with a few clicks and there should be an option to have grass and trees in one selection instead of two update steps the visual style over all i like it s a bit too clean in my opinion but that s nothing that is unsolveable better grass textures esp for the road upgrades also better textures for the water used in assets fountains are absolutely needed to make these matching the overall style trees on road update should have tree planters tree beds if no grass is used vehicles should have no snow on their windows deciduous trees should not only be white but lose their leaves make them invisible in winter all these are just smaller optical things that would enhance the visual experience a lot the city and district policies need more options but the ones available atm are a good start the upgrade functions for various buildings are great and i like them a lot i hope there might be ways in future to have them even detached from the main building in a defined distance the terrain tools are also very strong and free of cost a hard mode with cost i would like to see later as well as the tree brush while the latter still have a lot potential e g mixed tree selections what i like at the assets is e g that the vehicles drive correctly into garages parking lots as well as the fact that the entry and exit of buildings not get blocked by parked cars the photo mode is great it is an massively powerful tool and the only wish i have there that there should be an option to use specific settings directly in the game play e g light changes to have way more oportunities to create different looking cities as it is not nice to build with different optical settings then doing the screenshots i like that a lot of building are really large e g the train stations but i woul like to have there even more modularity also more variations in the city services buildings are needed only one elemantary school that not even matches a general european stile is not satisfying i see that pdxmods will help there a lot but imho co should deliver there always a basic selection of two or three alternatives per style to summarize positive good core functions as a solid base for future and long term development overall good simulation already good road builder great terrain toolsnegative the actual performance at least with changed settings it s possible to achieve 30fps that are enough for a city builder optical various small details are missing that would enrich the game not enough variations in service building assetsneutral missing workshop but pdxmods is in developmentgood game base with a lot of potential to grow within the next few years to be a very successful successor of c s in my opinion it is worth buying the game if you want to play a realistic city builder that is not too hard to manage but offers a lot of features and if you are willing to to wait for the further development of the game to get better performance add more functions and become more polished
