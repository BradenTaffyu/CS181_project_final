early access review massive amount of uneducated clowns review bombing the game right now likely in nexons pockets this is a paid 30 game with a free to play trial you ll have full access to all the classes albeit 1 at a time maps items and bosses you will however be restricted to normal dungeons where nobody can bring in anything higher than common grade items this change was made months before steam access came along to prevent crazy geared players from stomping noobs the way it s setup currently you ll be able to experience pretty much everything the game has to offer with no time cap incredibly generous and i cannot understand the hate if you want more support the devs if you don t like the content combat leave a review why a review saying the game costs 30 is and has no constructive feedback edit based devs made it so free to players can bring their gear into normal dungeons in a separate queue and can also now buy gear off of the auction house
