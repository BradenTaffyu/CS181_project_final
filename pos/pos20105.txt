2014 fallout new vegas is possibly one of the most successful video games published to the steam community not only becuase of its sense of real life war conflict of nature and real grasp of a post apocalyptic world but also becuase it allows to feel yourself as you might in the real world an example of such is how it allows you create your own character with your own tastes in style color and even gender it also gives you the feeling of bonding with other npc s as they as well have a design much like one you would find in the real world itself another very popular and inspiring thing for this game is its open world enviroment you can do what you want go where you want take who s side you want and say what you want along with a more then wide variety of armor weaponry and most anything else you can think of to choose and select from and if that isn t enough to satisfy your tastes you also have the ability to install mods to perk up the enviroment change many differant aspects of the game the people places and things you interact with and even yourself though this is a spin off from the fallout games 1 2 and 3 this world still allows you to imerge in a whole differant world that you would likely never find in any other game and if you re the type who is up for a challenge you can even use a feature known as hard core mode where hunger thirst sleep and radiation will be allowed to play roles in your gameplay experience all in all this game is a excellent piece of art made by the game industry and i would highly recommend buying this game if you are the type of gamer who like post apocalyptic open worlds as well as a throw back to what seems to be as far back as the late 1950 s yet mixed with a futuristic element at the same time i would with no doubt support this game and encourage the community to give it a shot game on fallout universe
