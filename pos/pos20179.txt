2023 tldr review for those who can t quite decide played almost 90 hours in two weeks i do work 40 hours a week aesthetic an lore accuracy feels 9 9 10 why are the bloodletters that massive 0 1 game gameplay 8 5 9 10 i love this style of combat management is boiled down nicely so it doesn t get in the way some small bugs one side quest bug early on that i fixed by installing toybox mod was a bit of a pain but not too much devs seem to be hotfixing at a solid rate which is promising space combat is spot on they have nailed the 40k feel it s horrifying to play and read about the game is solidly built but the polish isn t quite finished but not far off as always reviews are subjective if you disagree with me please report to your commissar for summary execution the emperor protects
