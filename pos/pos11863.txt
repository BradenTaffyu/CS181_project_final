2021 to be honest the first time i saw the game 2 years ago i weren t very interested about it beacuse i thought it was like another platforms game god it should be illegal to be so stupid artisticly it s beautiful and the soundtrack god that soundtrack i swear there are songs like the undying shores one that i need to listen to just because of how awesome it is it doesn t matter when you are reading this i m listening to it right now the game is amazingly balanced there are times that it may be difficult but not at an unfair point and adding that rogue lite touch makes you want to get deeper every time you die maybe because you want to know every detail about the lore you want to find every secret unlock everything or all the previous reasons together if you haven t given it a chance please do it don t be a fool like me
