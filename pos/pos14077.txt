2019 this game is a little difficult to get into and it s quite unforgiving of mistakes but once you get hooked it s hard to get away from it it s worth getting over that initial hump the systems in the game are really deep and interesting i particularly enjoyed the disease system which felt unique but there are many interconnecting systems with gases germs liquids electricity temperature and it can take quite a while to learn how to deal with all of it even on the easier settings overall it s a great game
