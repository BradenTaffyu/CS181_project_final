2019 early access review this is one of those games you get so deep into it you forgot about time and real life when you finally decided to take a break it s already 12 hours away then and you screwed up somewhere in the middle you had to restart over in the end you got zillions of save files because you start over zillion times and you are still addictive to it gameplay try to get diggers builders early game or you will end up taking forever to build anything for the first 10 20 cycles mechanics are really easy and user friendly if you up for hardcore there s an optionif you just like to chill and relax there s an option if you like sandbox there also multiple options want to watch your minions stress out want to build an army of dups want to dug through the entire rock here s your chance
