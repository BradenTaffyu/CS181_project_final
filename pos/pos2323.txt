2022 not bad at all the game was terrible at launch but right now it has improved a lot the optimization is not the best it feels way heavier than falout 4 even though they basically look the same but i rarely had any crashes and only a couple disconnects in my 300 h i really dislike the presense of membership plans and cash stores in paid games but here those are way less aggressive than in games like eso for exemple i ve never felt like the membership was mandatory to have an actually good experience you can actually recieve the cash currency by playing the game and it s not a tiny fixed amount like most of these games do and it doesn t have lootboxes the only major issue i m seeing currently is the lack of content i ve finished pretty much all the story quests of the base game and dlcs at around level 100 and since then i ve been living in a loop of repeating the same daily quests events and challenges to farm gold for the secret service stuff and to unlock pretty stuff in the choreboard but what for to wander around with my cool looking high level overpriced gear imo this game really need some better end game content the closest thing we have are the daily ops but those are very repetitive and boring
