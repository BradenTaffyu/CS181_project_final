2016 pros much better gunplay than previous titles good graphics decent story settlement construction character creation is quite detailed mod supportcons rpg elements have been toned down a lot not as optimized as i would like preston garveyoverall i think this game is great of course it all depends on what kind of game you re into the gunplay has been much improved in this installment and i think that s a huge plus as it was pretty bad in fallout 3 and new vegas as a shooter it s pretty good but if you re more into the rpg style from the previous games fallout 4 might not be for you if you enjoy building things the settlement construction system is pretty amazing allowing you to build almost anything you can think of overall i think it s an excellent game and it s worth a look if you re into shooters and construction also i recommend ignoring preston garvey unless you want to help settlements with their problems for the rest of your post apocalyptic life
