2023 this simulator is a phenomenal educational device and an addictive pass time for those who enjoy performing repetitive complex tasks with many positive reinforcements in the form of cr in game money a clean and organized garage and most importantly a collection of beautiful cars these cars can even be driven around town or taken to the local race track to test their high end performance with very realistic emulation for how the vehicles would perform in the real world driving the vehicles most certainly takes a back seat to the process of taking the vehicles apart repairing what can be repaired replacing what cannot then reassembling the vehicle to its factory glory or even tuning it to be a superior version of its original design while the vehicles in the base game are all fictitious generally based on a real world car or a mash up of multiple real world vehicles the parts you ll interact with in game are representative of the parts used in real world vehicles and will help the player come to an intermediate to advanced understanding of the inner workings of their vehicle it is this familiarity with vehicle mechanics that in my opinion elevates this game to higher education level of value unquestionably i will have my children play this or the latest version of this game when they are becoming old enough to drive i can think of few more effective ways to help them understand the 2 ton death machines they ll be operating perhaps they ll even develop a love for the processes they learn in game and dedicate themselves to the craft even if they don t choose to be a mechanic the game will offer them practice in operating a business with substantial initial investments before becoming profitable in summation this game is among the most fun experiences i ve had in the process of deep learning and highly recommend it for both meditative pleasure and personal education
