2023 early access review i could gush all day about this game it does so many things right it s an automation game an automation game which does what every good automation game should building things building big things even better sitting back and watching as big things are built dsp is very good at that automating a giant factory to make a gazillion hyper advanced science cubes per second is fine and well but you know what s even better watching hundreds of space launchers and rockets all coming together to put the sun in a cage made of solar panels so you can squeeze every drop of energy out of it so you can do it more and biggerer but this time faster until every star in the vicinity is yoursnow you might say but this looks like something that wants me to use my brain and you might have a point base building games usually feel like putting a logistical puzzle together but if that s not your thing fear not just paste some blueprints from the internet for the parts you don t want to do and you ll be good to go don t let anybody tell you you are playing the game wrong programmers copy code all the time and they still get paid for iti regularly find myself stopping whatever i m doing and just watching my screen in amazement be it the dance of the celestial spheres my hundreds of drones flying gracefully around the factory or my half complete dyson sphere rising over the horizon the game is absolutely beautifulframerate remains stable despite having several planets covered in poorly designed production lines flying or warping from one planet to another is as smooth as it gets i kept thinking hah i bet this will make the game start chugging but it never happened it s very easy to forget this game is made on unity yeahmod support mecha customization blueprint sharing you can even paint on planets if you want that s right write something crude on the surface of a planet in letters so huge its visible from space you know what save it as a blueprint save the entire planet as a blueprint that s right the whole thing now you can make every planet look like that let them know who owns itit says early access but i m yet to find a bug in this gamethis game is going to spoil me rotten and i won t be able to enjoy normal games anymore it s so addictive to play a game made by people with so much passioni could ramble all day but i don t think words alone can make this game justice you just have to experience it i only wish it had trains
