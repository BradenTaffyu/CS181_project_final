2020 as a single player story driven star wars game in the old bioware tradition this game is great every quest is voice acted every class 8 total has its own story that spans all 50 levels of the original game and the morality system adds a nice personalized flavor to the experience beyond that several expansions over the past decade have doubled down on story telling offering a rich and enjoyable experience for any old school star wars fan if you re all about the story and enjoy the wow mmo style gameplay you ll like this game from that perspective which for me is the most important thing by far i give this game 4 5 5still here want to find out what i don t like about the game well this section might go on for quite a bit longer than the praises but don t let that fool you i still really enjoy this game but it is not without its problems first the normal questing gameplay has gotten too easy as high level expansions have tweaked the low level progression speed up to get new players to late game content faster this means that as you follow the story you will find yourself more often than not several levels above the enemies you face in any given area your effective level is scaled down to the area you are in but even with that most public content is a trivial breeze to an experienced gamer there are some areas in the universe meant to challenge parties of two or four players working together after many years away from the game i started again recently and played through several of these solo without any issues this was very disappointing it s important to note that high level content does not suffer from this problem but pretty much all the original game s open world content feels like a tutorial now i know there are reasons for accelerating the level progression but with the game s level scaling mechanics already in place it would be nice if a player could intentionally scale themselves down even further to make the game more challenging for themselves second while most of the game s locations are unique and diverse enough to forgive the occasional cookie cutting there are some key locations that could have been iconic but are outright ruined by cookie cutting the two notable examples of this for me are planetary star ports and each faction s main hub the fleet every planet has a star port it s the first place you see when you arrive at a planet and the last place you see when you leave with only a few exceptions they are all exactly the same building with a different paint job there s very little reason to spend any time in a space port usually but it would definitely be nice if these got visual refreshes to feel a bit more unique the main cookie cutting offender for me though is each faction s main hub unlike planetary star ports which are numerous there are only two fleets one for each faction these are massive space stations with a huge amount of player services from vendors to the galactic trade network every player visits these hubs at least once as they progress through early levels and most players even at the highest levels visit frequently to access services not available anywhere else they should be unique and iconic imparting a sense of distinct identity for the owning faction yet they are exactly the same for both factions except for the paint job when i played the game on launch day in 2011 arriving here for the first time was exciting it marked leaving the newbie area behind and joining the universe at large when i arrived here for the first time on the other faction it was a huge let down i still love this game but i cannot visit the fleet on either faction without feeling that sense of disappointment every single time it could have been so much more if they changed only one thing about this game to make me happy i would have them change this lastly i wanted to talk about one more thing coruscant like the other city planets in the game coruscant is meant to feel big inorganic and sprawling and it succeeds on all three counts but in a bad way it feels big too big most planetary space ports take maybe 15 seconds to cross at full speed coruscant s space port feels three times larger this could have been offset by filling the space with players and npcs making it feel crowded to justify its size but no it s almost entirely empty the rest of the planet feels similarly large and lifeless to add insult to injury most of the questing areas on city planets like this have random nonsensical layouts there s no sense of purpose or design to these spaces making them feel like the facades that they are add that to the oversized empty feel of the space and you end up with what i judge to be the worst part of the game i dread playing through coruscant on a republic character and never look back when the story finally allows me to leave that forsaken planet i ve played many mmos over the years some good some bad some very forgetful star wars the old republic is easily in the top 3 overall for me and from the perspective of a generally anti social player who likes to go it alone the single best story experience i ve had in an mmo but from a gameplay perspective the game has several problems that hold it back early game is too easy cookie cutter locations make some key locations feel cheap and disappointing and coruscant taris a similar planet reduced to post apocalyptic rubble is better imo if you are a star wars fan that enjoys story more than anything you need to play this game if you are a gamer who prefers spectacular immersive locations and challenging content maybe the end game is for you but you ll have to wade through dozens of hours of disappointment to get there
