2019 only five years after release they finally made a fundamental aspect of the game province development thereby removing the majority of the reason to buy dlc but unless you want to generate a random map or control ai ally units during warfare i don t see a reason to get any of the dlc as of now base game is 8 10 game with mods is 8 5 10 once paradox releases a season pass expansion after the milk has run dry and you can get all the dlc for 20 instead of 200 the game will be 9 5 10
