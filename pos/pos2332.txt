2020 the original launch on bethesda launcher was bad we can all agree on that wastelanders isn t a fix all dlc update like some people we re expecting for some reason but it is pretty good the game feels like a fallout game now has loads of dialogue skill checks similar to fonv and fo3 yes it still has its bugs it always will but if you re looking for a fallout experience that is relatively engaging a little repetitive and grindy at the worst of times and surprisingly fun at its high points then buy it wouldn t buy it for full price maybe wait until its on sale but buy it then you ll probably enjoy it
