2020 i really love civilization and i played every version of the game if you don t own the game get a game bundle the base version of civ 6 is incomplete the rise fall dlc makes the game playable and the gathering storm dlc adds more basic features like railroads this is probably the most expensive civilization version for early adopters which isn t fair to players that love the game civ 6 60 dlcs 110 frontier pass 40 210 since when did it become just one more payment the developers also made changes to the game that make no sense like removing transport ships since civ 5 they should make things like that optional for the players the frontier pass also adds secret societes with unrealistic fantasy elements like vampires to the game this is ridiculous for a game based on history if players want fantasy elements they could be added with a seperate dlc like a middle earth version a star wars version a dracula version or a harry potter version fantasy elements shouldn t be added as a surprise
