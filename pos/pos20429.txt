2022 plants vs zombies is such an important game that it defines the tower defence genre on its own lots of other games successfully implemented the same ideas in various different ways but rarely you will find something that s so polished and well designed such as this one this is a very simple game at heart defend your home against the zombies by using plants however everything here seems to perfectly balanced and thoroughly thought even the basic resource management i e acquiring sun units generated by some special plants turns out to be one of the most important things to master otherwise you may end up with either too much or too little there isn t a perfect formula as it varies depending on the level and types of enemies speaking of which the zombies aren t just the regular ones some of them possess special abilities that will keep you busy with the strategy for a while the diversity is adequate just the right measure to make you think twice before choosing your arsenal in each level also things can become quite grim depending on the current environment you see zombies don t just try to come in through the front door some may argue that plants vs zombies is a bit too easy and that s true for the most part it certainly isn t the case with some of the mini games and especially a few achievements it was amazingly fun going through all of them and very rewarding even the passive moments of the game such as taking care of the zen garden and feeding the tree of wisdom were enjoyable this is an easy game to recommend to any kind of player hard core or not it s simply the right thing at any moment of the day there s no multiplayer nor high resolutions here and yet plants vs zombies still beats modern games without breaking a sweat
