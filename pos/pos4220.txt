2019 i did this in a non steam version but still be me play as a swadian spend hours leveling my character and training troops to help my kingdom finally accepted as a count get a small poor village as a fief okay then spend even more hours looting villages befriending lords and helping them capture cities or castles get named marshall gather some lords together march on an enemy castle capture it ask for it as a fief king harlaus gives it to some random who wasnt even there sake lord loses the castle a week later go back capture it again harlaus gives the castle to himself getting real tired of this gather the lords again march on jelkala and capture it harlaus gives it to the same lord as before okay enough rebel against harlaus 5 lords instantly join me because they like me enough i already have half of swadia on day 1 lead a long grueling deadly campaign against swadia leaving that city for last never take any fiefs for myself after everything has been dealt with march on the city besiege jelkala attack the walls at midnight rush the walls with me in the lead spend two minutes mindlessly hacking at a grouped up mess of enemies when finally its king harlaus right there in front of me tell all my troops to fall back pause game put on some power metal as background music for the ultimate showdown kill harlaus in three hits before the song even reaches the tenth bar capture the city easily and take it for myself not the easiest way of taking a city but it was worth it word of advice if you ever find yourself the leader of a medieval feudal country dont do not with your most powerful vasal you dont want to become the next harlaus
