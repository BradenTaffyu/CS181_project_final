2017 this game received a lot of negativity when it came out i didn t play it at release so a large percentage of the hate was probably well deserved in the end though i really feel this title is one of the best in the series i think the battle ai is the best of the series still haven t played attila though the game looks and sounds beautiful in all aspects the campaign was frustrating at first i was disappointed with the fact that they force you to a limited amount of armies and navies they also force you to have a general admiral for all armies navies that means no more marching small groups of leaderless troops from one place to another while i didn t like this at first it really makes sense you can still recruit troops away from a city and they magically appear in the queue on the next turn within your army which means they are marching from one location to another you just aren t the one doing it the game has its issues at times i encountered some crashes that got progressively worse until the game was rendered unplayable surprisingly it was a file that somehow got corrupted and simply verifying the integrity of the game cache resolved it entirely overall the campaigns i have played in this game have been some of the best to date and i highly recommend this title to anyone interested in historical strategy to those who love this series but haven t played this game yet i say give it a try and give it more than just a few turns put a few hours into it before calling it quits
