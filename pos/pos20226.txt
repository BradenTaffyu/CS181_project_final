2023 awesome game so far i ve noticed a few bugs but nothing game breaking i think the worst is the lack of ability to use my personal computer on the ship due to an overlap issue and then i had an issue where i couldn t talk to the space marine in his cage and ended up missing him as a companion outside of that the game has been excellent i am a huge fan of 40k and the rogue trader trpg and all the other trpgs that go with it so this have been awesome they did a great job with chaos and made ship combat and normal combat fun the ship combat feels a bit like battlefleet gothic but turn based overall i d say an 8 10 solid with 10 10 once all the minor glitches and such are resolved
