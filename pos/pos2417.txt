2020 when i played the game at it s release it was a different experience than it is now i wasn t able to complete the game because some quests were glitched now that i ve started playing the game again i have to admit that it s a lot better than before they finally fixed the quests which weren t working before with some overall improvements to the game and bethesda also managed to add npc s to the game which make the game a lot more vivid only downside is the game s optimization which admittedly isn t the best considering the fun that i ve had playing fallout 76 i would still recommend buying it
