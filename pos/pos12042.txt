2021 i m going to start with what a lot of people have issues with and that s the price iracing is a great game the pricing however is extortionate now you might be thinking that 8 99 month isn t so bad and you would be right it isn t the problem is that 8 99 month only gets you access to the rookie series thereafter you have to pay 11 95 per car and 14 95 per track you do not need all of the cars and tracks but using the gt3 series as an example so for me to participate in this seasons gt3 series i would need to at minimum buy one qualifying car for 11 95 and 12 tracks at 14 95 each 179 40 and that s just for one series if you want to participate in more than one add another 11 95 for the car and 14 95 for tracks you haven t purchased yet as you can see it does get expensive however you can spread the cost out as it s one track per week for each series with that said despite the fact that it pisses me off you need both a subscription and need to buy cars and tracks seperately i would still recommend iracing though only if you enjoy multiplayer iracing is by far the best multiplayer racing sim available races run at set times every hour and i ve found there are always people racing you ll have to ignore the steam statistics as the majority of people use iracing outside of steam you have a safety rating and irating which promotes clean racing and you will be matched with racers with similar skill level to you it s great for multiplayer racing but as above it s just unfortunate you have to pay for literally everything outside of rookies at 11 95 and 14 95 a pop it gets cheaper long term as you no longer need to keep buying cars and tracks because you ve already gone bankrupt by purchasing them all it is an extremely fun game though edit it s actually worse than above iracing charge tax at checkout instead of including it into the display price so your 11 95 car becomes 14 34 and 14 95 tracks become 17 94 as if paying for a subscription and paying for the content isn t extortionate enough they slap you in the face at the end with tax it s still a great game but hell edit 2 the vr implementation in this game is pretty good as well
