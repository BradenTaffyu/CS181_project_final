before we begin i have to admit that i haven t seen jurassic world dominion nor do i intend to given the criticisms i ve heard like it somehow botching the super easy task of following up to the ending of fallen kingdom in regards to this game i got it on sale and the only dlc i have is the camp cretaceous dlc pack because i saw the whole series on netflix pros the dinosaurs or rather prehistoric creatures and hybrids have more fluid transitions between animations than in jurassic world evolution 1battles are more interesting than they were in the last gameas opposed to the previous game having a modding scene come up after the last dlc pack this game got mods while still under active support from frontierlike the last game frontier genuinely cares about player feedback and strives to improve the game has the vast majority of content from the first game present in the base game at launch though there are exceptions like huayangosaurus being locked behind the deluxe edition even though it was in jurassic world evolution 1 s base game at launch as well as the secrets of dr wu hybrids being once again locked behind a dlc pack there are multiple pterosaurs in the game the last game only had pteranodon and they could only die of old age in that game never starving and flying around the island peacefully if the aviary dome broke marine reptiles are a nice touch and no matter how small you make their habitats they can t escapeall the inaccuracies compared to the real animals can be passed off as these being imperfect recreations of dinosaurs though the same can be said about any media in the jurassic park franchise cons the campaign is not as interesting as those of the last game as that had the base game campaign the secrets of dr wu campaign as a sort of side quest on that campaign the claire s sanctuary campaign and the return to jurassic park campaign all of which seem to take place in alternate continuities from the film canon sauropods still can t fight back and unlike the last game where the indominus rex was the only thing that could kill it even a pack of raptors can take out a sauropod in this game without the sauropod being able to defend itselfyou can supposedly get 100 of a dinosaur s dna as in the dna of the ones from prehistory but that won t change the dinosaurs to be more accurate though i can understand reasons for the devs not to do that also i got this game and the camp cretaceous dlc on sale because i didn t want to blow 60 on the base game yes i know inflation steadily eats away at the purchasing power of currencies in general overall while i list this game as recommended i d recommend you to wait until a sale
