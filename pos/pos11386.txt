2017 early access review disclaimer i played mostly offline with no internet and steam does not reflect that with probably closer to 1k hours into this game under multiple playthoughs as a solo character and as a team with my wife i would fully recommed this game to anyone interested in the survival genere it hits every point for it but with the hordes that come every 7 days as well as the roaming mobs that you have to content with it sets the bar high for playability with emphasis on survival you dont just battle hunger thirst enviroment but also have hostile npcs trying to wreck your crap constantly that to me sets this one apart from any other in this genre i worked for days irl building a nice base with all the details the game could offer only for a roaming horde and a 7 day horde to work in at the same time after a whole nights battle and using all my ammo weapons health kits i still died after respawining i was so scared of returning that i built a new base in safer spot and then went to remove stuff from my old base it wasnt needed to do such a thing as i could of just went back but the shear terror that i felt during that horde was enough to put me off and rethink to the side of caution if a game can make me feel that then it gets a high rating in my book 10x2 10x2 would inadvently seek terror and death then more terror again
