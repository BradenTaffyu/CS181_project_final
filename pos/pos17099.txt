2017 i have over 300 hundred hours in the first game i thought the first one was excellent however after 11 hours into the second my opinion on the first has changed warhammer 2 has improved in all aspects from the first game to the extent that warhammer 1 is bad i spent over 300 hours in the first game and cant possibly ever see myself going back this is how you do a sequel thank you ca i look forward to mortal empires and the end of the triology
