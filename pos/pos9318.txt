2016 overall a great game good graphics great gameplay can t wait for expansions already i do feel like the endgame needs to be fleshed out more as it gets a bit stale and relies almost solely on the player to push the game to the end i also encountered several bugs such as not being able to get rid of the prethoryn swarm without using console commands to remove them from planets this is not game breaking necessarily but it is rather annoying
