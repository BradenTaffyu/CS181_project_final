2021 the first thing you might notice when checking out this game is the black and white image of the protagonist with some colors being shown in other screenshots and videos however i recommend you to get into this game blindly without checking any image nor video at all if possible omori is a game that seems made with love when you first play comparing it to similar products in the genre from the more recent undertale to classics like earthbound mother 3 and even yume nikki and off is something that comes naturally if you have experienced those games already it all begins in a very uneventful way and quickly changes toward showing you many smiles many colors lots of cutely and well made drawn action and characters there is a lot of care put into everything the enemies have their own personalities the gameplay is characterized by a special emotion system that subtly makes you relate with what happens on screen think for example about pestering flies that make you angry when you don t kill them on your first try you d slowly go from upset to outright enraged and if you have a keen eye and a good memory you will notice many references to characters and situations that you will meet or that you have met and can now follow up after progressing into the game the story revolves around the titular character omori and you will control him while exploring the curious world he and his friends live in the more you delve into it the more you will see elements of love the first time i tagged someone else to be able to proceed seeing the pictures with the background of the environment they were in i felt like i was there with them and the companionship and camaraderie grew on me you will get affectionate to at least a few of the characters you will control or meet on this journey however and this is the part where you should stop reading if you don t want any further spoilers there is much more than a simple lighthearted adventure with your friends in this game which can quickly feel like it becomes more and more vast in contrast with the initial white space that welcomes you something unsettling happens from time to time revolving on the fears that omori has and needs to overcome to further proceed into the story but labeling them as simple fears really discredits the importance of what is truly behind them and what the journey of the character entails i cannot bring myself to tell you more than this as i want to avoid detailed spoilers but i can tell you how the game made me feel when it made me realize that a choice i would make could bring great disaster or great benefit to a small populace confirming that being attentive of your decision will pay off in accepting the result when i came out of a certain location and saw how things developed and how i wanted to change them fully relating with the difficulty of overcoming one s fears when i found myself on a long highway in the middle of the night the music accompanying me having understood more of the game while enjoying what was happening as if i were on the journey myself when against all odds i faced a dire enemy and could withstand its blows when i found myself drifting further in darkness feeling betrayed struggling to get out of it i felt joyful happy comforted sad shocked betrayed annoyed angered resolute the game isn t shy at throwing you darkness among all the happiness and your behavior will influence how you will face this darkness and what results your decisions will bring to it is an exemplary representation of fears depression sadness trauma inability or difficulty to move on mental health family problems social struggle beyond the surface of uneasiness there is substantial confirmation of what you will expect to find and much more against all expectations of dark moments in one s live and even then with all the darkness inside this game this is a game of love we all have been in very dark moments where an abyss seemed more welcoming than the world around us where it was easier to dismiss and feel sad because it felt comforting due to our situation the developers must have put ideas and thoughts from those times they faced as well and in doing so they created something which can be both scary and encouraging for people that are undergoing a journey to overcome their own fears and improve their well being something for all of those that are able to easily relate with characters that while fictional give us as many emotions if not more as the real people that are around us characters that accompany us while we help them walking their path growing strong facing their fears overcoming what we ourselves have been through or want to overcome whether we dislike them or appreciate them in the end the game is a meaningful work of love made for everyone that both needs and wants to overcome an escape from a life that is restrictive demanding and incapable of understanding how much more goes on in the minds and lives of people that aren t just bound by societal rules and work duties how much more people s existences amount to compared to how little importance and focus the world provides them back if you have played celeste you know that there is depth beyond the intense platformer that is presented to you and much love and care that surrounds the whole game where madeline overcomes the difficult task against the comfort of her current unhelpful life ultimately we are all desirous of feeling happy in a world where we can be accepted by ourselves and by others where we want to focus on the things that matters and that we love beyond what we are supposed to like and do and resign to as the norm i wish nothing but the very best to omocat and all the team that was behind a game that is for all of those that felt understood and capable of relating with the silliness and seriousness of earthbound and undertale with the detachment and depth of yume nikki and simply put for all of those that are undergoing this journey called life and can benefit from a reminder that beyond everyday s struggle and constant routine beyond times of dark and difficulties there is always someone and something out there be it friends pieces of media like books movies videogames art and many other forms that understand you and reminds what truly matters how you can influence what is around you beyond what society and others expects you to do and how there is a meaningful world of experiences and memories both wonderful and terrible within you
