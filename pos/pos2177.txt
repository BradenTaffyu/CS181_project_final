i can wholeheartedly recommend fallout 76 the community is fun roaming the wasteland using your new guns working together with strangers at events and trying out new builds is always great never felt the need to use or even view the ingame microtransaction store i paid once and i dont feel like im being goaded into paying for more sure i laughed at this game during launch but after trying it during the fallout series hype the issues people complained about back then are all but gone not a big fan of bethesda anymore but fallout 76 earned its place on my drive i am satisfied with my purchase and will continue to keep playing
