2015 so there i am leading my troops into battle 150 of my own vs 172 of theirs an honourable fight indeed me and my horsemen charge forward our swords ready to strike at the hearts of our enemies my archers their arrows ready to kill the enemy as soon they even see them i see my enemies on the horizon their commanders charging at us a swarm of so many arrows they block the sunlight a bloody fight begins honourable men and women dying left and right but eventually it s just me and the jarl quickly i run up to him thrusting my blade into his chest and blocking his swing he falls down defeated but my troops aren t cheering the fight isn t over why i hear something flying towards me but it s too late george has been knocked unconcious by farmer 10 10 would lose massive battle because of a farmer again
