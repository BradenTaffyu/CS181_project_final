2021 if you re looking for more quality reviews like this follow our curator page devils in the detail old republic new design a star wars mmorpg is not novel but both iterations have been first there was star wars galaxies a game that by today s standards would have seemed a clearer alternative to typical mmo fare originally galaxies was built upon your immersion in a star wars universe rather than nearly exclusively linked to your prowess in combat all classes were entrenched in developing that idea too as an entertainer for instance you needed never to leave a cantina as a doctor a hospital while this may not impress anyone playing an mmo in 2021 try to imagine the ability to work in the cantina in mos eisley in 2003 immersive indeed star wars the old republic is novel too while it still features old fashioned mmo role structures like tanks healers and damagers it nevertheless manages to articulate its originality in other ways the old republic is about its story and for the most part that works it is also not a common distinction in the current mmo market a market where many players are only vaguely aware that something outside of their own traditional gear grind may be happening force chaff star wars the old republic a screenshot of star wars the old republic by solaire bro it has been rumored that the old republic was the most expensive video game ever developed not even factoring in marketing the game racked up development costs totaling 200 million this is not surprising it had to be expensive for two reasons the first reason is that the game contains what amounts to eight different bioware rpgs in one as each class has their own mostly unique grind through the vanilla game and subsequent expansions and secondly aside from being programmed each one of these narratives is scripted and had to be voice acted the old republic holds the guinness world record for the largest entertainment voice over project ever with over 200 000 lines of recorded dialogue so what are the results decent mostly i ve played through three different campaigns since the game originally released in 2011 imperial agent jedi knight sith warrior and the game must be commended for its ability to make each character path feel unique occasionally when there s this much content to parse through there is a natural tendency to create filler content particularly in an mmo which is a genre almost completely designed around creating filler and make no mistake the old republic is no different with the exception that it actually goes through the trouble of voice acting chaff content star wars the old republic a screenshot of star wars the old republic by solaire bro the old republic deserves a lot of praise though in how it buffed its side quests prior to the witcher 3 s release in 2015 most rpgs let alone mmos were manufacturing quests that essentially came down to the same repeated structure go to place a kill thing b and come back with 10 of item c rinse repeat the witcher 3 still did some of that as well it was just more adept at hiding it behind its terrific script which effectively blended the lines between side quest and main quest but the old republic to its credit was trailblazing prior to that each side quest is as stated fully voiced and is realistically tied to your character s main through line considering this game was released in 2011 and an mmo to boot this is incredibly impressive it seems like something the old bioware would do this is why you failbut despite bioware s financial and technical investment the old republic never really gained traction eventually a free to play sub model was implemented in place of a traditional subscription based format and there s probably a ton of reasons for that including the reasons that actually made the game unique the reality is that innovative design doesn t always mean profits or quality a story laden mmo experience that can mostly be played solo is almost completely antithetical to what anyone playing mmos was and is asking for it should have been as obvious in 2011 as it is now especially before investing 200 million to create it the clear question to ask is why didn t bioware just commit to making a regular star wars rpg that was a sequel to kotor 2 instead of this slightly frankenstein d mmo if that is clearly what this game wants to be anyway their holistic approach of trying to create two similar but different entities makes for an extremely well made beautiful mess it never commits to either being a story based rpg or a dungeon crawling gear grinding mmo the game is stuck in purgatory a purgatory that naturally truncates the extent to which the game can succeed basically if you want to play a star wars rpg then why not just play kotor and if you want to just play an mmo then why not just play one this is both so in the eyes of most consumers it s neither it spins its wheels features that are additive to mmo capability distract from the rpg experience or the exact opposite star wars the old republic a screenshot of star wars the old republic by solaire bro for example why are so many people in the game walking around with the same companions that i am the answer is obvious they re playing the same exact game and the same exact story right next to me and there s very little the game can do to disguise it which is a problem because it s trying to be an immersive rpg as much as it is an mmo but there s nothing immersive about waving things like this in the player s face in fact it s distracting but based on the design it s also inescapable you re supposed to be the jedi not just a jedi in two parsecsrushing to the level cap is much quicker and easier than any other mmo i ve played as long as you re willing to pay a sub fee for it otherwise players have the option to simply play for free and accrue all the handicaps one would expect to come with that is it pay to win not exactly it s more like pay to not get bored and quit the added benefit of shortening the grind is that the player can focus more on the content specifically geared toward their character s story rather than be forced to do every menial quest the game might throw at you just because you need the experience points and there s a shockingly large amount of content here the old republic is absolutely packed with quests and side quests so much so that it s hard to imagine a scenario where most gamers won t feel an itch or slap in the face telling them to eventually stop doing it and rush the story or to turn it off but even if you do race to the end the stories are long too roughly 50 hours or so in the main game not counting the expansions and again there are eight of them which means there are hundreds upon hundreds of hours of potential content here which is standard for an mmo that s been out this long but this isn t a standard mmo it s also a solo rpg and a sequel at that conclusionstar wars the old republic is a good mmorpg for star wars fans especially those who were fans of knights of the old republic but it s also a game that comes packed with a detrimental expiration date especially for those not willing to pay the subscription fee because after you have played through a campaign or two you re only really going to still be invested if you re a person that enjoys checking off lists or if you really like star wars or both actually both 6 10 fair
