2018 early access review the first 90 percent of the work takes 90 percent of the time and the last 10 percent takes another 90 percent of the time tynan silvester main developer of this game why did i quote this tynan sure isn t the origin of the 90 90 principle but he did recite it him mentioning this captures the mentality of how this game is developed while the game is more than 90 percent done in its current state the developers are putting in another 90 percent workload to wrap up the last 10 percent i ve seen so many games failing to deliver their promise just because the developers called it done at 90 percent as they experienced getting it to 100 is such a pain this game isn t one of those lot s of thought went into balancing a few alphas back i could create a colony it would reach a stable state and that was more or less it but nowadays threats keep adapting to you and as long as you pick the right difficulty you ll always feel on edge or at least find yourself preparing for the next threats since the laste update there isn t really one strategy that solves all something that is often present in similar games the game encourages you to deploy different strategies to counter different threats if you re colony does reach a really stable state you can go for the endgame building a rocket starting up the engines of the rocket starts an exciting end game sequence the modding support is awesome i ve been modding this game a lot and i experienced first hand how much thought went into making modding convenient if you re a programmer you can truly create anything in this game given that you have time available and even if you re not a lot of things can be achieved by writing simple xml mods this has resulted in a very live and productive modding community once you get bored with vanilla there s a ton of content to explore in the workshop the game runs pretty smooth only if you re going for exceptionally big bases with a lot of colonists you may see low fps but for any regular player this is not an issue also i ve seen the performance making a good leap forward in the last updates there are many other positive points about the game found in other reviews but these were the first things that came into mind some minor cons the threat event variety isn t super high and you ll soon see similar threats events reappearing however this doesn t mean threats are repetitive a lot of different things can go wrong during similar events and a lot of different chains of events can happen also many mods exist to greatly enrich this part of the game some situations require a lot of micromanagement but you can see the developers are putting a lot of effort into improving this and again great mods exist that alleviate this if you really know how the game engine works you can manipulate the game easiliy for instance how severe threats are is determined by you wealth and the amount bad things that recently happened to your pawns amongst some other factors so by artificially keeping your wealth low and ocasionally killing your own poorly talented colonists you can keep the threat level low i personally pretend these mechanics don t exist so i don t keep count of my wealth and i don t sacrifice people this is because i just play for fun and not for winning on some high arbitrary difficulty level some people however care more about winning or simply aren t able to ignore knowledge they have about the game and have the tendency to exploit these mechanics to keep the difficulty artificially low for those people the mechanic isn t perfect but for me personally it s fine so in summary the game is really polished and will even get more so and i can wholeheartedly recommend this game
