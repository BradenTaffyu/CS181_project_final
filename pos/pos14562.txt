2018 rise of the civilization i am going to start with very unpopular but true statement civilization vi with rise and fall dlc is the best entry of the whole series it s engaging beautifully designed and finally has some complex mechanics which are truly shining in mid and late game being sentimental or not civilization vi is an important step in the right direction and i m pretty sure there is more to come this will be a quite long and detailed review still i won t point everything but only the most important things about this game aifirst of all we are talking about sid meier s civilization and let s make it clear ai was never the strongest point of those games yes in this one it had some serious problems at the release but right now it s fine just fine for example playing on king difficulty which is my favorite is quite satisfying ai is not declaring stupid wars and if so it is not sending units to death it s also properly upgrading older units if not prepared we can actually lose some cities why king difficulty this is a 4x strategy game and on higher difficulties ai is simply cheating it s not fun for me if you are complaining about ai in civilization vi then let me remind you that in glorious iv different civilizations were losing to barbarians in turn 2 how stupid was that and civilization v it had many flaws as well not mentioning the fact that the vanilla version was very empty design and visualsi wasn t very happy after seeing early gameplays i didn t like this soft and anime style of the game but i have appreciated it with time whole map units districts cities and finally wonders are all very detailed and they do look great what s more we can turn on day and night cycle and it s actually really cool to see your empire during night optimization is also great at least for me there is no end game lag here whole map has also been changed a bit with rise and fall dlc for example if we are in the dark age everything is a little bit darker and in comparison during golden or heroic ages everything is full of joy and light it s a little thing but as we all know being accurate about those little things is also the difference between being good or great in what you do civilization vi in terms of audio visual performance has plenty of those things sometimes you just sit watch and listen at this point i highly recommend you to search for zulus atomic theme you will thank me later leaders they are fine and personally they were never important for me while looking at whole civilization series we see nations not leaders and yes there are plenty of women as leaders in civilization vi but remember one thing historically they were great complaining about excessive feminism won t change anything and is simply stupid but on the other side we are living in xxi century and people are complaining about everything now returning to the game itself there are many civilizations to choose from and what s the most important you can feel that they are unique in terms of actual gameplay gameplaygoing through all the eras feels smooth like in previous civilization games the music is also changing and we can feel that everything is more modern as the time pass of course it s not perfect at the moment mostly because there are certain techs that can be rushed or strongly focused at so for example we can get late renaissance units while all our opponents are still stick with middle ages knights or even worse to be honest it was always a problem and it s really hard to find a perfect solution here in the end the game is quite fair and sometimes we can be surprised that our enemies have such strong units or technology already you need to make a use of your starting position all resources terrain and special abilities of your civilization all those things make every experience unique and we can all agree that it s the best thing in civilization games scenarios if you like them you will be disappointed because you can get most of them only by buying small dlc packs they are quite original just like in civilization v but there are not too many of them and you can finish most of them in around an hour this aspect is the one that in my opinion should receive a lot of attentions from devs right now i love playing historically accurate scenarios but well i m still waiting for them here of course there is steam workshop integration so you can download a lot of cool stuff scenarios and new civilizations but as we all know it s not the same interesting features and mechanicsobviously i am not going to list everything here yet there are some things that in comparison to other civilization entries changed for good and there are also many new things mostly introduced in rise and fall dlc which are really nice first of all tech and civics trees are both designed in pretty different way making you actually think about them during the game what s more you can boost most of them and you need to know how to do this since they all have special triggers secondly governments are back through the game you are unlocking plenty of policy cards but you can use only some of them thanks to those you can finally customize many things about your policy while building your city you also need to remember that wonders and districts are being built on hex tiles not within the city itself this is important because while you colonize you can t look only after the resources but you need to think about districts and potential places on which you can build important wonders a pleasant strategic element i have seen that people are complaining about districts but in my opinion they are really interesting thanks to them game itself has more depth and some districts like military one can be crucial in defending our empire so you always need to think twice before choosing where to build them same with wonders in civilization vi you can t have all of them like you could in previous one you need to choose carefully which wonder will suit you best in your current playthrough most interesting changes came with rise and fall dlc firstly loyalty system which is nice for players who like to play passively if your citizens are happy you can apply pressure on nearby cities and actually annex them into your empire you also need to think where to start your new cities because otherwise it s easy to lose them during dark age in our empire what s more we have great ages mentioned above and governors while playing the game we earn special points by doing some things like discovering wonders conquering barbarians hiring great people etc if we reach certain amount of them our civilization will be in a golden age which gives us some perks if we won t do anything about this we can end up in dark age which may be actually quite dangerous for us governors are special persons placed in the cities their specialization bonuses are quite strong and setting them in the right city can be crucial for the game on the other side you need to look which governors are used by your opponents all those new things are very interesting and thanks to them mid and late game are both more interesting than they used to be summaryif you are looking for the grand strategy civilization vi is not for you but if you are into 4x strategies that are not only very pleasant to play but have many strategic elements and can be actually hard then this is a must have for you grab it and enjoy your free time while playing there is nothing better than a round of civilization on free sunday or after hard day at work personally i have already played this game for more than 220 hours and i m sure there are many more to come highly recommended to all strategy lovers 9 10
