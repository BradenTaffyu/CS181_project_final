2018 product received for free early access review disclaimer this was written during early access and much has changed since it released but it s still equally if not more incredible than when it was in early access in this darkest dungeon meets hearthstone arena style card game slay the spire exceeds all expectations of a dungeon crawler and the game is still extremely unfinished looking absolutely incredible title despite looking equally as bare boned it speaks volumes when a game has so little visual appeal and can hold my attention for over 6 8 hours without alt tabbing once then realizing i had spent my entire sunday playing a card game of all things says so much about the positive direction this game is going in as someone who hates card games hearthstone being 1 deck metas randomness and is more than frequently destroyed by the unforgiving deity entity known as rngesus slay the spire is one of the most fun card games i have ever played just like darkest dungeon you are thrown into a dungeon with multiple rooms that ultimately leads to the boss at the end as you complete rooms many things can happen both good and bad you can 1 add a random card to your deck out of a small selection of 3 occasionally getting an upgraded card or a rare card after battles typically 2 find a relic that grants some form of perk or debuff or both 3 shop to purchase potions relic s exclusive to the shop colorless cards almost all of which are insanely useful like apotheosis insanely powerful possibly even broken card that upgrades your entire deck for that battle and enlightenment another insanely powerful card that costs nothing to use and reduces all card costs to 1 for that turn 4 encounter an event that has choices that are often risk and or then reward 5 rest 6 encounter elite mobs although there s no guarentee the game will screw you over once in a while with its randomness but even then sometimes it isn t too bad as the excitement of starting over and potentially having a better run than before is enough to tide over the expectation of failure from rng the battle system is essentially like hearthstone where you have x amount of mana energy as it s called in this to cast spells attacks abilities or block but you do not gain energy with passing turns you have to find relics or spells that increase your total energy the game currently only has 2 characters but i m excited to see more and more from this game and hoping it doesn t simply stop at 3 characters and 3 floors this game has an incredible amount of attention and hope to see it ported to handheld just like darkest dungeon would definitely purchase a copy as this game is an amazing time burner
