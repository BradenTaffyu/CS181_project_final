2016 early access review was found by zombies and ran into a random house on the street screaming into the microphone for assistance from friends then proceeded to stay in a dark corner of said random house and cried as i went from sensed to unsensed for the next 10 minutes friends found me but was too frightened to come down until day 3 you could say that i m a wimp gameplayokay okay in all seriousness 7 days to die the survival horde crafting game is a great game that i personally needed time to form an opinion on my friends loved the game from the get go but it took me several play through s to even begin to appreciate the quality of the game at hand you start out in a vast open world where you need to you guessed it survive zombies in hawaii themed shirts are after your delicious brain and the dogs are not your friends i repeat the dogs are not your friends i made the mistake of thinking they were like many other survival games before it your job is to build a suitable enough environment in which you can live out the rest of your post apocalyptic life in i m guessing that is the purpose i ve never really survived that long anyways there are many items at your disposal and the possibilities are endless based off of the discussions in the forums there will be more options in the future which only enhances the quality and price of the game the developers are from the looks of it more than willing to listen to their player base which is definitely a huge plus pros i can pretend i m in the walking dead amazing replayability value here all for a decent 24 99 pricetag offers a cheat mode which of course makes things much easier still provides hours of entertainment very fungame to play with friends i ve already lost so many hours playing this it s ridiculous but clearly not as many hours as many others that just proves how great this game is fun pimps the developer s are amazingly responsive to their fan base they roll out updates in a timely manner and are always working to better their product you can t beat that kind of dedication this game is truly terrifying at times it doesn t have a horror tag but i think it really deserves one then again my threshold for scares is dangerously low this game has been known to terrifying my most manliest of man friends though graphics are great they have improved vastly since it was first released if you can play it on high graphics you will have to restart the game if you change during the middle of your gameplay otherwise you will see chrome neon and black figures instead of a human being etc cons would like to see some improvements to defensive measures items like the spikes prove to be too ineffective at times zombies can glide over sometimes so many optimistaion issues so so many the game has been plagued with lag since the beginning and i hoped that it would ve improved by now but alas it hasn t can there be some achievements and trading cards i know this is not the mark of a true gamer but i truly enjoy this game and would like to have a flashy badge to prove it can there also be some bandits and rivals likewise it would be nice to have other survivors that you can pick up along the way they can either be persuaded to join your group or become enemies am i fangirling over the walking dead too much whoops i ve been playing this game since it was first released from the basic blocks lagfests and terrible graphics to its now far more superior quality and number of improvements while i don t have the hours to prove it since a lot of time was spent offline this is a game that i absolutely adore in the end 7 days to die has a lot to offer and at a more than decent price lives up to expectations with more updates coming along the way and a sufficient player count you honestly can t go wrong with this title overall8 10beware every 7th day you have been warned like my review or have any questions then please consider joining my review group the sonny report i will keep it up to date with the games that i plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions gameplay video if you would like to watch can be found here youtube video views 0 youtube video views 0
