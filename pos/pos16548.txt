2019 early access review 10 10 would recommend this to anyone that likes a good survival challenge 10 10 would buy this game again i greatly enjoy the fact that the game doesn t baby sit you in any way imo truly a open world sandbox type of game i look for with a more than fair amount of interaction with objects and great amount of detail maybe not in graphics but in content for what has been put into the game
