2017 early access review i am speechless i bought this game together with two friends after we ran out of coop games to play and since this game has been on my wishlist forever i decided to go with it it was on sale after all after a 5 5h session on the first sitting we became addicted and i mean really addicted couldn t wait to come home from work and continue to prepare to survive this game is basically a survival bulding game dayz minecraft to be really general you can build and destroy blocks create furniture traps weapons houses etc you can find blueprints and craft even more things there is also a skillsystem in place where you can teach yourself recepies and f ex craft ammunition but most of the time you re just gathering resources to set up a base and not die and of course you alos have to eat drink stay warm and dry and not get sick there are multiple ways to do so and the more you play the more you ll learn pros big world for you to explore either a map or randomly generated lots of stuff to craft and build new enemies with 7 days upgrade your weapon parts and build weapons from scratch change the world the way you want to dig caves live in trees etc play with friends together against or alone a lot of places to discover change upgrade and live in cons it lags when zombies spawn down to 20 30fps you can get stuck underneath the ground when you join a server a few minor glitches not easy to get started you need to read most stuff on the wikiover all i do recommend this game in 3 days i logged 23hours of game time and i do not regret it there s a lot to do a lot to plan and a lot of fun involved you get better quicker and smarter with each day move if you love a scare some pressure crafting harvesting looting creating building and shooting this game is for you
