2021 the game itself is cool i really only play when looking for a more casual play experience best home builder in a sims game so far but in all honesty i can t fully endorse a title that costs over 100 to actually experience in full only purchase this if you already love the sims franchise and even then do it when it s on sale the base game often goes for 5 and that s honestly not terrible for what you get i ve bought two expansions on sale and in total i m out about 20 for this game all in all i m pleased with my experience but i wouldn t recommend paying full price or even getting all the expansions just get ones that fit your desired play style and enjoy a decent and entertaining if a little buggy life sim overall impression 7 10highly recommend waiting for sale
