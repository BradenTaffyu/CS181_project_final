early access review i am just shy of 80hrs played and i ve only owned the game for a little over a week also this is the first game to ever compel me to contribut to the wiki so take that for whatever it may mean anyways having played a lot of farming sims i can confidently say fields of mistria is one of the best on the market even though it s only in ea can t wait to see how the game develops
