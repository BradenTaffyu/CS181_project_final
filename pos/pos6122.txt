beware that this game dlc s cost fortune there are some nitpicks i have with sims 4 mostly about limited plots for houses and some minor botherations like say eco lifestyle s community policies which i am almost sure they were carried over from sims 3 or that i can t adjust lenghts of specific life stage period like say make toddler just take 5 days like in sims 2 aside these i find sims 4 to be fun to play you have more control over various sims unlike in sims 3 where playing more then one family was next to impossible the game is also way less buggy then 3 s were and performance is night and day comparison however character creation sims don t look ugly like in 3 s more leniant gameplay the general details like various mood modifiers this game has these plenty the overall ease of use not restricted to just one family thus bridging gap between gameplay lost of sims 1 and 2 to bridge burner sims 3 i consider 4 s a good step especially now visually sims now can look truly goregous unlike even in sims 2 ah and game doesn t make monsters from townies sims 2 generated aesthetic abominations a lot which was proving difficult if you are for legacy challenge playing no i have no issue that sims 4 isn t continuation of 1 2 and 3 in straight timeline the only proper conclusion to whole plot of sims was exactly like 4 alternate fixed universe to prevent 2 s from happening ps beware that ea app is atrocious worse version of origins and ea likes to break it a lot
