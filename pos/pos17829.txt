always loved mtg and compared to all other ccg s it s quite affordable and easy to get good cards without having to plop down large amounts of money into it just by playing the game you can craft the cards you want need so that you can build decks you actually want to play edit tldr i checked some negative reviews just for the fun of it and to be honest i find it funny how most negative reviews all cry about the same thing calling the game pay to win if you truly are a die hard mtg fan like i am just ignore the salty reviews from people basically being bad and calling it trash most of them only have 10 hours or less put into the game and are crying about losing all the time blaming the shuffle system or whatever else they can come up with to cope there s nothing wrong with the game it has tons of different modes to choose from if anything the only modes missing would be like a 2v2 or 3v3 castle mode the wild card system lets you craft the cards you want need to pickup the game and have a good start there are 2 one time purchases in the shop that amount to a little over 20 to get you started and if you complete your daily quests to gather gold and gems you ll have more than enough cards to craft a decent deck to keep going i made it to diamond rank no problem and was able to build myself 2 decent decks all the while just playing funny part is i didn t even buy the 15 starter purchase i only bought the 5 one i just did that opened my free packs i got from downloading the game also used my free draft tokens that also gives you free packs by the way lol then googled the meta for standard ranked and built a dinosaur deck with cards from lost caverns of ixalan seriously this game is awesome and no i don t work for wizards of the coast i wish i did lol
