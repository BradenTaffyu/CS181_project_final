2021 would i recommend this mmorpg to others yes and no the game is a fantastic story driven mmorpg i enjoyed every moment i spent playing my sith maruder to max level through all expansions deciding who died finding all my companions along the way rebuilding hk 51 which faction to choose at the end plus loads more i will defs comeback in the future to complete other classes main story arcs the game has a very friendly community a huge roleplay community many rp guilds in game is great for people that are more on the casual side of mmorpg as this really focuses on the solo adventure you can do all activities and story with a friend if you so wish you can also return to help friends even if your way further levelled as all planets will scale you to its max level the amount of planets and different environments made every planet feel different and really made it feel like you were exploring a great and vast universe with loads of fantastic looking weapons mounts and armor and that fit in starwars perfectly the main story first 3 chapters kept me so hooked i was putting in some serious hours per day 16 18hours once i finished the main story though and started my expansion journey next thats where everything changed cut scenes become the entire expansion barely any fighting barely any movement just cut scene after cut scene don t get me wrong the story was fantastic but as soon as i started those expansions i started to loose interest compared to the main story the expansions felts dull and boring they felt so linear and just was your generic pick quest up run there do a cut scene run back and do a cut scene now this was a huge disappointment for me as i have being excited to play the eternal empire for so long the cut scenes were fantastic the story was good but the gameplay was terrible to easy could literally just do the boss fights because theres barely anything to fight everything you do fight is not challenging in anyway unless you dont have a understanding of your class which i hope you would by the last few expansions what can i say about the cartel market i dont like it its over priced has inflated the in game currency to a point that new players can probs never buy anything of the trade market without putting months in the game to make the credits you need i asked around in game and i found out from a load of people you can just buy your credits of 3rd party websites i was told you can buy over 1 billion credits for a few dollars compared to the absolute rip off they call a cartel market to many mounts armors etc all in cartel market and more needs to be rewards in game to give incentive for players to play the game cause as the game sits im honestly bored of the game atm as theres nothing for me to grind for besides going to a new character and starting over again which i did with 4 other characters but after completing the first planet for each class they all felt the same just slighlty different quest givers but for the same quests ive already once done i recommend this game for its main story arcs which are fantastic the planets are beautiful and if your a starwars fan you will enjoy at least one play through of this mmorpg overall for me 6 5 10expansions really let this down for me they were to short and to cut scene based for my liking spent more time listening to cutscenes the actually playing and if i wanted to do that i would of just put a movie on the game needs to take a new direction with the next expansion and my score may change but until then this is jsut a okay mmorpg for a at least one time play through atm i got no reason to keep playing ill come back next expansion and play that but it may be a year before i try to level another character to max and do the main story as im just drained and bored of it for nowoh also if your outside the us or eu have fun with terrible connection im from australia i had 250 350 ms constantly
