2016 i picked this up the day after it came out and have been playing it off and on since my new hdd came in so far i m liking what i m seeing please bear in mind this review is coming from someone who came from euro truck simulator 2 and while i ve tried to avoid comparisons between the two they re inevitably going to crop up as i type this i ll divide this into 4 sections the great the good the bad and the ugly the greathere s what i felt was executed masterfully what i feel there s little to no way to improve upon what s already in the game believable damage implementation there s no collision deformation sadly but as your truck becomes damaged more and more things start happening neglect your engine and it ll start to fail mid trip neglect your gearbox and you ll lose the high gears very immersive it s easy to lose yourself in this game put on a radio station or a podcast and relax easy to mod the game makes itself easy to mod and has a large and active modding community as a result if you type in american truck simulator into the search engine of your choice you ll see at least ten websites dedicated to mods trailer parking system gives you a choice in difficulty upon arrival with a load you almost always have a choice in where to park the load with 3 options generally a more difficult one that requires backing up an easier one where you just pull straight in and an option to skip decent trailer variety one of the things i noticed in ets2 was how there was really one major variant to most trailers excluding liveries with most trailers here there s a short variant and a long variant towns on the map actually feel like towns unlike in ets2 there s actually commercial and residential districts in the towns across the map it doesn t just feel like a giant industrial district the goodhere s what i felt was done well but had room for improvement the map is rather detailed you can tell that someone spent a lot of care working with the map and it doesn t feel at all like a bunch of pre fabricated areas cut and pasted together some bits don t make much sense however such as a burger stand without a parking lot or a giant sign advertising a hotel and casino sitting in front of a motel parking lot no casino or hotel in sight scaling feels a bit awkward as well a good example is on the cali 58 southeast of bakersfield where there s four sudden hills one after another fun yes but a bit unrealistically close together weather effects are pretty nice but limited it s mildly disappointing waking up in frisco and not seeing the bay s thick fog over the golden gate bridge or not seeing the wind kick up a dust storm out in the nevada desert sometimes policing system was reworked from ets2 s there s actually patrol cars that ll drive around the roads that act as speed cameras on wheels if you speed near them they ll turn on the lightbar and you ll get a citation you ll see a few parked on the side of the road running radar here and there as well however the amount of police cruisers patrolling the streets is absurd especially on the freeways where you can have three patrol cars one after another they also bear a generic chip livery which is a bit bland the badhere s what i felt rather disappointed by not enough for me to feel a rework is in order but enough for me to want to complain about it the game feels very unfinished when it came time to release there were all of two trucks as of me typing this there are three 2 kenworths and a peterbilt customisation is rather limited and it seems overlooked if you look around in the options you ll find keybindings mentioning beacon lights no such beacons exist yet and in the lighting adjustment you ll find options referencing auxiliary lights which also do not exist yet also at one on off ramp in elko there s redundant traffic signals facing the wrong way on the ramp although several modders have ported in customisation items from ets2 that render most of the previous sentences moot it still feels as if this game is little more than a beta at this stage you ll note i did not mention anything about what states the map does or does not include passing zones on back roads are few and far between seriously there s very few places where you don t have the double yellow line that isn t right before an intersection i m not from california nor nevada but i know that here at least unless you re coming up to a blind hill or corner or an intersection there s a passing zone mildly frustrating when you re behind an underpowered truck doing 20 below at the start of a long straight section the traffic s ai is a bit screwey sometimes they ll wait to signal a turn until they re a car length away they ll pull out in front of you to turn right at some traffic lights especially bad when the speed limit s 55 and my biggest nitpick when they re turning right on green they ll stop at the light pull up a bit stop again then make the turn bad news for a driver not expecting this road signage nitpicks if you re unfamiliar with the roads you re on speed limit changes occur without warning especially in once case a 55 to 25 drop note in the previous example it s fairly obvious the reduction is coming if you look at the gps however 55 to 35 drops are fairly common i don t know if it s done this way in california nevada but down where i m from sudden speed limit changes are announced a ways beforehand with a sign reading reduced speed ahead or a sign with the speed limit on it with an arrow pointing forward think the yield ahead signs in game but with a speed limit sign instead of the yield triangle road work signs are posted a short ways away from the construction site not all of 25 feet before the uglyhere s the thankfully only 1 major things i felt was done horribly weigh stations give little to no warning the major killers here are the two on ih 80 in nevada where the speed limit goes up to 80 and you have a chance to get up to speed here it s rather rare for ai trucks to get going that fast so i m usually in the inside lane overtaking the other trucks the notification is set so close to the weigh station you have 5 and a half seconds at ten under to decide whether you have enough time to get up to speed pass and get into the weigh station or whether you need to brake and drop back try and squeeze into the spot between the truck you re passing and the car behind it and slam on the brakes to make it into the weigh station this isn t an exaggeration either i was in an underpowered kenworth t680 passing a truck with a tipper trailer when i got the notif between truckee and reno and just barely had enough time to brake squeeze between him and the cop behind him and pull into the weigh station if i d have taken a half second longer to react i literally would have missed the off ramp the purpose of coinsurance is not well explained i might have just missed it but all i knew was it would be paid separately said when i bought my truck and that it shows at the bottom of the diagnostics page closing notesall cons aside if you re a diehard fan of ets2 and want to support the company like i did it s worth the twenty bucks if you merely like ets2 i d recommend getting the demo and seeing what ats has to offer before jumping in if you re new to scs stick with ets2 all in all i ll give it a solid b review typed for game version 1 1 1 3s on 2016 02 21 edited 2016 03 03 because i timed the weigh station bit and to remove an erroneous example in the unfinished bullet
