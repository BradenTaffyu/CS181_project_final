2022 i really like this game i love it in fact i ve mentioned before i think that survival is a genre i have an on and off appreciation for as it just depends on how it s done raft absolutely scratches the itches really well and it s one of the very few survival games that i really enjoy playing if there s zero games i feel like for any reason this game is a super easy one to load up you start on a very small platform and you need to hook delicious ocean wastes such as wood leaves and plastic in order to expand the raft and craft crude gear that you need to survive the opening at all like holy when i started playing the game a friend warned me of the beginning half hour being brutal this wasn t exaggerated as when i started on normal i quickly gave up after several new worlds the hunger and thirst meters on normal are so aggressive that easy feels like normal in this case i played my current 75 hours of progress on easy because that actually feels fair hunger and thirst exist but you don t feel like you re constantly babysitting it the gameplay loop works so surprisingly well and it s incredibly addicting to build up your floating fortress i m someone that when passionately invested in making something goes to whatever lengths he can to have fun with it injecting my own humor as i make something i m proud of i m always proud of the raft stuff i m developing the building system is simple but works so well with the snappy grid based system and keep in mind i hate first person base building in 9 out of 10 cases but it works really well and still allows for lots of creative looking rafts my friend has one that looks way better personally but it didn t stop me looking at my own and saying yeah i m super damn happy with what i ve made i m gonna add more i mean you have to contend with bruce in the early game but once you can armour up the perimeter of your raft he just becomes free food the world will randomly spawn in islands as you drift across the ocean with special story islands only starting to spawn once you build and place specific items on your base quite a few of the larger ones can have more resources that are less common but also hostile entities so crafting weapons is a good idea and while the story isn t something i actually care for i ve found the voiced notes entertaining with each island for them having their own tone and they were quite fun to listen to the variety of creatures i get to deal with are quite fun too is the combat hard no it s simple but it works well enough so there s no complaints there another little shoutout to the lesser things such as the really good soundtrack the solid performance the characters maya is too cute not to play as in my opinion and the graphical design being easy going and pretty i still have quite a lot more to do the only reason i haven t played much more is because i ve been playing alone since i have a lot of difficulty maintaining focus and enthusiasm in games like this when i m stuck on my own not being able to bounce off anyone else just means that when i do play raft my play sessions currently are very short because i just can t maintain the concentration it s why my raft is called the sp lonely as f ck oh this is not a negative about the game by the way it s just a me problem and i do need to try multiplayer if anybody i can find is ok to do it with me bottom line is this game is extremely good a wonderful survival game that despite my terrible issue with prolonged focus i do intend on continuing to play be it alone or with a friend that i can drag into doing it please support these guys they ve made a lovely casual friendly survival game
