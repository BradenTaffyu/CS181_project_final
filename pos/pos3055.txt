2021 divinity is an incredible game and regardless of how many times you ve played through it it always manages to bring something new to the table met the spirit of a lumber worker maybe next time a tree will order you to consume his soulthe game s combat system is fantastic in particular i quite like the magic physical armour systems effectively separating fights into two phases beginning with a slugfest and ending in a game of stuns whether it be through knocks freezes or literal stuns y gotta find some way or another to skip enemy turns and avoid getting skipped yourself with skills like first aid or armour of frostof course like anything else it has it s flaws for instance in a normal play through your party member s civil skills are usually going to be persuasion thievery loremaster for me at least and the 4th one doesn t matter much but when playing lone wolf you have to make visits to the mirror every so often to open some random hatch which winds up more tedious than anything elsemoving on from my gripes with civil skills there s something special about the voice acting in this game weirdly i didn t think i cared for it all too much but when i started to mess with mods like happily emmie after the lack of a va started to be far more impactful than expected the narrator stays consistently great throughout the story with a tone that perfectly matches the setting i will also add the voice acting for the act 3 intermission was top notch
