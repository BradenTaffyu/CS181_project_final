early access review overall a pretty fun game free version allows you 1 character slot would be cooler if they allowed 2 or 3 so you don t have to delete your character if you want to try other classes but you can unlock all the character slots for 30 usd which isn t a terrible price game is pretty fun in solos but playing in duos or trios with friends provides a more entertaining experience
