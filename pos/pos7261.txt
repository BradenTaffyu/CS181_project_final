2016 a lovely addition to the truck sim family to follow up euro truck sim 2 which i also thoroughly enjoyed it s great seeing the new game assets that are entirely different to those in ets2 new trucks obviously but also a large range of new vehicles new scenery props new architecture new road designs and some fun things that enhance the ambience like helicopters jets shooting stars and flocking birds there are some new mechanics too including police cars that tag you with flashing lights and sirens when you get a fine for speeding crossing red lights the company extensively researches truck sounds and handling to give you a more genuine experience when driving the trucks and they spend an inordinate amount of time getting the locations looking like their real world counterparts within the limits of the game which is all very nice and you can see side by side comparisons with google street view shots but the main reason i enjoy it is that it s just so damned relaxing if you re looking for a serious hard core driving sim with realistc crash physics go play something else this isn t that game this is a casual game about driving a big truck around taking in the scenery listening to some music and gradually building your trucking empire
