2022 i ve played this game since 2012 and it s the one mmo that i always come back to almost every year hours and hours of amazing star wars story content that can be played single player all the way through if you prefer combat is straightforward and fun and exploration and customization are very enjoyable so impressed that the devs have been keeping it updated and fresh after all this time top 5 favourite games of all time for me and probably controversially my favourite star wars game i love it
