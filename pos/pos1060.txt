early access review took some time to get to it because i wasn t a big fan of the look of the game and i felt like i d get bored quickly the interface looked awful like right clicking a window to open it wtf is it ms paint but i finally gave it a go and all those prejudices vanished in 2h and i got freaking addict you just forget about all those weird things as soon as you start understanding the fundamentals of the game it all makes sense it s all balanced and what doesn t make sense to you most likely has a mod to fix it the dedication of the developers and of the community is beautiful this game is a masterpiece and i m a tough guy to satisfy genuinely it made me re discover the love of videogames i lost 15 years ago while binge playing too much boring and easy game this one is hard and you ll like it hard thanks for this game
