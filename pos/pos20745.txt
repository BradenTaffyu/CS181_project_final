this is the most beautiful game i have ever played i sometimes get lost in the environments turning all the hud icons off just to absorb the intricacies of each detail the muted colours and how they flow the melange of elements that fill the landscape the way the light cascades across the foliage and buildings speaking of buildings the architecture of this game is actually ingenious each hamlet has a homely feel all the houses are perfectly decorated inside and out the npcs do their own thing and make the villages feel alive but aren t too vibrant the stories attached to each hamlet are quaint each quest provides lore on the area s history and there s always hidden mysteries to find the game really captures the remoteness of the scottish highlands the humility of countryside hamlets and the graceful dreariness of the world i can t discuss buildings without the obvious hogwarts it is mesmerising its scale is akin to a whole world i avoid using fast travel between quests because i love finding my way while gazing at the walls and statues walking those hallowed halls and no matter how often i travel to certain areas i still somehow find different paths to traverse there are countless hidden details in hogwarts most of which i still have not come across npcs have various cute little interactions you can just stumble into and you always find characters you ve interacted with just doing their daily chores which i love not many games have their main characters free roaming and living their lives outside of the story there are of course puzzles you solve to earn rewards and all but i find the best reward is just discovering new details i d overlooked i made four separate characters of each house just to explore each dormitory because those especially hold treasures and trinkets worth experiencing first hand the colours of these environments work so well together to create a brooding and natural tone lighting is the pinnacle of this game s visuals i have never seen a game create a realistic mood via lighting in the same way that hogwarts legacy can when you leave a dark and claustrophobic cave to the daylight outside the exit of the cave is almost blindingly bright as your eyes have not accustomed to light yet but when you leave the light tempers with the environment and balances out just as your eyes habituate to the amount of light it s a minor effect that works to engross you in the world that bit more sound design is likewise engrossing your footsteps echo throughout hogwarts stone walls then crunch across the verdant countryside people s voices flutter around you the winds and whistles of the trees surrounds you the aches and creaks of old wooden buildings make you feel part of a lived environment the voice actors do an incredible job at giving each character personality emotion a story a reason to be and your character is a conduit of your own story your own reason you can design them and tell their story however you desire they re a fifth year student with little backstory you fill the blanks this almost makes them feel out of place in this world a lone traveller with little connections before this game begins but that s for you to really decide i love designing characters i love art and storytelling so i love filling in those gaps the game does an excellent job of placing your protagonist in a pre written story then handing you the pen the story of this game while simple is perfectly balanced with the world you just have to let yourself go and forget that this is a game with a beginning middle and ending and honestly it doesn t really have an ending just the beginning to the next chapter which may be soon according to the game developers i loved the stories of each character and how they entangled with the main plot they were well written realistic for a game about fantasy and magic and innately human i also loved that these characters expanded on the world you learn about other schools and institutions of magic outside of hogwarts which gives us an insight into what else there is to explore there are so many possibilities to explore within this revived franchise i hope the developers of hogwarts legacy continue this game s legacy maybe a game set in uagadou or an alternate magic school or even a ministry of magic focused game where your protagonist is an adult and facing the real world consequences either way i would love to see these developers create another environment and story because this game was just beautiful and engrossing i will continue to play this game despite 100 ing everything because there is so much to do outside of what the game tells you
