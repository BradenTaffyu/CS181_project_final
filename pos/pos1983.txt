2023 the first time i played the game was about 9 months after launch when they provided free play up to level 15 or something like that i wanted kotor 3 not an mmo i didn t play mmos but hey it was free so i tried it i loved it so i subscribed mind you i played the game like a single player game for about a year and a half only teaming up for flashpoints with the group finder i mean heck there are 8 stories to play over 3 acts which is quite a lot of content the best of the stories in my opinion are the imperial agent sith inquisitor and jedi knight and act 1 of the smuggler the rest are fun in their own right and worth at least the playthru the game has changed over the years allowing you a lot more flexibility with class skills which is also fun to mix and match i e play smuggler like a bounty hunter etc it s hard to go ftp after subscribing i tried that and it wasn t so much fun instead i took long vacations and paused my subscription until i felt like playing again i do suggest that if you want to play ftp at least buy something small so that you have the benefits of preferred if you like one of the new space races spend the coin on getting them it does enhance play style role playing and character aesthetics if you like the sims get a stronghold but the decorations and the guild bank are kind of out of whack and difficult to get some fun items without cartel coins or millions of credits apparently inflation is a problem in this game just like in real life
