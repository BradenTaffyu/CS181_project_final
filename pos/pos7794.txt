2020 early access review this game is like everyone else has said very demanding on your pc so if you don t at least meet the recommended specs then unfortunately i d say just stick to watching crashboompunk s videos on youtube and you ll get all the satisfying destruction you could want my pc meets the recommended specs and even i have to run the game no higher than medium with some settings on low if i want a consistent frame rate if your pc can run this game and you want a vehicle sim get this game now car tweaking that would please any gear head practically any driving sport you could want can be recreated here drifting hillclimbs rally hajwalah you name it
