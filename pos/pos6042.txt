2020 tl dr game is ok base game wise and has it s own strengths and weaknesses dlc definitely improves it though price is definitely terrible for dlc so wait for sales base game 7 10 game with the 4 mentioned dlc 9 10this game without dlc is meh it s definitely shallow in comparison to sims 3 and it s missing several features that seem vacant for no reason at all an open world being one of these removed features the moodlet system is really nice and it changes up how the game is played overall as now you actually have to play while keeping your sim s emotions in mind the relationships between sims are a bit more dynamic it seems and skills that were once unnecessary are now key to making certain things go as planned like pick up lines and jokes requiring charisma and the new comedy skill more dynamic job systems are definitely welcome some side gigs like writing and such have been reworked and even overhauled in some ways to be ultimately better creating a sim is more dynamic as far as body goes but the clothing options are severely hampered due to the inability to make custom clothing or even hair colors the hair color options are slim so removing the ability to have custom hair colors seems like a bad move in my opinion the ai of sims have somehow both gotten better and worse sims will actually actively take care of themselves better based on what i ve seen but they also make nonsensical choices for seemingly no reason at all for example when instructing my sim to go indoors he picks the longest way to get there sometimes also sometimes sims will have conversations while making food and even though there s an open spot at the table they will actively go to the sofa in the other room thus ending the conversation abruptly aside from these gripes i think the base game is pretty alright also there are no substantial community hangouts on the map at all in the base game only parks which is strange the game itself is just plots to build a house and put sims in as random sims come and go from your house that effectively brought this game down from a good game to an underwhelming meh game immediately this means the only plot worth visiting is your own house then you just hope that sims that have time to talk to you show up they later added more in dlc but this segment is for the base game ultimately it had me on the fence the whole time certainly wait till the base game goes on sale for super cheap once you add dlc though this game ends up becoming great for this segment i have particularly gotten get to work get famous get together and seasons i think these 4 are the quintessential dlc s that you must get when you can these expansions add what the game is missing like the aforementioned local hangout spots which are added in get together the content the expansions add are definitely something worth noting get to work and get together are the ones in my opinon you ought to go for first they add what the game needed for sure such as more interactive jobs and social hang out locations the other two i listed add stuff like a fame system that actually works better than the one in sims 3 and seasons with more holidays than the sims 3 by a landslide you can even make your own holidays however there is one glaring problem with all of the dlc s the price tag these dlc s have no business being priced as much as the game itself none so my advice just like the base game wait for a sale there s even dlc for dlc its kind of absurd looking at the my first pet stuff pack aside from pricing though these dlc s are actually solid and even adds stuff that sims 3 didn t have handled poorly
