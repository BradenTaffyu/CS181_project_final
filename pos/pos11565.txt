2019 early access review one of the don t recommend reviews described this game as something akin to fallout with zombies i think that s a great description and one i cannot imagine being used to denigrate the quality of any game so i ve read a lot of crappy reviews on this game lately and maybe it has lost something in the most recent few updates i wouldn t know because i picked the game up on version alpha 17 4 and i think it s buckets of fun maybe that s because i didn t see all these great features the game used to have but frankly a lot of them sound downright annoying like the skyrim style use based improvement for skills i don t know anyone that actually liked smithing 10 000 iron daggers in skyrim but apparently everyone that did ended up playing this game go figure personally i think the xp skill point based system is great it puts a greater emphasis on looting and collecting resources than making a million stone axes to improve your crafting skill i also think it forces the player to make harder decisions about where to spec rather than just spending all day hunting zombies and all night cooking and crafting there is now an incentive to you know ever leave your base at nighttime a lot of the systems are somewhat clunky and unintuitive there is a bit of a learning curve to getting all the mechanics down crafting systems take getting used to the character menus can be a little weird hitboxes with melee weapons kinda suck sometimes blah blah blah you can pick up the gist of most of the systems in under an hour and it s pretty smooth from there on out you will probably die multiple times on your first horde night i spent my first day 7 running around just trying to make sure i picked up my backpack before i got murked by a swarm of zeds again it wasn t what i d call fun but day 14 saw me with a well stocked ammo cache an iron spike blockade surrounding my base and a trigger finger itching for revenge and that friends was fun very fun the game also has a thriving online community around it especially considering it s an ea game there are tons of servers and a lot of them have kick ass supportive communities with great admin support and world building shout out to afterlife pve check them out if you get a chance i imagine this community is only going to continue to grow as the game fleshes out eventually hitting beta and a full release overall i think this is a very well thought out game i think the devs are making a lot of steps forward in fleshing out the fundamentals of the game right now something that gives me hope this game won t be trapped in early access hell like so many other great games out there i love the scope of the game i think the customization tools are awesome this game is pretty much endlessly tweakable with a minimum amount of effort and i can t wait to see how the game improves going forward as the devs start adding more enemies character models items vehicles whatever i m also excited to see a fully fleshed out world where the devs can start focusing on story i think the white river trading company has a lot of potential
