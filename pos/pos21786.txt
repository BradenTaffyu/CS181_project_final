2016 to preface this i bought and played the japanese version on ps4 to completion already i cleared the game 4 times on 3 different character builds and have invested around 85 hours so far this is my opinions based on that this is honestly my favorite game of all time i love the souls series and with over 1300 hours put into the other 4 games this has instantly become my favorite of them if you take 35 demon s souls 35 dark souls 15 bloodborne and 15 dark souls 2 then combine them into one you will get dark souls 3 starting off what the game takes from demon s souls is the tight sprawling atmospheric level design as well as many other references callbacks and influences from the original dark souls you have incredible bosses music npcs visually stunning vistas and interesting lore this game feels more like a sequel to dark souls 1 than 2 did with direct references to the game as opposed to 2 s way of saying that something happened long ago from bloodborne take the detailed environments visually impressive graphics thanks to a new engine and a dash of enemy and boss designs finally from dark souls 2 take the massive quality of life changes that make the game more accessible in a positive way pros excellent gameplay with a combat feel and speed similar to dark souls 1 and demon s souls tons of content with over 150 different weapons a wide array of armor sets and solid amount of spells extremely detailed and varied world with attention to level design and smart world building like dark souls 2 the game covers a lot of horizontal distance however the world fits together in a way that makes sense the levels are also massive with some single areas taking up as much space as multiple areas from other games there are many paths shortcuts and secrets in these giant levels approachable systems such as a very simple yet deep upgrade system where weapons can be upgraded to 5 or 10 and infused with a element or scaling path similar to dark souls 2 however the paths are much more interesting such as a strength scaling quality scaling luck scaling and many other paths in a very demon s souls y way the return of exclusively using estus to heal no more lifegems or blood vials there is a dark souls 2 system of upgrading the estus however you start with 4 charges instead of 1 divine blessings still exist but are very rare and you can only carry 1 at a time i was personally not disappointed by a single boss area or enemy in the game there was no drop in quality like dark souls 1 lackluster areas like dark souls 2 or annoying tedious grinds like bloodborne there was a smooth difficulty curve that increased as the quality of the areas and bosses did all the way to the end of the game mound makers is one of the coolest covenants in a souls game the way they work is to leave your white sign however when you are summoned you are hostile to the host summoned phantoms invading phantoms and enemies your task is to kill a phantom of any kind so they act as a sort of wild card every encounter i have had with mound makers has been a fun time the matchmaking at least on ps4 has been incredible very similar to the speed of dark souls 2 but with the password system of bloodborne multiplayer with friends is very fast and can be done immedietely after the tutorial boss the pvp also takes a 2 hit combo system from dark souls 2 where it s relatively impossible to get stunlocked to death unless you get ganked backstabs are also a non issue unless possibly the other player has a horrible connection amazing soundtrack one of the best in the series so many good songs however there are a few problems that some may have with the game magic is pretty hard early game other than maybe pyromancy when trying to play a mage you have a lot more stats to focus on and it takes a very deep investment in faith or intelligence for spells to get really strong i played a magic character as one of my characters and i constantly struggled with whether i wanted to upgrade int for better spells damage attunement for more mana and spell slots str dex to get a better backup weapon and health since you start with extremely low health the cast speed also feels really slow and you can t cancel casts with an increase in aggression and low health starting as a spellcaster is very challenging for the first third of the game it is doable however and by the end of the game is very viable and will hit very hard encounters take a very ambush y and gank y approach to them this is not a bad thing for me personally but i know a lot of people dislike this method of approach and there is a lot of it in dark souls 3 with magic being as slow as it is it makes playing a mage even harder than it already was the world is not interconnected like dark souls 1 is there are no inter level shortcuts and areas with multiple entrances and exits this is a non issue for me because the level design was so good that it didn t matter to me however i know that one of the biggest draws for people regarding dark souls 1 was how the world was connected so this will be a negative for a lot of people there is a lack of interesting covenants to take the place of the ratbros or gravelords most of the covenants have a typical function coop invasions or protection of a host area this is a let down as the weirder covenants were some of the more fun covenants that existed this is one of my biggest negatives but also not a big issue in the grand scheme of things there are 2 returning covenants in the game that perform the exact same duties the blue sentinals from dark souls 2 and the blades of the darkmoon from dark souls 1 i really do not see the point in having both of these covenants the way darkmoons should work is to use the eye orb to invade the world of sinners who invade other players and let blue sentinels do the guarding of the way of the blue members this just feels incredibly lazy redundant and a massive oversight into the possibilities of the coolness of the darkmoons probably the most objective negative is with some weapon variety a lot of weapons have copy pasted movesets with only the weapon art to differentiate them and sometimes not even that a lot of weapons are objectively worse than others for this reason boss soul weapons are also disappointingly underwhelming however each weapon class is very fun and different so even if many play the same between weapon classes there is lots of types to play with those cons aside this game is incredible i highly recommend it whether you are a fan of the series or not it takes all the best parts of the other games mixes it into a nice dish and adds its own twist to make it stand above the sum of its parts i was blown away and it surpassed my expectations which were already extremely high i hope that the multiplayer lasts a long time as i will be playing for years to come
