2017 early access review beamng drive gives you the gameplay you want and doesn t force you to do anything that you don t think is fun or interesting this is exactly the reason why i love the game you can do anything you want and you can even customize the car however you want the game also lets you wreck cars in a very satisfactory and relaxing way and there are very little bugs 10 10 would buy again
