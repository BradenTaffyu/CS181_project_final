2023 early access review this game took me by surprise it sat on my wishlist for nearly two years because i thought well it s early access so i ll wait until their committed to a full release full honesty i still don t know if they are or not but what s already here is definitely a full package experience unlike probably most i haven t played factorio or similar games maybe i m shallow but the only reason this game drew my attention at all was because space but man does it work unlike others you get a very significant expansion of scope as your technology and throughput increases your not staring at the same map for hours on end you re building up from a modest corner of the world to a factory hub to suddenly making planet spanning designs to flinging yourself across the solar system then between stars just like how seeing a smaller setup functioning correctly is satisfying seeing the space between planets light up with dozens of hundreds of small lights from ships is just as much satisfying if not more so there s a real sense of exploration albeit on the level of elite dangerous rather than nms but just overall this game went from a game i thought i d only put a couple hours into to completely eating up any free time and thoughts i recommend this game not just to factory builder fans but to problem solving minds in general
