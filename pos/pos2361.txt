2020 fallout 76 is a first person third person mmorpg by bethesda it s an attempt to create a multiplayer fallout in a fallout 4 engine it is set few years after the nuclear bomb drop at release fallout 76 didn t do so well because it has so many bugs and one big thing that really important the absence of human npcs making fallout 76 world the appalachia an empty and boring wasteland it has been updated with few patches and content updates ever since with the big one being the wastelander update that brings the one thing people really want the human npcs gameplayin terms of gameplay fallout 76 is pretty similar with fallout 4 so if you like fallout 4 you ll like fallout 76 many features has been changed or improved in fallout 76 such as survival is now part of the main gameplay instead of difficulty workbench now has multiple function it can craft modify and scrap weapons and armor it can also scrap junk ammo can also be crafted here with the new tinker s workbench but the one features that receive significant changes is settlement building you can still claim settlement and build it like in fallout 4 but they are not persistent once you log out everything you have build will reset along with the server you can however build your own c a m p it s quite similar with settlement building except you can set it up anywhere far away from named locations it has small build area but enough to build house and some farm anything you build in camp is persistent and you can take them server to server player level and perks also changed you still receive a perks points everytime you level up until you re level 50 that s basically the limit although technically you can level up indefinitely after level 50 you stop receiving perks point and everytime you level up you ll get a chance for re spec your build instead perks also works differently in the form of perks card most of the perks is similar with fallout 4 while some are changed to balanced things out being an online mmo the end game of fallout 76 is no really satisfying the most common things to do is get a nuclear code assault a missile silo facility launch a nuke go to the blast zone if the blast zone is the fissure site fight the scorched beast queen and get legendary stuff if the blast zone is not the fissure site farm end game materials for crafting end game stuff repeat nuclear winternuclear winter is another game mode for fallout 76 a battle royale mode with fallout twist currently there are 2 maps well it s basically from the fallout 76 appalachia maps but shrinked for battle royale mode the maps are morgantown and flatwoods it s a decent game mode if you like pvp gameplay works different there you also gain an overseer rank which gives you some rewards everytime you level up i don t play this mode that much since i don t really like pvp graphics and performancegraphically fallout 76 is quite similar with fallout 4 with some updates with the lightning effects and the worldspace now has better color palettes the rest is pretty similar to fallout 4 i don t know about the 16 times the details but it looks quite the same to me performance however is a mixed up bag sometimes it runs smoothly no problem other times it s stutter and feels really not optimized remember boston in fallout 4 something like that i run medium settings and the stutters still there a bit there s also many moments that i called it really bethesda moment such as clipping stuff in the wilderness strange ground textures just ruin a little immersion fallout 1stlike other bethesda mmo games like teso there is a subscription membership for fallout 76 called fallout 1st the current benefit of the subscription is 1 1650 atoms each month it s kinda a good deal because it s cheaper if combined with the other benefit 2 private server i tried it for a while and there are some difference with the public server performance is somewhat better in most cases server will last 20 minutes after you log out from the server so until then everything will stay there your workshop and stuff 3 free ncr ranger outfit and helmet pretty nice if you ask me but since this is a one time benefit i think i prefer a free stuff each month 4 scrapbox for storing scraps you can store unlimited amount of scraps there this is a game changer stuff because unlimited scraps is valuable 5 survival tent you can place anywhere in addition your standard c a m p this is another game changer because you don t have to spend caps anymore to place your c a m p instead place a small tent that already has a bed cooking place stash box and scrapbox so you can store your loot anywhere anytime without a hush 6 i think i get another set of outfit and helmet but forgot the name conclusionright now after the wastelander update i feel like fallout 76 is well kinda good feels like an expansion for fallout 4 it looks similar and familiar with so many new things to discover and bigger world i like it the human npcs are there camp building is nice the event is okay ish the quest is fine yeah fallout 76 could use more updates and content but right now is good i recommend fallout 76 rating 7 10
