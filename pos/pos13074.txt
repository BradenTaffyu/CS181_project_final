2021 this isn t just a great game it s an inspirational game just read the reviews i ve never seen anything like it people have taught their kids students using this game they ve helped themselves understand orbital mechanics while in school studying physics this game has made people change careers to go into aerospace what other game out there can say these things then after you consider all of that go watch the trailer ksp2 and see if you can manage to not tear up i dare you this game doesn t just represent a good time though it s got a lot of that to offer it also represents the next phase of humanity what we reach for and aspire to it shows us who we are as a species and allows you to feel like you re a part of it so buy the game play it a bit or a lot and be inspired yourself
