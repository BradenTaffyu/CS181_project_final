2020 i was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions so i stuck with btd5 instead i haven t played much bloons before other than a lot of btd 3 and 4 back then but man i was missing out the microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be currently having too much fun with this game
