2023 game is bare bones right now for example there is a menu select for the different doctrines to choose from just like coh2 you can choose to take three of them however you only have three right now making the whole selection screen pointless so with that out of the way it is company of heroes and a very fun addition too campaign is good but where it shines is the skirmish multiplayer coop vs ai modes that s what we really want and it came with a map editor custom game join create lobby and steam workshop support for get this mods at launch at launch so yes it is bare bones and the campaign does have the occasional bugs but the game is solid and it is totally worth it it is fun too i love it i just hope it is built up and supported because if it does it has the potential to be the best company of heroes out of the 3 cant wait for the future meanwhile i will indulge in many many games with friends p s i just hope the devs put an xp progression system and rewards like the crates we got in coh2
