2017 early access review when i first saw the game it seemed very simple simple graphics simple concept after looking into it more i decided to try it out and i just can t get enough of this game tl dr version a must buy for those who love colony sims and complex medical mechanics don t let the simple art style scare you off rimworld is a sandbox colony managenet game focussing heavily on survival when you first start you ll be told to choose a scenario this can range from a simple group of tribesman to being a lone explorer with great resources you ll also be capable of generating a random scenario or even creating one allowing you to upload it to the workshop for others to try once done you ll choose an ai director and difficulty difficulty will vary with each choice not only changing the severity of random encounters but even removing or adding new ones depending on what you choose next you have 3 ai directors cassandra classic phoebe chillax and randy random each one has different quirks and could drastically change how things play after choosing your ai and difficulty you ll be able to generate an entire plaent using a seed and adjusting some sliders for rainfall and temperature once generated you ll be shown a planet with varying ecosystems and will be allowed to choose a location to begin your journey in this game when i first saw the map i was confused that i couldn t see the grid like in the past with its map shape it had it wasn t until i zoomed in that i really got hit with how large this planet truly was as this massive planet is made of hexes clicking on one will let you see all information on that location climates temperatures land shape ect after you set your world up it s time to setup your colonists by default depending on the scenario you choose you ll have from around 1 5 colonists all with their own look traits and more for this i would recommend the mod edb prepare carefully as it ll allow full control of colonists adjusting every detail so you could make your own unique group of surviors even going as far as editing their relationships and starting supplies after you ve got everything done you can start your new life on a potenially ruthless planet out for your blood now this may be just because of my option settings but your gonna have to fight for your life alot if not because of raiders and berserk animals it ll be from infections diseases injuries even hypothermia and heatstroke you will need to plan things out and create a colony capable of surving hell itself i can t say much else from here as playthoughs will change drastically from eachother i often find myself dying in horrible and hilarious ways and instead of just giving up i start up a new colony just to see what ll happen to these poor guinea pigs something i got to give ludeon studios props for is the medical system it is amazing how indeph it can be allowing medical treatment to every limb of the body this can lead to big decisions such as needing to remove someones leg to stop an infection you just don t have the man power to deal with another nice touch is you have no restraints of what kind of playstyle you want to pursue want to be a tribe of cannibal nudists that eat their prisoners of war go ahead want to have a mad scientist who harvests organs and makes cyborgs you can do that too i m honestly at a lost for words at the amount of detail that is put into this game i d have to make around a 1 hour video just to cover the majority of these features i can understand some people might be keeping a distance from the game if not for the look of the game then maybe the its price tag and early access stamp to me though this game feels complete i can t even really think what else they could add and optimization is phenomenal i ve had no slow downs and no crashes aside from ones i had because of mods that were not up to date i can t recommend this game more than i already have if you have the money get this game there is a refund system that works if you played 2 hours or less but honestly even at 2 hours you ll either still be learning the ropes or so focussed you won t even notice the time so be warned if you plan to just test the game
