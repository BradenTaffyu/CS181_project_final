2023 i mean i can t speak for others but my nvidia 1050 handles the game just fine without lag on low settings not even the lowest settings just regular low settings game had a lot of improvements compared to cs 1 that we saw in the trailers and i find it annoying that the grid tool doesn t integrate well with already built sections so i found myself manually drawing roads which has some other issues but i am still kinda trying to figure that out since the snap system is different and i like how they added ground water and air pollution so far i ve just been messing around trying to figure out everything by myself as i go but there is a tutorial as well for new players which is more than cs1 had to memory
