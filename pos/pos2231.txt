2021 with almost 500 hours invested in the game i finally feel qualified to give it an unbiased review if you are looking for something new another step above fallout 4 keep looking and keep waiting this is not it everything looks similar to fallout 4 the enemies are similar the weapons are similar the perks are similar in affect this is just an extension of fallout 4 this is one of those games again that steam needs to add a neutral recommendation button the game has it moments it is fun and the community that currently plays the game is helpful rather than hurtful people go out of their way to help lower level players rather than prey on them again it has its moments of fun but overall it is very grindy and repetitive there are only some many times you defend the mama dolce s or the giant teapot there are only so many times you can commune with the wise moth man or kill the sorchbeast queen and that is the main problem with the game bethesda s clientele typically are people that like a good story that grew up reading books in addition to just mashing buttons and that is what fallout 76 lacks there really is nothing to do for the sole survivor there is no real overarching purpose all you do is wander around to collect some junk in order to craft new junk at your shelter it provides some entertainment but after a while just gets boring i am putting it down for now maybe i will look again if i get really bored until then i will find something else i am going to give it a thumbs up but really i would only get it if it is on sale once again don t look for any new eye candy and don t look for ground breaking game play this is nothing but a time killer until new intellectual properties get developed or elder scrolls 6 comes out
