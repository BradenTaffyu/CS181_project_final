2016 fallout 4 review developer bethesda game studiospublisher bethesda softworksgenre open world rpg fps price 59 99played on gtx 650 core i3 1920x1080 res it s the end of the world all over again fallout 4 is an immaculate open world rpg with a colossal amount of content in it the game is filled to the brim with adventure as you explore it s dark and mysterious world you seek out settlements and locations on your map as you go around demolishing anything that stands in the way of the goals you want to achieve and the marks you want to leave on the commonwealth and it s people the game starts off with you your spouse and your infant living in a futuristic house inside of boston with a robot butler this is where you can build your face for your character and their spouse if you choose to do so life seems perfect before a television broadcast alerts of nuclear bombs hitting america destroying everything you sprint off to the vault getting one last look at the outside world before you and your family get locked in the vault frozen for 200 years where you wake up in the year 2277 after waking up you find your son has gone missing and so you are off to escape the vault as the lone survivor of vault 111 what you find is that even after 200 years of being frozen the world is still a nuclear wasteland with people fighting over things like food weapons and other gear alongside that there are also mutated creatures such as 2 headed deers and giant scorpions roaming the apocalyptic wasteland your adventure in the wasteland builds on how you want to play the game you can run around not really following the quests and instead build yourself a huge fort made out of the materials you find from scavenging houses mines bunkers and other places you can be the commonwealth s generic hero by helping out small settlements being attacked by raiders and monsters or you can be the big tough guy who takes everything for himself as far as wasteland creatures go there is a wide variety of them to find from ghouls to super mutants to gigantic crabs the wasteland has it all including legendary enemies which drop rare loot with special attributes whether you choose to fight these creatures head on with your shiny power armour or sneak around each with their own strategic benefits is entirely up to you the main storyline of the game is rather short if you rush through it it will take you around 15 20 hours there are however a lot of side quest lines which can be very long and also rewarding if you go through them in the story there are factions of people which can be joined by the protagonist and build up their trust and respect for you by doing their quests and generally helping out with miscellaneous tasks i did rather enjoy the main story of the game as well as most of sidequests which some people found repetitive the real serious problem i have with this game is that it s lacking that it s lacking that exquisite depth that i felt other rpgs offer the characters in the game were very bland no one seemed to have much of a personality and were just there like robot the limited amount of dialogue options in the game don t help with this as you can make a joke every once in awhile but mostly it is just falls so flat despite that the gameplay is extremely superb the gunplay feels fun and responsive compared to a lot of first person shooters i ve played the enemies feel satisfying to kill using or not using vats the automated agility point based targeting system which is in a few other fallout games adding things like advanced crafting made playing the game almost like a survival first person shooter with rpg elements more than just a plain rpg graphics wise the game doesn t look as great as some other aaa games coming out in 2015 it doesn t look awful but it looks dated which is one of the big things i have to talk about the game s engine the engine for this game is ancient at this point it feels like it also so many things could ve been improved if bethesda pushed it a bit further and brought in a brand new engine for fallout 4 they didn t do so and that s honestly just feels like laziness a lot of things felt like they were dealt with using laziness in the game the building is alright but it honestly feels like something that was crammed into the game to add extra content and is quite glitchy if they would ve used a new engine for the game i m almost certain that it would ve earned a lot more respect and been considered revolutionary like skyrim was but it just isn t why most of this dosen t really bother me is because this is that there are already mods that fix most of my problems and that add more content for the game as always places like nexus provide a large amount of mods for the game to improve it to the player s liking tl dr fallout 4 is a fps with rpg elements and not an insignificant amount of problems there are a lot of things broken with it but the amazing gameplay adventuring and exploring makes it worth your time and very much worth it on sale 8 8 10 for more reviews like this check out my curator page here
