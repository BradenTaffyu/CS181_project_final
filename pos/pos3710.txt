2022 this game is a masterpiece i would 100 recommend it to anyone who can handle the topics the game portrays i absolutely loved this game i cannot believe i didn t hear of this game sooner i found this game randomly scrolling through the steam library thought it looked cool enough to buy and played it completely blind needless to say it was one of the greatest games i ve ever played the world is captivating and beautifully portrays the games topics with art and music that ranges from adorable to horrifying every major character you meet is so well developed that its hard to not love them all even on the fifth or sixth playthrough the combat while not the most challenging out there is still engaging and demands that you build upon your knowledge of the game as you progress and the story is just spectacular i ve never played a game that made me feel as much as this one if you complete this game and don t fall in love with it i would be convinced that you didn t have a heart the one criticism that i can certainly understand is that the game can feel unnecessarily long and certain points in the story while this wasn t an issue for me during my first time playing the game i started to understand this more and more with subsequent playthroughs nevertheless i loved the game so much that i felt compelled to get all of the achievements which by the way you should really do your research on before you attempt bottom line get the game and play it blind it blew my mind and i am certain that it will do the same to you
