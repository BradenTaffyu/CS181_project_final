2017 best racing sim in a long time get that ferrari 458 gt2 dialled in around spa and you ll be grinning from ear to ear get a decent racing wheel and you can feel every little slip of the tyres bump and knock now it s not without it s faults for example there is no rain or wet tracks nor are there night events and the graphics aren t as pollished as some other sim s but once you get used to the awesome physics and feel of the cars it s hard going back to any other racing sim
