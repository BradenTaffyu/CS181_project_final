2018 this game is just amazing if you are thinking of buying this then you should know that even though it s turn based combat it s actually fun because there is just so much that can happen i used to seriously hate the living crap out of turn based combat but this game made it fun for me i still hesitate buying other games with turn based combat but here it s just fun and the game is so much more than just combat there are so many places to explore and there is always something interesting which makes it really fun to explore i am always positively wondering what may await me maybe a nice item gold interesting characters maybe they are trying to trick me and there may be hidden trapdoors or entrances that you can only see if one of your party members have the talent or skill for it and a talent can make you talk to animals which also open up even more story and quests and opportunities and things like this can make the game replayable because there might be things that you haven t experienced yet or maybe you want to play the game with a different build than the first time the ending is pretty bad though compared to the quality of the rest of the game still worth a buy
