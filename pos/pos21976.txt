2022 by far the most fun i ve had with a souls game while the world is a bit more linear than ds1 and ds2 it more than makes up for it with much more fluid gameplay i ve spent so much time playing it in different ways including all normal builds challenge runs like sl1 skills only no healing and magic only and with mods like convergence and even after over 700 hours playing it is still enjoyable to me easily one of my favorite games and i can t recommend it enough
