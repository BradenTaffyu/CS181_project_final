early access review it s ark right up front if you don t have a beefy machine don t bother with this version of the game i have a 3080 play at mid high graphics and get 40 70 fps if you ve played ark this is the same with prettier graphics and some new dinos and an improved but still rudimentary building system if you haven t played ark this is the og survival game tame dinosaurs build dong shaped towers ride dinosaurs lose them to freakish things happening mourn your loss build a memorial tame more dinosaurs it s fun if a little bit grindy compared to some of the popular genre titles that have come since it lacks a strong end game so this is the type of game to take slowly and enjoy today rushing to tomorrow only gets you closer to not playing the game anymore
