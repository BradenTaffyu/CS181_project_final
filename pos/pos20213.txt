i really enjoyed it i loved the characters and the setting it was great to have a crpg in the 40k universe i will say though the ending slides were quite disappointing and some of them straight up felt bad to get you can do everything right for a character complete their quests accept them support them and help them accomplish their goals but that doesn t guarantee they ll get a good ending great game but bad endings and the paths that lead to those endings are not signposted well
