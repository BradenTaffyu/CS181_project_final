early access review great game let s say you work from home let s also say that you want to play games but can t play anything too consuming when it comes to actions needing to be done it s a perfect background game you get to watch your village slowly grow into a strong hold of berries wheat and other resources satisfying gameplay with simple but nice to watch everyday interactions of characters and workers slower paced with enough time to repair or learn by mistakes villages are not failing immediately and sustaining is simple enough with room to learn how to expand village what i m really missing from this game statistics about in game happenings and overview about trades
