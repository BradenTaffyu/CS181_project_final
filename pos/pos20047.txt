2019 one of the best story games ever there is way more better than bethesda could ever do the only damn shame is the meta score if they have given it a 85 or 86 we might have seen another game like this regardless if you love the fallout games or any story game with combat eg bioshock you should own this one if you haven t played any fallout games before it don t worry this game has its own lore maybe few nods to the older fallout games and one more thing get the fallout new vegas ultimate edition trust me the dlcs are worth your while
