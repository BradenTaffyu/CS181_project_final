2016 hands down the best game i ve ever played i almost love it more than i love my family three crippled limbs haven t slept in four days no ammo left and hunted by the legion but atleast my spurs go jingle jangle jingle it s a perfect rpg with a perfect amount of everything you want unlike fallout 4 you actually have more than 4 choices of dialogue and the ability to make up your own story i usually end up using revolvers and repeaters since i m pretty much obsessed with cowboys the amount of really good side quests is incredible some of them are even more interesting than the entire story of fallout 4 although in my opinion it is easier to gain playtime in fallout 4 what about the dlc s the dlc s well they are as amazing as you d expect from obsidian honest hearts my favorite since i love the landscape of utah and the story of the burned man old world blues however made me laugh as much as i have never laughed at a game before lonesome road and dead money they are gold aswell literally the soundtrack is the best ever i ve been listening to the music from day 1 since i got the game and i know the lyrics to most if not all the songs it s quite surprising how you won t get tired of them also mr new vegas it s impossible not to love him 3how about factions do they beat the brotherhood of steel or the institute hell yes any day any time the conflict between the ncr and ceasar s legion is far more interesting and immersive than the bos vs institute thing i m a bit of an ncr patriot myself heheh never been a fan of lynching and burning people alive crashes by the number glitches by the score everyday you love me less each day i love you more let s talk about mods oh lovely mods if you re getting a fallout because of the mods this is the one for you you can and should customize your game entirely using them i m running 100 mods now and it s not even that much the problem is getting the game to work with all of them though it can be pretty frustrating new vegas is nostalgically depressing but it s surprisingly a great feeling so should you put 60 dollars into buying a failed fallout game or spend 20 bucks on one of the best games ever made the choice is up to you i d get this game though edit 1please vote for this game to win the test of time award obsidian deserves it
