2020 i originally was interested in this game because of the fanart and fanwork so to speak and had already been spoiled on the clusterfluck of a story and multiple endings as well as how it ties into the first nier series and in turn drag on dragoon it was 50 off at some point so i decided to show support for the developer for making such a visually exciting character but in playing this game there s much more to it there s simply much more to this game than can be experienced by reading spoilers and looking at artwork the voice acting and even mimicry of human ticks mid conversation the sound track and music scored by a professional music production studio monaca the cinematography and spectacle of cutscenes and boss introductions the way the game s meta settings line up with in game story telling your hud and settings are actually supposed to represent the settings of the android you re controlling the great attention to detail every npc has dialogue every item has a description every weapon has a story in the literal sense that unlocks as you level it up the realistic depictions of characters your main cast aren t just one liners or silent protagonists they have internal dialogue that is not shared with the player but can be inferred from body language an extremely full world of interactables unlike most game s that advertise open world this world really feels fleshed out you may be annoyed by invisible walls here and there but the entire world is chock full of interactables and rewards you for exploring and being curiousbecause of all of the above the world created in this game is incredibly easy to become immersed in this doesn t even being to talk about gameplay of which most story driven narrative games oft fall short if you re complete dogs t at video games like myself you can turn on or off easy mode at any time and simply advance the story like watching a very convoluted mystery action thriller this game would have been good enough if it were just a movie but when they could have just stopped there they decided to slap real and challenging gameplay on top of it as well as vast variety in battle styles this game is amazingly fleshed out and i understand why it had received the goty title for 2017 it s very cliche to say some bull like this is more than a game or this is a piece of art but once in a while a game like this will come and very much deserve those sayings if you ve ever enjoyed fanwork of 2b you owe it to yoko taro and yourself to play this game
