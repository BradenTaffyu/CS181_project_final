2020 on it s own fallout 76 wastelanders is an pretty solid game but it doesn t completely amend the problems that plagued it or subvert the controversy that surrounds it for quite some time now what it does do is provide a path forward that is leading to fallout 76 becoming a genuinely great game and bethesda is finally taking a right path future updates should only make things better and better thumbs up
