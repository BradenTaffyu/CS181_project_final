2019 oxygen not included will fool you no matter how smart you think you are in real life i work on aircraft electronic systems i spend plenty of time in front of complex wiring diagrams and engineering drawings a cutesy little game where a bunch of cartoons jump up and down and clap their hands and squeal while building a space colony pffff how hard could it be 30 hours of gameplay later i am very stupid for the first 10 15 hours of gameplay i spent learning lessons my farm was too big and i ran out of water which led to my duplicants dupes for short getting sick soiling themselves and a life of misery i started over for the next 15 hours after that i restarted repeated small colonies armed with ideas from reddit and youtube on how to streamline systems lay out your base well in advance and improvise when challenges presented themselves finally around the 30 hour mark i decided to really dig my heels in so far my colony has survived past cycle day 100 with clean oxygen aplenty temperature under control yummy food stores bursting at the seams an efficient water recycling system art and cleanliness in every room a thorough hygienic system renewable energy and a small army of skilled dupes who can cover any specialty that my colony may need and still i fear that a single oversight may tip the first domino on my road to ruin improvisation is your best friend learn what to do when you accidentally dig the dirt that held the sand that held your water supply which is now flooding down into your sewage learn how to turn the dreaded carbon dioxide and chlorine into your friend learn how to recover from a nasty infection that sweeps your base or start again with the same battlecry that every player of oxygen not included will utter at some point in their playtime i ll do it right this time
