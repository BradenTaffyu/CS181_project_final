2016 i have been playing this game as much as possible over the last two days because frankly it is the best game i have gotten from steam ever something has happened here which i have never really experienced before aside from this being the first steam review i have written i love this game so much and am so into it that i had to pry myself almost physically force myself away from it just so i could write this review because i believe the developer deserves it that much i first played harvest moon on the snes when i was a boy i had always wanted a hobby farm or to live my life in or around nature and playing that game was a virtual taste of the type of lifestyle i had always wanted to live it was a great game it seemed perfect at the time with me as with most harvest moon fans the love of the game never left me there was always a dream that existed within that made one want to live in the country tend to a farm see green trees and grass every day smell the scents see the beauty of the mountain and the forest but for most people that isn t a reality they are stuck in someplace removed from that idyllic dream now i m grown up and i work with computers and i work in a grey lifeless company not denying that the story for stardew panders to me a bit maybe that s part of the appeal and when i played this game the old feelings of escaping the modern life getting back to nature they were revived i mean we could go into the joy of tending to your farm and the importance of that to one s life and the pain of being removed from it but that s grapes of wrath stuff and delving way too deep into the industrial era psyche let s just say that whatever harvest moon accomplished this man i still am not sure i understand that this is one guy who made this has taken everything that was good and beautiful about harvest moon and added everything that anyone could possibly desire in a new harvest moon and he has created a labour of love a truly beautiful work of art which cannot be denied i have played a lot of games in my life but i am saying this truthfully this is the best game i have ever played 10 10 would play the best game i have ever played in my life again and going back to playing now
