2015 i m a pc gamer since 1994 and right from the beginning i played many racing games microprose f1gp indycar racing nascar titles need for speed and so on some years ago i tried live for speed and was hooked on it for several months i can say that this was my first true simulation experience in that time i played some netkar rfactor f1 and simbin games too from then my wheel and pedals had been quietly standing in a box until i tried out assetto corsa recently which got me instantly hooked i progressed in the career did some hotlapping the sim is amazing then i tried the multiplayer and well i was disappointed in some races i was leading and near the end some wrecker would take me down smiling trying to kick this guys from the server no one votes no one cares no sanctioning whatsoever i saw iracing with a 3 months free promo and just wow this is a completely different story from the start from the behaviour of the car you can notice that it is a simulation and not something made to entertain and when you figure out the way the races are structured the licences the leagues you forget everything else to progress in the sim you have to be safe you don t have to be fast this is a requirement and surely helps teaching new players how to behave in the track you start out in the rookie class and you ll wanna get out of it as soon as possible since this class acts as a filter all the wreckers who wanna win in the first corner are there as soon as you progress to d class the quality of the drivers is noticeable better you can easily achieve this in 1 or 2 days clean racing fairplay this is what separates iracing from the rest the netcode is by far the best i ever tried all the servers belong to iracing so this also helps to deliver the best experience almost without lags and dissapearing cars in relation to pricing i probably end up saving money instead of buying that random steam game that eventually i wouldnt even play the only thing i spend now is on iracing but in the end they deserve every penny because you get quality from the service in any case you don t have to buy anything in the beginning you can progress as you ll like and stay with the included cars and tracks only you ll have plenty of time to decide on which career path you wanna follow open wheel close wheel oval road racing etc this is a simulator that demands true effort but it pays back with the best racing moments you ll ever get from a computer warning expect to be completely addicted and spending much more time that you ve predicted on this game you ve been warned
