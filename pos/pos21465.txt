2021 about reviews how are those checklist format reviews helpful at all i keep seeing more and more of them pop up and they keep getting to the top of store pages as most helpful when they really don t say anything here is an example graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dos gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deaf audience kids teens adults grandma pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second live for grinding story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10based on the information provided can you guess what game this review is for what s it about what kind of game is it point is these reviews are completely interchangeable i bet if you took this exact review and copy and pasted it to every game in your library you d get the top review for half of the games you put it on even if you didn t change the check marks to fit each individual game in my opinion the steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion maybe it s just me and i guess it s not that big a deal but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don t say anything specific about the games in question plus i don t see how they could ever actually influence someone s decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given anyone agree or am i the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games i might be interested in original review why you wont buy this game1 ai is cheating unreasonably fast huge different between highly skilled and above average 2 connection problem connection suddenly broken in the middle of the event also sometime it shows unable to join the session 3 narrow wheel controller angle only have 180degree if ur take it serious go buy other sim why you buy this game1 graphic is great but more hungry than fh4 2 tune car comparing other cars sim racing game not much game can do the paint job and swap part for car 3 good community multiplayer this remind me need for speed world you can roam and randomly race with sb on the map chillhonestly review is very subjective why not try it and refund it or keep it i suggest to watch some gameplay on youtube but not just review nomatter what game ur consideringoverall 90 100 just ignore it
