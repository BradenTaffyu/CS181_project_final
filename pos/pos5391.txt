2018 early access review hello i am a four armed knife fighting centaur mutant and this is my story in the beginning it was all wholesome they needed me to figure out what s eating the watervine and to fetch spare parts for their experiments i usually died but they kept bringing me back i got better i learned the secret way into the girshling lair scores of snapjaws fell beneath my whirring blades i began to get cocky i started walking closer to the slumberlings i experimented with mental mutations and injectors i lost days i d wake up miles underground covered in fungal growths gnawing on worm corpses i met some unsavory people arms traders who were themselves sentient guns i wallowed around in a garbage pit and prayed to a goat god in the jungle i became a fabulously wealthy water merchant i lost it all i gained it back but i had a change of heart and this time i gave it away i cast all my artifacts into the sacred well and let me tell you i am healed i never touch the injectors the teachings of the canticles chromaic saved me and they can save you too live and drink my friend and make your way to the six day stilt 10 10 goty
