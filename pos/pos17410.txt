2021 hello three kingdoms is probably the best of the total war i ve been playing to these since medieval ii and had bought rome i after that but neither rome ii which was my former favorite total war nor the following i did nt get thrones of b opuses did that impression to me i got three kingdoms on january 2020 and the game has hugely evolved since that date it already was a very interesting game which put you in the middle of some of the most legendary figures of ancient china the duel system is quite interesting and tactically useful if you want to fix some general while you fight against his army moreover the profoundly complex system of imperial flavor the diplomatic panel the spying network the microgestion of parameters propers to your faction such as credibility for cao cao etc deepen the consistence of the game transforming it in somewhat of an rpg while the former total war games were more flat there are some problems however for example arrows seem to be made of rubber and you can hardly kill more than 20 people of a unit with only your archers and crossbowmen if they are not of the imperial guard i only play on legendary so i don t know what they do in the other difficulties liu biao and the prince of ru nan sima liang eight princes are quite frustrating and it is merely impossible to win a campaign as them even if there gameplay is interesting jurisdiction government the game should adapt the campaign to these characters and make it easier to get cooperating warlords and to maintain your vassalage while it should be allowed to raise armies on client territory it takes 3 years to go from shandong to sichuan i only tested mandate of heaven and eight princes dlc and if they are not a total innovation they remain part of a game and are not new ones they introduce some interesting features such as the quest to maintain the empire while being liu hong the ling emperor of han the alignment parameter from the eight princes is quite interesting and the sensation to be plunged in another warring period of the chinese ancient history even if related to the former is very amazing some of the characters lack of variation but the differences between the groups of factions yellow turbans warlords governors bandits is enough to give you four great groups of campaigns i don t include the nanman campaign which is a whole new one with new objectives and enjoyable features so you can tell that there are merely eight campaigns in the game playing as dong zhuo the governors the warlords the yellow turbans the bandits the nanman petty kings the ling emperors or the eight princes i haven t tried the 194 and 200 dlc but i think that the stakes are very different for at least cao cao liu bei and yuan shao than whith the 190 campaign i would really like to see one day a xianbei xiongnu and a korean dlc and why not a tibetan one stand alone dlc about the eighteen kingdoms the warring states the sixteen kingdoms northern and southern dynasties five dynasties and ten kingdoms fall of the tang may also be enjoyable even if i understand that sega and the creative assembly have other things to do finally i would say that knowing even a little about the three kingdoms period is crucial to fully enjoy the game i got my older brother to play to it at first he was not interested and playing as cao cao didn t ring any bell for him then i showed him the wikipedia page about the timeline of this period and he began to love his campaign the final step being to read the romance of the three kingdoms good day to you
