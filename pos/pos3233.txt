2021 the quality of this game is astounding the dialogue the tactical combat system the world building and lore the quest diversity the impact of your choices it s honestly the best game i ve ever played i find myself continuously coming back to it to start a new playthrough i find new things to do every time new interactions with npcs new ways to complete quests take all of that and add a strong modding community with new gear skills and entire classes this game is worth any amount they want to charge i strongly suggest trying it
