2021 with 30h i have no idea what i m doing xd but so far i can say i enjoy the game the fact that you need to subscribe to experience full gameplay doesn t bother me as the price of subscription is affordable for me the amount of things you can buy from cartel market could be less but still it s mainly cosmetics so far i ve finished a few planets and met some awesome people who helped me to get a grasp of the game mechanics i say if you do strart this game join a guild they will help you and make it more fun the quests seem interesting though some of them are classic kill that bandit or bring that thing but the majority have interesting story the worlds are colourful and different from each other the music awakens nostalgia for kotor you can do a lot of things solo or together with a friend or guildies if you don t plan to become the best of the best in this game and like me just want to enjoy star wars mmo rpg then i definetely recommend you to try it out you can always start as a free player and then subscribe if you like it you can also stop your subscription any time you want
