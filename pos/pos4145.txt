2019 early access review i love the idea how this game presents itself in a straightforward way the mechanics and gameplay are so easy to understand but a bit harder to master addictive and fun the time i have invested on this game has surpassed from the price i ve paid for get it on full price to support the amazing devs who made this happen and if they ever gonna release this on portable platforms smartphones or nintendo switch i ll consider buying it on day 1
