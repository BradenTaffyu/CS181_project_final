2017 nier automata is my first experience with nier series and i loved is really a amazing rpg gamemy personal opinion pros nice soundtrack the story is very rich and touching the game mechanic is very good you can take control as 2b 9s a2 and have differents points of view what happened with a specific android once you re controlling another android this turn the story very rich self destruct and fan service time maybe a con this is also a bullet hell game sometimes is very hard at least for me i m not good with bullet hell ignorance is a bliss is better end the game in route a and b only if you still want play route c and d maybe you may cry the story is very sad at least for me still is possible buy day one edition not with steam with resellers but for me this is not worth it is only few skins i bought mine with a reseller after promotional event ended and still work the bonuses try with your own risk about the dlc this really worth buy after you battle and win in 3 colosseums in desert zone flooded city forest zone you ll gain accessory also a sexy costume for 2b and you can customize their hair color as well so even you buy you need play until reach a certain point to access dlc after you clear plato s quest you can access the special music video nier automata meets amazarashi deserving of life that is very cool conclusion somehow i feel this game very unique and i recommend to everyone
