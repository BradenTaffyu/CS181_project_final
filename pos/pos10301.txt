2016 early access review seriously awesome this little game even in early access is truly captivating i find myself re starting over and over to see what random things i can encounter this game seems to adapt creatively to whatever it is you try to do and try to opress your motivations creatively it s an amusing game i can t seem to put down example stories 1 built a mountain bunker with only one tiny ingress point made some impressive defenses i pissed off all my neighbors on purpose killed every one that came by eventually one of them sent a large group and half of them came and mined their way into the back of my base in two different spots while a third group setup mortars to destroy me from afar while a few also rushed my front gates that s some impressive and entertaining ai right there i wasn t even mad at losing like 8 hours worth of effort into my community 2 built a cute trading village in the woods pleased all my neighbors the best i could always one pirate group though unfortunately grew lovely crops trading my way up had bionic parts for a few of my sims loving it my two main gunmen were recovering from injury from some raging animals and could not fight only to get raided from enemies barely fought them off with choke points traps and running around the map like an idiot as my base was being destroyed and my two fighters were killed only traders craftsmen left expected to die at the next major raid but that never happened instead some insane storm came and blew all my crops away and since my food storage area fridge was partially destroyed with a collapsed roof from the raid the storm blew away most of the food in storage right as winter approached ran out of food in the dead of winter couldn t afford to buy more via trading as sim after sim died off the others turned into canibals eating the dead one after one after eating human flesh my sims all went mad and then died off some just wandered out into the cold and died some just sat in their room died of hunger one set his room on fire and went up in a blaze i ll add more soon p
