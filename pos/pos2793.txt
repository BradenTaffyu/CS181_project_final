2019 okay let s see you re either a pre made character choose from 6 or a custom character you create each pre made character has a unique story 4 player co op either local or online you can play as an undead show your face at your peril there are various skill lines that you can choose from mix and match to create a beastly build you can kill anyone and everyone and somehow still progress through the game very mod friendly you can bring 1 3 of the pre made characters into your party or solo it either way is viable environmental effects can change a fight very quickly and it s highly recommended to utilize your skills to create them poison fire boom fire water steam lightning electrified steam clouds enemies aren t dumb bricks most of the time and will actually pose quite a challenge by utilizing environmental effects as well synching your skills to devastate enemies feels so satisfying multiple endings alright time for some negatives although the character creation is nice i do wish they had more face options for all the races especially male elves remedied by a mod enemy mages automatically know if you re undead and will heal you to death remedied by a mod potion bottles instantly disappear the moment you drink one which makes recycling them impossible remedied by a mod characters can be a bit sluggish just a bit remedied by a in game mod when you want to create a new character you have to do the tutorial ship level each time it s great the first time not so much after 4 100000 different character rerolls remedied by a mod get this game it s worth the full price
