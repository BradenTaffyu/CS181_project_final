2019 two point hospital is a reboot of the old bullfrog ps game theme hospital as i loved the original i love the new version there are so many little touches that make me smile like the golden toilet the holiday themes the hospital announcer and now the radio dj s just to name a few this game is great for those who like to create their own hospital each level with their own unique challenges and requirements you can control room and hallway additions hiring firing and training of staff research of new and fun diseases like premature mummification what patients get treated first if you like it s a wonderful and fun game that i will play again and again i still have my theme hospital and console and this has most assuredly improved on the original
