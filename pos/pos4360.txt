2020 after 800 hours of this game on steam and another few hundred not on steam i can safely say this is one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played it s kept me entertained since 2013 when i first stumbled upon it with many game changing mods such as prophesy of pendor clash of kings ice and fire and many others constantly keeping me coming back to this game to have a play though in completely different worlds almost entirely different games you just can t get bored of this fantastic game i m playing it for probably the last time now as bannerlord is set to release into ea in just 2 hours warband has been good to me and i pray bannerlord will be just as good if not better it s harvesting season
