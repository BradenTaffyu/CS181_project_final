2021 i love the wasteland setting of the fallout games played every single one of them including brotherhood of steel the top down shooter one where you can be a ghoul in the bos and even the board game and tabletop skirmish game this game is an mmo on a smaller server scale so it gets super grindy like i ve played a lot of mmo s like wow eso coh cov and several others and i would say the grind in this game is on par with other mmo s i suggest not going in expecting to play another fallout 4 or new vegas but keeping in mind you will be playing an mmo group up with the friends or make some new ones and have fun exploring the wasteland when you can then when you re ready get focused on the grind
