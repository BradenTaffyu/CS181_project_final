2019 pros it s a highly addictive and enjoyable game one more turn syndrome is guaranteed the graphics are fantastic the factions are very nicely themed and the unit models look fantastic the variety of units is incredible from chariots to ethereal cavalry to reanimated statues to massive dinosaurs and possessed cannon wielding shipwrecks cons the game is noticeably more dumbed down some would say streamlined than previous total war instalments with its focus shifted to the battles themselves and away from strategic considerations on the campaign map there are no navies siege battles are atrocious and all take place on virtually the same map building selection in settlements requires no thought at all for example the temple building in warhammer 2 which provides untainted or corruption depending on your faction would have broken down into four or five separate choices in rome 2 each providing its own secondary bonuses many diplomacy options from previous titles have also been removed such as region trading and marriage trading because the entire family tree mechanic is also gone my main problem with this game is its ai the campaign ai is so bad that ca imposed an arbitrary financial penalty on the player which escalates with every new army you build this was designed to limit you to a very small number of armies while the ai is given free advantages in every aspect of the game resulting in the ai running around with countless large armies full of elite units and building colossal empires spanning half the map how is the vampire coast for instance supposed to win a long campaign when one victory objective is to destroy the empire and the empire holds 80 100 settlements even in inhospitable climates in real terms this means that you are almost forced to spend every lord s first 10 or so skill points on the blue skill tree for the upkeep reduction bonuses before you can even think about giving them better spells or army wide bonuses another irritating ai quirk is its obsession with unwalled settlements it will determinedly send armies deep into the heart of your territory to target a single settlement that has no walls instead of attacking those of your settlements that are actually on its borders an ai army will run from unwalled settlement to unwalled settlement razing as it goes and always staying just out of reach of your own armies while you besiege its capital elsewhere balance is a difficult one in a fantasy game at high enough levels some legendary lords are hilariously overpowered and can destroy most of an enemy army themselves while consistent with the lore in the warhammer universe it doesn t translate very well to the game in my opinion spells are very powerful which in itself is not a significant problem until the ai crams its entire army into any bottleneck that might exist on a battle map such as the gate on a siege at which point one or two spells will win you the battle overall while i do recommend buying this game on sale be under no illusion that it s technically the best total war game out there because it s not
