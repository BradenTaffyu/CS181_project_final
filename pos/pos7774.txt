2021 early access review i thought now currently at the amount of hours i have in this game would be a good time for my review of beamng drive it is a very good game it has a lot of potential and i am glad something like this game exists in the simulation driving genre the vehicle physics are realistic and on point as well and its amazing how a game like this is able to be made and improved upon as well overtime there is basically endless options and opportunities to choose from from maps to cars and everything in between involving vehicles you surely won t be bored the modding community keeps coming out with and creating many mods for further enjoyment which is a plus as well there are cars and also planes that i personally didn t think would be possible to add into the game there is an in game mod manager which is easy to download and look for mods and also through beam ng s official website there are also other mod websites out there to get mods for this game but a lot of it is poorly created mods stolen and they don t even work well and there are risks of viruses if you don t know what your getting into all in all i would recommend this game and the community seems to really stand behind it even during its current e a stage
