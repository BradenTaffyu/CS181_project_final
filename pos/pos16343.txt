2016 early access review my first 2 hours of gameplay turn on the sauna oven grab a beer and another beer find the carage and the car wreck be flabbergasted by the amount of weird car pieces around the carage and wonder how the hell you can put this puzzle together think f this junk and decide to go buy more beer from the store pick the van break the windshield accidentally with your fist while trying to shift gears and drive it in to the ditch decide to walk back home and notice that the character can t run or sprint get back home eat drink and go to sleep fill the flatbed with firewood and decide to bring them to your neighbour drive the tractor to the woods and die wake up in a cemetary and decide to go to pub get piss drunk urinate on other patrons while giving the middlefinger for the bartender pass out wake up in a sauna realize you are hungry thirsty and all your working vehicles are crashed in the nature and you propably die on thirst or hunger before you can get in to the store somehowno video game ever can get more finnish than this 5 5 game would recommend sure the game has still many flaws but they ll get fixed eventually it s early access afterall
