2018 when i heard my friend bought this game i was like practicing for the future then i bought it at a sale and my opinion immediatly changed on this game it s great fun even though the concept is extremly simple literally you drive across europe hauling cargo it is also very relaxing if you play in the singleplayer and yes there is a multiplayer it s a mod though but it s very easy to install and i definately recommend you the multiplayer if you have friends who will play it with you me and my friends always die laughing while playing the mp my only con would be the pricing of this game 20 for the vanilla game is pretty expensive and some of the dlc can get pretty expensive aswell apart from that i would recommend this game to everyone i know it gets a 9 5 from me p s sorry for any mistakes english is not my first language
