2016 edit have added an update at the end i will start off by saying that i was put off from buying this game for over a year due to a couple of reviews now i appreciate a small of bad shouldnt count considering the amount of blazing reviews it was because all the negative comments all stated somewhere about the cost like most i am not a millionaire and cost is always a factor in my life so i stayed away from iracing i found a promo code giving 3months for 5 so i thought i would give it a go will skip a bit and just start off with addressing the cost moaners if you added up the cost of all the tracks and all the cars then yes its insane money but and here is the buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuttttttttttt in other car racing games you end up liking 2 3 maybe 4 cars more than any the same goes for tracks yeah you know your way around them all but there are a handful you just love and end up sticking to them i never thought i would like oval racing after getting into it and learning a bit more about the race craft i am absoultely hooooked so why buy tracks and cars you dont really like simple if you are a stat glory monkey and want to be the next best f1 racer then you will probably end up spending a lot to get there also if you buy a game from a popular franshise a few years after it was released and want all the downloadable content and mods and addons that have been created since its release it would cost a small fortune but most people play from the start and add it as they go alone a bit a time iracing has been around for a while now and walking late into it there is a lot to catch up on also the amount of work that has gone into creating the tracks is mind boggling there is a youtube video of them scanning the tracks the constant updates support and improvements the devs actually listen and care what the community are asking their net code its bang on i have been racing against people from all over the world and zero issues with connections from anyone there is also sooooo much to learn and do before you even need to think about purchasing extra content there is enough in the starter pack to keep you entertained for a lonnnnng time this is not a game this is a simulator i used to think project cars was the poodles plums it still is in its own right project cars has one foot either side of the arcade real life simulator line but iracing is so far away from the arcade side of the line you cant see the line anymore i have only been signed up for a week on iracing and i can honestly say this sim is mind blowing i can only manage 2 or 3 races an evening the adrenaline mental and physical strain after a 40 lap oval is crazy my first race i was shaking after it so much i couldnt pick up a glass to drink d if you love project cars asset corsa but wish there was a way of policing the idiots that spoil it for everyone else by parking on the apex of a blnd bend ramming into the back of you because they are bored etc etc etc iracing has that yeah there are the occasional ends of a bell but there are things in place to punish and reward bad and good driving its as close as you are ever going to get to real racing while sat in your pants at home if anyone thinks about giving it a go after reading this send me your email address i can invite you and get some in game to put towards cars and tracks editupdate after 2 weeks and 24 something hours play time this game just gets better and better i thought i would end up in road class but i have fallen in love with oval racing even though its baptism by fire and in rookie starting ranks it is total chaos its all about making it to the end of the race rather than coming first once out of rookies it starts getting serious not to mention even more fun in my 30 years of gaming there have only been a couple of games that have got my heart pumping and adrenaline flowing iracing does this every race more than anything else i have played here is a video of my first race where i am in 1st place and fighting for it back for 20 solid laps youtube video iracing charlotte motor speedway oval street stock views 236 this was an intense 20 laps only started iracing a couple of weeks ago prior to this i had zero experience or interest in oval racing
