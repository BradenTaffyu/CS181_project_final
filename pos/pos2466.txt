2020 product received for free i have 1000 hours on this game on bethesda net so i m posting this review out quickly with low hours on steam because i believe i know this game well enough to know what i am talking about first things first the game has horrible optimisation if you have an everlasting erection for smooth framerates look elsewhere if you don t care continue on fallout 76 had a horrible and laughable start with it s early access and launch the clown fiesta continued for a very good while and honestly it was much worse than what elder scrolls online ever could be on launch usually i d bat my eye away thinking the developers would just leave it as abandonware not updating the game and essentially have another anthem to scoff and laugh at and ridicule the high up executives who think the release it now patch it up later business model is remotely any good but just like elder scrolls online and some other games the small team in austin pulled through and stuck with it many bugs were patched the optimisation was improved to a tiny extent but the gameplay still feels marginally far better than what fallout 4 is and certainly feels like it has more progression and certainly looks and feels better than what fallout 4 plays like if it weren t for the awkward optimisation as an mmo it has an end game from a fully functional raid with mechanics and additional difficulties as well as end game worthy upgrades that can be acquired from the scorchbeast queen albeit not much of an engaging fight and i am more curious if other raid like activities will be introduced into the game some builds arguably are busted and should be looked at but there is a large variety of weapons perks armours and enemies that add variety to the game most enjoyable enemies are the cryptids who are visually freaky and can be terrifying at times exploration is absolutely perfect many different areas to visit and many quests and events there are to do to level your character and get into intriguing lore backstory narratives and i do think the lack of a major plotline does work for the game being able to find tid bits of information by searching for it is more fun though this is more of an opinion based point i emplore those who believe the game doesn t have any redeeming qualities to check out this post made by an ex obsidian employee and read it thoroughly those that do own it should try it out
