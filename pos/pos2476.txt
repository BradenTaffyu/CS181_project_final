2020 after 1000 hours on the bethesda launcher i was happy to see i got a free launch from steam along with the other free fallout games pretty sad to see people still mad about its launch but its pretty good right now wastelanders is a good refresh on stuff to do because the main quest lines were shadowed by grinding to get the best gear after all this time playing it gets boring once you have everything you ever wanted and get only pennies and junk from these quests so taking away vault raids was a mistake more stash space easier fast traveling without bugs or glitches and crashes and this game could be spotless edit steam awards requirement still a good game and free battle pass style rewards with missions that take only around 20 minutes a day to complete
