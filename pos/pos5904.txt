2020 early access review the singleplayer is a straight upgrade from warband less tedious less annoying more variety larger map larger battles better diplomacy better everything else if you buy m b for singleplayer it s ready to play right now i haven t noticed any missing features in about 8 hours of singleplayer playtime cannot wait for mods to make it even better the multiplayer as of early access launch march 31st 2020 is well a clusterf the matchmaking will throw you into a game and crash for no apparently reason 50 of the time for some reason they decided that the large battle mode from warband wasn t good so they replaced it with 6v6 tactical battles which feel bad i guess they re trying to make it esports idk compared to the 40v40 one life per round battles in warband it sucks the siege mode is better than warband not that that s particularly difficult warband s siege mode was a joke haven t had the chance to try commander mode yet it s probably just as good as it was in fire sword some of the weapons in multiplayer are op especially the polearm the empire gets it starts with an m basically one shots all but the tankiest people and has insane reach and is by no means slow i tried getting one in singleplayer and it was painfully slow nigh unusable as anything but a cavalry spear yet in multiplayer you scythe through people like wheat i wonder if they plan on balancing i m not holding my breath i pray that a c rpg type mod comes out and they can fix vanilla s balance just like they did in warband
