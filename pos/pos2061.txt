2020 althought i hardly have any hours for swtor on steam i am a founder of the game and have pre ordered the game i also have the collector s edition box if that makes it any more apparent although i was extremely excited for a star wars mmorpg the game fell flat when it launched it was crazy boring and unfun and i hardly played a week before quitting for years i recently came back in the summer of 2019 due to the hype of the mandalorian show and fell in love with the game i re created a jedi knight sentinel and loved the storyline of the class all the way to lvl 70 at the time i was shocked to see the amount of end game content playable too such as uprisings flashpoints and operations as well as pvp that had very quick queue times i quickly learned how to set up my class rotation and bis gear list with stat priorities it feels like a complete mmorpg now compared to when i played it years ago on launch while i love swtor now there s still some cons to the game that can turn people away i ll make a list like i usually do with mmorpgs so newer or returning players can get a grasp as to what swtor offers pros best story i ve played in an mmorpgplayer choicefun and interactive combatcool customization and cosmetics armor dyes easy to play solocompanionsdiverse story per classdetailed worlds to fit the movies tv showshours of contentswtor has byfar the best story i ve ever played in an mmorpg it honestly feels like a well built single player story game similar to mass effect or any bethesda game your player character gets choices ranging from light side romantic to dark side dialogue options which can change the direction of the entire storyline i played a light side jedi knight that had to make some small dark side choices for the greater good and loved how hard some of the story choices were i fell in love with the story and characters such as kira carsen lana beniko and valkorian the combat of swtor is your typical mmorpg tab target combat but the animations flow nicely and it feels fun and clean unlike some mmorpgs like lotro that have slower combat swtor has tons of races to choose from as well as different body types to fit your ideal character there s also hundreds of cosmetic armors as well as stat armors to equip cosmetically that can help you design your character the way you want swtor also has an armor dyeing system similar to lotro to help add more personality to your character swtor also has a unique feature not found in almost all mmorpgs i ve played which is the companion system depending on your class and faction you find companions across the galaxy that will aid your character in the story these companions also have a unique story that changes depending on your light dark side dialogue with them this gives the player so much player choice so you can play how you want swtor does an amazing job at showing planets and locations you ve seen or read about while also making it new due to swtor being thousands of years before the phantom menace so you can still visit your favorite planets while being shocked at the newness of them cons story feels very singleplayerrepetitive contentlack of new frequent contentdecent server optimizationwhile i love a lot about the story of swtor it doesn t really fit into an mmorpg setting it feels more like kotor 3 due to how your character is extremely important to the lore and that every other jedi knight will be a special snowflake along with the other classes the content also gets very repetitive while i love all of the pve content you can only do it so many times once the rewards are no longer worth running for swtor also has a decent release span of content due to the smaller dev team and due to coronavirus the next big story patch got delayed from spring to the holiday season of 2020 which is a huge gap of no new story for players and while i can understand that they delayed the content for safety reasons i wish they released more content other than reoccurring events between this gap to keep players happy and content swtor is also not the best running mmorpg on the market while it s hard to compare swtor s server stability to the beast of an mmorpg known as wow the game isn t perfect it runs on a 32 bit client and even the best of computers get some fps drops in areas that they shouldn t the game s sub model and in game store when people see that an mmorpg other than wow has a sub model they are skeptical and they have a right to be but swtor has one of the best sub models i ve ever seen if you subscribe once you unlock all story content and all expansions permanently that means you can sub once and have all the current expansions forever until a new expac comes out then you ll need to sub again the subscription model also adds some bonuses like monthly in game store coins removal of gold cap and much more benefits that don t break gameplay the in game store is pretty fair too all items bought on the store can be sold to players on the auction house for credits meaning if you don t want to spend 10 for a badass armor set you can save your credits and buy it off the gtn auction house for a decent price this game has the most fair model i ve ever seen especially for an ea game i think swtor is an amazing mmorpg if you love the star wars lore and universe as well as story in an mmorpg the game offers hundreds of hours of unique story content dungeons and raids and pvp battlegrounds arenas you can make your character look however you want with nothing holding you back to fit your ideal star wars character and while it isn t the best mmorpg on the market it s prob one of my top 10s since it s f2p you can access the content from levels 1 60 completely free which is more than enough for your to decide if you want to subscribe just once to permanently unlock all expansions to progress further sidenote swtor also offers a ton of free rewards for those who use some of these free codes which can
