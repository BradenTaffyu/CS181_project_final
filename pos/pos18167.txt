2023 certainly one of the best indie games of the past few years and perhaps the most original and creative since return of obra dinn at least for me inscryption does exactly what a great indie game should it subverts expectations turns on its head at the most unexpected moments and expands the boundaries of the genre and of video games as a form of art while the game sells itself as a ccg collectible card game in a way it completes the genre and goes beyond it in similar fashion the sopranos had completed and concluded the 50 years of mafia films you don t have to love it but give it a spin nonetheless at least for the sake of being able to say that you ve played it inscryption is certainly worth it
