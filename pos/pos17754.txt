2023 20 1 reasons i like pharaoh 1 it s fun i haven t enjoyed a new total war game this much in years 2 interesting setting that s new to total war and hasn t been explored much in the wider gaming community especially when it comes to military strategy 3 8 unique playable factions each with their own playstyle and roster of faction specific units 4 native recruitment system means you fight different enemies in different places and can incorporate them into your own armies 5 an evolving world where the actions of the player and ai shape the state the world is in prosperity crisis or collapse each have visible and gameplay effects 6 genuine mid and late game threat in the form of the sea peoples 7 battle system that makes weather and terrain important as it can change the face of the battlefield mid battle 8 unit stances that allow for units to have special behaviour and advantages without resorting to magic or superpowers 9 return of generals with bodyguards no more legendary lords soloing whole armies 10 royal court mean that warfare is not confined to the battlefield but involves political manoeuvring and intrigues with different court positions complimenting faction s existing playstyles and opening up new avenues to explore 11 civil wars are not one dimensional affairs but can involve multiple different rival pretenders competing with you for the crown it s even possible for someone else to win without it causing a game over so you then have to decide how to handle the new king or queen while planning for a future civil war if you intend to take the crown for yourself 12 becoming pharaoh or great king provides additional powers but whether you compete for it is a choice not a requirement 13 ancient legacies allow you to choose to follow the path of a historic leader and shape your own legacy and playstyle restoring worship of a heretical god building great monuments creating vast trading empires becoming a great conqueror etc 14 religion system that lets you choose to worship one or more gods in a realistic way each with their own advantages and disadvantages 15 outpost system that situates important buildings outside of settlements offering useful advantages but also being more vulnerable so a small army guerilla warfare resource denial strategy is actually a viable option 16 multiple resource system meaning your economy is more complex than just make lots of money to pay for everything makes settlements have strategic value and gives different factions different economic advantages and disadvantages that can be taken advantage of 17 large in game terms map that s comparable to rome 2 s region count settlements are often spaced further apart creating more opportunities for field battles and the focus on a specific area means that it makes it harder to for example just conquer the whole of egypt in a handful of turns while also making natural features like the nile and mountain ranges far more strategically important 18 numerous campaign battle and ui customisation options meaning you can tailor your game to your own preferences increase or decrease the level of challenge switch off some mechanics if you don t enjoy them while making others more punishing and even use random start positions so you can replay the same faction with a very different starting position 19 fantastic audio with music dialogue and sound effects creating a very atmospheric world generals and individual soldiers will comment on the battlefield and each other and the major figures have both battle and diplomacy dialogue specific to each other such as tausret and seti talking like a married couple or seti telling merneptah you re all talk father if they meet in battle 20 battle maps reflect the setting with certain major settlements like merneptah modern day memphis having unique maps based on the actual layout of the cities in this period 21 like i said it s fun in summary pharaoh is a total war game that sees the return of many elements i ve enjoyed about the series over the years while also introducing new ideas like dynamic weather and terrain outposts and unit stances that i hope will become standard in the series it s a game i m enjoying a lot and look forward to continuing to play for years to come all the best welsh dragon
