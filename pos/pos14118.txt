2020 it is a big time waster of a game in a good way however the game loop while pretty solid is lacking towards the endgame the first few attempts you will lose the first few attempts after that you will be cheated out for some reason and lose the few after that you ll make a lot of progress but you reach the end of the mid game and something just isn t right the game isn t so much fun anymore as it is just chores and that s considering you aren t about to lose due to overheating your base the game isn t difficult just time consuming from this point on the game is great it is a good time waster of a game but in my honest opinion the mods are the only thing keeping me around to play it i m waiting for more updates but it feels like communication between the devs is pretty lacking since release i would hold off until a sale to buy this game but it is still a nice game
