early access review i ve logged 315 hours in beamng drive and it s been a blast i recently upgraded to a logitech g923 wheel shifter and pedal combo and it s taken the game to a whole new level the last 45 5 hours with this setup have been amazing beamng drive is all about realism and immersion playing with a controller was fun but switching to a racing wheel made it feel like a completely different game the force feedback from the logitech g923 is incredible making every drive feel real right now i ve got my setup on my computer desk but i m planning to build a rig with a custom chair to make it even better the shifter and pedals add a level of realism you just can t get with a controller one of the coolest things about beamng drive is the mods the base game is awesome but the mods take it to another level you can add all sorts of cars tracks and scenarios just be careful though some mods can break the game so it s good to keep a backup and keep an eye out for the upcoming career mode it shows up as under construction on the main screen but if you click it it will load so far its pretty fun it looks like it s going to be fantastic addition to the game if you re thinking about getting beamng drive or upgrading to a racing wheel do it the game is already great and with a good wheel setup it s even better perfect for any driving fan or sim racer
