2022 i don t know why people are complaining that this game is back on steam it isn t the games fault or the developers fault that the game left steam in the first place blame ubisoft for being scummy anno 1800 is an exceptional game with unending hours of available play time the game has a way of exhausting you and keeping you up all night at the same time you don t need all the dlcs but the must haves are the ones that add new regions such as land of lions and the passage i would also advise bright harvest for the tractors they make your late game much less stressful seat of power and docklands are useful but i like them more for their looks than anything else all in all 10 10 would recommend don t pay attention to the haters that are directing their hate to the wrong people and not to ubisoft who deserves all the hate they can get
