2023 if you enjoy colony simulators there is none better in my opinion this game is up there with great games such as dwarf fortress maybe even better for you if science fiction is your thing i absolutely love the organic story telling that comes out of circumstances simply from playing the game can be very difficult and there is a hefty learning curve if you aren t familiar with these types of games but if you can overcome that this is a truly addictive and deep experience
