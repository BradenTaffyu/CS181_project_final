2023 the game is great it is the kind of game where i will sit down to play for a bit while i finish my coffee in the morning and then close it frantically when i realize it is dark outside again thankfully the game s addictive nature is tempered by requiring ubisoft connect 50 of the time i have to do a full restart on my pc to get ubisoft connect to launch 100 of the time i have to log back in to my account with two factor authentication cleverly the ubisoft connect remember me and this is a trusted device toggles are non functional i can only assume they did this deliberately to remind that my time would probably be better spent doing laundry or more likely playing something else
