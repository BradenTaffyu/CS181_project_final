2020 this game is something else on the surface you might think it s just x com with an anime skin but once you get a few missions into the story you start getting introduced to system after system of customization each one adding more depth to how you build your characters to be honest in the beginning it s almost too much you feel lost in the interwoven systems but the game starts off slow enough to let you dig in and start to slowly figure things out before it throws more characters and systems at you it s something i haven t encountered in a game before even after 40 hours the game is still introducing new mechanics that are fully fleshed out and i haven t even unlocked beast taming or drone crafting the mastery system is one of the deepest mechanics i have seen in any game and the hidden mastery sets are fun to figure out what parts make sets and they lead to even further customization the developers are constantly updating the game sometimes several times a week fixing bugs adding new masterys and sometimes they will just drop wholly new fully fleshed out mechanics you didn t even know you wanted until you see it these deveopler s love this game and i do too it s a treasure
