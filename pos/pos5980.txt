2021 the sims 3 is also on steam and it s cheaper just something to consider tl dr it s fun enough to be worth getting the base game and some expansions on sale but if you have the willpower it s probably better to be a conscientious objector and not encourage ea s scummy practices by giving them money for this although there are enough sim simps that i doubt your righteous protest will be enough to make a difference in the long run anyway i d recommend this one still if you get it on sale the base game goes on sale for as low as 5 at times and while it s lackluster it s worth at least that much and the 2000 expansion game and stuff packs also get on pretty good deals sometimes even then you ll still feel like you re spending too much money but it won t hurt as much the thing is the game is fun the packs are underdeveloped and overpriced but most of them are still fun in their own ways the devs really knocked it out of the park by making a game that s both so poorly developed that it s infuriating but also still fun enough that you ll be willing to still play it and shell out money for at least some expansions out of the hope that they ll fix the game the dlc model of the game is abysmal so many of the packs are things that should absolutely have been in the base game or at least added as a free update like seasons get together cats dogs and parenthood to name a few like this game is all about interactions and relationships between people they didn t flesh out the parent child aspect of the game enough and they want us to shell out an extra 20 for them to make it marginally better gtfo the game is fun and its vibrant modding community of people that love this game more than the devs makes it better but it s also incredibly disappointing i ve gone back and forth on whether or not to recommend this several times just while writing this review but i guess it s fun enough for it and some of its dlc to be worth it if they re on sale that is
