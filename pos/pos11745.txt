the game is fire highly recommend below are some essential tips for enjoying yourself more as a more casual player for my purposes casual if you often ask yourself what the am i doing if not casual then ignore 0 if any strategy from here or elsewhere is ruining your fun with the game just don t do it you enjoying the game is the most important thing everything else 1 most important at the beginning of the run pick brutality red melee tactics purple ranged or survival green shields utility as your main skill whenever you get an upgrade scroll pick only this color unless the game does not give you the option use a weapon of this color too do not spread your points evenly reason for this by the time you have 15 points your damage is increased by more than 200 the 15 per level stacks if you spread the points evenly you get a lot of health but hit like wet noodle jack of all trades is a master of none in this game anyway 2 custom mode is amazing unlock it an use it the mode lets you choose which items appear in the run for example if i don t like the balanced blade very much i can just disable it for next run and only other items will appear you can disable more items and re enable them before every run you unlock it by finishing the 1st and 2nd stages then go to ramparts then kill a special elite zombie there there is no penalty for this as long as you keep at least 20 items if you have less than 20 you can t get achievements but all other progress is saved 3 ignore the timer completely and fully clear every level kill all enemies get all cells get all gold at least take a look at every free item don t be fooled by the 2 00 door at the first level and similar doors there are no scrolls behind it they are way more important than the loot you get from the door the 30 kills without damage door is reasonable to shoot for though you are much stronger and hit much harder for the entire run if you are full clearing this isn t risk of rain difficulty is the same on the final boss and every level in between whether you are 10 minutes into the run or over an hour you can save and quit in the middle of a run come back any time and pick up exactly where you left off the game autosaves your exact location progress frequently you can literally play for 5 mins and save and quit and come back standing in the same place ok bye
