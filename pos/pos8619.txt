2017 this is hands down the best hunting game that i have ever played actually it s the only hunting and first hunting game that i ve ever tried out unless we count duck hunt if i had to give this a xx 10 rating i d have to say 9 5 out of 10 why not 10 out of 10 here s why cons some of the hud can be very glitchy and clunky it s difficult to scroll down menus and select tabs sometimes the tab is unclickable for a few seconds sometimes menu items appear to scramble lack of firearm variety there are only two shotguns for example addictivepros crisp gameplay mechanics bullet drop bullet penetration bullet expansion hollow point ammo is optional lots of achievments to work towards many missions and side missions to keep you busy does not ever seem to get boring at times i have had 5 10 people watching my stream for most of the day the graphics this game is optimised on a gtx 1060 this game can be 100 maxed out with no lag looks like real life is this a good or a bad thing though rare albino animals a level up system with perks and skillsas i said those cons above are only reason i didn t give this 10 10 some reviews complain that this game is nothing like real life hunting or some such but come on it never could be maybe in 10 years i was afraid to write this for fear it wouldn t come across properly however in the best most exciting way possible this game is incredibly relaxing it s relaxing in the most not boring way possible
