early access review this is how you died these are the very first word you see when you launch a game and these define the very core of the project zomboid experience yes this is a survival game yes you will get good at staying alive eventually you can even live or even thrive but a single mistake can cost you the entire game project zomboid is a game in which you attempt to beat the odds and see how far you can get eventually death is inevitable you try to delay it at most there are multiple ways to play the games in which the gameplay can vastly differ play in a solo casual experience in which after a death you can either start a new character and continue or start over challenge yourself in new and more insane ways either with the game s default challenge options or with a handcrafted pick of multitude of crazy mods making your life all the harder experience cooperation by playing on a closed server with your friends and try to survive or challenge yourselves and finally you can hop on a more open server and experience a ruthless world in which any other player may be your next predator or even your prey and the dead corpses become nothing but a side obstacle the game is extremely customizeable to a point that it is even possible to play project zomboid without any zombies in it and simply experience the realistic management of your character s needs instead or if you are crazy play with an amount of zombies so high the state s population must have been equal to 10 person per bed before the collapse of society handcraft your own experience with the game s base settings mixed along with a group of mods among the thousands available on the steam workshop to get the experience you want and live the perfect story for you where the base game has some flaws i cannot say that these flaws are universal as the game is so extensive and customizeable that eventually you will need to resort to mods if you want the perfect experience for you but with how many options the workshop offers and with how easy this game is to mod and edit to its root there is no real flaw that cannot be fixed one way or another one of the best experience i ever had both alone and with my friends and one of the best tool for youtube videos storytelling i ever saw
