without going into spoilers this game has one of those stories that give you complete closure by the time you finish it unlike so many story games i ve played where a beautiful story has an iffy ending due to an ending that came too suddenly that should ve been fleshed out more omori provides a sense of satisfaction by the time it ends it doesn t go deep into the post game events of the story but it doesn t have to even without descriptions of the future or even extensive epilogue scenes the ending to this game finds a way to leave you completely satisfied without leaving that all too common lingering hole in your heart my jaw has quite literally dropped by itself at certain key moments in the story and i genuinely almost shed a tear the story is extremely mature and beyond fleshed out despite all the questions you will have and all the confusion you will initially experience the story explains everything in the best most intriguing ways if you are a fan of games containing realistic stories that fantastically attach you to the struggles and mental growth of the protagonist this game is a must ps along with the story the gameplay is amazing as well i have 75 hours well spent in this game the quality staying extremely consistent and even improving throughout
