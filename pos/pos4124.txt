2017 product received for free early access review i feel like i need to start this review by stating that i don t normally enjoy rpgs turn based games or deckbuilders i am a total fps fan girl with that being said when asked to review this game my initial thought was alright so i ll stream it for about a half hour people can see what it is about then i can uninstall it and never play it again 30 hours of gameplay 19 achievements unlocked later and i can t put this game down there is this odd hard to explain appeal to it as you progress through the floors and sometimes narrowly escape permadeath the euphoria you feel after slaying a boss with just 1hp left to your name blends perfectly with the fear anxiety as you realize you must face your next challenger with minimal hp to depend on slay the spire s aesthetics help transport you into this magically terrifiying battle the background music is pleasing while not overbearing sometimes you almost forget it is there the character lines are these adorable sound bites that you can t help but begin to anticipate joyfully the art style is beautiful full of understated details i don t want to spoil anything for anyone as discovering just what this game was all about was part of the enjoyment i will say that the developers have done an excellent job at creating something new entertaining this is not the type of game you will play for a bit grow bored of
