2021 if you liked the first one you will probably like this one as well it s more of the same with a few qol improvements as well as quite a few terrible game mechanics the good again more of the same gameplay modifying genetics of dinos no longer changes their star rating and instead is either just cosmetic or increases decreases chances for them to get certain traits dinos incubate in batches that range from 2 10 depending on which dino it is so no more spamming one hatchery full of one species to get that social number up airlift dinos immediately from a hatchery no more little staging area outside of one so you can populate all your exhibits i actually liked the scientist mechanic no longer are they just a number of how many you have but have names talents such as being good at genetics or medicine and traits like reducing costs time of research incubating etc chaos theory this mode is more like a campaign than the actual campaign it functions more like zoo tycoon scenarios in that each map is a fresh start which i like i m sure i wasn t the only one who had nothing to research excavate in the first game once making it to the 3rd of 4th map the bad the terrible status check and constantly refueling your generators until you can upgrade your power system every ten minutes a dino requires one to view basically anything about them you can assign ranger teams to an area but unless you feel like having ranger stations every 20 feet you will never have enough of them certain dino traits some of them cannot be modified out aggressive on carnivores is the big offender here if they aren t the alpha they will start fights with the current one all the time and injure either them self or the other this gets rather costly averaging 100k each time and adds stress to whichever scientist you assign to heal them oh and by all the time i had two carnos which needed each other to satisfy their social who would fight roughly 45 seconds not a joke i timed it after healing bugs i have encountered a few ranging from hilarious to annoying like dinos mysteriously glitching through their fences the star ranking button breaking so i can t click it and my personal favorite ranger teams randomly shooting into the air about 100 feet the campaign is laughably short and functions more like a tutorial i m not even good at the game and managed to beat it in just a couple of hours if you liked finished the first get it if not don t if you haven t played the first get the first one then read this line again also i don t play sandbox so i have no opinion on certain things in that mode being locked behind challenges
