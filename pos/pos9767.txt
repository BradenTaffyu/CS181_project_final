2016 early access review from the very beginning we had a dog his name was jed jed was loyal he followed his daily master retrieved resources and fiercely protected the survivors then came the battle far larger than any previous ones those damned heathen barbarians with their clubs and bows we shot and shot and shot yet still they came until finally our fortifications were overrun one of our number was surrounded with no chance of running jed being the brave companion he was rushed in to rescue the now prone survivor he was a roaring fury of teeth but damn them there were so many and they set upon him with their clubs we covered him as best we could and finally their spirit broke and they fled cowards that they were the man jed had defended was still alive barely next to him lay jed fierce jed whimpering from his wounds we brought him back to the compound not the shed with the animals no he deserved better the doctor treated him as best he could and we went about the necessary tasks of repair an reclaimation the next morning when most of the animals would normally go outside to graze jed was not with them he lay panting on the bed in the room we had constucted just for him in the night his spine crushed from the clubs of the horde he lay there looking up at us with happiness and sorrow he licked our hand when we put our hand on his head covering our eyes we left his room and went to the prison cells the attackers had swarmed in large numbers so naturally our artillery and machine guns had wounded many rather than kill of the initial 7 3 had succumbed to their wounds in the night as we did not have adequate beds for them all as for the remaining 4 we had a decision to make they were murderers all and they had reveled in the blood they had spilled at least while they were free now as we approaced them they were less certain when seeing the hard look in our eyes winter was approaching fast and we were in no mood to share what food we had with their ilk and then there was jed jed who had been with us since our ship had crashed on this forsaken world jed who had done more than one could ever ask of any companion human animal or otherwise jed those prisoners did not survive another night we burned their clothes if one could call such scraps clothing the next morning we came to jed with a special meal his last meal in many heathen cultures among the stars the blood and hearts of one s enemies is thought to give strength to he that consumes them we supposed that is was a fitting end for the ones who had attacked us and broke our community we gave jed his peace that night as he slept and from his pelt our tailor made a coat of insurpassable craftsmanship it now has its own stand in our armory among our other great works a reminder of a warrior a friend a good boy the barbarians now come again and we are waiting 10 10 for jed
