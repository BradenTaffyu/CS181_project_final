2017 early access review the ai will truly make you feel like this is a game of survival this is the sort of game where it s better to take things slow and steady rather than try to save time to new players do yourself a huge favor and read some guides it will save you hours of frustration this game is very unique i have never played anythng like it it s a love hate relationship really it can be great fun but it takes work to get there
