2020 early access review at the moment besides my actual job which is already very time consuming i m taking classes and paying good money for those in order that i can apply for a higher salary job the whole course is 414 hours long and represents a good opportunity to get a better life very well instead of using every second of my free time to study and made a better use of the knowledge i paid to have i decided to buy this game so rather than put another 356 good hours of study i spent most of that time crafting and painting a gigantic regular octahedron with a massive structure around it for the sole purpose of see how my old lap top would render if whole thing colapsed on itself i also built a very nice sort of a yacht and befriended a goat a clucker and a freaking llama 10 10 wasting a better future
