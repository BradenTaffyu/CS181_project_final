2023 i got this game a couple weeks ago and have been playing it nonstop if you re like me and spend hours decorating your house and choosing your outfits in games like the sims or animal crossing then house flipper is perfect for you i generally gravitate toward cozy laid back games that allow me to progress and explore at my own pace and this is definitely one of them house flipper offers dozens of quests that feature many aspects of home renovation such as decorating budgeting and demolition and the game does a great job of guiding new players as you unlock more building modes the more quests you complete the more skill points you acquire which makes flipping your houses much easier in addition to completing quests you can also buy homes to renovate on your own you can keep any house that you buy for yourself or you can sell it to a buyer if the house meets their specifications you ll get a large profit for your hard work most buyer preferences are broad and allow for a lot of artistic freedom giving you the opportunity to customize your homes exactly the way you want one of the best aspects of the game is the relaxed pace there are no time restrictions or penalties so whether you feel like completing quests or flipping houses to sell you ll never feel like you re missing out on anything you can take your time decorating and renovating to your heart s content and earn money at your own pace as much as i enjoy house flipper i do wish there were more quests available after binge playing the game for a few weeks i finished every quest and even flew through the hgtv dlc additionally i would ve liked it if lawn mowing and gardening were available features on the base game instead of being a separate dlc that said i think the game is wonderful overall and most definitely deserves a spot in your cozy game rotation
