2020 early access review great game bad devs the future for this game is uncertain as the devs are locking content behind their patreon and they run the offical discord like a communist politburo innurashi streams occasionally for new players bit eccentric but he s a cool guy if you do intend to buy the game i recommend checking his stream for a idea of what you re getting into folks there are usually kind and welcoming and won t lynch you like the devs did to me when they saw me on a fan discord update devs have shown some effort attempting to right their wrongs looks like this will be a redemption story god bless em leaving the old review here for transparency
