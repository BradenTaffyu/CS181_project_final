2023 early access review if you want realism this game is not for you building a dyson sphere is an impossible task mainly because of the scale but this game handles that surprisingly welllet s take a look at our sun for example the surface area of the sun is about 6x10 18 m squared this means that if we want to build a dyson sphere with a thickness of just 1m entirely covering the sun we will need 6x10 18 6 quintillion m cubed of materials for reference the volume ceres the dwarf planet in the asteroid belt is roughly 0 4x10 18 m cubed so unless we can find 15 dwarf planets made of pure titanium or carbon nano tubes humanity is still far away from building a dyson spherein this game the scale is brought down to manageable levels your local star is no bigger than a planet and the emptiness of space especially interstellar space is remedied by warp travel ultimately this game does a great job of creating the illusion of space being a rich and abundant place to feed your mega factories instead of the vast and empty nothingness that it actually is
