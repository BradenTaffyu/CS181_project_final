2015 early access review i absolutely love this game when i first started playing however i did not i kept hopping in for an hour or so and attempted to play never getting much done this went on for the first 30 40 hours i played the game in theory it seemed like a cool game i would like but i could not get past the learning curve with my limited playtime finally i quit playing an mmo and really sunk my teeth into ksp with the help of scott manley and his amazing tutorials i started to really understand what in the world i was doing after my tutorial spree i spend time playing with different mods and ultimately unlocked the tech tree in science mode then for the first time i played in career mode for me it was a different spin on how i played and it hooked me back in again as of now i can send spacecraft to other planets land on them do some science and return to mother kerbal without killing anyone usually if you think you might like it try the demo watch some of scott manley s tutorials check out the ksp subreddits but most importantly give yourself some time to know what in the hell you are doing
