2017 early access review review absolutely love this game amazing tactical mechanics great storytelling and interesting classes and character customization lots of ways to solve puzzels or escape dangers feedback suggestion i would really like to be able to ping somewhere in the game world or on the minimap as a way to help out multiplayer you have the pin system for the zone map but if we could do smaller temporary local pings that would be super helpfull or have the ability to draw fading lines on the minimap or on the ground great game though
