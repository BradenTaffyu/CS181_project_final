2019 there s a very appealing flow to slay the spire with lots of meaningful decisions and no downtime play card do damage expand your deck as you go and see satisfying combos play out exactly as you imagine although there is a bit of strategy you often get to select one of several cards to add to your deck as a reward the main body of the game is tactical what cards have you got in your hand is anything good left in your deck how best to play these to win each battle it s also a card collecting game for those who don t like building a deck collecting happens from very discrete choices primarily as rewards from combat and adding them to your current deck slay the spire is very tactile with a super satisfying feel of weight associated with playing a card not especially taxing unless you like to over think things so works well as a casual game while evolving enough to keep things interesting there s enough procedural generation to ensure that evey run feels a bit different the main claim of the game however is how nearly all information is completely displayed to the player with very little rng this may sound like a chore in the way that chess can be a chore but it isn t as the decisions are largely all discrete and easily intelligible slay the spire is a classic in every imaginable way comments enabled
