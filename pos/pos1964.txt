2022 reviewing after 200 hours and having 4 level 50 s among other characters pretty fun game glad it s free to play with an optional subscription you can choose to play as the republic or empire the story is amazing if you ve played bioware games before you ll have an idea of what to expect their good at storytelling pretty much all the conversations are voice acted in the main story as well as voice acting in the content has a wide variety of classes 8 origins to choose from and 16 classes in total i ve played most of the classes and can say they did a good job designing them there are some similarities between them mainly the classes that mirror each side for republic or imperials each origin has a different storyline so thats 8 storylins in total there are many flashpoints which are pretty much dungeons to play i won t spoil how many or what they are but there are quite a few which offers alot of replayable content the game also has raids called ops which i have not played yet i haven t played the expansions or gotten past 53 on my characters at the time of this review i heard some of the recent expansions are pretty lack luster short storylines among other things but playing the base game and the first few expansions takes a while and provides much content one perk of subscribing is if you subscribe once you unlock the expansions permanently allowing you to level past 60 all the way to 80 there are slight restrictions when your free to play like not being able to mail credits not being able to use artifact equipment etc but there are work arounds to a couple of these if you spend money once you get preferred player status which gives you alot of character slots and some extra bonuses definetly worth trying out highly recommend it
