2017 stellaris is a pretty awesome game don t get me wrong but before you decide to buy it keep in mind the game is complex in the sense that there are quite a lot of situation quest type things you need to keep track of researching is slow but very rewarding sometimes might feel monotonous there is a lot to stellaris and i doubt i ll ever get to the end of everything popups can make your game both really immersive and really lengthy if you decide to read them finally games are really freaking long there s a lot more to it but those are the things at the top of my head it s up to you if those bits are good or bad
