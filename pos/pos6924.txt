2018 early access review this is a very unique survival game you are stranded in the middle of the ocean trying to survive a castaway lifestyle even though its early access raft is a really enjoyable game that being said raft does focus on being strongly mutiplayer rather than a casual independent game solo playing is not impossible but the game is more fun in a group some of the things i would love if they could add 1 being able to reach the highest islands without a very very tall raft maybe implement the plastic hook to grab the the land and propell upwards 2 add more miscellaneous decorations and objects so that creative mode can be more fun to create in 3 loading your friends world when they are offline especially if your playing together its sucks having to wait for them to decide to come online 4 add more weather changes and biomes and possible a land map and treasure hunts 5 more sea life and sea creatures adding fish underwater with vast reefs would make the game more appealing 6 be able to access storage if someone else is using it aswell it sucks waiting in line 7 add character customize hair color facial features and clothes 8 be able to make mutiple different rafts so that mutiplayers can split off into different teams 9 add some more weapons to kill sharks and seagulls with10 fishing net to collect fish instead of live fishing
