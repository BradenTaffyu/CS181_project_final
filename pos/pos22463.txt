2022 this game started off slow in all honesty atleast until you beat the first 3 bosses which should take like 1 2 hours but this game after that threshold is absolutely amazing the bosses are awesome the level design is awesome the game is just straight up awesome i love this and don t regret buying it one bit i almost like it as much as elden ring but this game definitely has better overall bosses than elden ring and is also in my opinion harder especially the endgame bosses
