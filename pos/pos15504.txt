2023 really good game i find it hilarious how everything goes so smoothly in this game and is quite relaxing to play but in real life whenever i try and fix even the most basic things in my car its nothing but getting really mad at the car swearing and breaking stuff its the complete opposite in the game i would definitely recommend it especially if you want to learn more about how a car works just don t expect things to go so smoothly if you try fixing your own car lol i would also love to see the developers add a chevrolet general motors dlc
