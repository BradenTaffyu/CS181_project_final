2014 this is a game i really enjoyed the various timelines in the bookmarks are respresented mostly accurately and it is a good strategy game you can be ireland spreading the green ness to the entire world or be byzantium and take back all the former roman territories and the mechanics are vastly improved over how they were in eu3 not dumbed down but instead made easier for people to use and for new people to figure out i give this game a 10 10
