2018 what is nier automata this is my favorite game ever like favorite of all time it s just perfect i just cant write a full fledge review because it would be a huge wall of text so i ll give you a summary do you like platinum games do you like games with great story do you like innovative gameplay do you like what is the possible best soundtrack in any game i ve ever seen theres nier automata for you the only flaw in the game i can think of is the difficult which is a bit unbalanced and the a little dated graphics other than that its a game that blew me away in terms of expectations about the game industry itself i never expected to see this type of storytelling in a game that would emotionally affect me the way it did i never expected to get addicted to its soundtrack to the point of hearing it everyday i never expected to love a game s combat mechanics so much which is something i usually have hard time in tons of games i never expected that i would have too much fun on a niche game that i had like zero expectations before playing i just never expected that i would find a game like nier automata or any game close to that its like i found the game of my dreams i always imaginated the perfect game on my thoughts and i never had hope that a game like that would exist and it does and its nier automata in my opinion it s the best game i ve played in my entirely life after ocarina of time and no matter what nothing will come close although i m not replaying it straight away after doing it 3 times already i ll give myself some time before coming back to this one again lets just put it like this just play the game don t waste time buy it right now you have to experience what this amazing game has to offer no matter what taste you have for games it s something that i would recommend to everyone and to end this review ill say it welcome to the taro verse
