2022 dos2 is in my opinion the greatest game of all time it ticks all the boxes for me fun as a single player game fun as a multiplayer game up to 4 seamlessly add remove players during a session brilliant soundtrack a good balance between combat and exploration that keeps the pace dynamic the game turns out wildly different each time i play it so it feels fresh every time endlessly replayable excellent writing interesting character arcs for pcs and npcs a very engaging combat system that gives you control over everything mix and match classes and abilities for tons of interesting builds check out fextralife s build guides armor weapons and items with genuinely interesting and fun abilities so many hidden things to discover can play on most devices great voice acting tactician mode is genuinely tough giving a good challenge for experienced players downsides the learning curve is maybe a bit intimidating it s worth it though trust me in my opinion the last act feels weaker from a story angle than the others until the final scene that puppet fight you ll know the one also make sure your graphics driver is up to date my sister was locked out of the game until she updated her nvidia drivers
