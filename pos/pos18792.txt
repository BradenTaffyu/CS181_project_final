2018 europa universalis iv is the greatest strategy game that i have ever played it s beautiful has a lots of countries to play as and i could play it forever the steam workshop also offers a variety of modifications that make the game more enjoyable game s mechanics are very complex but really easy to learn compared to hoi iv europa has great optimalisation and it never lags after 100 years so you can play even to 1821 without any annoying lags even on gpu s like gtx 760 or 750 ti there is only one problem of this game the dlc s playing eu on vanilla is sometimes really boring and the most of basic mechanics like province upgrading is disabled and they can be only obtained from dlc s furthermore entire dlc collection costs absurdly 200 so you should keep eye on those sales overally the vanilla game is worth it and recommendable only if it s on sale for like 10 and whole dlc bundle is in acceptable price sorry for my borderline retarded english im slavic so please forgive me p
