2023 the game genuinely doesn t deserve a mixed rating if you despised the artillery spam heavy tank spam and always seeing the exact same commander in coh2 you ll have a better time here the game gets updates to its balance more often than most games in similar positions i consider this a significant step up in terms of gameplay from coh2 it combines aspects of coh1 and coh2 while delivering its own on top of it for example it returns to the doctrine style of coh1 as opposed to commander selection and ultra light vehicles light vehicles and light tanks play a much larger role in the mid late game it has less players than coh2 but i wish the coh2 people would give it more of a shot theres a gem here thats far far better than coh2 was in its first year and its going to improve far beyond it
