2022 pros incredible support from the devs with continuing improvements since release they undoubtedly care greatly for their game the core game play is somewhat similar xcom 2 though for more varied and deep character progression is by far the best i have seen in any game i ve played to date period the amount of builds and sheer number of talents you can unlock is staggering makes this nearly limitless as long as you have the patience to acquire them all crafting is useful and a viable alternative to acquiring gear though some of the end game sets are a bit disappointing the artstyle is quite colorful though with a focus on realism and all of the main characters are quite well done though the antagonists are sometimes recycled the soundtrack fits quite well into the game and i never found any of them to be inappropriate for the events or battles that were playing out map design is quite excellent and extremely varied they are not procedurally generated like xcom 2 but that also adds a tremendous amount of style and realism to the maps that would otherwise be lacking due to assets being mashed together randomly by the game if you have a crazy amount of free time replayability is absolutely a thing with this game as with the sheer variety of characters builds skills and difficulty settings makes it highly experimental neutral extremely long game i finished the main story probably around the 250hr mark minus some hours away from the keyboard not really for a casual player whom only has a hour or two a day to play though it does have chapter recaps which goes through the major events of the game and allows you to refresh your memory if you stagger your play time the huge amount of builds and skills can be quite overwhelming for some as you need to do a lot of trial and error to figure out the best builds for each character and also arguably scenarios themselves as some builds will not function as well against certain enemies especially at the higher difficulty levels a lot progression is tied to the story itself so grinding will not make as powerful as it might in other games due to lack of certain masteries to unlock bonus or materials to make gear cons a lot of recycled enemy models this is understandable given it a relatively inexpensive indie game learning curve is arguably quite steep and requires a lot of dedication to figuring the mastery system out no dialogue voice acting this is also understandable given how expensive voice acting is and the sheer amount of it would require due to the huge number of characters would easily price this into the 40s or 50s range alone or even possibly make it an nonviable production translation is probably the weakest aspect of the game while is it done fairly well with the help of the community i can t help but think a lot of the characterization and emotion was lost in the process especially after hearing the battle voices a lot of mission of objectives are repetitive being mostly to just kill everything on the map though in many cases this is not necessary you ll just miss out on possible drops which is one of the best aspects of the game reasons to play great storyline which is told in a mixture of a visual novel and in game cutscenes a bit rough around the edges here and there but it overall a sound experience if you liked the xcom games core loop you ll probably love this game as well as it is superior in almost every way to the unmodded version despite a vastly smaller dev team each map or scenario will take you roughly 15 45m or so depending on the difficulty of the mission itself and the difficulty you re playing on so you can easily take it in chunks at your own pace you are absolutely rewarded for dedicating your time into unlocking the games skill and mastery system as well as rare loot drops from the more powerful enemies as many of their items have unique or signature skills that are useful and powerful if you like having magic martial arts guns and robots mixed into your gaming experience you ve come to the right place and will definitely have a lot of fun with this game
