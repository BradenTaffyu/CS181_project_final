2021 okay lets start with lot s of good and bad the good a well and long developed game with plenty of content and tons of tanks to play a good selection of maps and plenty of nations to try out lots of freebies pr s personal reserves and even event tanks camo and decals etc the bad oh the bad okay let me start off with this i have been playing this game since release 2011 i wasn t part of beta i waited till full release i hate betas too much changes in a full release from the testing phase this game as it is now isn t the game i started playing back then period they have changed every aspect of the game many times over since then you see gold tanks now called premium tanks were sub par to the tech tree tanks which means they were worse than the regular tank of the same tier and same nation gold tanks were to train crews and make you a few extra credits silver doing it period that s it they gave you no advantage other than that now now the premium tanks rule extra armor better this better that you name it so now if you don t buy the newest op over powered premium tank you are going to suffer vs them sound fair okay that s just the tanks ammo when i started gold ammo now premium ammo cost real money like real so it wasn t thrown around often very very rare was the person that used the gold ammo constantly so in ten matches you might run into two of them that someone was slinging gold then came the change you can now buy gold ammo with silver the normal in game money now of course the premium ammo gold ammo cost more than normal ammo but hey everyone can use it now so suddenly armor meant nothing you could have the best armored tank on the game back then a kv 5 but now everyone is slinging premium ammo like no tomorrow so armor suddenly means zip btw the kv 5 had some great armor but the gun was the worst of the tier 8 s in the game of any nation and would only pen the weakest of spots on any enemy tank now my biggest gripe mm match making has changed many times over the years and not once ever for the better the whole concept of a three tier match your tier plus 1 2 tiers above or below you is so out of date with the newer op tanks it isn t funny just as a one off example and there are plenty more you are in your new shiny tiger i a tier 7 tank near as you can get to what the germans had as a best tank for wwii not to mention the lesser used king tiger etc and you hit that big red battle button in your mind you are thinking i finally got some real armor and the battle starts guess what on that other team you are seeing tanks that were pure fantasy or didn t even come out till the 1960 s to 1980 s tier 9 s really a 1940 s tank is supposed to fight a 1980 tank guess what it goes very poorly for the much much older tank sound fair so mm has been broken from almost the start it just has gotten more so over the years the problem with mm isn t just that it also is with how often it seems to place you at the bottom as well in 10 games you are for sure going to see at least 6 8 of them at the bottom tier over time that wears on you hard next is the cars armored cars in real life the armored cars ran away from the tanks in a battle as fast as they could because a single shot would end their life a single shot period not here you can hit a car with a 12 8 cm gun 128 mm full on and get that fateful message we didn t even scratch him or worse critical hit yet he takes no damage and just keeps driving like nothing ever touched him and just for fun the auto aim on the cars hits you no matter what the car is doing turning flying jumping etc sound fair now just a few honorable mentions arty arty is one of the most hated aspects of the game all i can say and i am not an arty player is get over it arty was there before a single tank rolled out on a battlefield period those poor souls that cowered in the trenches or standing in a battle line formation on an open battlefield were no doubt saying the same thing i wish there was no arty guess what they had to deal with it so do you now get over it maps there are plenty of maps some better than others some with good sides and bad sides but it is always random which map and which side you get so it all works out in the end rng now here is a real stickler as a real life shooter i know for a fact if the weapon hasn t been accurized it more than likely isn t going to hit the same place twice in a 6 round shot string now some weapons can of course but they are not common so a mass produced cannon is not going to be a tack driver period at 300 500 yards a man sized target think tank weak spot is harder to hit than you think even more so if it moving up and down hills etc so rng is real live with it toxic players is another thing if you play stupid people are going to call you out on it without a doubt so stay at the lower tiers till you figure things out or you are going to learn a whole lot of new words pay to win well i have explained the whole tank thing so that is a no brainer in it s current state it wasn t before but now yes oh yes it is sad really if you noticed the bad seems for sure to out pace the good yes and no i still play the game so there is something to be said about that in my heart hope wargaming reads these reviews and takes them to heart the game can be fixed and be fun again fix that god awful mm make it one tier up or one tier down or all just a single tier battle the most fun btw one more thing before i run out of space the mid tiers are the most fun right now 4 6 because there at least most players are trying to do better and the op tanks are far and few between so i suggest find a mid tier tank you love easy to get to as well and just enjoy the game don t mindless grind up a tech tree take your time learn as much as you can before going up to that next tier remember it isn t a race so do i say try it yes yes i do don t spend a dime though not at first if you really do enjoy the game go for it after all i did and i am happy i did this game has given me many years of enjoyment as well as heartache we spend money on things that make us happy so that choice is totally up to you not them don t let someone else s negative review sway you it is free to try after all glhf and happy hunting
