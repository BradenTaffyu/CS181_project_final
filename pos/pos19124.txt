2018 this game is way better than fallout 4 i enjoy the leveling system karma system the unique perks choices that matter having your speech skill to a certain level add more dialogue options you can kill anyone you want the list goes on in my eyes this game is the whole package this is a fallout game done right i m giving this a recommended review because this is a great fallout game compared to it s sequel however i keep experiencing frequent crashes i have to save every 20 minutes because i m worried my game will crash at any moment causing me to replay certain events i rather not if i forget to save relying on auto save is a no go because if you enter an area where it s the main reason for your unexpected crash then be ready to reload the last manual save you did an hour ago and re live it again was able to complete the main quest by the way beware the crashes
