2023 this game is an excellent simulator for someone like me who knows nothing about cars not sure how accurate it is but i feel i m learning a lot some of the story missions are interesting it would be nice to get a little message of thanks when you finish a story job though it would be much more immersive and it s nice to be thanked for doing a good job i get really sucked into being the mechanic the only main things i have an issue with are below i m almost max level and getting parts from the junkyard to salvage is just not worth it i recently decided to go to the junkyard and pick up everything i repaired what i could and salvaged the rest it took me nearly 2 hours there needs to be an auto repair or auto salvage at higher levels it s just not worth anyone spending enormous amounts of time on the mini game to save a few credits time is money after all the above leads into the issue with the warehouse what s the point of having it if you can t use anything in there without it being in your inventory at the bare minimum i d like a little icon when installing a part to show if you have one in stock in the back room that way i d use it all the time at the moment i m lugging around 200 parts that i repaired just so i know i have them the dyno doesn t do any explaining on how to use it i ve no idea how to tune a gearbox and i struggle with it from what i ve read elsewhere other people struggle too great for people who know what they re doing not at all intuitive for people who don t which means we just won t use it if you have a race track you need to fix the driving mechanics because they re incredibly clunky i get it s not a racing sim and i respect that because the mechanics side is wildly fun it s just a thought also races would be great if that s an area you would delve into in the future in summary this is an excellent game that i can relax and play for hours on end it just needs a couple of qol tweaks to be perfect 8 10
