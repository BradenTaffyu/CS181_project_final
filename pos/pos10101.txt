2021 unironically what i consider to be the greatest game made in the last few years tynan sylvester has truly captured lightning in a bottle with rimworld some of the most fun i think i ve ever had in video games as someone totally inexperienced with colony simulators rimworld makes it so very easy to just jump into a colony and see how it goes some colonies last a long time some don t but that s all part of the fun on top of an already stellar game from release tynan has provided significant free and paid content updates the royalty dlc adds a lot of content and it seems the upcoming ideology dlc is going to add even more options in how to run and manage your colony if you ve read this far yes the game is incredible and i highly recommend it and you have the modding scene which in itself is probably one of the most active and creative workshop sections on steam there are thousands and thousands of incredible mods that can range from overhauling the entire games storyteller system revamping the entire combat system adding ammunition types different buildings different races animals i think the other reviews here indicate as i hope mine does that if you do not at least try this game you are doing yourself a disservice and potentially missing out on one of the best games in recent years buy the game start the colony struggle persevere overcome fall suffer cannibalize any unfortunate visitors make their skin into dusters and cowboy hats siege enemy civilizations with drop pods the survivors fortunate enough to bring a useful skillset may become slaves or even colonists the unfortunately untalented survivors may simply become meals rule the rimworld ten out of ten a masterpiece
