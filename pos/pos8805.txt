2021 i went in trying to build an enlightened utopia with blood and sweat i built a federation using diplomacy and trade to scramble my way to the top despite warmongers all around me then the unbidden came my territory was overrun defenses were wiped out and my allies began to fracture but i held on planet after planet was wiped out but i held onto my core building up the mother of all fleets i lost upwards of 80 of my territory and my stockpiles of resources were nearly exhausted but i sent forth my fleet in a last glorious charge against inevitability i cut through tens of thousands of unbidden ships fleet after fleet until i arrived at the doorstep of the dimensional portal only to find that a rival empire had claimed a critical star system and closed their borders blocking my path my resources were nearly exhausted and my fleet was months away from crumbling under its own weight so there was no time to find a diplomatic solution i declared war alas the allies in my federation were too cowardly to provoke another power while they were still in the midst of pushing back the unbidden so i had to make a hard decision i left the federation that i had built and given everything to and declared war on my own as my new enemy scrambled and threatened to overrun what little i had left my fleet last hope pushed through the one troublesome system and then to the dimensional portal the genesis of the unbidden threat that had all but destroyed my civilization i gave the order and prayed before i knew it untold thousands of my people were dead floating in foreign space but the portal was destroyed it was over not just the unbidden threat but my empire i had no wealth no territory no federation and my shattered fleet was in no shape to fight a war on its own then i saw it an achievement victorious
