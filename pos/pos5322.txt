2023 product received for free early access review let s think about fantasy for a moment imagination is theoretically limitless there s nothing stopping you from imagining things there are no limits to creativity humanity as a whole has so many cultures and histories and mythologies our world is littered with all sorts of legends and myths and stories and yet when it comes to fantasy people seem to be stuck telling telling the same stories over and over again the magic is gone we ve buried it deep underground we keep telling the same old tales over and over again elves and dragons wise wizards and ancient prophecies fireballs and magic swords caves of qud is a treasure it is fantasy free from all the imaginary walls we ve built around it over the years it is not the deepest or most sophisticated experience but it is the most imaginative you will never forget qud you would never mistake it for anything else because i guarantee you ve seen nothing like it that is enough in my opinion i shouldn t need to say anything else caves of qud should be the norm this is what fantasy should be like this is what games should be like
