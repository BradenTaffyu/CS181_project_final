2023 i bought the game as soon as it came out on steam but i didn t dare to play seeing negative reviews on youtube etc i didn t want to spoil my good impressions of the fallout series after some time in may 2021 i still launched the game and started playing and you know i really liked the game i was pleasantly surprised maybe at the time of release the game was terrible but in the 21st year a lot of things were fixed in the game everything is very easy if in other similar games you have to grind for years to achieve top gear etc but in fallout 76 in a couple of months you can achieve all the heights so to speak for me this game is like a rest after work i go to relax play a little separately you can highlight the community of this game i have never seen better anywhere any question will always be answered and helpful even in the game itself many help beginners of course the game has its problems but in general at the moment the game is very good if you are a lazy person like me then this game is definitely for you the game does not force you to sit and grind in the game 24 hours a day unlike many similar games it would be possible to write about the pros and cons for a very long time but some a positive side for someone can be a negative side and vice versa therefore i recommend trying it yourself
