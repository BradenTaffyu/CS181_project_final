2020 edit finished the game added some info at the end after the tl dra wonderful story of heartbreak and isolation make sure to read the content warnings and don t be afraid to take a break and spend time with someone you love i m not finished yet but it s really engaging for me in terms of the mystery behind these characters who are they and what do they mean to each other what is this fantastical world why can i blow an air horn and make all my friends angry at me the combat is fun but the emotion system is not as in depth as i would have liked you can usually get by with just rushing down your enemies using attacks and a few special moves but the emotions mainly play out as intended during boss fights think of the emotions as a pokemon starter trio happy beats angry angry beats sad sad beats happy and then use the emotions to exploit weaknesses it s fun but the random encounters are too short to use them because both you and the enemy are fairly fragile art and music are fantastic writing is great with a lot of jokes and pretty hard moments to swallow if you liked the roadblocks in earthbound or the ants in mother 3 there are plenty of little jokes about sections of the game that are gated off for progression the looming darkness of the game is present but not so much that you can t enjoy the funny and cute moments it ll show up to remind you that this is not a happy game but usually in short manageable segments jumpscares are in the game but for the most part they didn t get on my nerves too much the first major jumpscare i found involved a door being cracked open just enough to look outside and it really got me and didn t feel cheap or fake overall the game is solid other games in this genre perform better in many regards but omori s particular niche and artstyle is amazing i recommend it for the initial release price of 19 99 but if you re on the fence you can wait for a sale it s not so amazing or important to play as a game like undertale was but i think the developers deserve praise for trying new ideas and doing a decent job at translating them to an original project with great visuals and sound tl dr not the best rpgmaker horror rpg out there but definitely one of the better ones easily a top 10 choice post credits thoughts okay then that was certainly an experience i legitimately did not see where the story was going up until the moment it dropped into my lap but i was able to guess some minor details there were times where i didn t know if my choices would change the outcome of the story and got anxious over picking the wrong thing but the game has a message about that crafted into the narrative in a way all i can really say without giving away spoilers is that actions can t be undone but you can rely on others to guide you through your sorrows if you have family that you ve lost there are some tough segments i got upset and teary eyed in the climax especially involving some of the more striking scenes i felt so awful once i learned the main twist i needed to step away and get some water your personal reaction may vary but it got me good definitely my favorite story based game this year please give it a chance i have heard some drama about the kickstarter and other people disliking the game s opening segments but i think the game came out better with this massive delay i got 20 hours logged on this save file but some of that extra time is due to leaving it running while doing other things 1 per hour of enjoyment is great and i think that i might go through and play it again in a few months
