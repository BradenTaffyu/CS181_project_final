2014 if you have a deep longing to attempt landing on the surface of a star or the gumption to fling countless people into space without any consideration toward their lives then this may be the game for you failure is the only option most of your best stories will have nothing to do with what went right on a standard planet to planet maneuver or how you really nailed that hohmann transfer no it ll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survived but somehow did my game once glitched as a kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface he bounced and not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way he bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrong the only type of mission that truly exists he fell from space and lived forget space erect a statue my first manned mission to the mun ended in predictable failure i tried landing without any sort of landing gear how you might ask by landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff i forgot about my horizontal velocity however and ended up ripping the engine apart i had all the fuel i needed for a return mission but the broken engine was left kilometers away oops at least i could plant a cool flag i attempted a rescue mission because that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do stranded person in space send more people to help them the first mission collided with the mun at 600 m s rough landing the second mission landed but i was probably 50km away which isn t all that bad all things considered i had the stranded kerbal run toward the landed ship but it was taking forever so i started using his little jetpack to expedite things lemons and lemonade as it turns out you can actually disintegrate a kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solid like the surface of the mun you will forever be in our thoughts mac kerman so much for the rescue i may as well have the rescue team return safely remember that landing gear part yeah i still hadn t updated that section of the ship instead i landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp bulletproof logic at least this kerbal had the dignity of a fiery fiery death an honorable death by my own hands in ksp your little kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous lost column it was with great sorrow that i saw mac kerman s name in there i didn t care so much about the other guys who cares about the second guy on the mun but here s the thing several years into my career mode mac magically reappeared and was ready for action he came back from the dead and what was the first thing he wanted to do go back into space to die again in conclusion yes to this game just yes i currently have a kerbal orbiting the second moon minmus yes he is in a stable orbit without a ship just him and he s been there for close to 30 years now i ll get around to that at some point update still in orbit
