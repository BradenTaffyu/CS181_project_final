2017 i don t really understand the strength of many of the negative reviews they almost scared me off of this one and i m glad that they didn t this is a really good civ game sure it s not exactly the same as civ 4 or civ 5 both very good games in their own right but it s a lot of fun i really appreciate all of the unique ways in which the individual civs stand out from one another city states are also actually fun to interact with now as they don t lose influence over time and each one has a unique bonus that it provides be it a unique tile improvement or resource boost or what have you the diplomatic screen is a little easier to navigate allowing you to jump between other civs without leaving that interface which saves a lot of time the split research and cultural techs make for a fun dichotomy and all of the smaller actions that you can take to speed up research or gain favor with city states help to freshen up the gameplay without being overbearing like the quest system from beyond earth i like that they got creative with support units such as healers that can help your units recover faster or balloons that increase the range of your siege units the districts take a little getting used to but they aren t as restrictive as i had thought that they would be you just have to put down a series of similar buildings on one particular tile on the map which adds a bit of extra strategy to maximize bonuses there s nothing keeping you from putting down many types of districts for the same city it s fun and it s got a creative design that keeps the gameplay fresh definitely recommended
