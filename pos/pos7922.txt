2016 early access review perfect game for any car fan regardless of age there s not a whole lot of fancy graphics no lens flares relatively simple smoke dust effects most foliage except trees are made of flat textures which are pretty well done you can t really tell unless you stop and zoom right in on the grass looks fine if you re driving even at low speeds and the shaders aren t modified to give a cinematic look so this game isn t an astonishingly pretty game but you know what that s okay each vehicle is intricately modelled down to the point where you can see each individual part of the engine you can see the butterfly valves on your supercharged v8 muscle car you can see the engine block move around in its mounts slightly as you rev the engine the level of detail is insane hit a harsh bump that bottoms out your custom lowered car be prepared to potentially have your entire exhaust system ripped out of your car hit a sharp kerb at high speed might wanna watch your tires they can pop giving your car an unnatural feel the physical damage in this game is brutally realistic as each car is not hard coded with performance stats health points etc each individual part of a car makes up it s whole performance much like a real car pop your front right tire and your car will start veering slightly to the right fit sport tires you might be able to handle a corner slightly faster lower your suspension you ll reduce body rolls and keep all 4 tires on the road better resulting in better grip it goes on and on the soft body physics overall are brilliant the cars crumple wobble and react exactly how you d expect a car to react maps the maps that come with the game are very nice and quite varied gridmap a testing map with an assortment of jumps surface types from sand and dirt to mud and water slalom cones objects to crash into and a few high speed race courses port a small map set on a port a perfect map for gymkhana or drifting fans with all kinds of shipping containers warehouses and a few ramps along with it industrial site a medium sized map set on a seaside industrial area it features a rallycross track with multiple configurations an offroad racing track laced with thick mud that will bog down your average rally car but take a big 4x4 and you ll plow straight on through and a more traditional tarmac race course the industrial area also features many warehouses like the port map and a nice little circuit that races around it featuring a jump over a small inlet east coast usa set in the east coast of the usa as the nae suggests it has a medium sized town along with fairly well maintained roads that go from the coast to snaking through the forest lots of dirt trails through fields and woodlands for rallying around too jungle rock island on a tropical island this map has poorly maintained roads that call for terrifying high speed driving along the coastline of this island it also has many offroad dirt trails that run through the forest and can quite easily end up getting you lost there s also a few little rally trails and industrial areas quarries and a port probably my favourite map cliff spawns you in at the top of a cliff the only way around is down the cliff fun little map for just throwing stuff of cliffs and watching it arrive at the bottom as a mangled mess not much to the map other than that but still fun nonetheless hirochi raceway a race focused map this raceway is gp styled with very wide smooth corners along with fast straights and chicanes thrown in this map also has a few forest routes that can take you on a narrow road through some forests so any mistakes can be fatal so quite a few maps with lots of variety scenariosthe game has a wide variety of scenarios too many to list here that cover multiple fun aspects of the game these can range from tutorials to shakedowns of various cars police chases races delivery challenges even a hyper miling challenge where you have to cross jungle rock island with very little gas left in your car there s even a demolition derby scenario for people to party play overall i d give this game a 8 10 i d like to see networked multiplayer something the beamng devs might implement if their engine can support it and a campaign mode which the devs have planned pretty much since day 1 of the project lots more potential the modding community is great who make new maps scenarios vehicles etc etc definitely worth the buy especially for car fans imo
