2018 kid safe imo though i advise they play in casual my kids 6 8 panic when they see tarrs and then there s all sorts of screaming for mommy to come save them reading ability increases enjoyment of the game particularly the storyline but isn t really necessary for gameplay the plort market is surprisingly good incentive to practice math skills also good from an adult point of view the slimes are super cute and you can make largo combinations of your favorites to make them even cuter there s thinking and exploring and planning involved it s replayable in the same way you would re read a favorite book the only thing that s changed the second time around is you but it s long enough and detailed enough that there s still a lot of joy in it even if re reads aren t your thing i wish there were more customizability of your ranch it s limited to choosing what to build on very specific spots and changing some colors around it s not much of a builder but honestly the cuteness of the slimes cannot be overstated
