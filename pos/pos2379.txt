2020 this game isn t anything like fallout 3 or nv but its still pretty good imo call me a criminal but i actually like the game sure its not that well optimized and the servers can be eh at times but from personal experience its nothing too big to where it ruins the gameplay but regardless of everything game is a blast to play with friends
