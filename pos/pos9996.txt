2021 terrible game the needs of the colonists and permanent guests is way too high i had one guy who kept having mental breaks and overall being a nuisance i guess his reasoning for being such a pain was because we harvested his organs fortunately there are workarounds for this i for one decided that simply disconnecting his limbs was unethical so instead i used an arsenal of varying safe drugs to keep him happy if he embraced his deadbeat side by getting addicted to a prescribed drug then i simply used a different prescribed drug to make up for the mental toll it had on him rest assured my doctor is licensed and he recently hit level 7 he knows what he s doing naturally i could ve let him go but there s no way someone with two missing organs two peg legs and three different drug addictions would survive out there really i m the good guy he should be grateful i decided i should remain his ward guardian because he wasn t in a condition to be making these sorts of decisions as such the best course of action for assisting with his problems was to accept payment where i could give him to a different colony specifically one with many more trained medical professionals so he can get the proper help he needs that said it did leave quite a sting when he was screaming lunacy as he left on his voyage such as you sold me off as a slave and i m the freaking man in black why naturally one should not buy into the falsehoods being said by a crazed man rather i ve found it best to remain silent as they depart simply smile wave and yell a brief slight reminder he needs luciferium in 3 days hopefully they heard me if not oh well
