2019 i don t usually write reviews much less reviews this long but i love this game so much that i thought it was only right i bought stellaris shortly after it launched in 2016 and though i enjoyed the overall experience of leading an alien empire of racially pure genocidal religious zealot maniacs i could never truly enjoy the game because i sucked badly i would almost constantly get destroyed by 1 4k fleets in the early game because of how difficult it was to wrap my head around some empires used wormholes some used hyperlanes some used lasers some used ballistic rounds and you claimed territory using starbases that costed influence upkeep that expanded your borders very little due to how trash i was at the game i gave up and wrote it off as a game i d never understand about a year later by pure chance i happened to boot the game up again after the utopia update and i was somehow okay at the game now what had happened turns out they had completely redone all of the hyperlane weapon and my personal favorite star bases star bases no longer costed influence upkeep they instead costed a flat rate of influence you would survey a system plop down a star base and that starbase would expand your borders in a small circular radius around that system a far cry from the system before having a small amount of starbases slowly expand your borders over a long period of time that while producing some cool looking borders you no longer see in the game today slowed down the rate of expansion and made the game much less of the rush to colonize it is now on top of all this the utopia expansion added megastructures things like dyson spheres ringworlds think the halo rings from the halo games massive science nexuses and gigantic sensor arrays that clears the fog of war across the entire map this dlc and update drastically changed how the game was played and made it easier for scrubs like me to get hooked and get hooked i did over time in true paradox style they have flooded the game with regular free and paid content updates including the apocalypse expansion which adds death star like weapons yes please the synthetic dawn expansion which adds playable robots of all shapes sizes and genocidal tendencies and most recently the megacorp expansion which adds mega corporations a galactic slave trade hive mind empire overhauls city wide planets and new megastructures this dlc also dropped with the free le guin update which was the largest overhaul of gameplay mechanics since the one that overhauled starbases on top of that theirs also a ton of story packs which add more events creatures to the game and their even coming out with a new one ancient relics focused on archaeology tomorrow they also support steam workshop which has graced the community with hundreds of beloved mods that enhance the experience of the game this may sound overwhelming but you must remember these are optional game play enhancements the base game is good to get started and if you like it on it s own you can start layering on dlc overtime i recommend utopia as it is by far the best expansion as of yet or splurge and buy all of the dlc at once if you re more wealthy than me or less responsible with money than me which i don t believe is possible overall stellaris has occupied 214 hours of my life as of writing this review and i expect that number to balloon over the years as paradox adds more content to the game and i decide i should do a play through as the commonwealth of man for the 13th time so i definitely recommend it it has become my favorite paradox game and possibly my favorite strategy game of all time and with the community thriving and the game growing every year there has never been a better time to dive in also i don t usually give scores to but you can eat the populace of the empire you take over in this game so it s at least a 9 10 possibly a 9 5 10 if we get an ice cream race eventually
