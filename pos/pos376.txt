2017 i was really weary on whether or not to buy this game because i thought it would be another point and click farming rpg game but it turned out to be so more more than that it s a beautiful slice of life game with so much to offer i completely love stardew valley now the storyline mechanics and characters are well drawn out and amazing not to mention you will become very very addicted to this game i can t wait for the option of multiplayer games now i definately recommend this wonderful game for all you rpg lovers out there
