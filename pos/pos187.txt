2016 first a couple of admissions this game gets compared a lot to the harvest moon series which i have never personally played couple that with the fact that i have also never played a farming sim before and this is pretty much as pure of an opinion on the game itself as you can possibly get now to the point stardew valley is incredibly fun and has managed to hold my interest so much that i m playing as much as i can lately there is a bit of a learning curve if you are not familiar with anything from the harvest moon series friends i know who have played that series and then stardew valley clued me into a lot of little things i didn t know about and likely wouldn t have figured out until i read about it somewhere later but what makes this game even more impressive to me is how a single dev took so much inspiration from something he clearly loved mixed in loads of player feedback and built something truely special i wish i had been one of the people that learned about this game early on so i could have watched it grow no pun intended i also can t help but love the retro art style of classic rpgs yet with the modern polish and bright colors that make it stand out as still being something new i can t help but wonder if chucklefish helped concerned ape out with some of that considering how much it reminds me of the art style used in their game starbound but either way it s got a surprisingly good level of detail to it with lots of character as far as how the game plays i found myself loving the simple yet challenging approach of levelling your five core skills and learning the best techniques to maximize the efficiency and profits of your farm you start off struggling to make everything work in that first year and by your second you really start to feel like you know what to do now the story is also simple but with a lot of charm even though pelican town is small it always feels like there is something new to discover about the people who live there while it can take a lot of time and effort to befriend everyone it becomes worth it to see how they all interact together and how much of an impact your character can make in their lives it s the ultimate expression of a lively small town community and looking out for your fellow man something i think a lot of us lose sight of sometimes in this digital age but let s not forget the symbol of modern change that takes form in joja corporation a megacorporation looking to monopolize pelican town you can either decide to help them out for a price and increase the town s reliance on joja corp or instead work to restore the town s community center and promote local business and interaction declining joja further business opportunity in the area it s a powerful underlying message to the whole game and something many can feel passionate about one way or the other lastly i need to mention the price for all the hours i ve sunk into this game already and will likely continue to add in the future the 15 price tag feels like a steal i can t help but highly recommend this game at full price because if you are a fan of this type of sandbox rpg farming sim you will easily justify the cost twice over i actually bought the game for a friend because it was affordable and something i could recommend to anyone and i knew my friend would enjoy it while i m sure it s bound to end up on sale when the initial hype dies down please don t be someone that waits specifically for that to happen this game is worth every cent and doesn t cost any more than a month of game time for any mmo out there if you are sincerely interested and have the money don t wait tl dr this game is freaking amazing and you should get it
