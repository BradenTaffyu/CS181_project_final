2021 as an owner of all of the age of empires games i skeptical of this release since it felt like a rework of age of empires ii however after playing it for 20 hours and working through the campaigns i m happy to say my concerns were abated this release feels classic but fresh it takes the best parts of aoe ii and aoe iii and adds in beautiful sound mixing good visuals and great campaigns i ve really enjoyed multiplayer and single player matches and all of my aoe iii friends jumped on board and we re learning the ins and outs of this game together there are some awesome features i ve dreamed of for years including units on the walls ships that are more realistic and bringing back a fourth resource stone into the game aoe iii s three resources was a negative in my opinion i like having to manage and source more materials the civilizations are really unique and offer totally different play styles than prior releases which is a really welcome addition i ve been playing with many of the new unfamiliar civilizations and i m learning some new play styles that i was not expecting to pick up i ve never been a rushing player but i m learning how to balance building and rushing through this release overall i m extremely happy with this release and have no complaints i ve read through other negative reviews and don t really find them to match my experience i think this is a fantastic release and i have loved every minute of game play so far
