2023 many criticize this game for the lack of content number of commanders maps etc and it is absolutely deserved however what this game lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality the game play from coh2 has been incredibly polished units have unique and interesting abilities unit path finding is excellent usually and the maps the game did release with are excellent however i hate the breakneck profits first approach sega has imposed on relic the lack of content is not relics fault the developer team is relatively small and the time and resources they had to make this was insufficient i m sure with a couple more expansions this game will be everything the fan base was hoping for but i believe that fans are justifiably upset with the lack of quality i want the game to be successful so i am leaving a thumbs up
