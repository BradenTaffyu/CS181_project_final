2016 another review needs your upvotei will not hide that i did not play fallout and fallout 2 yet and i liked fallout 3 and new vegas i have enjoyed both games i liked the world of fallout 3 more but prefer new vegas gameplay more i have waited for fallout 4 since i finished nv i knew it will be a bethesda game i did not expect a miracle like the witcher 3 maybe that s why i m not disappointed with the game i liked it from start to finish you start the game by creating your character as always this time you have a nice costumization options you can create a handsome guy or sexy woman same as you can create some really badass looking or plain ugly characters after short time you get thrown into a game bombs fall down and the world as we know changes only war war never changes after you wake up you find that your child is gone and you go on a journey to find him the story is pretty nice i did not expect a good story but i enjoyed it until the end also first time in the series i loved other characters in previous games i didn t care for anyone in this one i loved to chat with my companions and get to know them and little stories behind them were quite interesting of course not every character is likeable there is one you will hate from the start and he s become another internet joke skyrim had arrow to the knee and this one has well i don t want to spoil it for you the gameplay is similar to previous games shooting mechanics are improved now the game feels and plays more like a shooter the world is nicely done and you will spend many hours exploring it after 2 hours you will say ok i ll clear this building and turn it off and another 2 hours pass and you re clearing 5th building already and you can barely hold your bladder it s really addicting the world is small in scale but locations are very close to each other and there s so many of them that they will keep you busy for hours there is another couple of new things first being you can finally hear the voice of your character i don t if it was needed i guess it only made dialogues more simpler and shorter also now you can build your own settlements and invite people to live there graphics are nice i love the colors hated the green and yeallow brown tint in previous games in fallout 4 the colors are realistic time of day and weather can change and it looks gorgeous character models sometimes looks very good and sometimes they look like they came from xbox 360 all in all graphics are nice to look at but performance is not very good in an empty part of the map you will get 60fps but in busy areas fps will drop to 40 or even 30fps because the game renders shadows underground yeah dear bethesda you really have a talent this time the game feels less rpg and more fps the dialogues are dumbed down there s almost no choices and even when you can choose it doesn t matter what you choose the outcome will be the same same as the walking dead but i don t know if it makes the game worse i loved fallout 4 and would pre order fallout 5 for me fallout is all about exploring while listening to an amazing in game radio stations but if you expect a 100 percent rpg you will not get it it s more of an adventure shooter with elements of rpg of course the game has plenty of mods which could add things and improve almost anything i can t really imagine this game without mods after the first hour of playing i already had some mods installed official modding tools are coming soon in conclusion i would recommend this game at full price it s fun it will suck you in and will not let go this is by no means a masterpiece and it has plenty room for improvement but it s a must play pros great world designgraphicsimproved shooting mechanicsexploring is funcons performancedumbed down dialoguesdumbed down choicesmy curator page
