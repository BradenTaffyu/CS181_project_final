2023 fallout new vegas has a legendary reputation among many fallout fans and there s a good reason for this obsidian s entry into the franchise is the first and thus far only post nineties fallout game to capture and build upon the depth of writing and the slightly goofy yet fundamentally very serious tone of interplay s original fallout while combining it with the more approachable and arguably more immersive first person gameplay of the bethesda entries into the series fallout new vegas offers all the qualities of the original games in a first person action rpg package whereas bethesda s fallout 3 and fallout 4 have thus far failed to deliver either a truly thoughtful narrative or a genuinely in depth rpg system fallout new vegas is a game that actually has something to say in every corner of its large open world we are presented with the conflict between three different factions caesar s legion the ncr from fallout 2 and mr house in turn these may be read to represent the forces of fascism democracy and capitalism but obsidian isn t content with just casually labelling these factions and expecting the player to go with the obvious good or bad option as we explore the mojave wasteland we are told by roving traders that the lands subjugated by the slavers of the legion are actually much safer for travellers than ncr territory precisely because of the inhumane nature of the legion and the cruel punishment that highwaymen and dissenters in general can expect meanwhile the ncr is a beleaguered democratic nation that offers its citizens inherent rights and freedoms but is struggling with political infighting and trying to cover up its own darker side read violent expansionism mr house sits firmly in the middle ready to cast his lot in with either of these systems because in the end he s just interested in getting the biggest slice of the pie for himself no matter what social or political system is nominally in power underneath this grand conflict lie the countless smaller stories of the people humans mutants ghouls etc inhabiting the mojave wasteland all brilliantly realized in video game form and most of them way more mature and thoughtful than you d expect from a game with goofy 1950s atompunk robots i could go on and on about how fallout new vegas uses the existing gameplay mechanisms of fallout 3 to give players a host of options on how to approach different situations how these systems allow you to truly flesh out your character both in terms of skills and in terms of their identity and worldview or how the writing is moody and perfectly hits that sweet spot between an all pervading sense of melancholy and the dark humour that the original fallout games were known for but all of these details just come down to one singular point fallout new vegas is a game with actual depth in terms of its action rpg gameplay as well as its writing this allows obsidian s entry into the fallout universe to completely overshadow the ultimately very shallow entertainment park bethesda have turned the rest of the franchise into as far as i m concerned even as a fan of interplay s original fallout games fallout new vegas is not just the last great fallout game but also the peak of the entire series so far
