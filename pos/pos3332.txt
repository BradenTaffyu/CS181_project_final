2017 early access review it s short and very much unfinished thus far and yet has utterly surprised me by being one of the most fun co op experiences i ve had in a while while it has some issues for early access it has a level of polish unheard of in most games that aren t yet fully released and also some that are the systems seem well thought out 4 player multiplayer is a massive improvement the game looks quite lovely not even just in raw graphics but more importanly in visual design playing as the red prince and picking the most vegeta like dialogue just to see what happens is funny to me the combat is fun and just challenging enough these are all good points in the game s favour but there is but one thing that draws me in like a moth to a flame i have never seen such levels of freedom and sandbox design in a fantasy rpg before to the extent where there s just so much room for player dickery for example my friend would start conversations with npc s like some kind of strangey mcweirdo who actually wants to advance the plot instead of committing petty crimes for even pettier reasons i know right so while he s talking learning story and lore and just generally enjoying the writing i decided to him over for a laugh even outside of combat you can sneak as long as you don t enter an npc s line of sight and the npc s sight was focused on my poor friend and not her valuables and i needless to say i made off with her shoes a potion and some fish the last of which i sent to my friend s inventory as they were still talking one what i can only assume to be magical cavity search later and my friend was in prison while i was grabbing many many crates all of which sell for 1 gold to get my pants back after a guard took them from me the last time i got busted for petty theft 10 10 would have a kleptomaniac episode again
