2021 on my first playthrough which i completed in a measly three days because the game is that good that i couldn t draw myself away from my screen i achieved the good ending the good ending left me a near emotional wreck i am scared to go back for the other endings because i don t know if i ll be able to handle it 10 10 would let it rip my heart out again on a more serious note i implore you to experience this game blind do enough research to see if it s a game you ll enjoy before buying but don t do any more than that please don t spoil this incredible experience for yourself it s worth every penny and minute of your time no other game has made me feel the way omori has edit only coming back to this for the steam awards badge 84 84 achievements later i d say that this year there isn t any other game that deserves that outstanding story rich game award more than omori
