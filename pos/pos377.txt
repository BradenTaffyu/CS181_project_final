2016 just started year 2 and a smidge over 60 hours played right now so i think i ve played enough at this point to give an honest opinioni like simulator games but harvest moon and animal crossing both tended to lose my interested after a while they got very grindy to say the least or just boring i think stardew combines both very nicely and adds some good old dungeon crawling to boot i hear rune factory also did this well but i ve never touched the series so i can t compare i ll do my best to list the pros and cons as i saw them pros music is very nice and fitting for the seasons what adds to this too is the music isn t constantly droning on the game breaks up the music with just moments of silence with ambient sounds this really helps break up the monotony and keeps you from getting sick of the music too quickly other than that its just rather nice time stops while paused not sure if this is a constant in farming simulators but still a nice feature so you can leave it up and go afk exploration and dungeon crawling is rewarding not only do enemies drop good resources but the mines contain a tremendous amount of ore the further you go down the more plentiful not to mention it will record every 5 floors you go down so you don t have to restart from the beginning getting a reward every 10 floors is also a nice incentive plenty to do between the farming and dungeon crawling there s goals to accomplish inside the community center in the same fashion of the floors of the dungeon you get rewarded for completing these tasks packs some better than others but most have been very worth it leveling up skills reaps nice skills you can essentially build your farmer to be proficient or do better in certain aspects of the skill netting you a lot more gold depending on how you plan on playing maybe you want foraged things to be worth more or maybe you want to have a chance of picking up two every so often getting married is also kinda nice i mean yeah same old harvest moon has bee doing that forever but its nice your character can marry any other character that is single just keep shoving salads in their face and they ll be all yours they also help you out every so often its very open ended no oustanding or time constraining goals you need to accomplish or you fail which for someone like me who wanted to just have a nice wind down game this was great there s also a butt ton of references and easter eggs if you like that stuff i sure do cons i generally tried to take something positive from these though personally i found the penalty for running out of hp in the mines to be a tad steep lost about 1 3 of my items 2500g and the memory of the previous 11 floors so i had to do them all over again before being able to advance again overall it wasn t a big deal and i m more careful now but at the point i was in when it happened it was very detremental unless you really stay on top opf the rest of your farm trees and debris are gonna multiply big time the hole western side of my land was just a mess of these full grown trees from out fo nowhere it felt that way anyway where d they come from character options really just shirt wise since that s the major thing outside the hair felt a tad samey and just switched the color most of the time don t get me wrong there s over 100 options and i applaud that just they didn t seem very different from each other a lot of the bachelors and bachelorettes just came off to be kinda really unappealing just their attitudes and personalities were hard to like in most cases this is completely subjective though but i found myself half the time just going wow you are a really intolerable person this game is gonna eat up a lot of your free time or maybe that s a pro either way beware overall if you re itching to play a really good farming simulator and have enjoyed games such as harvest moon and animal crossing i d totally recommend giving this a go i d say its worth is price of 15 even though there are not so great aspects of the game i think the good parts greatly outweigh the bad you can usually take something positive from the experience mostly the game is fun and in the end that s what matters if you can have fun with it you re gonna enjoy it
