2021 it s almost like real hunting it s more like a simulation than a game a couple areas where it falls short of real hunting 1 wind in real life the wind isn t always blowing in this game it blows 24 7 and it ll be south one minute and then north 5 minutes later ruining your entire plan of attack generally in real life in the northern hemisphere wind blows west to east with small variance devs went full potato with the wind 2 animal intelligence they all have the same ai in real life though certain animals are smarter than others elk are dumb as hell in real life but in this game they re just as skittish as whitetail and rabbits which is just stupid 3 camouflage in real life camouflage matters blending in with the environment matters in this game it doesn t matter at all how you f this up when you re trying to create a hunting simulator is beyond me regardless of these shortcomings it s a very fun game
