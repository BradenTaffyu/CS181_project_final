2014 early access review thank you klei dst is even better than i imagined it would be the first day i started playing ds the bottom line is this if you have friends family whom can play ds and survive on their own for long periods of time then this game will make doing so together much more fun i honestly can t see why this is even in beta the game looks sounds and feels done to me it isn t missing any obvious components has solid gameplay without crashes bugs or disconnects a truly stable environment for a truly unstable game world awesome i highly recomend this game don t miss out
