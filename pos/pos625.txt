2016 a typical day in stardew valley wake up watch my morning shows go outside and check my mail hey kent sent me a letter bomb again quaint check on harvest crops and fruit trees discover that a meteorite has crashed into my farm in the middle of the night and while wondering why i did not wake up from the force of the impact let alone the sound of it or why none of the other villagers from pelican town heard came to see what had happened i decide to mine it more likely than not exposing myself to cosmic radiation in the process best case scenario i become a super hero worst case i get cancer go and tend to the animals brew some alcohol because i ll need to celebrate if i become a super hero or drown my sorrows if i get cancer from mining that meteorite head to town chat up the local townsfolk regaling them with tales of mining meteorites and avoiding certain death from numerous letter bombs from unknown assailents wait for the townsfolk to leave raid their garbage like the hobo super hero cancer patient that i am sweet joja cola take on a job from the bulletin board those slimes are going down head to the mines scream death and havoc as i wade into glorious combat with my foes get slimed pop a few mushrooms to restore health and energy wonder why i m not trippin report back to mayor lewis a job well done hey since when did mayor lewis become a walking spatula with a groucho marx mustache and oh finally the mushrooms are kickin in stumble back to the farm after having an adventure in who knows where because of those mushrooms and climb into bed thinking tomorrow will certainly be even better than this one sleep through a witch unsuccessfully egging my chicken coop 10 10 would mine meteorites again
