2023 first heard of the game from a gangs of glasgow mod video bought it cheap to play mods and figured i d best do one or two vanilla runs to get the fundamentals down first here i am 270 hours later still playing vanilla the vanilla game can be a bit frustrating at times horrible lord ai troops are often dumb politics are a bit shallow but the combat system is where it shines and generally sets this game apart from other medival rts titles with the aim of realism it incorporates directional attacking directional blocking and momentum based damage and provides a wealth of different weapons and playstyles to chose from it s also ridiculously satisfying easy to learn and hard to master you ll feel like a wizard if you can get a grasp on melee combat or you can go the historically op route and just let loose your arrows on horseback if you like interesting combat political manoeuvring and medieval settings are generally autistic then this is the game for you 10 10 still better than bannerlord
