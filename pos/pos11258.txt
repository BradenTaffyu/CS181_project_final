early access review tldr there is a lot to love in fields of mistria it s the most polished ea game i ve played and i can t recommend it enough if you enjoy the cozy farming genre this is awesome the farming system isn t terribly complicated the fishing is enjoyable and catching bugs is a pleasant way to spend your time the character portraits give serious sailor moon vibes and the dialogue is amusing i have thousands of hours in stardew valley but my heart belongs to rune factory 4 special like rf4s fields of mistria provides unique character dialogue that makes me want to chat with the people in town friday nights at the inn make me laugh and i look forward to seeing what will happen next in the campaign in mistria it s not dead grandpa s farm and i m not there to fix a community center for a shady mayor who constructs gold statues of himself i m looking at you lewis i m there to help revitalize a community after an earthquake the townspeople are working together and you are helping them achieve their goals rather than jerkface pierre taking credit for the produce i cultivated i recieve recipes in the mail so i can grow more of that produce and cook healing food from it i feel like i m making progress just by shipping things and that really makes me happy items are affordable and it doesn t feel like a grind to obtain them i can plant a sapling in spring and it will produce fruit that year speaking of pierre i don t have to worry about a shop being closed on wednesday i can buy stuff whenever i want that s particularly useful as the days fly by crossing a sprawling map even with a very fast walking speed i still stressed about making it to the shop before it closed only to find out that i didn t have to it stayed open i really like foraging in these kinds of games and i couldn t believe the variety of materials there were to gather in spring halfway through the season i discovered cattails were a crafting material i didn t know about the water chestnuts until there was a request to make trail mix and that s another place that fields of mistria shines the requests do not have time limits i can take my time and explore and enjoy the game without feeling like i need to rush around like in the example of the water chestnuts above the requests can act as tutorial such as for smithing cooking or wood working i never feel lost or unsure of what to do next everything feels clean organized and thought out the only very slight criticism i have personally is that with my dyslexia sometimes i find the pixelated font difficult to read i found that moving my desk chair further back from my monitor helped a bit this might be a bit of a rambling review so if you ve made it this far thanks i just want to close by saying that if you enjoy stardew valley or even better if you liked rune factory 4 special this is a game you won t want to miss
