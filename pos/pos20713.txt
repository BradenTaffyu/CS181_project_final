2023 for people who grew up with the books or even the movies this game is a must play for people who don t care about the harry potter world but just like playing videogames this is a solid well executed game on par with any good aaa game and a pretty solid 7 or 8 out of 10 better than anything ubisoft makes better than the lotr shadow war of mordor but of course it s no elden ring and that s fine it doesn t have to be finally for people who only care about what j k rowling says on twitter this game is not for you not due to anything in the game itself it is actually very kind and inclusive and you would enjoy it but because j k rowling created the harry potter world 30 years ago you won t enjoy playing any game set in that world that s fine please don t bully people online for enjoying things and don t spread hate
