2018 i was wrong about this game i first got it in december and played it for only an hour and returned it i returned it because it felt like it was too complicated for me to understand just a day ago i decided to get it again and give it another chance and i m glad i did i m still learning how to play hoi4 and so far its really fun i rarely post reviews but hoi4 is an exception hoi4 deserves a positive review this game allows me to enact my own alternate history ww2 scenarios and i m glad this game exists thank you paradox for making this game as i said before i am still learning how to play but once i do it will add an even more fun experience overall i will give this game a 9 10
