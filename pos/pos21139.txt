2019 this is one of my all time favorite games it was love at first sight when the early access was first released and i ve only found my love for it growing ever since it s such an adorable and wholesome game with beautiful visuals and music you can wind up playing it for hours without noticing when you set your mind to fulfilling some task you want to achieve which is great for those times when you re not quite sure if you feel like doing anything elsethe world is also very immersive and interesting to explore even after you ve seen most of it already
