2021 a much better game then what anno 2205 was however it is trapped on the egs who greedily took it away from players who may have found it through steam sales or advertising let it be remembered that steam never had a monopoly on game titles but epic hypocritically does edit game is back on steam but not pleased that i cannot get a deal on the dlc offerings because i got the game 4 years ago before ubisoft removed it but still has a lot to do although the ai is a huge pain
