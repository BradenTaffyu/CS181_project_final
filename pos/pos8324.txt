2020 my favorite thing about frostpunk as a game is how much it hates you the game was designed specifically to make you miserable everything from the frozen city map often broken up by valleys and mountains to the mournful music clearly anticipating your demise to the blighted landscape of the world map put together it creates an intensely melancholic atmosphere that can unnerve even the hardiest of souls the overworld offers no hope or respite as you desperately search for frozen resources while attempting to stay ahead of oncoming storms should you fail even if your city survives any scouts outside the city are lost to the storm frozen to death and consuming both the lives and the resources used to send them out into the frostland the addition of trade between settlements added in the dlc adds another component to manage to this allowing you to spend resources building up three other settlements in order to foster resource trade to make up for your own shortfalls beware though because a surplus now could mean a deficit once a storm hits and shuts down production as the game is measured in days no new citizens are ever born your only chance of increasing your workforce is to risk the frozen snow choked world map you must either escort them to your city losing valuable scouting time or risk letting them come alone even finding new citizens is a double edged sword you must use your limited resources to feed house and heat them they often arrive sick or disabled requiring additional time and resources to make them useful the law system can offer you an increased workforce and improved mood for the populace but only by sacrificing your soul you have the option of forcing your people to work for 24 hours non stop or work 14 hour shifts you can force the children in your city to work safe jobs or any job should you take mercy on the children you must spend resources building and heating daytime housing for them you can strip the dead for parts but doing so leaves you open to disease building a cemetery costs resources and manpower and grants you no bonuses from organ transplants building a tavern opens up the possibility of turning it into a brothel where people are forced to sell themselves at your whim heating is a constant struggle as storms grow ever more powerful with temperatures dropping into the sub arctic range in the early mid game depending on your chosen difficulty should you fail to adequately heat your homes and workplaces people will get sick lose limbs to frostbite or even die in all frostpunk is a hauntingly beautiful and deeply disturbing look into humanity s possible future as well as your own psyche and what difficult choices you would make should you find yourself in their position succeed and your reward is survival fail your people any you are exiled into the frozen wastes to freeze to death 10 10 masterful approach and execution i only wish it had more maps
