2020 i never thought in a million years i would recommend fallout 76 i bought it at launch on the bethesda launcher and it was a steaming pile of unforgivable garbage and refunded it in the first hour they have totally turned this game around i have have had no glaring technical issues the game runs around 100 150 fps on max settings my specs at the end of this post most of the time the lowest i ve seen it drop was 60 fps in a big town with players and lots of npcs fighting i have had no disconnects no falling through the ground no npcs t posing and desyncing etc which were all extremely prevalent problems at launch i was also really worried about the subscription cash shop but i have not felt any real need to buy anything there yet inventory management is about the same as previous fallout games and being able to make a stash for cheap right away and move your c a m p around for basically nothing 6 10 caps for a small house with all the essential crafting tools in it makes managing all the loot painless if i could criticize anything i would say it s that you need to pay for the monthly subscription to use the private server for friends feature but since they are spinning up a private server for 8 people it makes sense that it s behind a subscription the addition of npcs really saved this game they are well written well voice acted and the quests are meaningful and really fun honestly i think the quests are better than fallout 4 i think 76 might be better than fallout 4 just overall the community has been great too i have not run in to any griefers or hackers yet the pacifist system is great too nobody can trick you in to a pvp fight by getting in the way of your shots i have heard there are ways to get around the systems in place to grief people but i have not yet experienced any of them and the fact that i have not been griefed during a free to play weekend speaks volumes about the effectiveness of anti griefing systems really give fallout 76 a try during this free weekend you have nothing to lose and you might change your mind about this game and end up having a really good time i have to hand it to bethesda they really came through for this game my specs ryzen 7 3800x 4 5 ghz1080ti fe 2025mhz core 6000 mhz memory16gb ddr4 3200 mhznvme m 2 ssd
