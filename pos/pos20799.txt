i m not the biggest fan of the harry potter franchise but i think that hogwarts legacy is a fun and enchanting magical adventure that does it justice visually it s quite impressive perhaps not in terms of raw technical achievement but in a very homely sweet comfortable and nostalgic way everything is so inviting and bewitching the world of hogwarts legacy is packed full of curiosities it feels very lived in and organic down to smallest detail the castle halls are large and foreboding as if inviting both divine sorcery and danger the house rooms are warm and cozy perfect for a lazy afternoon nap the shops are mysterious and filled with all manner of colorful witchcraft that the kids use for their pranks hundreds of flying little magical objects all around you with long looped animations that must have taken forever to animate i really felt like a kid in a candy store just taking in the sights and sounds there s life and excitement everywhere you look and most of the buildings and rooms you find are enterable with their interiors beautifully designed to immediately permeate you with a sense of wonder and amazement magical brooms sweeping the floor a floating kettle pouring tea for you as you brush off the snow from your shoulders enchanted mechanical birds flying overhead and chirping a song for you it s a dream come true for any harry potter fan i would often find myself entering buildings that i had no business being in just because i wanted to see what s inside the world is full of such wonderful little experiences and it never gets old hogwarts legacy a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by luriam the hogwarts castle and the surrounding area is so incredibly detailed full of quests npcs secrets interactive magical things references to the books and movies classes that you can attend and a seemingly infinite number of living paintings all of which react to the day night cycle there is so much to do and see it made my head spin at first all of that is beautifully accompanied by the game s fantastic music and sound design everything around you looks magical and it also sounds magical too the clicking of all the self rearranging mechanical pieces bubbling of potions pupils practicing spells the moving staircases the otherworldly fauna and flora the random fencing of two ghostly duelists who never seem able to defeat one another the cheerful and syrupy ambiance of a candy store it s all perfect and exactly how i imagined it should sound in addition to all that there s also a massive countryside brimming with content as well and it s got some of the most beautiful vistas i ve ever seen in gaming little huts and rivers people painting and fishing fireflies in the moonlight quaint villages and comfy towns all of which are magical in more than one way and the game also features different seasons which completely change how these places look and feel i particularly liked the fall season but they all look beautiful and distinct people change their clothes depending on seasons and so can you there s a lot of customization options and most of them look good and i also like that the character selection screen slowly gets filled up as you progress through the story and side content the more you achieve the cooler it looks and it s not just the character selection screen npcs and enemies will often mention the things you did or the house that you re part of i liked that hogwarts legacy a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by luriam the story did not really grip me and the main quest was the only thing that i ended up somewhat caring about same thing could be said for the characters the vast majority are weak and forgettable and pretty much all of the protagonist s friends are pathetic losers whom you babysit none of them are independent or capable of great things they re just there so you re not alone in class there are no real bonds of friendship or even rivalry and what little there is are just bizarre cliches that feel outdated and out of place the closest they got to a memorable friendship that has realistic ups and downs was with sebastian s quest line the black wakanda girl talking about their own african hogwarts and how it s ten times as big and ten times as good was hilarious you re telling me that there s a magical castle for gifted kids somewhere in the deserts of africa and yet they allow all the brutality famine and desolation outside their walls to continue nice one there s a ton of side quests but most of them felt repetitive and cheap fetch quest types from irrelevant npcs where your reward is usually something a lot worse than what you had 10 hours ago you also can t choose to be good or evil so there s low replay value you ll play 100 boring side quests instead of 15 memorable ones where you do something interesting and unique overall the challenges and achievements are very grindy and the rewards you receive are unimpressive to say the least even the quest rewards were often awful completing all the challenges gave me so many outfits that just made my character look like a clown this is where the transmog system saved the day thank you for including it even though there is loot everywhere and you possess magic your inventory is tiny even when upgraded to the fullest capacity money is worthless i was a millionaire but there was nothing to buy the merchants all sold the same items that i already bought a bunch of times and sadly buying and selling things is very slow and tedious combat is sort of fun and allows for interesting spell combinations mixed with environmental and special attacks i liked the parry and dodge mechanics the timing of it all was fun to master fights are never too difficult and there are plenty of extra items and potions to assist you hogwarts legacy a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by luriam mixing exploration flight and combat can be fun but it also often reminded me of the dragon age inquisition free roam often encountering physics glitching out items placed inside walls or clipping through one another same sort of scan system randomly spawning enemies that you can fight or avoid speaking of enemies there are no interesting or intimidating foes trolls are the closest i suppose but where are the dementors or some kind hulking werewolves that make you want to avoid the dark forest at night you mostly fight adults who are thrice your age but somehow lose to a little kid who just learned their first spell the deluxe edition rewards are absolute trash do not buy that i never wanted to use any of them and when i accidentally did i regretted it in my opinion hogwarts legacy s biggest flaw is aiming at the incorrect audience the game is very obviously designed for kids it s very transparent simple in its design very pg there s no blood no deaths really nothing difficult or morally ambiguous no depth or deeper meaning to things no love nor hate everyone talks to you as if you re in a special class explaining the objective to you several times and then you can choose to keep asking for help with it and even though it mimics the first 2 harry potter movies i think that was the wrong thing to do because the kids who grew up watching the first 2 harry potter movies are now in their late 20s or 30s and this game treats them like absolute dummies why couldn t this have been the last year at hogwarts why not feature some more mature or darker themes like in the last few harry potter movies the stakes are ever so low nothing you do really matters npcs are just a bunch of talking heads who bore you with their sterile dialogues this is what i think hurts the game the most we grew up but it didn t hogwarts legacy delivers a wonderfully designed world and immersive audio design alas earwax story gameplay and performance
