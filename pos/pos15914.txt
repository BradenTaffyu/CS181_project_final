2021 early access review hei all it s been a while from my last game review but honestly this does deserve one i wasn t quite sure what to expect when i turned on the simulator i mean let s be real what can you expect from a washing simulator i can t even get my lazy butt to clean my own home not to mention doing it in game man was i wrong this game is soooooo good at stress relief and it was amazingly relaxing i mean it actually reminded me little kids coloring books just instead of colors you had to remove dirt for things to come alive just felt so fulfilling you get hired to clean different things from cars to bikes to houses to playgrounds you finish the job get paid buy better equipment and soaps and clean even harder and faster couple things what i missed that i felt should be added to the game 1 tutorial i mean the button screen is helpful but it felt like it was missing something i got thrown into the game start cleaning if i wouldn t have seen a youtube clip on the game i wouldn t have known that you can rotate the front end or even change the tips 2 things got real really fast xd from cleaning the first car to going to a bloody mansion as the second job i mean jeesh maybe a wee bit of a smaller object can be put to works for the second workorder 3 as this is really enjoyable but a wee bit short it could use both more workorders and steam achievementsanyways those were my 2 cents i do recommend the game it was quite enjoyable d
