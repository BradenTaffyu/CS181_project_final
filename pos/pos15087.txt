2015 remember when you first played tetris and after a while buildings started to look like tetris blocks and you were trying to fit them all together i left the house today after playing dst for 40 hours for a week it s winter here and all the real life twigs are calling to me to gather them on my walk i actually heard the haunting screams of rabbits being murdered amid surfing the web for a moment i mistakenly thought it was going to get dark i am constantly hungry this is what it comes to survival instincts resonated from not wanting to do stupid sh t like burn the base camp down in front of your mates will make you this way
