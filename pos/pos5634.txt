f1 f3 sun tzuedit i just conquered the entire map as a vassal and so my game concluded all jokes aside this was an unbelievable experience every war season was intense and nail biting every battle was glorious every moment was special i felt things in this game i felt things that i guess are not able to be felt unless you command troops in battle and this game helps you roleplay that to the extent that a game can do that even if it s just pixels on a screen i remember one time when we were heavily outnumbered and we won and at the end i rode my horse from one end of the battlefield to the other emoting to my troops as a sign of gratitude that was special i really felt like i am not battania you are battania also don t get me wrong this isn t a larping game by any means it truly is strategic if you use the right formations and the terrain to your advantage as it may pertain to any given situation the odds will sway massively in your favor it also helps a ton to choose your battles carefully also i never ever got tired of pressing the execute button and the last time i rode with the army on the highest plateau of the mongolian steppes and king jagutai was no more thus bringing peace to calradia once and for all at least for a couple of decades 10 10 also sun tzu
