2016 dark souls 3 is the first dark souls game with an actually good pc release unlike dark souls 1 ans 2 the game is playable with kb m you don t need a bunch of fixes and mods to make the game playable achievements are working there are steam cards it s easy to play with your friends and you don t need to make a pact with the devil to make the online work i ve heard some people are having problems with crashes stuttering and stuff but after i changed my lightning to low in the options menu all my problems were fixed so yeah it s worth it in my opinion
