2016 as i have said in my ets2 review driving a virtual truck might not seem like the most exiting of things but ats just like ets2 before it manages to achieve the improbable and actually makes it a very relaxing and fun experience to just start your favourite music on the radio and drive through the expansive roads cities and small towns of california nevada and arizona delivering various goods and growing your trucking empire both ets2 and ats have something unique to offer ats captures the feel of us roads pretty well particularly after the rescale scs has done to make the map a lot bigger and complete the diversity of companies and cargo is pretty good in my opinion and the three states provide plenty of roads to drive even if not as much as full ets2 the complexity of cities is also better in ats than in most parts of ets2 ats definitely has a different feel to ets2 the landscapes are new as well as road layouts and the overall feel is different to when i am driving in ets2 you can definitely tell whether you are in europe or the us and not just because of the truck you are driving the only downside of ats currently is that it has only 2 truck brands with 4 truck models together and it seems scs is having a rather hard time getting new truck licenses so the wait for new trucks if you don t like using mods might be rather long overall ats is a brilliant us truck simulator with a ton of potential when new states and new trucks are added in the future
