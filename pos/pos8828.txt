2019 i started with a planet of egalitarian scientific minded fox people they wore battlestar galactica ish robes and had names like deran von fel they were organized by a benevolent high council and they had fully embraced the age of automation with robot servants to do the heavy lifting in society as we explored we carved out a modest corner of the galaxy for ourselves eventually we met some friendly vulcans and began trading we also met some roach people and they were cool too there were also some belligerent geckos but they were really weak so we just ignored them eventually some of our robot friends became self aware so we naturally afforded them the same rights as any other sapient being while using their unique abilities to compliment our own a caravan of rat people came through and asked if some of them could stay behind and we were like sure thing and some of the vulcans came over too we founded a galactic market and used our wealth to institute social safety nets and did our best to create a fair society where everyone truly had an equal chance we grew wealthy and technologically advanced with all of the discoveries made by our explorers and a healthy engaged and productive populous to build on them a society designed for everyone that belonged to everyone and amazing discoveries those were mind you a dyson sphere able to supply us with all of the energy we could ever need a system belonging to a long gone empire home to a planet covered entirely in a vacant city ripe for rebuilding the knowledge to build stargates and artificial worlds in space and our worlds were open to all diversity is strength i m embarrassed to say that there was a small faction in our government that sprung up against the idea but they were quickly suppressed by the wise and benevolent high council then disaster struck we received word that one of our rivals an enclave of communist robots was on the verge of opening the sealed gate we had been stalling on opening this gate ourselves for fear of something lurking on the other side it s unclear who finally opened it first but the result was a disaster fleet after fleet of super powerful nanite ships came pouring through the galaxy was in flames well nanite clouds the informational notifications were a constant stream of refugee arrivals from desolated worlds most with nothing but the clothes on their backs exoskeletons chassis of course we took them all in with us behind our walls of safety we erected powerful fortresses at strategic choke points on the hyperlanes into our cluster and we were able hold off the nanite scourge while our main fleet led by admiral galdrig den badir pierced deep into their home territory in order to find the source of the scourge and shut it down there were attempts and failures several times our fleets were forced to retreat but each time they learned from it admiral badir in particular learned to get the most from the ships under his command there were times when the fleets had to make do on their own and he learned to coordinate his to move swiftly and make the most of field repairs that were available we did what we could back home too there were resource shortages all of those fortresses and ships didn t come cheap even with the massive energy income from the dyson sphere alloys were expensive we focused on protecting many of the smaller fledgling worlds that we had helped uplift we weren t always successful the mushroom people of gadim lost their homeworld because we couldn t make it in time we learned from our failures and redoubled our efforts we almost didn t make it in time to save the people of sol iii the nanite fleet had destroyed their mining outposts and was moving into position to bombard their world into dust when one of our patrol fleets was able to jump to the system and save them barely by the fur on their tails so to speak in the end admiral badir and the fleet were able to shut down the nanite factory and the scourge was defeated after that came reconstruction terraforming the nanite devastated worlds building new worlds to mitigate the overcrowding on our existing worlds integrating all of the new species that had arrived during the war and new powers arose in the aftermath the communist robots had taken damage but they were able to quickly rebuild and become a force to almost rival us of course by that time our allies were many and so they kept to their side of the galaxy the angry geckos were left with one planet and yet they still continued to send hateful taunts every so often anyway super game love it 10 10 feels like a narrative and not another starcraft match no shade if that s your thing but i feel like there are a lot more games out there like that so that makes this one special runs on linux too so i don t have to yeet over to windows if i wanna take a break
