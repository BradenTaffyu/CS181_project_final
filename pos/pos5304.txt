2017 my original review for this game was lets face it i ve been pretty terrible so i decided to rewrite it fallout 4 is good the story is subpar and quite honestly uninteresting but the game play is fun it has the bethesda feel take that how you want and music is very good similarly to skyrim this game definitely excels with mods i found myself enjoying the game more just exploring the wasteland listening to the music in game than crawling through the story honestly i was level 25 before i even found nick valentine the dlc for the game is very mediocre and most of it should have been an update quite honestly nuka world is odd but a cool setting far harbor is actually really great getting the goty on sale will definitely make you feel better about purchasing the game other fallout games are better sure new vegas was phenomenal but i find myself coming back to this one more often
