2023 this review is for anyone coming from baldurs gate 3 this game is a masterpiece it controls a lot like bg3 but has some major differences mostly in mechanics it has its own rules set to follow and it is a joy to learn it s not as cinematic as bg3 but it still has its own charm i highly recommend playing it
