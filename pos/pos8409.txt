2019 has it occurred to any of the intellectually challenged people downvoting this amazing game that the devs planned for a year of free content and then moving on but wanted to stick with the game and needed to charge if they wanted to do that beyond the first year or that sales slumped too much to be able to do free dlc while still developing the game not to mention that downvoting a game because you re angry at change that has no effect on the present game you ve bought is completely misleading and childish if we were talking paid loot box content in the present game i d grant you a point but this downvote the upcoming dlc not the core game god i hate people plans change some promises have to be broken because reality you re the kind of people who get furious when politicians flip flop due to changing conditions grow up this is an excellent game upvoting so that it counters these challenged individuals downvoting it en masse for dubious cheap entitled and selfish reasons this is an incredibly emotional wonderful experience and the devs have already handed out quite a lot of free dlc which improved this masterpiece immensely
