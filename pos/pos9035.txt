2017 stellaris is another one of paradox masterpieces anyone can judge the paradox policy of creating dlc content themselves i for myself am okay with that since it more often than not means support and updates for games that have been out for years see crusader kings 2 which still gets dlc to this day so this review is for the game stellaris and not for the company policies of paradox stellaris is a 4x type space colonization strategy game in pausable real time daily ticks the main game is no clear cut story driven campaign as in many strategy games and the game does not feature a story mode like for example campaigns in total war games instead you write your own story and history unbound by preset provinces etc similar to sid meier s civilization just not turn based you start off by creating your very own empire or by randomizing it if you want the surprise factor or are just lazy you have the ability to choose an appearance for your species from many partially animated portrait sets that will represent your population and leaders throughout the game you customize the appearance of your space ships cities the type of climate your species desires on their colony worlds from arctic over ocean to desert climate 9 in total and set what your civilisations original way of ftl travel is some of these choices are cosmetic others actually have a deep impact on the game not to forget you set your species traits based on a trait point system and customize your initial government type through the selection of an authority level like e g democracy or dictatorship etc and ideology traits like e g xenophile or militaristic etc as well as fitting civic policies you start the game in a galaxy which s size and properties you can chose beforehand and begin your exploration by controlling your ships building new ones researching technology and colonizing planets or your expansion or your domination of the galaxy you will run into anomalies alien species and realms both sentient and non sentient space fairing and primitive empires and enclaves always forced to make decisions some decisions you can only take when your empire has a certain ideology purge indigenous species on colonized planets other events happen because of the technologies you have researched an ai rebellion for example this way you advance through the years build up your empire form an intergalactic federation or just conquer it all the victory conditions are just that dominate or unify you can either play the game casually just enjoying the ride or min max every aspect of the game something the game actually allows you since you can see every little number percentage and even customize your warships to the single plasma cannon the game is technically up to the standards shows no bugs at this point that i am aware of the occasionally confused ai is only a very minor issue and certainly not game breaking and it is constantly updated and the dlc will keep pouring in for the next months probably years to come if paradox keeps its course i can recommend this game to every strategy gamer and since this is not turn based even to rts fans since the multiplayer actually demands a certain skill level and knowledge of the games features to respond to threats in time that can even tickle the fancy of deep core rts players the game allows for a peaceful approach with few wars and conquests as well as for a militaristic domination and so even the more relaxed players can enjoy this game just laying back and managing their growing commonwealth without need for military action solving a crisis or the other and befriending everyone the game has an incredible depth but allows you to go easy on some of these elements until you actually want to learn about them but gives you constant nudges to try them out in the form of events and problems which could be solved more efficiently by diving in deeper into the game than before
