2023 in the grim darkness of the far future there are only bugs to their credit owlcat have finally released a game that is not an unplayable mess on launch most of the bugs with the unity engine are gone and since this is not pathfinder there s no smattering of 2000 different ability bugs either however the few bugs that do exist are quite annoying if you are willing to work around them this is actually a far better game than either of their two previous pathfinder ones the system works and this is probably the best adaptation of warhammer 40k in a video game to date the story is decent and the game does credit to both the grim dark aspect of the setting as well as the 80s thatcherite britain part of it that being said if you ve played zero tabletop 40k rpgs it can be somewhat convoluted but if you ve played even a little bit of it you will understand how everything works very quickly and there s far less min maxing required than in pathfinder 10 10 would succeed in a lore warp check only to get the perplexed debuff again edit after 70 hours weeeell i was wrong on this one there were bugs up to chapter 3 but they could be addressed with workarounds from chapter 4 onwards though the bugs actually brick your playthrough and you cannot even proceed without using toybox to mod if you have enough spare time to get all the way to chapter 4 before they start patching it don t just wait for more patches if you do not you will pull your hair when your playthrough is bricked by things like having no exit from an area and other such things the game is great still this is why we put so many hours into it but it turns out that rather than trying to fix bugs they just focused on making the start of the game viable and then left chapter 4 and on in a state that was not really ready for release example bugs jae heinrix and cassia quests that last one actually gets you stuck in an unexitable room
