so great game but my god it has an unreasonable learning curve having to manage a empire across multiple maps is already hard enough with the games lack of explanation of how to play but your entire save and hours of work can just go down the toilet because the ai just spams military ships faster than you and just decides war is the option two saves so far lost to this bit frustrating giving it another go now i know more how to play feels like i m 70 hours in and constantly having to google how this game works 6 10 right now potential for 10 out of 10 once i get the mechanics down 3 out of 10 for accessibility to new players
