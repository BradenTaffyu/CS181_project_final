2016 introductionat first glance it might look like a simple 2d clone of harvest moon but the game gives more than what meets the eye as someone who has been immersed with the gameplay for almost a week now the only thing that i could say is to bid farewell to your personal life and have fun gameplaythe game starts off with you talking to your grandfather and him handing over a letter that will give you the chance to change your lifestyle in the future if you ever so desire years later on you are living in the city and working as an employee of a grand corporation named joja corporation but feeling empty inside that was then when you remembered what your grandfather left you and took the chance to start a new life with nature welcome to stardew valley in this game you play as a village farmer who inherited the land from your grandfather after the introduction you will also start with the basic version of tools that you need for growing and maintaining your farm which can be upgraded with the required items and money through the town s blacksmith and some cash to purchase the things you need which is basically money to buy seeds each season will cycle on a 28 day basis which also has you limited on the crops that you can sow and harvest aside when growing them inside the greenhouse weather also changes depending on the prediction from the forecast which will help you on planning the tasks you need to do as the game progresses aside from the farm you can also interact with the other villagers npcs by either helping them out from a certain request or by giving them gifts which will help you in befriending them or even be intimate only for those who have the single word below their icon on your list if your relationship level is high enough but not only that you can also fish mine ores find and donate artifacts raise farm animals turn your crops or goods into products forage fruits and flowers or even explore dangerous caverns and mines and become a true adventurer the prostons of content there are tons of things to work on this game aside from farming may it be socializing with other people fishing excavating and exploring the mines etc this attribute pretty much sums up most of the great things this game as to offer which also contributes to the second factor immersive gameplay i am not really certain which feature is the most prominent factor that makes this game addicting but i am confident to declare that each and every single one of them works in harmony to bring out the best for its players great audio the soundtracks made for this game really fits the theme of each and every scenario it has to offer not only the soundtracks but also the ambience effects really make up the feel as a whole the sound of the animals the rustling of the plants and flow of the water are just some to enumerate the consminor bugs and game errors though it might not be game breaking the game still has a fair amount of bugs and errors that could be a point to improve on some of the bugs that i have encountered are showcased on my screenshots so feel free to check it when you have the time too immersive gameplay you might think that this portion is a joke but i am dead serious about this for someone who works on a daily basis i really don t have the leisure of playing games like before when i was still studying i already spent my leaves for this month and cancelled a few meetings with friends and colleagues and i am expecting worse to come this game will take your time and if you don t have the will to sacrifice it then at least stay away until you have some kind of long vacation repetitiveness this is most likely the nemesis of every simulation game after every year there will be small additions to the cycle of the game to make it fresh as long as possible but it is still inevitable that you will reach a stage where you can say that you have played enough final thoughtswell i ll just save you the time and get straight to the point if you ever had that one bit of interest when you saw this game do not hesitate and get it rating 9 8 10 this review was submitted for elite giveaways check us out for more reviews ranging from indie games to aaa games
