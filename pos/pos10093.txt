2017 early access review rimworld is a survival base builder it s one of those game s where each play through would be quite different than the last one it s quite addictive in its base building resource management and invader defence mechanics even though still in early access it s highly polished the game runs smooth given the amount of calculations it has to make i run around 30 mods with almost no frame drops current content in vanilla game is very satisfactory but can be expanded further with hundreds of awesome community mods available in workshop the game has a lot of future potential so a must buy for any survival sandbox lovers
