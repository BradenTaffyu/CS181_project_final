2019 dont buy the hate i want you to goto your games library and find all your rts games now do a rough estimate of what it cost to buy them including any dlc you may have bought now just generally compare them they are most likely not that different from each other now imagine if you could have a rts game were each faction seemed like a game in and of itself that is this game at first glance the dlc and pricing seem crazy then i found it on sale and grudgingly bought the whole shebang if you love rts games like me and i have played dozens i will just say it will be a long time before i play any of the other ones on my list to me and many others it is worth ever penny at full price even if you buy wh1 which i did not long after i bought wr2 i would bet it would still cost less then all the other rts games in your library when you add in the mortal relms dlc were you can play all the wh1 and wh2 factions on 1 map the replay value goes up to hundreds if not thousands of hours do i recommend this game hell yes
