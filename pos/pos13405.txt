2020 i started playing this game forever ago with my friend and we just laughed for hours at the rockets exploding in amazing ways it was fantastic when i bought it on steam i started to try make the rockets work and from that moment i was hooked it is simply the most rewarding yet frustrating game i ve ever played there is nothing quite like completing a mission that you have tried and failed on so many times i can t recommend this game enough
