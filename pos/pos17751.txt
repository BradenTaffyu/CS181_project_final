2023 coming off the back of the early access i was excited for the game it s effectively a sequel to troy so if you didn t like the way they did bronze age warfare in that game you won t like this conversely if you re interested in trying a different style of game more infantry centric than past ones give it a go the campaign mechanics are probably the richest we ve seen yet barring three kingdoms and the game runs smooth as butter and is very well optimised overall recommended ca sofia do good work and i hope they carry this forward and keep innovating in their next title
