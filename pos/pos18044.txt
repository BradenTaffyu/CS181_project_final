2018 base game s campaign is crap boring overly hard without reward and generally unfun so why do i recommand it three letters dei divide et impera makes this game do a complete about turn oh boy dei makes this game bloody amazing well at least to me i have played many different nations etc in campaign and i still ain t bored hell i haven t even conquered the world yet although i m working on that radious was good as well however that is now sadly out of date but dei is still alive and kicking and don t think dei is gonna take it easy on your backside cause it won t it s even harder then the unmodded campaign but unlike unmodded dei s ones are actually fun wiping your enemies pathetic exsistence from the face of the earth never gets old 9 10 if you add mods although if you are here soley for the custom battles i actually do find stock unmodded custom battles to be more fun then dei or radious s ones now go crush your puny foes and melt all their gold so you can erect a statue in your likeness in their captial city disclaimer you can t actually do this you just have to use your imagnation
