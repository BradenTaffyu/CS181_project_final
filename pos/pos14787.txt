2021 from kingdom to monarchy from empire to republic from tribe to civilization theme of the game for us lovers of history in reality however the game has no direct competition that can take you through human history in a more entertaining way and can only be compared to its own predecessors in such an extensive work probably everyone will find one or two things they would like otherwise it was no exception for me i found a lot of things that managed to spoil my mood and the impression of the game at first i was irritated by the childish and loving style of the characters after all history was one big massacre and not some gay pride then i began to realize that there were no such banalities as the map of our world where i played hundreds of hours in civ 5 or the exchange of permanent builders for temporary or hundreds of annoying and hard to achieve achievements i was also bothered by the simplified graphics of the game so that even cheap computers can play i m sorry about this but i didn t put thousands of euros in the game set for playing small games the bar was just set damn high and civilization 6 is a successful addition to this series but my expectations have been elsewhere 60
