2018 i ve hesitated for a really long time to write a review for nier automata thanks to the 2018 steam awards for the motivation not only because it is a game that is so hard to review properly and not only because it weaves all of its narrative threads uniquely multi layered gameplay elements and masterfully timed pacing together so perfectly without ever missing a beat but because it is a game that made me reconsider what games as storytelling can do and just what incredibly powerful and affecting stories they can tell in that regard but to go into the details of the hows and whys would really do you and the overall impact of the game s story a true disservice after all of my time with nier automata including my 100 hours spent on the ps4 version i absolutely must urge you to go into the game as blindly as possible i know it s easy to scroll through review after review trying to decide if a game is right for you though so i ll just say that if you re a fan of jrpgs hack and slash games with gameplay that just feels right soundtracks that will get stuck in your head months after playing games that aren t afraid to mess irreverently with their established universe philosophy and games that ponder android robot autonomy bleak yet beautiful post apocalyptic worlds unforgettable moments dialogue setpieces characters and games you ll keep thinking about long after you ve finished them then nier automata is for you that said while i do wholeheartedly recommend nier automata itself for the reasons i listed i unfortunately can t recommend the pc port without mods and a controller it really is necessary really the game is essentially unplayable unless you re lucky enough to not have issues with your resolution and find playing with a mouse and keyboard doable after going through nier automata s opening sequence so absolutely do get the game but download the far fix automata resolution mod by kaldaien if you re having problems with your resolution output it s really a shame that the developers still have not released any patches to support what is otherwise an incredible game but that mod is there if you need it nier automata is one of those games that redefines what storytelling through gameplay means as i said above but it is also one of those games that begs the clich phrase more than a game to be used because that s really what it is it s not perfect by any means and even if you can tick all of the boxes of my criteria listed above that s no guarantee that you ll love or even enjoy the game or that it will become as special to you as it has for so many other reviewers and players out there but at its heart nier automata has done what few other games dare to and for that i absolutely believe it deserves to be recognized it is not afraid to ask you questions and satisfyingly leave you to answer them yourself it is more than a game because it truly is one of those games that wants to be seen as such and everything it does with all of its facets working in such beautiful cohesion to take you on its journey is done so so expertly perhaps because it does not fear the weight and pressure of being subject to such an infamous phrase in a time where few others can say the same it truly is more than a game nier automata is decisively an experience and it deserves every single moment it asks of you to tell its story
