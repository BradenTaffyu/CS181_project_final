2017 early access review lili s score card1 stay away2 not recommended3 only recommended when on sale4 recommended5 highly recommended6 this is a must playwhen my friend first gifted me this game i thought right away i hate zombie games so i probably play this for a few minuites and then find a way to tell my friend that i don t want to play anymore i opened the game and honestly the first thing that hit me was wow the graphics are amazing yes if you run them low then they are going to be looking but the amount of effort put into the graphics alone was just great i started to play for the first few minuites trying to find my friends doing all the starter quests figuring out how to avoide zombies and they are alot of zombies normally in most games during day and night time zombies are like meh for open sandbox worlds but they were so many everywhere i think my friend had the extra zombie option on honestly as a person who is super duper afraid of zombies i really enjoyed that there was alot more to this game then just zombies survival is huge in this game anything can kill you ive died to pretty much everything and anything my first death was to a tree falling on top of me then when you break your leg i swear you would rather be dead then have to walk everywhere you can bleed out die of infection die from falling drowning eating something thats bad for you ofc zombies zombie dogs zombie bears zombie zombies plus the range of type of zombies is very intresting you have ofc the basic zombies who dont do anything much other then try to kill you then you have fereal zombies who can run fast even during the day time then you have zombie spiders who can crawl up anywall and crawlers who can break your legs zombie bees who create hordes and zombie screamers who look like the little girl from the ring who will scream a horde into exsistance on top of that in the next patch they will be adding zombies who are like from attack on titan who will distroy bases the game might be called 7 days to die but honestly i should be called how many times can i die because it never ends scratch that that was a lie you will die no matter what even if you beat the first 7 days and the 2nd 7 days the rivers dry up the animals die out the trees dissapear the zombies gets stronger every single day the more you play the worse it gets after a while the food you stock up dissapears the water and drinks you secure drie up the snow melts the earth becomes a scorched wasteland and then finally the zombies eat you and no matter how many times you respawn there will be nothing left to do because the earth is dead and you are dead inside and the zombies dont care and its great its amazing 10 10 game theres a few diffrent ways you can play the game 1 with the same type of map over and over again 2 random gen so you will never know what you get and 3 solo play with a smaller map size on top of that you are able to control how long days and nights are and how many people you want in your server or how many you do not want in your server the only downside to this game is that its pretty hard to run if your computer is sorry for the weird review its my first one but i hope you enjoyed it if your gonna play this game add me i definetly want more friends to play with d
