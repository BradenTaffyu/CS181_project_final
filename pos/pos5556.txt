early access review after making my first bulk card box at the workbench it automatically paces the bulk card box in your hands the problem is i have no shelf space to put it down you cannot put it on the ground or back on the workbench you can only place it on a shelf i decided to wait it out until there was an empty shelf the problem is my employee is set to restock and i have a ton of inventory i can not access the employee dialog or phone to stop him from restocking with the bulk card box in my hands i then decided i would just let my employees run the store for a few days until i ran out of stock and a free shelf space opened up but again a problem occurred after ending the day and starting the next day i still have the bulk card box in my hand so i can not turn the sign from closed to open so in conclusion i am soft locked on that save for the moment i hope the developers read these a potential fix could be allowing us to put the bulk card box on the ground like other boxes or allow us to place it back on the workbench until space is made available on a shelf that being said i still recommend the game i am not angry about this bug i know that this is a very fresh early access game and these are the types of things that early access is meant to catch so they can be fixed i absolutely love this game and the developers have done great work so far i will be starting a fresh save after posting
