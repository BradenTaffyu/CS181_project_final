2023 limbus company is the third game in project moon s dystopian setting and it s the first to struggle to follow up on the innovations the previous entries introduced to their respective genres it s a game that squirms against the constraints of the gacha model and ends up as a somewhat confusing experience both for fans of the series and fans of the genre pros cons strong visual style that has only ever improved since lobotomy corporation the user interface is a nightmarish mess of submenus and often struggles to convey even basic information tight story focus that is reminiscent of library of ruina music and the general atmosphere are interwoven with the ongoing narrative narrative pacing suffers due to the needed episodic structure of a live service gacha design the current balance is very f2p friendly due to a focus on character specific skillsets over gear and raw stats of unlockable characters likewise this devalues the usual appeal of gacha games rolling on banners isn t an exciting experience because of the limited character cast and the lack of clarity in what you are actually gaining in power miscellaneous thoughts the difficulty curve feels inconsistent this is partially due to the design of the user interface which makes interacting with your skills very obnoxious but also has misleading power connotations character rarity once you finish the current story 20 hours at the time of writing there is little reason to interact with the regular missions due to a lack of rewards instead most progress seems to lie within a peripheral game system called mirror dungeons and the battle pass technical issues and performancewhile the game crashed once in the main menu i have not otherwise encountered bugs or issues that being said the game does have a tendency to have rather lengthy loading times and to be a bit unresponsive to your mouse the latter is solely the case during combat as you drag a chain from the left of your screen to the right this is a visualization of the game s combat system but in actuality it feels more like it is merely hamstrung by the need to cater to mobile devices graphics and soundgraphically limbus company is almost a straight upgrade from library of ruina despite being a mobile game characters are in general more detailed and there is a respectable variety in the new combat animations due to the game unlike other gacha only featuring a limited cast of characters their artwork and skins are also more glamorous than some genre competitors many story sequences carry over the trend of featuring cg which unlike lor seems to switch art styles occasionally and thus may feel jarring during certain moments in the story the sound design is once again one of the highlights especially mili s tracks that accompany the ends of the different chapters with their lyrics tying back into the plot dialogue is delivered confidently albeit once again only with a korean voiceover and combat at large feels more impactful than before due to what feels like a big increase in the feedback of weapons hitting your opponents gameplay and gacha designwhile lc improved or at least maintained the quality of lor in terms of its presentation the game grinds up a lot against the restrictions that a gacha title brings with it the core gameplay is still the same you have control over one to six characters the sixth being limited to a guest character from your friends and have a selection of two abilities per round that replace the deckbuilding aspect from before effectively this means that each character still comes with a deck of abilities but the player has lost the ability to customize it in favor of needing to roll for an entire skillset through the gacha system in addition to the abilities effects and damage type skills are now also associated with a sin and effectively tie into a rather loose combo system that simply rewards picking skills of a similar category multiple times per turn this feels annoying at the best of times due to both the sheer lack of tactical decisions to be made per turn as well as the clunky u i disallowing you from just reading each ability before selecting them strictly in order as they will fire during actual combat while both lobotomy corporation and library of ruina featured fairly infamous difficulty curves limbus company is remarkably generous and even with your baseline characters you will have little trouble clearing the current chapters the focus here seems to clearly be providing a story focused experience rather than the slow but rewarding gacha progression which makes me question who this game is supposed to be for as mechanically it merely is a thinned out library of ruina while seemingly not understanding the appeal of gacha games altogether mirror dungeons are a fresh addition and are lc s strongest recurring gameplay loop essentially they represent randomized dungeons with enemies from the previous chapters and are entirely separated from your actual progression in terms of identities and character levels instead every other tile you explore grants you passive power ups story and settingin limbus company you are dante a man whose face is replaced by a clock with the ability to fairly literally pull sinners your characters from hell it ties back into events from both lobotomy corporation and ruina and features three chapters currently available the issues here are twofold firstly and more prominently the game is tethered to a live service design while being quite story focused this means lengthy content droughts between chapters that may make it hard to stay interested throughout its development the other issue is a thematic one whereas the previous titles used intertextuality as a way to convey thematic elements of the story limbus company is very literal religious iconography is now canonized as part of the worldbuilding through characters that are immediately tied to relevant mythology one way to put this would be to call it style over substance instead of intertextuality as a means to convey underlying elements of the presented story limbus pushed your face into a book and asked whether you got it yet gregor is a man with a bug arm it s kafka s metamorphosis you know kafka right dante and vergil ishmael what a cool name and it s from literature too this is deep and profound in actuality none of it feels like it adds anything meaningful to the overarching story that would work just as well without it final thoughtswhereas both lobcorp and lor managed to innovate in their respective genres limbus simply writhes in the constraints of its own every design decision feels entirely counter to any sort of gacha a genre that has an understandably bad reputation but can work in a game s favor as can be seen in the more accomplished titles like arknights or azur lane in the end i am not sure who limbus is actually for fans of their previous games will see a stripped bare library of ruina that seems to struggle to add anything worthwhile to the established story and world while also lacking the appeal of other gacha games nevertheless project moon has offered a competent roadmap going forward and if you can stomach the slow pacing you ll find limbus to be a fairly decent story experience due to its f2p friendly design though naturally the underlying predatory monetization elements are still there much like wonderlab and distortion detective it s a fair enough game to reach for if you merely want more of project moon s world greed truly is the strongest sin
