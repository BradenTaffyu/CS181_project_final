2019 ok i ll put it simply i thought the hype was too much i got this game 15 days ago and basically haven t played anything else 76 6 hours on record yes that s almost like a fulltime job i got to stop staying up until midnight slaying the spire deck building artifact gathering turning into a ghost or vampire or a ghost vampire d great variety makes me eager for just one more run each run is satisfying yet makes you thirsty for more
