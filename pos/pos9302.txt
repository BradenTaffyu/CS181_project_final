2016 product received for free updated for 2 0 apocalypseits no secret that i love stellaris and while a lot of the changes for apocalypse are pretty sweeping especially wormhole travel almost every single one has grown on me in a positive way video text 2 0 makes a ton of sweeping changes and the two biggest are the way faster than light travel works and how warfare works all other changes mostly tie into how these two have made that possible first now there is only hyperlane travel instead of the three options that were there previously and while this is hard to swallow i know i always played with wormholes as mine the resulting changes due to this restriction is amazing now systems have predefined locations where they connect to meaning you can create defensive bottlenecks and even more important you need be smart about your expansion plans because traveling between systems for your fleet might take quite a bit longer than previously you re going to need to make sure you can actually defend what you claim about that claiming its changed that each system now needs a outpost like building which ties into how borders work as borders only spread to systems you actually claim meaning that no longer are borders vague blobs that grow by the magic of lala land they are controlled these outposts are also the building you upgrade to make them into strongholds where you can have orbital defenses multiple shipyards and the like in them meaning shipyards are no longer bound to planets and you can position yourself in places that are important strategically regardless of the planets available this is especially amazing for habitat tech players further due to this further changes in armies and warfare restrict fleet size change how the stack of death works ie fixes it a bit but not fully and how movement works a lot of new options for strategic gameplay are available this does a 180 degree turn in how to plan your empire and its damn fantastic though players much smarter than me will judge combat balance i found myself playing a more controlled game with less guesswork than previously the changes don t stop here and i strongly suggest checking out the video but new changes to exploration technology sub light speed travel and many small changes to ship upkeep upgrading fleet management are also added there is a ton of stuff and almost all of it good the bad the already slow midgame seems to have slowed down further which i don t like also diplomacy while more important than before hasn t received much love both are things that still need work but all in all i love this game and this expansion is an amazing addition if you enjoy the review do follow my curator feed or check out the various other reviews on youtube
