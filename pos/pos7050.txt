2022 when i was a very small boy in the early 1970s my mother bought me a book i do not know the name of the book since i could not yet read but i ve always remembered it as the big book of trucks within the pages of that book as you might imagine were very detailed paintings of various trucks pumper trucks garbage trucks cement trucks and of course tractor trailer combo trucks the book absolutely fascinated me for several years or so it seemed time passes differently for youngsters than it does for adults and up until the age of 12 or so every time an adult asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up the inevitable answer was a truck driver seeing the movie smokey and the bandit and living through the late 70s cb craze just reinforced the notion in my head fast forward to the age of 17 and i enlisted in the marine corps for the simple reason that it was the most expedient way to get out of my hometown and on my own after several years in the infantry i got out and went to college majoring in engineering i ve now spent 30 years in the construction industry rising to the position of executive vice president i am by the measures of society a very successful man but every time an over the road owner operator drops off a load at our shop i watch with green eyed envy as he pulls out of the parking lot heading for his next load and the open road every single time that happens i think of the junior college down the street that offers a six week truck driving course since i do not wish to drop a zero off the end of my income however i sigh and walk back into my office to deal with the thousand problems awaiting me but my mind is on the highway in this game the developers have given me the greatest gift anyone can present to another person the fulfillment of a fantasy on the weekends i can hole up in my home office and run a trucking company driving a rig across many states while listening to a stream of current pop music which i d otherwise never hear i am transported to a different time and place in which i am once again young where my future is not set and the world is my oyster i quite literally cannot put a price on that gift from the bottom of my heart i thank you scs
