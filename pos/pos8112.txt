2014 early access review just awesome the game or simulator that you always dreamed where you can crash cars and see them destroy realistically in real time with beautiful environments and with a friendly and big community that has released ton of mods including vehicles terrains scripts and more i totally recommend it at this stage and seeing the potential it has even more i ve played this since it was available to but in the official site
