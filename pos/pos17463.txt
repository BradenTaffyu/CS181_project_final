2019 really enjoyable game i haven t had this much fun with a total war game since med 2 i love how each warlord plays a bit differently and the starting positions really matter this game runs great so far on my 5 1 2 year old computer i only had one crash in almost 21 hours of play hopefully the new patch that just came out doesn t ruin the game currently waiting on it to stop downloading file checking i see a lot of posts of people complaining about this new patch excellent graphics sound and gameplay can t wait for some mods and expansions update still loving the game it appears the patches have fixed the yuan shao vassalize everyone and their brother issue experienced one bad crash the other night but still pretty stable it will be interesting to see where they go after all of the patches are complete for folks giving negative reviews of the game give it a little bit ca needs time to properly patch the game and create some expansions i don t get bad reviews after a game was just released i understand if the game was crappy but it s far from that however i do agree that there are too many generic portraits in the game but this is an easy fix by modders or ca
