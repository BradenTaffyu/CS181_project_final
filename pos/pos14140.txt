2020 you are in control of some duplicants small humanoid creatures that work for you in the middle of some asteroid hollowing it out and building a base in it with various machines and other tidbits that enable them to survive and do what they re supposed to do always carefully watching that there s enough breathable oxygen in your base and that it doesn t get too hot and that there s not too many germs making them sick and a thousand other tiny things that make your dupes die and dupe is a pretty apt name for the little critters because they are about as stupid as they can be if there is a way to screw something up rest assured that they will find it and take it but that aside the game is cute the graphics functional and even cuter and most importantly your success does not depend on doing something perfectly there is room for experimentation and toying with the base layout and you are not required to build the perfect base just to be allowed to succeed let your creativity flow
