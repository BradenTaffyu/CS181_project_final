2021 gotta say this is probably the best game to be able to experience cars that i can recommend iracing gets too expensive and forza is a great game but its a simcade if you want a full simulation to experience cars the closest that you can to the real thing this is your game you can have races you can just chill and run laps and the modding support for this game is absolutely incredible me and my friends had a drift session which was fun an f1 session and everything in between if you have a wheel the force feedback in this game is the best ive tried so far for sure so whether youre drifting in the mountains of akina in an ae86 racing the oval in a nascar or narrowly escaping the wall in the tight monaco circuit in an f1 car which can range from the 50s to the 2020s this game is the best way to experience it alone or with friends
