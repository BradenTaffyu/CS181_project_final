2018 euro truck simulator 2 american truck simulatorin terms of gameplay the two games are essentially the same game the only real difference is the map and the trucks regarding the map if you buy all the map expansions for both games the euro truck simulator 2 one is way bigger the map quality i would say is the same in both regarding trucks euro truck simulator 2 has more trucks more brands and more variety the dlc for euro truck is also better for that reason if you are only willing to buy one game i d say buy euro truck simulator 2 i have the two games and the reason for that is after so many hours of play map diversity is important for me and the fact american truck simulator lets me drive in a new environment was reason enough to buy but that s it to be honest i see ats like a glorified map expansion to ets2 the appealon the surface this game doesn t seem to have a lot to offer you just do deliveries over and over again this was my first impression of the game when it was launched but out of curiosity i decided to buy fast forward a few years and euro truck and this game are my most played games on steam at the time i m writing this for me the appeal of the game is that is very relaxing after you get used to the controls you ll find that the game doesn t require a lot of mental focus most of the time this makes the game a perfect background for activities that do require some of your mental focus like listening to listen to podcasts or listening to music while paying attention to the lyrics or maybe you just want a peaceful environment to think about stuff in your life or fight depression simplikation com this game can provide you that environment i usually play this game while listening to podcasts music or when i just want to relax and think about stuff gameplaythe gameplay is fairly simple you just drive your truck around europe and do deliveries trying to get money and develop your company while driving it s up to you if you want to obey speed limits and traffic lights or not but driving at high speeds and not obeying traffic lights will get you a fine it will also increase the chance of you getting an accident and damage your truck fines and repairs can be expensive and will slow down your progress developing your company this is specially important in the early game where you are the only driver in your company and your income is not great which means each fine and repair have a big impact in the late game when your company has more drivers to make money for you paying fines and repair costs will not be a problem really in the beginning you don t have your own truck so you ll be making deliveries for other companies which provide their own truck as you do these deliveries you ll earn xp and earn money little by little when you have enough money you can buy your truck and start your company that way as you get more and more money you can buy new garages and hire more drivers to make more money for you every time you level up you increase different skills which will help you use less fuel get more jobs and get more money and xp the truck you own is also important when you buy your first truck it s not a bad idea to choose a weak one since you don t have the money for a better truck but as you get more money you can upgrade your truck with better engine transmission chassis etc but you can also buy a new one other than that there s also a lot of customization to change the look of your truck the balance between simulation and arcadethis game is a perfect simulation between a simulator and arcade it is a simulator in the sense that a lot of physics on your truck concerning the engine breaking suspension and damage are simulated the sounds of the truck are sounds taken from real trucks the maps also try to represent the real locations but it is arcade since you don t really need to know a lot of controls like in other simulator games and even though the damage is simulated it s really not harsh most of the times which leaves a bit of room for error dlcthis game has lots of dlc and you may wonder if you really need all of it to get a full experience the answer is no you don t need all of it the base game is perfectly fine to give you a sense if you like the game or not if you are new i would say to start just with the base game which on sale can get really cheap if you like the game then i would suggest to get the map dlc s the map quality on the dlc s is very good good detail and different scenery in each one other than that there are the paint job packs pick just the ones you like there s also cargo dlc which introduces new cargo to deliver while it s nice to have new cargo for me it didn t made a huge difference gameplay wise buy if you like but i would say it s not really necessary don t feel you are missing out if you decide not to buy world of trucksthis game has an official companion site called world of trucks www worldoftrucks com you can make an account and in the game you can connect your profile to your world of trucks profile if you do this in the game you ll have the option to do external deliveries this deliveries are just like regular single player deliveries but its progress is tracked online and will appear on your world of trucks profile for that reason it s common for them to be called online deliveries the developers from time to time also do special events which require you to complete these online deliveries with some sort of special condition the rewards of these special event usually are cosmetic items for the game there are plans to also make world of trucks a place where you can start online companies and all sort of other online interactivity your profile on world of trucks can also be used for euro truck simulator 2 multiplayerthis game doesn t offer multiplayer but there is a popular mod which does in my opinion the mod has its problems and you ll probably encounter people who will just ram everyone with that said i had fun moments in multiplayer and it is worth considering
