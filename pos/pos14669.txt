2020 the platinum edition vi is once again a masterpiece after more than 100 hours i like it even more than civ v because it has some fresh approaches for example districts or disasters climate which have an interesting new impact on the gameplay just don t fall into the money trap to buy the base game and every single dlc initially when they come out be patient and wait for the platinum edition since especially the expansions always enhance the complexity of the gameplay in a way the base game alone just can not compete with play the platinum edition vi until the platinum edition vii arrives repeat win
