2016 so this game was responsible for converting my non gamer girlfriend and i finally got my hands on it the short version farm fight friendship romance profit easily one of the best experiences in gaming i ve had in 2016 stardew valley baffles with wonderment in a masterfully crafted homage to the hm franchise also bloody amazing piece of work for one human being to make on their own 9 5 10 the looong version what hasn t been said about stardew valley it s a loving callback to the golden age of the harvest moon series sure but what makes stardew valley stand out from being an hm clone on the pc depth and modernity you can actually date before marriage whoever you want regardless of gender combat is functional adds to the sense of adventure this is a meaty experience that doesn t feel cheaply padded stories can touch on more adult concepts like substance abuse and abandonment mods give you an endless world of possibilitiesthat s brilliant that s modern with some less than stellar recent entries in the hm series and the bankruptcy of rune factory creators neverland co stardew valley offers gamers a beautiful immersive and yet simple experience of country life
