2022 this is one of those games where you ll need to have a solid long weekend or vacation coming up i m not to big on hearts of iron or any of those sorts of games but i can see why people find them addicting stellaris is a good segway for those who aren t interested in those types of games and like space games i didn t think i d get caught in the time trap but i did stellaris is essentially a space orientated rts type game the player has the ability to pause the game at any point this ability is a huge feature as the player will have to manage their empire accordingly and when it gets big a lot starts to go down there is a point where i had my empire stretch across the galaxy and was focusing on keeping enemies at bay on one side where a worm hole was and the other side where i was making my offensive as any rts type game there are loads of resources to acquire and research to discover as the player progresses so do their fleets armies buildings resource output and new opportunities like a slave processing facility the game took a steep turn here eventually the player makes first contact joins a galactic council can potentially make a federation or simply start spying on everyone the menus are a little overwhelming at first but all starts to make sense when the notification bubbles start popping up players can meddle in markets factions of governments assign leaders to government positions fleets scientists etc species management and gene management claims and other diplomatic options i felt this was a lot friendlier than when i tried hearts of iron the gameplay itself is good lots of management lots of pausing to look around where ships are placed lots of systems to explore lots of scientific discoveries to make and two major screens to do that all from players will spend most of their time looking at the map of the galaxy the other screen zooms into systems and allows players to view space battles or just have fun looking at planets and stars there aren t many spaceships to choose from and the leveling system jumps from ship to ship insane fleets can be created but the game seems to favour battleships when it comes to any battle some enemy fleets or rebel colonies manage to boost their armies to levels impossible for the player to intervene it seems if research isn t prioritised the player will have a difficult time in the game the game does a good job trying to keep balance but i feel at times this balance simply tips due to being slightly behind or in front technologically to other ai players there will be a few new game starts and a lot of what if saves further to genetic modification and even modifying slaves the player is able to create an empire of their own from a pool of species the visuals and graphics are appropriate the ship details and battle animations are average nothing super impressive or giant or weird explosions but the basic elements to see what is going on is there the universe isn t super pretty however the user interface may have been a playing factor as it makes navigating the game very easy without getting in the way the user interface i think was really well done everything is within a mouse click of the player and icons make it easy for new players to quickly recognise buildings and their functions descriptions are provided by hovering over the icons the sounds and music are okay i don t have much to say in this domain as i feel this domain is satisfactory there aren t big boom sounds but the player will constantly hear a lot of notification sounds in addition to briefing sounds when the game suddenly pauses i think this domain could ve used a little more work overall i would recommend a purchase on sale upon quickly playing the game i got sucked in very quickly and there went a few days it does have a learning curve at first but after starting a few new games the player quickly realises what is important to creating a proper space civilisation if you re skeptical i would do some research and see if the game sits well with you it s one of those games where if you play it on easy you can figure out the gimmicks once you do you still get thrown curve balls like the computer declaring war again maybe a fault of mine for not addressing the political situation it s tough to see the choices that are made impacts certain situations where the player is powerless in short good game could still use some fixing especially the lag effect the amount of dlc and the cost is also a little off putting rating 8 4 10 gameplay b story campaign b visuals user interface b sounds music c replay ability b overall b
