2014 very challenging historical battles managing provinces felt easier than previous titles particularly in terms of unrest added some logical features that make it more challenging like military attrition if you run out of food many differing factions which adds to variety in gameplay the way researching technology is managed felt like a step up from previous entries ui felt clunky and unpolished i found the game engine to be very unoptimized lots of bugs common complaint but too much of the game at release is locked so that you ll buy the dlc including about half of the historical battles systems for managing family and politics were lifeless additions to the game and unlike previous entries felt very forced and had little impact on how the game progressedlockeproposal s big day outcommunity groupcurator pageserious steam reviews subreddit
