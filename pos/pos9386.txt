2016 having spent 500 hours in the last 2 5 years i can say this is easily the best racing game ever and a true successor to the gtr2 category it is irritatingly realistic requires a lot of practise and epic patience to get your laps right and comes closest to the real thing earlier versions had optimisation issues but now assetto corsa is a charm and is a must have for all car guys racing fans there is a sense of achievement when you get your laps setups right pros 1 physics are bang on perfect if you are looking for realism this is as real as it can get it has reached a point where its painfully real for example you set your toes and cambers to tune the cornering it affects the temperatues inside outside and mid tread of tyre gets different temp and the suspension reactions you then fine tune the suspension which affects your previous toes cambers but mid way you realise your height spoilers anti roll bars and spring stiffenss need adjustment which you are able to perfect but when you run a lap it has all went to waste because the last update while being brilliant offsets something else completely ruining your whole life no corner is as easy as brakes steer accelerate out you ve to be aware about the tyre loading temperatues current fuel load and age of tyre before deciding on that ever fluctuating time to brake and to steer 2 a huge array of cars and tracks fulfills every guy girl helicopter s need in terms of car choice hatchbacks small sports cars japanese sports cars the only dlc i refuse to buy sedans suvs vintage cars vintage legends supercars hypercars gt4 gt3 gt2 and f1 and believe me each one of it has a completely different character and satisfies when you get it right tracks i agree are just about enough but can seem limited at times solution download more through various concerned sites 3 brilliant community support a lot of fantastic mods are available which are very welcome by the mod friendly nature of the game in addition there are lots of racing leagues being organised very professionally by players very much like iracing 4 very affordable pricing of the product even the dlc are completely affordable for even college students i feel the value for money factor is off the charts for assetto corsa cons 1 career mode starts off from the basic hatchbacks races and progresses upto the formula gt series in a very slow fashion whilst from a real life career pov is very real gets really boring in 2 3 hours i found it boring to establish expertise on fwd hatchbacks but it definitely helps you understand the basics of driving a car fast this progression gives you the feeling of differences in street vs race cars 2 engine sounds has always been a weakness of assetto corsa which has improved upto a certain extent yet still not on par with other racing games in the market solution mods available sound mods are simply brilliant and eradicate this issue completely google fonsecker if you want a jump start on sound mods in competition assetto corsa makes codemasters formula 1 look as real as mario kart project cars which is 5 times as costly to buy incl dlc doesn t come anyway near in terms of realism and assetto corsa doesn t come near pgc in terms of graphics iracing is the only real competitor to ac but loses out on pricing that thing is damn expensive nfs drive forza etc etc aren t in this league so no use comparing all in all just buy the game already if you ready to learn racing from the ground up even though you have won championships before and if you have a lot of patience there is nothing like assetto corsa it is a step ahead of every other game else
