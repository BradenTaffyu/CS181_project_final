2018 a worthy successor to theme hospital but take that with a grain of salt as it has all the bugs to go with it wish steam would allow you to do a so so recommendation as a yes or no answer doesn t always suffice pros builds upon the fun of theme hospital and gives you more to laugh at as your patients are litterally shaken to pieces getting their treatment there are more diseases that the patients can catch and the cure is often worse then the disease literally more stuff to put in the rooms and hallwaysstaff appears in the hiring window faster so you can build up your tortur errr medical staff quickerseveral new moneymaking gadgets for patients to play around with or buy from are added while waiting for the docs to see them the rat shooting is back though with hyperactive worms now must be a trademark problem training you don t have to wait to hire a consultant in the field that you want to train others in just bring in a contractor to train them cons some are know to older players of the game i know i m one of the old fogey s the ques are a pain in the butt it pretty much replicates the original down to all the problems it had this version doesn t seem to have copied the experience factor patients have to go through all the diagnostics before the doc figures it out used to have a gotcha factor in the old game where if a doc is exposed to a condition enough that they would figure it out and skip further diagnostics that used to cut down on the number of gp s needed but now you need a ton of them just to keep your hallways walkable now don t patients know how to sit anymore you ll have 1 or 2 patients in the que sitting down on the benches and chairs provided and the rest will be piled up in the middle of the hall the whine factor is much worse and i think it is a bug built my janitors up to 3 per piece of hardware and if you count plants it s pretty much 1 1 but the same janitors will be called out over and over causing them to tire out then threaten to quit just go to staffing click on everyone that is tired and then send them to take a break if you notice the ones that are the most tired worn out will be the janitors and the assistants both of them seem to be bugged no matter if you have far more then needed on the same note the slide bars don t seem to want to send people on break properly the docs and nurses seem to work better but they ll go en mass to the breakrooms no matter how rested or tired they are on shooting the worms it is even worse then shooting the rats on the original not the speed but the aiming and god forbid that the hallway is crowded the game seems to decide if it will allow you to actually shoot no matter how you aim your mouse and the standards are always changing if the hallway is crowded or you click near an item and you don t even have to actually be close to it the screen centers on that person or item if it is a person it will then drag your screen around it used to do that in the original but the tolerances were tighter even for an dos based program no real excuse for updated programming and heat is back with all the irritations that come with it haven t the programmers heard of central heat and air ducts would be a better modern fit as well as being easier to incorporate at least i haven t lost my touch with it the clown emergency is bugged every so often it will give you the emergency and no one will show up even if you re built to the gills on clinics it is the only emergency bug i ve noticed so far training is back and it is faster the only thing is that once you train someone you ll keep getting pop ups wanting to promote them you hire someone with the skills they go for about a year before wanting to be promoted you train someone they ll want promotions every couple months the other thing is it doesn t always let you know when someone can be trained to a higher level you can train 6 people on psychology then when you choose to have a class on psychology 2 only 4 as an example as it varies will show up as being trainable even though all 6 have training slots open and are still on staff reputation is bugged or completely wonky had a flowing hospital where lots of patients were being seen quickly and treated to the tune of 200k profit a month with 0 markup on prices lots of seats no real temp variances room quality was 4 or above plenty of things to do in the hall and pretty quick service ques of 4 or less employess were pretty happy pay satisfaction was low but roughly 50 yet my rep plummeted over the course of a year till it hit 8 rep patients kept coming though slower dropped me to about 50k profit then the rep went up as mysteriously as it dropped without doing anything all i was doing was going for the final star build lots of toilets at least 1 room with 3 in every building i d go with more but that would be a recommended minimum docs and patients don t seem to like traveling between buildings to drop a load even if it is 4 steps between buildings this also seems to go for breakrooms for your staff building limitations if the radiators came back you know they just had to bring back the odd shape buildings newer version not able to add onto buildings or construct them to the playes specs death a fact of life haven t reached the highest stages yet but the variations of treatments for disease seems to have been left out of this version a cure for one is a death sentence for another it seems to have been replaced by upgrading machines but that doesn t seem to have done anything from death striking randomly the ghosts are pretty funny when they re dustbustered up if you have a janitor trained in ghostbusting the awards ceremony an annoyance especially if you re in the middle of building a room even clicking on it to close it brings up the cancel the room tab it s pretty easy to keep track of when it is going to strike but still an annoyance on the same point you can t look at messages or hire people when you re in the middle of a build it will do the same research more limited then it was before you can t disect people like before as fas as i know of as i haven t finished yet you can t research subsets of a disease and you re limited to researching the equipment and waste a lot of time getting a pitiful grant or tokens to buy special items another bug that i ve been running into and it is random so far is that researchers even though assigned to research as their only job will disappear with the research incomplete and just walk the halls after taking a break this is with plenty of doctors to do everything else haven t noticed anything wrong with assigning people to only working one room except for research also co op research either isn t allowed or not allowed to work for me so it s basically one researcher per task conclusion worthy successor of theme hospital yes it still has the same bad puns of the original just more of them worth 30 not unless you re a fanatic for the original it just seems they updated the programming to match the newer os added a few more actions and gave you more stuff to play around with but there is still quite a bit of problems left from the original if i had been told it was just a mod for the original i wouldn t discount it but it is still fun to play after all these years and i still play theme hospital on a vm from the original disk i bought years ago in the bargin basket edit should have said staff box instead of sliding bar my head was still stuck up the theme hospital hole unfortunately you can t set priorities just rooms for staff and clicking on individual items to repair in this game and pathing sucks the higher up you get in a map
