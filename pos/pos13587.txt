2014 early access review one of if not the best early access games on the market the updates are fairly frequent and always add something new and exciting the devs are always willing to listen to the community to and will often hire popular modders to work on the game officialy incorporating the mod into the game itself with some changes for uniformity and game balance the game itself is excellent and although it can be challenging to beginners that s mstly due to the accuracy that space is portrayed in this game it almos perfectly emulates zero g environments and orbital mechanics despite this once you understand the basics the game is simple enough to reward experimentation yet challenging enough to require it i cannot recommend this game highly enough at time of writing verion 0 9 0 has just dropped oficially bringing the game into beta
