2015 this pulled me away from csgo i like driving games in general and this was going cheap on steam so i thought what the hell im now a proud owner of a rather pimped up volvo fh with 800 bph and 7 employees what makes this game even more puzzling is its converted most of the guys on ts as well after they heard me playing all evening without swearing about snipers very relaxing great graphics and alot of fun
