2018 nier automata is one of the most incredible games i have played the gameplay is a very fun action jrpg hack and slash although i mostly spammed a few buttons i still found it quite enjoyable and engaging some of the bosses were a blast to fight the story is incredible although has a slow start things don t get too interesting until one of the playthroughs later in the game but when it gets going it gets really good it has a very thought provoking story to it that really makes you think it s not the kind of story you would see in an everyday action jrpg i highly reccomend you don t stop playing after the first ending you will be missing out on 2 3 of the game s story the soundtrack is also incredible one of my favorites being the amusement park dynamic w vocals there are so many songs in this game that are very memorable and they go well with every scene throughout the game go listen to it it s great the game also looks quite good there are some very breathtaking sights to enjoy while playing through the game although i do wish the buildings in the city ruins had more inside of them they felt a little empty but that s a minor complaint now here s something i do not like about nier automata it s pc port is pretty bad i got it to run fine even without the far mod but most of my friends could not run the game at all even though their specs are more than enough to run the game they tried the far mod still didn t work if you have a ps4 get it on there the game is guarenteed to run on there without issues so it s a safer bet if you can only get it on pc i d still reccomend giving this amazing game a shot refund the game if it doesn t run at all there is one certain boss later on in the game that absolutely murders the framerate which is annoying lower the settings down at that boss and then go back to the higher settings later on if you have that setup despite the pc port being terrible and the devs not caring to even patch the game i still reccomend this game if you can get it to run on your pc it s a purchase you will not regret
