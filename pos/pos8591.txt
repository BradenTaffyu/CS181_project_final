2020 555 hours of play love this game sure its has some bugs old ones get fixed new ones come up but the games fun to play and relaxing on the surface you just wonder round and shoot things but the more you play it and start to go after the better animals the harder the game becomes and you realize that its not about shooting everthing its got a sort of manage the heard built into it and need zones are the key to getting bigger critters on a side note killing bugged animals in game is a key feature you need to remove them from the spawn group to stop them passing there bug on to the next generation
