2016 if you have kids get this game for them if you don t have kids get this game anyway edit since this game finally reached it s final update and i want my dang steam awards badge i m just gonna update this to say that it s still great and considering all the bizarreness around on around ksp2 we very well may never have anything that surpasses it unless take two finds a way to kill the game without replacing it with a better one i m sure modders will continue to add more content far beyond the capacity for the game engine to even handle go explode some rockets how hard can rocket science be anyway
