2023 it s world of warcraft but star wars set in a time thousands of years before the original films when there s a lot of jedi and a lot of sith but if using the force isn t what you re after you can also play as a non force user on the side of either the republic or the sith empire regardless of what side you re on you can make light side or dark side decisions or choose to walk somewhere in between you can play with friends strangers or choose to focus on the single player stories there are hundreds of hours of single player stories for those like me who don t want to interact with players i don t know irl you can play for free to try it out but once you re past the first couple of planets playing with a subscription is where you see all the benefits whether it be various xp bonuses or customisation
