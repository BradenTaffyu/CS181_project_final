2017 i don t play stellaris that often but the main reason for that is that i often end up playing for 8 hours without a break when i do and the rest of my life suffers if i don t try to limit the frequency with which that happens especially because it really gets harder to survive those monster gaming sessions as i get older at this point i would say that stellaris is my favourite 4x strategy game its greatest strength for me is that i feel like the game offers a sufficient range of play styles and a huge range of choice that it excels in creating a sense of role playing different types of cultures i have to go back to alpha centauri for another 4x game i enjoyed for the character of different factions but stellaris goes about it completely differently rather than a selection of pre designed factions stellaris is an engine for countless variations of weird and wonderful sci fi civilisations clashing it s hard to recommend a game like this unequivocally as there a lot of moving parts and one person s elegant solution is a tedious annoyance or painful oversimplification but i feel like if you have an interest in science fiction and strategy games with play styles that facilitate role playing different fictional cultures then stellaris is well worth a look the tutorial makes this one of the most accessible strategy games paradox has published but it retains more than enough depth in its systems to continue to hold my attention going forward
