2019 ok since patch 1 0 4 i ve had no problems with this game i ve now also tried using it with triple screens and it works well and i don t have any complaints for the current triple screen support the online races i ve tried have also worked as expected so i can recommend this game in it s current state updating after release currently the game is a bit buggy compared to early access all content is released however the new content has introduced bugs where the game may crash or functionality doesn t work as expected i m hoping this is resolved but check the discussions to see how things are unfolding before buying probably don t pay full price and wait at least in its current state kunos has started rolling out patches and i m happy to say that while the sim still isn t perfect any of my issues seem to be resolved for now i don t use vr so i can t comment on vr performance but do use triple screens which is decent enough but not as good as iracing due to some very minor stretching on the side screens i really love this race sim if you re interested in racing gt3 s then this is a fantastic experience and one of my favourites i also play iracing assetto corsa and project cars 2 and this holds up to any of those titles when it comes to the racing there are a few things to consider as of now which is just prior to release triple screen support that you use in other titles is not available now due to limitations of the unreal engine it currently has a different implementation of how this works vr support is also not a good as other sim games so if vr and triple screen support are big priorities then you need to consider if this is for you also for those that are looking for iracing multiplayer style matching then this likely isn t for you either as multiplayer will be closer to ac1 for everyone else this is likely going to be a sim you enjoy
