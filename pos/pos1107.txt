2019 early access review quick and honest still can t get over the graphics gameplay is very sluggish it s a time consumer and clunky i m exited about the roadmap because the map feels entirely soulless at times which is intended yet i m missing observable in screen random events i m lacking npc s i m lacking a reason to do go out and do activities besides surviving the map is very large yet over time nothing really changes but what you the player touches you can respawn with a new fresh character in the same world after your character dies but i can t stop dreaming because this game man i can best describe it as a story generator similar to games like rimworld only now you are playing it by yourself in an interactive world the map google it is huge i mean once you get the hang of walking around and orientating yourself a little everything feels realistic with sims 1 graphics you aren t feeding yourself non stop drinking is passive soft off and requires only some attention going face to face with three or more zombies is asking for problems without the right weapons loot feels rare finding an axe feels like winning a jackpot they are rare for example this feels like a the walking dead simulator at times and that is a good thing hordes of in screen zombies building things securing a prison if you want deconstructing furniture to get nails having to close the curtains or create improvised ones so aimless zombies don t accidentally see you inside and start breaking in really having to be careful but still be able to outsmart or even use zombies to your advantage many traits talents to level up very risk reward character builder you do stop caring about your characters looks and name after a while haha but i kinda want more than it already gives in my ideal pz world there would be a lot more ai npc events to have allies have them tend to and defend your base house with all risks included have other npc s slowly create their own forts and fortified buildings and start to interact with the world start encountering people from other towns with extra people there are more mouths to feed so there is a little pressure to what you are doing systematic looting from houses isn t viable long term it creates diverse gameplay more than just nudge survive because my only downside to this game truly is you kinda know that you have to create your own situations yet after seeing some let s play s when you start mastering this game it still get s a little predictable some area s are too safe so they stop being fun if there was a system in place besides the sadistic ai for zombies that would create events that would push you to go to different places at different times say to rescue someone trade or help defend another community from a horde i mean what this games already gives is really great but a little niche for too many mainstream players i really tried convincing my friends and they love my stories when i tell them about my many characters but after seeing some gameplay nope this engine allows everything dayz and other games never really nailed everything in this game feels right after getting used to it leveling the moodles that affect your performance stats ingame traits positive and negative to for unique character builds that all contribute to a unique replay the first few dozen hours are the most fun because you keep experiencing new things after that you kinda do everything for yourself only to stay alive as long as possible my first house alarm which i thought would create a little noise ended up pulling the entire freaking neighborhood i m not joking from a semi empty suburban area towards a small swarm i died or shooting your first weapon only to find out that was a mistake now every zombie in the area is flocking towards your shots you finally reach a point where you are doing okay ha ha poof there goes towns water supply no more obvious unlimited refilling of water thought that was bad poof there goes the power as well good luck getting fuel form a gas station without a working generator this game is pretty darn difficult even at lower difficulties start there trust me but you will die nonetheless fixing up cars or be really lucky and find a working one will create new possibilities the sadistic ai will create evens making zombies move to certain locations every now and then this applies to giant hordes as well so your perfect base will very likely get overrun at some point but hearing stories that some area s are almost 100 safe that with regular settings all resources are finite and you will end up having to travel to other towns all risks and preperation included right now this game is about surviving as long as you can and that is a little boring at times when there are only zombies to entertain you a little depressing like the moodlet you get from getting bored or not distracting yourself with some me time i really understand how much work it would take to make this my dream game but the entire foundation is just sitting there waiting for some magical implementations by the devs multiplayer already adds so many layers of fun interactive npc s that aren t always friendly godlike having them do stuff over time that interacts with your game good and or bad i can easily imagine myself losing 1000 hours into this game so know that the graphics are iconic but it has a steep but engaging learning curve it s the main gameplay loop and you really get invested with your character at some point you always know that you died by your own mistakes super frustrating first button when dead is quit to desktop but you know you can get further next time but this lack of content and events you can take over the prison for example make it incredibly safe grow food and everything completely self sustainable and then there you are sitting there possibly for years until something really happens so now you have beaten the game and have to explore to increase the risk of you dying because nothing happens you restart to create a new story and my motivation to restart is dropping knowing i m only playing to survive after you reach that level not much more to do unless you are the explorative type
