2021 as a jurassic franchise fan i adore this game definitely has improved so much comparing to the first one first one s campaign was too short and had no freedom in the sandbox mode but in this you ve got a huge freedom in sandbox also the chaos theory mode just wow you can design your own jurassic world as you wish the number of dinosaur species have been increased and they are visually stunning i ain t going to say this is the best game of 2021 but this will claim a top spot in the best game of the year list
