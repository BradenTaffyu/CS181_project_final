2020 the lines needed to write a review are too many you fire up the game thinking aww how cute then suddenly one of the mother dupes got miffed enough with your solution to go ahead and punch a hole in lower part of your main water tank that you decided to build in the middle of your base flooding your base with the fresh water that you spent 3 4 days engineering into one main area making you consider to entertain an idea of designated bedrooms with a chlorine or co2 gas pipe going into it while gnawing on your keyboard and cursing the day you installed the game but then you realize you can construct a massive cooling system by running thermally radiant pipes trough your overflowing waste water reservioirs cooled by electric power generaged by the natural gas from the compost heaps and you smarten up a bit with each failure bringing you closer and closer to either end of the horseshoe that is miraculais ingeniousnessess heat exchange you exclaim as you cleverly wield the flow of temperature with the adjustment of an m ethanol fueled cluster of carefully placed thermostats all without touching a single book and just a profit or die b and when you then hear the stupider part of humanity ever wondering about geothermal energy or what is air you smuggly think to yourself been there done that you are the law of conservation in the meantime though let s just say it s got thermodynamics watts and stuff like that
