2023 age of empires iv at first didn t really resonate with me i was never sold on the let s keep the aesthetic similar to aoe3 the simplified looks of the units i didn t think it was necessary i never felt like aoe2 was hard to read what was going on in the screen and yet it had a more realistic approach on units without needing to resort in a cartoonish look also aoe3 had technical limitations at the time it was just trying to be the best with what it had but after playing the campaign and lots of skirmish battles i have to say it grew on me it s true that aoe2 has a tons more factions to play but aside for a couple of units sometimes just one that are unique all the factions in battle looks exactly the same same medieval foot soldiers same archers same cavalry in aoe4 every faction has it s own units design they feel more immersive so what do we really seek in a game some people like to focus on the multiplayer aspect of it and i understand that more diversity brings balancing problems but honestly as an history enthusiast i really don t play the game for it s bare mechanics i care about the look and feel of the game i wish aoe4 would have chosen a more realistic approach but i say it did a decent job nonetheless to depict the few factions in the game building a wall around the city and defend it with archers and crossbows has always felt more interesting to me than spamming houses to block enemies troops and aoe4 does a fine job to satisfy my need for historical battles without being needlessly complicated very accessible i also loved the documentary approach of the campaign with lots of vids that teaches you about the many aspects of medieval life and technology like old times i felt i was learning something new i also want to praise the soundtrack and sound it was amazing hearing the music composed uniquely for every faction and the language spoken by units evolving during the ages is a very beautiful touch i find myself coming back for more skirmishes everytime i have a few hours to spare good job relic i can t wait to see what the expansion has in store
