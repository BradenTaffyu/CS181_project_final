2016 a great space strategy game one of the bests the music and atmosphere are great and the game runs very smooth it really gives you a feeling of running an interstellar empire with gameplay that includes managing the ethos and expectations of your subjects administrative sectors and more there is always something interesting to do with random events planet development empire management and ongoing politics like any paradox title give it time to fully flesh out with more content that will come later down the road i am sure paradox will support this game for years to come just like europa universalis 4 must have for all gamers who like smart 4x games and paradox strategies
