some things to unpack here considering what s been going on recentlyfirst off the game is absolutely phenomenal in what it does damage physics are amazing missions are really dope and the modding community for this game is an absolute gem however teardown has gone through some changes after tuxedo was sold to saber now as someone who s played this game since 2022 and watched it grow since its inception it kinda hurts to see what saber is doing with teardown especially with the dlcs they haven t really done anything with the missions or gameplay mechanics except for a pretty dumb overhaul of the ui so aside from that bump in the road i would definitely recommend this game for a new player looking for a fun destruction puzzle game
