2023 you play as a sentient booger possessing a corpse as it tries to unravel the mysteries of a plague ridden island it s just like mario meets game of thrones you jump on platforms like mario and you want to get to the castle but there s no princess yet there s lots of blood and you meet the hand of the king and possibly other members of the royal court you enjoy pain and suffering dead cells shattered my expectations i think this game doesn t get enough attention for the amount of fun it can be i am a very recent roguelike enjoyer and was looking for a new one when my wife s boyfriend recommended dead cells prior to dead cells i had beaten hades which was great and returnal that was also fun but dead cells has both of them beat for me i am extremely picky when it comes to side scrolling games having really only truly enjoyed cuphead before playing this so i wasn t sure how i would feel i was addicted immediately dead cells has some of the smoothest and most satisfying combat i have ever experienced not just in a side scroller but in any action game period along with its satisfying combat is the mind boggling amount of weapons and abilities you have to choose from and the combinations of both that frequently compliment each other thankfully you have the options because the enemy types also vary drastically which is incredibly refreshing as you make your way through each level it s the fairest game of all time basically 99 9 of deaths are your fault the only stuff in the game that i d consider bulls t is so minimal it s not even worth discussing it s perfectly viable to do a flawless run on the hardest difficulty with the weakest gear if you re focused sweaty enough its level design is nearly flawless each stage forces a different means of traversal or items that need to be found in order to progress making none of the levels seem repetitive the music in each level is also extremely well done and i feel really fits the atmosphere of each stage as for the story it takes the dark souls approach in needing to examine locations in the world to better understand the background of what s happening not the greatest story out there but that also doesn t take away from how fun the game is there s so much i could continue to say about this game but this review has gotten long enough as is the dlcs add new weapons biomes and bosses i didn t want to talk about the castlevania dlc specifically to not make this even longer but i ll say that as an enormous fan of castlevania it s pretty cool i think i spent less than 15 on it but would happily spend double on this game it s that good if you re looking for a challenging game with incredibly satisfying combat and a wide variety of combat options i highly recommend it to anyone who has had an onlooker s interest i highly recommend picking up dead cells 10 10
