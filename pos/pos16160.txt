2023 i see this game as being the garry s mod of tabletop games it has insane replay value and it s a really good place to test if you ll actually enjoy a tabletop game before you buy it in real life there are game packs that can be bought specifically for tabletop simulator and there are other scripted and non scripted games that can be downloaded for free off of the steam workshop all the way from monopoly and uno to stuff like warhammer and battletech it has little to no bugs multiplayer service is really good and the interface is very clean and functional overall it s a really good way to play a tabletop game with online friends over long distances also there s an option to literally flip the table nice touch
