2023 i summoned a mad phantom with the intention of dueling him but instead he sat down and offered to toast with me we continued on throughout undead settlement together despite my wariness of him and he helped me take out all the mobs in the surrounding area after a while i became accustomed to fighting alongside my newfound friend and started turning my back to him knowing full well that he would protect me to his last dying breath we were a team the best of friends and nothing could stand in our way he may not have been a warrior of sunlight but solaire s legacy thrived on within him jolly co operation resumed until we neared the curse rotted greatwood and it was then that i decided to take yet another chance and summon a second mound maker to see if we could rally him to our side the plan seemed successful at first but it wasn t long before i noticed some suspicious patterns in the phantom s movement and his interest in my backside became a significant concern my anxiety was proven justified when the phantom took a swing at me with his greatsword and missed my loyal protector raised both his hand and his middle finger at the attacker before charging forward with fury the likes of which none in lothric had seen he made it his personal duty to end the traitorous life of the one who would dare attempt to strike at me and before long the violent fool was fleeing from our jolly wrath he rushed up a ladder and leaped across rooftops before finally dropping a harmful distance to the ground giving us an opening to attack my companion launched himself from the rafters and his flowing cape waved majestically in the air as he readied his sword and plunged towards the infidel who would dare spit on the tenets of co operation and sunlight the valiant protector lunged his sword deep through the attacker s back before he could escape the weapon grinding through bone and flesh and rendering him a lifeless husk i dropped down following this and we waved and spun our capes at one another in excitement and victorious glee but this was the end of our time together we gave each other one final wave before my friend s body started to fade away as he was whisked back to his own dimension it hit me i d never see him again
