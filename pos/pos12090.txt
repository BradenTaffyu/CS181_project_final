2018 with 47 hours in i can safely say that i love this game and it s worth it if you re able to pay for it iracing is an online sim racing game every driver is a player no ai is involved when you re racing except the pace car but that s something else p at first you start in the rookie licences oval road dirt oval and dirt road for a promotion you ve to compete in a set number of races and have a sr rating higher than 3 0 what is sr you say it s safety rating my friends determining if you re eligible of a promotion and to let others know if you re a clean racer during the race you get penalty point when you re involved in incidents and this can affect your sr x1 going off track x2 contact with a wall or light contact with a car x4 heavy contact with another car now to the downside of this sr system there are sometimes collisions which you can t avoid like people turning into you and so on well this also affects your sr cuz the game just sees it as you colliding with someone giving you penalty points but that s only one downside of this system for me atleast now if you re interested and want to join iracing but you don t want to spend money on cars and tracks immediately like me cuz i wanted to see if i like iracing you could just buy a subscription and with the subscription you ve already access to 17 cars and 17 tracks for free and i did my rookie licences without buying any car or track yet eventually when i got in d and c i bought some cars and tracks but that s totally up to you and this quote i found on jimmy s server sums up iracing pretty well iracing is only as expensive as you want it to be jimmy broadbent s discord serversome notes a wheel is strongly recommended for this game rookie licence is hell so prepare to lose some sr but eventually you ll manage to get out of it took me about 1 2 weeks some people are even faster licence promotions are at the end of the season or when you reach 4 0 sr in a licence don t forget your amount of races needed this game runs pretty well not having problems whatsoever have patience not every race is won in turn 1 and the first laps again have patience you will get frustrated now and then but don t give up the browser ui is amazing and easy to usethis is everything i ve to say i guess may edit my review in the future if needed or if something is missing cheers
