2019 i m a true gamer now in all honesty i confusingly enjoyed this game with a love hate relationship playing this game was enjoyably difficult but each death made me want to progress further to beat the game it pushed me to do better the next time which this game tests the patience of only few people i picked this game up mid last year played and defeated gundyr and then i just couldn t bring myself to challenge anymore i dropped it and didn t pick it up again til 4 days ago from writing this review and i am happy that i did the game in short is about the protagonist finding and returning the five lords of cinder to link the flame which basically means the player encounters various enemies and bosses throughout the game with different playstyles abilities etc the game is gorgeous and the cinematics are great to watch some bosses are definitely better than others design and control wise since some enemies are boring or too easy like wyvern deacons or feel a bit broken like two princes minibosses the game is enjoyable and the progression feels very player based allowing them to combo and upgrade to their preference with armor weapons and upgrading the player with souls it feels very open compared to other video games but this game is both very difficult and easy the game feels like it has too many bonfires like when defeating dragonslayer there is a bonfire just ahead in sight making it quite pointless and unneeded to have that many at times i feel that the game slowly becomes easier because the player is more experienced with the gameworld and enemies their reactions and character behaviour to weapons and armor the game is difficult but the improvement of the player makes the game easier this doesn t however cover all since bosses like nameless knight and pontiff sulvyvahn will give difficulty no matter what in my opinion in conclusion this game could go through a few tweaks since hitboxes seem a little off and walls need to act like walls rather than enemies being able to stick their spear or sword through and hit me i also feel like the frost knight miniboss is very overpowered and the only way to defeat him is by cheesing the elevator or having him stuck on the staircase the game is enjoyable and the lore is very indepth the game i feel is very balanced but remove a few bonfires since it takes away how some parts are easy and the game looks great really enjoyable first souls game and i hope to pick up the others soon to play and experience them 8 10
