2020 if you ve seen this game and think you might like it you ll probably like it more than you can guess the controls are tight and the combat is punishing but does not feel unfair at least not in early game plus the game keeps getting updates and rebalancing and if you don t like an update you can always play whatever version of it you prefer in legacy mode i have 125 hours in and i have not even beaten it in the hard difficulty considering how much skill i lack and how much i dislike playing games that are over my skill level 125 hours is a major compliment for this game from me keep up the good work devs as for me i really need to git good edit as i ve put more hours into this and got the dlc as well this is a great time to mention assistive mode for when you really suck it makes the game more approachable to everyone so you can have fun no matter what your gaming skills are
