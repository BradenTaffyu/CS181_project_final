2018 early access review reviewed as of tubular update klei won me over several years ago with an early build of don t starve thanks to their unique animation and distinct charm over those several years they proved to be attentive to the community listening to feedback and refining their game eventually even making a multiplayer iteration that i never knew i wanted but loved i got oxygen not included as soon as it released on steam just knowing that i could expect great progress as it went on the initial release felt a little barren and i only played it for a few hours not coming back to it until just this past week and i m astonished at how addictive the complexities are in just its current state starting things off with ample oxygen supply and rations for your 3 starting duplicants to last you a few days you are tasked with admittedly meager guidance to expand and begin producing renewable food and oxygen with the ability to print a new duplicant every 3 5 days or so each duplicant has needs that must be met that are governed by their individual personalities that are randomly generated and this alone is fairly complex aside from hunger each duplicant has unique stat points expectations for food quality and decor perks and phobias and a laundry list of potential debuffs depending on their environments and actions this leads to rising and falling stress levels which if maxed out will see your duplicants react in wildly negative ways that can affect the survival of everyone involved as well as stress out others but the duplicants themselves are living in a world that is infinitely more complex than most games would give thought to with mechanics such as the following gas pressure there are currently 5 types of gases in the game oxygen carbon dioxide hydrogen natural gas and chlorine each gas has its own density which will affect where it settles in an open space compared to the other gases some gases can be consumed wholesale to be converted into other resources such as filtering carbon dioxide into polluted water or turning hydrogen into powerful yet quickly burning energy beyond simply managing the gases to ensure your duplicants can breathe however you must also contend with pressurization air vents can t deliver gas of any kind into a room that has too much and if you build an infrastructure to allow high pressurization you ll put your duplicants health at risk as their eardrums rupture from the pressure it s boggling how much attention must be paid to properly pressurize a base and keep gases flowing smoothly and safely power you ve got a lot of machinery you can make to help your duplicants out in this game but obviously you ll need something to power it all options ranging from manual power on hamster wheels to coal to natural gas allow you several ways to go about powering your base though every single option has other things to worry about such as heat output and gases even beyond figuring out what you want to use to produce power you ll have to manage the wiring as certain wires only carry up to a maximum wattage before they ll begin to overload and fry themselves this entails careful thought over power supplies beyond simply jamming as much energy production into one spot as humanly possible to spread to the whole base there are also automation options to help control machinery without micro management as well as batteries and transformers to help manage energy more efficiently temperature everything in the game both before you break it down and after has and maintains a temperature throughout the game these temperatures will obviously settle depending on their environments but it means that grabbing very hot ore from a volcanic biome and bringing it back to your base will result in you heating up the area around wherever you re storing it as well as all other materials stored with it on top of this you have to contend with heat output from machinery that can eventually build up to a point that may cause damage to itself or other machines as well as give duplicants heat stroke liquids there are water sources both clean and polluted found naturally in the world as well as magma and oil and these are your basic liquids you ll be dealing with using pretty straightforward plumbing infrastructure just as with anything else in the game liquids have temperature that can affect everything made with them speaking of temperature and liquid most resources in the game can possibly be heated to the point of melting as well resulting in liquid versions of some things that are naturally solid germs as of the outbreak update germs have been added in they re relatively straightforward to deal with if handled properly from the start but something as simple as a duplicant having an accident near the water supply can cause the entire colony to get food poisoning management of germs on the duplicants themselves is as simple as providing sinks and sanitization stations for them to use getting germs out of liquids requires using heat and infected resources such as ore minerals and even food requires specific tools or simply storing them in environments surrounded by chlorine there s even more to talk about with the game such as how different materials can be used to make nearly every object in the game that will affect the stats such as melting points thermal conductivity decor value etc but this is already a novella of a review simply put if you enjoy complex plate spinning games where some new problem to solve can surprisingly show up because you forgot something then you ll love this game if micro management of all of this minutia doesn t sound appealing then the odds are that you won t enjoy this personally i already love it and can t wait to see what klei introduces to it as we get further into 2018
