2022 been playing this game since early access and it s only gotten better raft has been my go to favorite game for a while now to just chill and survive on my own or with friends there s a lot of room for creativity when designing and decorating your raft and i ve seen some pretty amazing ones the graphics aren t top tier no but they fit the game so well and they re not by any means bad and as one would expect or hope from a game based on living on a raft the water effects are done very well sometimes a little too well so if you get motion sickness then you could possibly experience that with the big waves the combat is very basic but it works and i don t think it s boring at all it s actually very easy to get sucked into the environment and lose track of time which isn t a common thing for me with other games i will say that the game doesn t hold your hand so if you re looking for a clue to tell you what to do it won t at least not at first everything is really up to the player to figure out but once you reach the first story island you ll know where to go next to progress the story if you re not playing with someone who s familiar with the game or using a guide the first part of the game might take a while but what you see in the beginning isn t what you ll see throughout the entire game there are different biomes enemies and interesting places to explore so it s definitely worth the time i will also note that co op play while fun can also be a bit janky from my experience anyone that isn t the host will usually experience some lag or my favorite a freshly killed enemy sliding across the ground and into the water like some sort of magnetic pull lost a few seagulls that way but you get better at catching them before they hit the water no this game isn t perfect and to some it might be boring or grindy but if you re looking for a chill survival game then this might be the one for you
