2023 it is certainly a different total war from the others it is not only a strategy and rts but also has 4x elements i have read many complaints about the interface the unreadable map etc well you can get used to everything i think the developers designed the game very well however it is not for everyone first of all you need to like the chinese atmosphere it is good to read something about china and watch some movies hero house of flying daggers empress 14 blades or more recently shadow but especially three kingdoms red cliff from 2008 directed by john woo i get the impression that the game s developers were heavily inspired by the latter film which worked out to the game s advantage 3k has unconventional solutions when it comes to mechanics especially on the strategic level it is designed according to the chinese wu xing theory of five transformations tree pinyin m fire pinyin hu earth pinyin t metal pinyin j n and water pinyin shu the cycle of creation and destruction translates into the erection of buildings and the selection of military units and generals failure to follow this rule has real negative consequences for the functioning of the state and the army playing 3k what i miss in the other installments of the series i have the feeling that the developers have given the player real tools to build an empire and manage it it couldn t have been otherwise by the way since imperial china was essentially the first state in history with an elaborate administration made up of top down educated officials but one step at a time in the game regardless of the chosen leader and faction we lead a state with a monarchical system our ruler has broad prerogatives with them we conduct a policy of distribution and appointment creating the power elite of our kingdom from among various candidates we can appoint them to offices at two levels the central or court and the provincial level in the form of commandery administrators several ministers make up the monarch s advisory body the council which meets once a year to propose specific measures for internal and external policy candidates for office can combine civilian and military functions so there is no avoidance and conduct expansion in one or at most two directions due to the high cost of maintaining several armies it is not easy in the game to create an efficient and effective spy network but if successful there are plenty of options here from sabotaging enemy logistics to inciting rebellions in cities to disrupting the transfer of power within an enemy dynasty included however there is no option to send a recruited spy to the enemy s territory with a preview of the map a completely different solution from the one used so far instead we receive reports from our envoy we recruit the army in a given commandery each army consists of three generals commanding a maximum of 6 troops which gives a total of 18 troops 3 bodyguard troops of each general this solution may seem strange after all in previous tws there was only one general however it is not an ahistorical solution from the point of view of military history given that armies were divided into two wings and a center here the player the commander in chief is de facto in command anyway the diversity of units is in my opinion greater in 3k than in shogun 2 but let s not expect the unknown the battles themselves look quite nice and have something of a fairy tale feel to them even in archive mode in my opinion this fits in with the overall concept of the game on the other hand the troop morale system animations and damage dealing are a bit disappointing on the plus side however the game can be credited with the ability to create different infantry and cavalry formations on the battlefield as well as obstacles in the form of for example oil patches or palisades this undoubtedly gives more possibilities to use the terrain for example we can protect our wing from enemy cavalry by building various barriers and hiding archers or crossbowmen behind them relationships between generals also play an important role in battles one should think carefully about what to do with captured generals of the enemy army their execution aggravates our relations with all factions due to the game s treatment of war crimes as dishonorable as for the audio visual aspect i will say yes the music here is atmospheric and the graphics well what who likes i m glad that the developers have moved away from the graphics known from rome ii attila and thrones of britannia which is to say the least strangely ugly due to fatally chosen colors and poor edge smoothing yes there is no revelation in 3k in this regard either but the character cards moving event cards troop icons beautiful tech tree and the overall interface based on exclusive black look great and aesthetically pleasing i give it 9 10 i m not looking forward to medieval 3 or empire 2 i d prefer the thirty years war period of 1618 1648 but with equally developed management mechanics as in 3k
