2014 early access review 7 days to die is certainly a great game a minecraft like shooter with zombies what more could someone want while the game is in alpha stage it still has a lot to offer there s a large list of things i could talk about but i don t want to write a book essentially the game is minecraft with zombies however compared to some other free roam games out there you are very limited to what you can explore additionally the things you can find get very boring once you have explored enough another thing to keep in mind when looking at this game is the lack of objective if you are someone who needs a goal this won t satisfy you very much its more of a sandbox as of now something else that i consider very important when buying this game is to make sure you have some pals to play it with you will find yourself bored very quickly when playing alone also the online community isnt the greatest so i would not put your trust into that tl dr the game is pretty good for the money while it has its flaws its only in alpha before you purchase make sure you have some friends to play with and watch some gameplay videos
