2023 this game is a mixed bag for me but ultimately recommended what this game is a great and fun looter shootera fun colony sim managera shooter with rpg elementswhat this game isnt a fallout game i know big inflammatory statement and obviously false but let me explain fallout games historically have been rpgs first everything else second fallout as a franchise had many mechanics like traits speech checks skill stat based dialogue options karma and reputation system ect that made the franchise truly feel like an rpg and like every action i take has potentially massive consequences fallout 4 has practically none of this there are some speech checks here or there but they aren t tied to any skill level or perk requirement they are based around the charisma stat as a result most of the dialogue options typically end up being of little to no consequence with a somewhat arbitrary set of conditions as to what defines a successful speech check hell even vats just slows time instead of outright pausing vats pausing the game was a very intentional choice in game design in fallout 3 and new vegas to capture the feel of a top down turn based rpg like fallout 1 2 were and have that translate into an fps 3d enviornent the new system plays more like a modern ish fps than an rpg full stop i could ramble the whole day about how fallout 4 literally isnt an rpg and more of a looter shooter with rpg elements but instead i m going to ramble equally long about how that isn t a bad thing at all fallout 4 is probably one of the best looter shooter boomer shooters ever made no seriously i think this game blows pretty much every other entry into the genre out of the water i genuinely prefer this game to something like borderlands or doom and its not even close the best thing going for fallout 4 here is its perk system i know i just trashed the game for not having skills and traits but stay with me fallout 4 is the most rpg like when you are choosing a perk there are literally a million ridiculous ways to be completely overpowered in this game and its blind fun there is a certain charm to exploding peoples heads with an unarmed 9 luck build in fallout new vegas but this game has the same level of caustic satisfaction but with practically every weapon type and it doesn t get old either there s enough different situations weapon and enemy variants to keep the game play interesting and satisfying don t believe its a boomer shooter put on your power armor and literally bulldoze people oh that reminds me of the ludicrous amount of armor options and mods and hilarious tank perks and goofy special builds this game has a litany of different ways to kill in fun and hilarious ways and this is where its at its strongest its looting mechanics are also solid loot variety is high and in general the rare collectibles are collectivized as they provide significant and sometimes downright overpowered bonuses to boot the dungeons are laid out intelligently and have a reasonable difficulty curve all in all this game is heaps of fun and with its colony sim mechanics this game has a solid amount of replay value however i would highly recommend modding the game to take full advantage of the settlements system what you get out of this game is a lot about what you are expecting going in if you expect a truly compelling and immersive story that gives you tough choices and moral dilemma this game can deliver that but there are vastly better experiences elsewhere especially within its own franchise looking at new vegas and fallout 2 as standout examples but this game excels at providing a combat experience like no other one that is genuinely fun challenging and completely unique it still has many elements of what makes fallout s combat so consistently good across all of the games but it approaches them as a shooter rather than an rpg and in that bethesda can truly say they have a masterpiece on their hands however i feel like this game was more worthy of spin off branding rather than a direct sequel as this entry departs too much from what fallout games are typically associated with in terms of gameplay and rpg elements 6 5 10
