2021 when this game first came out it was dismal not completely unplayable but certainly nothing to get excited about or even to have a glimmer of hope that it was just another fallout game but after many updates and fixes not bugs or glitches because there are plenty of those this game finally has some depth to it and is worthy of a play through if you have friends to play with whilst a big chunk of the game is easily played single player a lot of content can be missed out on because it is rather difficult to solo overall is an alright fallout game with some good lore and story but it can be grind and you will find yourself having to do daily or weekly challenges to get by
