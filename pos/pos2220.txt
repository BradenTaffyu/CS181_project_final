2023 i went into fallout 76 with rock bottom expectations like everyone i heard how bad the game was on launch and avoided it but after 100 ing new vegas and 4 i decided to give it a chance i m so glad i did it s so bizarre to me how elder scrolls online is praised for how much its improved since launch but fallout 76 is still called a bad game to this day again i didn t play on launch so i don t have anything to compare it to but what fallout 76 has become is a genuinely enjoyable looter shooter overall the game boasts multiple well written story arcs that take you all over the diverse landscape of west virginia there s a distinct improvement on dialogue choices compared to fallout 4 which i was very surprised to see the game world feels alive with monsters npcs and other exciting landmarks at every twist though i will say the amount of boarded up homes that aren t explorable can at times be immersion breaking in comparison to previous fallout games the combat similar to fallout 4 is buttery smooth improved further by the real time vats system i m well aware this change was likely only made due to the fact the game is online but it makes me wish every fallout game had this design choice not having vats freeze time whenever used keeps the fluidity of combat moving which was a great change that being said and while on the topic of combat i will say later in the game some monsters and events can become quite bullet spongey i know this is more an issue with the genre as a whole but it does push the player towards min maxxing their dps which pushes a lot of cool weapon choices to the wayside last but not least the community like most online games this is always a flip of the coin its usually either a complete mess of toxicity or a genuinely wholesome group of people always willing to help each other especially new players and thankfully this is what i experienced tons of nice people looking to play the game together and lots of higher levels who go out of their way to make new players experience a memorable one so if you were considering giving fallout 76 a try i highly recommend it while it s not the best game in the franchise its still a solid contribution to the fallout universe
