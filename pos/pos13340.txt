2015 early access review so im going to give you a short list of the pro s and cons and it will inevitably leave you with a sense of dread if this game is not already in your steam library shame on you pro s endless fun insane modding community as complex or as simple as you want has a career mode for those who need goals when things go just as you planned you get a giant smile on your face and when then go horribly wrong you get a bigger smile con s there is only so much in the time in a day to play this game so if you only have 30 minutes a week to play you might have trouble getting into it but you should still buy it to support this awesome game the game is not free and it never should be buy it if you suffer from having only 2 hands and 2 eyes you may find it difficult to control and micro manage a space research empire warp ers bewaaaaare so thats my little list as to why everyone should own this gem of a game
