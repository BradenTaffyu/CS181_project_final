2021 a fun hybrid between a jrpg and the firaxis xcom games as opposed to the dos one you have the 2 action and cover system from xcom and then some rpg characters with a few class options and optional abilities set for them and then each character has a mastery board where you can slot an every increasing number of perks to customize your characters some of the mastery perks are fairly minor smallish stat buffs others can be situational but playstyle defining like getting an extra action if you one shot an enemy there are also set bonuses for items and for masteries i had success with a few different builds for some characters but did tend to settle into some favorite styles enemies use the same masteries you can add to characters or various robots or beasts you can summon so there is a fair degree of mechanical symmetry which you may find good you can copy various tricks many enemies use or annoying there is a ton of content at 270 hours i have not done all the missions and am behind a few of the story missions added in recent content updates too much less gone full completionist and caught all the animals and collected all the enemy info etc i found the game appropriately challenging at max settings in missions there were a number of times i had to redo missions but it generally felt like i could improve my approach to eventually progress without seeming to just hope for better rolls there were a few times i needed to basically go back and retool my choices in terms of the squad items and masteries to better suit the opposition i was facing i was definitely not prepared to go against the final story mission before the dlc with my initial set up also the dynamic where i could usually struggle through a tough mission but sometimes would need to back out and adjust the loadout going into it suggests a reasonable balance between the tactical choices and risk management versus the strategic layer build choices there is an anti grinding setting for difficulty to keep enemies appropriately leveled so you can reduce situations where by doing side missions you ruin the challenge in the main story but this is optional a few problems or potential issues to be aware of first of all there have been a number of negative reviews that mention the number of enemies and their relative proximity causing chain reactions of pack aggro combined with masteries granting reaction attacks which leads to enemy turns potentially taking a long time these statements are correct there are a lot of guys so the computer turns take awhile and sometimes one enemy will take their turn which triggers multiple enemies making free attacks and then the next guy might trigger another flurry of free attacks i don t think this was unfair since i think there are several routes to protecting your guys from reaction attacks or the abilities they use make multiple attacks and it s pretty sweet to overcome seemingly overwhelming numbers but it can lead to missions taking a while even with fast enemy turns enabled also i tend to feel like the combat system can make critical hits a little too extreme characters and enemies can get very high default crit chances and also huge critical damage multipliers making one shots very common without one of a handful of specific masteries equipped which are not cheap plenty of elite named boss enemies end up going down in a single crit for like triple their hp and they can do the same to your guys i would also note that the game makes albus manage his mercenary police business to pay his rent and employees however wages and rent are basically trivial expenditures throughout the game i wouldn t say this is a flaw exactly but it s still worth noting that the business end is trivial money is for gear stuff not worrying about keeping your company afloat it s not like jagged alliance type games where a bad run of missions or just running too heavy a payroll can drag you into a financial death spiral management is not really part of the strategic level of the game not to say that it necessarily should be but some games make this more or less of an issue and people should know the game has a ton of subsystems besides the mastery and class picks mentioned above there s crafting animal taming building custom robot minions reputation for your company reputation with each merchant some kind of dance modifiers you can add to your abilities late game this is more of a sprawl not a tight or elegant game personally i think one of the biggest problems is with the story progression when the blurb says troubleshooter abandoned children is the first season of a turn based strategy srpg that takes place in the world of troubleshooter this does not mean that we get a complete feeling story with room for further stuff in the setting instead the game throws out a bunch of incomplete subplots and unfinished character arcs the ending of the base story line i have not yet completed the black witch dlc story is still a pretty big victory but it still seems like there s more loose ends than wrapped up things and the dlc introduced another enemy faction so to sum things up i m enjoyed this game if you are looking for a tactics rpg or think an anime xcom police sounds neat this should be a worthwhile addition to your short list of considerations unless some traits i mentioned sound like deal breakers troubleshooter also gets pretty regular patches so far and has made the white lion black white dlc free
