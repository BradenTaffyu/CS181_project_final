2021 look at my play time that s not idle playtime that s active to say this game is like xcom devalues this game troubleshooter is more than xcom it has a long interactive well written story translation issues aside and one the most dedicated development team i have ever seen in a game this game has 100 hours of content easily and at it s price is woefully undervalued i ve never played a game where the community unanimously is begging the developers for more ways for us to pay yeah that s right the gamers are saying please let us pay you more for this game only for the developers to release an entire full fledged dlc for free what the heck buy the game not at a discount but at full price heck buy the art book buy the soundtrack you know what buy the trading cards this developer 100 deserves every single cent update most translation issues have been fixed
