2014 early access review wow i have been looking for a game like this for a while you can play the game two ways 1 you play it like a simulator sweating your ass off loads of fun 2 you just kinda chill out and go out for a nice sunday drive maybe even drift a little loads of fun any way you like it you re gonna enjoy it the game is really well optimized and it seems to work with nearly any racing wheel i used a 9 year old racing wheel and it worked like a charm the fact that the game has modding abilities makes me fall in love with it even more wether you want to drift around on rainbow road with you bmw m3 or cruise around paris with your fiat 500 the mods have got you covered the realism that kunos have put into the game is outstanding the car sounds the handling and the looks the game looks and sounds epic overall it s astonishing that the game is only in early access since it sure feels like a complete game i cannot wait to see how the game turns out on release kudos kunos kudos 9 5 10
