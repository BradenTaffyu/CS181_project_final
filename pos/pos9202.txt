2018 average score 6 0 10 it s a great strategy and management space game but it s too demanding changes a lot with time and it s too complexpersonal score a loved it i always come back to play again and the game is a good mix of despair and chill i recommend buying it if you like paradox thingslove modable gameslike challenging and complex strategy management gameswant to play this with your friend really cool experience you re a stoner gamer and would love a game that give you opening for your chill sessions dont buy it if hate paradox dlc format can t handle massive micro management can t handle games that do change a lot with timeyou re buying it just because of space fightshate incredibly long matches i was never able to finish a save with a friend you can t enjoy a game without a campaign characteristics rts with pause option even in online modem k onlymicro and macro management less focus on combat time and more focus on management timereview averages general mechanics 7 5 10 ok most people argue here some dislike them because of the changes others will say it s a ripoff of similar games but this is not how i review things based on average expectations for strategy games i think this one is above average hence a 7 or higher grade they are simple actually although some things will be more complicated if you haven t played games like civ or crusader kings your international interactions are cool although i find them pretty stupid when dealing with federations that s why it s grade won t go above 8 graphics interface 7 5 10 they re perfect for me but i know the average player is way more demanding than i am maybe i m old school but stellaris has pretty smooth graphics interface just fits and playing the whole game is always a good chill it s also pretty flashy as fights get a lot of colorful bright lasers shooting everywhere i feel they could ve used a more diverse kind of particles tho content surprises 6 5 10 well pretty average i mean at first if you haven t played anything of the sort you ll get a lot of surprises on your first playthroughs and dlcs will complete the feeling but overall not that great with game surprises content is cool too but didn t reach anything above averagelore story 6 10 the story of your civilization is basically yours and is basically written while you play if you haven t played games of this sort you ll be popped with event logs which will update you on everything your galactic nation is up to a rebellion that rose on a country an emperor that has died and was succeeded by his son and some special events where you find something curious in new systems music sound 4 5 10 well every game has this problem but paradox could ve just made a radio system as surviving mars and cities skylines have felt like a waste really the game s soundtrack didn t appeal at me at all kinda lower than expected plus and cons you just have skirmish mode 6 5 10 it is not a con to me but ya know it is something that people should be aware it s basically what the game s about game modes have dozens of settings before starting 7 10 stellaris have a map generator before you start you can choose the shape of your galaxy up to 4 atm the number of stars the probability of habitable worlds the number of enemies the number of special enemies endgame crisis really lots of stuff this is amazing because remember when i said back there that the game was long well good news create a tiny galaxy and you ll get your 4 hour match community is active and so are the devs 7 10 is this game 2 years old 3 years old i can t remember right now but the game is already in it s 2 1 state and there s been a lot of fuzz about the 2 2 coming out some people think that a game that changes with time is a bad game i think this is a complete whining the game even has an option to allow you to donwgrade it back to old versions controls and learning curve 4 5 10 the game is not that intuitive and it took me a lot of tries to learn also most of my friends didn t really stick to the game the only one who really enjoyed it was one that already enjoyed titles like total war so he s into more complex games game is way demanding 4 10 really smooth game but try playing a galaxy with a thousand stars it gets laggy by the endgame specially with massive fleets fighting diplomacy options are scarce 4 10 after a while the game didn t felt with that many diplomacy options going aggressive feels more rewarding than relying on bots which aren t that smart crusaders offers much better interactions
