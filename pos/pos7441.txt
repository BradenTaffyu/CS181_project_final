2021 early access review started to play this epic game yesterday and played it for 12 hours i would like to play this for 12 hours a day it is a nice and useful game i like building a couple of survival shelter i also liked the graphics and the effect when the sun rise and set it is more fun to play with friends and to survive for as long the creative mode is a nice and good decision players can freely and unlimitedly create buildings parts of the ship without trying any other modes and the supplies are unlimited this is a thumbs up
