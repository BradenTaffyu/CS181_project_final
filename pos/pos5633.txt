2023 as of patch 1 1 0 they are finally introducing mechanics that tw promised but never delivered on e g stable and streamlined ux gang mechanics ambushing ruler specific armors to name a few up to this point in recent months tw has moved the game in a much better direction if you asked me a year ago i would ve said that this game is like warband but worse and somehow still pretty fun even if gravely unbalanced and rough edged now this game is simply on par with warband imo while doing a lot more somehow there s enough bread to righteously succeed warband but not enough butter for taste at this rate with the game continuing to be polished improved and finalized all the more bannerlord s potential for the definitive m b experience will be quickly realized in the patches to come i like many others still cherish warband and i think this is largely because of its simple polished sandbox gameplay loop it s like bad company 2 for battlefield once bannerlord reaches that level of polish there will be no more complaints from my end lots of work left for tw but finally worth playing and recommending to newcomers at this stage of release very fun and getting more fun as time goes on 7 999 10 and creeping up
