2019 early access review i ve been a huge zombie survival enthousiast for a very long time and have a pretty brilliant zombie movie collection from all versions of night of the living dead to utter trash like swamp zombies and the stink of flesh and obviously also played loads of zombie games boardgames like last night on earth made my own 12 level campaign with a lot of freedom of choice pnp like all flesh must be eaten pc games like no more room in hell and stuff like that and of course there s the walking dead like a lot of fellow enthousiasts i love thinking what would you do well i d train in spear and stick fighting because of their ease of use and construction safe zombie fighting and other uses jamming doors reaching for stuff and go for the woods of course unfortunately no game has ever been a decent simulation of this without compromising fun and playability and then some friend suggested pz i don t mind the pixel graphics i ve been gaming for well over 3 decades and my favorite game ever was text only gameplay is always superior to graphics for me the gameplay and controls are a bit rough to manage in the beginning but i got used to it now i ve got a cute small house boarded up with some nice supplies a filled up jeep a river nearby for fishing i ve figured out how to get worms found a nearby house with a stove mine doesn t only noticed later got some seeds planted it s nice and quiet and there s a graveyard very near just for a nice matching atmosphere how awesome is this the balance between exploration survival hardcore permadeath and micromanaging is just very very good the wounds i get make sense the tools i need to make and repair stuff also the risks of exploration are sometimes tedious as it should be but rewarding as well when you finally find something you need i m thoroughly enjoying this game and with all the customization options i m sure i will do so for a very long time i just may have finally found my perfect zombie survival game and that s quite a feat let me tell ya awesome job guys and my utter apologies for not discovering this gem sooner
