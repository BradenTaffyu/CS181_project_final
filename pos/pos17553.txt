2017 i usually aim for 2 hours of entertainment per dollar invested at 492 hours invested it would be worthwhile to buy at 246 even with all the dlc it wasn t anywhere near 100 i got a great return on investment if you are a warhammer junkie you may have issues with some of the choices made if you have never really done the warhammer thing but like this kind of game it s a no brainer if you like civilization conquering games and rts battles it s a no brainer people have given it a negative review because of the dlc practices and that is a valid choice if you don t like the practice of a studio releasing content as they go this is not the game for you personally i don t disapprove of the practice the consumer is the one spending money they are not honor bound to buy every dlc i disapprove of people giving a game a negative review even though they loved the game because they chose to spend extra money on it the game is fantastic though
