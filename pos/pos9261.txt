2016 originally posted by deliverygodnoah there s a 50 50 chance you didn t even know this game was coming out huh no sir when it comes down to a paradox game it s 100 for sure having pre purchased so many titiles i can almost guarantee that no other publishers than paradox have fulfilled all their promises before release not deep silver nor even ubisoft lol some quick outline of the game after 35hrs of playing with yet unfinished campaign yes the game progress really slow the game feels unfamiliar at the beginning but soon you ll grasp the essense of the game if you come from eu4 aka very clausewitz ish very huge galaxy i went with midium size and i cannot guarantee i have explored all it has to offera lot to do and try early game which i enjoy the most ship designer was initially a blast to mebeautiful bgm with nice british accent assistantmet the first alien empire i tried to be nice but they are too scared no we wont send you to the laboratory the diplomacy was quite simple kinda reminded me of civilization style diplomacy window no infiltration no coveting action no royal marriage i hope the diplomacy can be more detailed in later patches dlcsthe game gets hard as i expand my empire i have a great difficulty keeping the balance positive while fulfilling my gorgeous ambitions also micromanagement of each planet really reminded me of provincial management in eu4the later it gets the more similarity of eu4 i can find in this game you start up weak you farm you research you build navies you either be aggressive or continue to farm on until you are the only one in this galaxygreat mod support i ve been using a few nowin fact i stopped playing dota for a few days just because i wanna spend just one more hour in game minor imba issues minor graphics glitches minor issue with the launcher few functions broken acceptable given the game s just released 10d ago maybe less replayability in comparision with eu4 in conclusion the game is pretty stellar at this price i hope they can polish it further and add more elements to the game i know they will through paid dlcs
