2019 this game is like that specially preserved malt whiskey that your uncle keeps hidden in the basement it is special rare wonderful but if you dont like the taste of whiskey then its just bad however if you are brave enough to quit playing fps and want to indulge in long dialogues and character creation leveling up etc then this is for you the soundtrack is relaxing i guess as the only thing that keeps bothering me is my unfamiliarity with turn based gameshowever this game has a co op for upto 4 players so we can be nubs together
