early access review first of all i love this game this is my first game i really buy with actual money rather download on websites im now at lvl 35 and i feel i just playing with too much boxes it will make game easier if you can add some another employee to do stocking or add multiplayer system so i can play with my friends i also have an idea if we have some barcode scanner in hand for doing stocking easily you just throw your stock on storage room and scan shelf with that tool choose items and quantity and its stocked place that tools on certain level like 30 id like if we have some inventory to carry more than one 5 8 is enough and we can choose it with number like other games and lastly please make our employee work faster maybe we can upgrade them with higher paying job i hope just 80 but faster thanks
