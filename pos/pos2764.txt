2021 this game is crack this may be my new favorite game of all time there is nothing this game doesn t have it is so much fun i come from a backround of mostly shooters and have never really played a full blown rpg like this before i beat this game in 2 weeks it took me 69 5 hours no joke it was such a challenging and rewarding experience graphics this game looks so damn beautiful the visuals from all the spells are so cool and the different areas that you quest in are all very unique and pretty stunning i really wish i had a 1440p monitor to experience this on it is awesome gameplay i love the gameplay each encounter with an enemy is so much fun this game is all about strategy and how you play your turn with the turn based mechanics it is so rewarding to take out an enemy or two in one turn after you have strategically buffed or moved yourself into an advantage and had the cc to death it s actually addicting and some fights are extremely tough if you don t use the right spells or get yourself into the advantage audio the game sounds great the voice acting is great spells and skills have their own unique awesome sounds to them the music and themes for each area are nice touches as well story the story was really entertaining with a great pace that didn t ever bore me i actually took the time to listen to every encounter with npcs and really enjoyed it by the end of the game you know what you were here to do and is rewarding with multiple different endings to give you the option of how you want to fulfill your destiny the final boss fight was the coolest final fight i ve ever played in a game no spoilers but the part of the final fight that i loved was that for a part of it the sound was muffled and it was just epic as mentioned before it took close to 70 hours to complete the game which brings it to the longest game i ve ever beaten my final thoughts on this masterpiece i loved the turn based fighting that really separates this game from others in my opinion and it was so good each fight is unique and you can use the environment to your advantage or the enemy can the story was awesome as well as the places you go and explore you can create a ton of different builds and play how you want to play the game i love that you can reset your build at anytime after act 1 and chance how you play completely if you started the game a pyro mage you can completely change to a ranged huntsman at any time each character had a great backstory along with their own fun character quests there is just so much you can do in this game it deserves a second playthrough no matter what i have no problem giving this game a 10 10 it is truly a masterpiece
