2021 recommended for fans of history and fans of rts games if you re a fan of both all the better firstly this is a successor to the eternally successful aoe2 not 3 the aoe2 veterans will know there are plenty of changes from the preceding title but to a casual they re roughly the same premise an rts designed around civilizations which became empires in the 1000ad 1500ad timeframe the difference comes down to simplicity and usability no longer must you be a micro god to feel at least partially successful we now have a select all military buildings for example which i can rebind to f1 and tab through my various structures barracks archery ranges stables letting me set my rally point for all of them at once we now have a select all military units button a select all economic buildings button and so on farms no longer have to be replenished i could go on but essentially what i m getting at is that aoe4 is a modern game with modern keybinds cool art style take it or leave it i was a huge fan of what the definitive edition did for aoe2 but aoe4 is mighty pretty itself the units don t have the best detail the glowing bows of the english longbowmen being the worst example but they re functional and easily discernible from each other and the buildings and maps are gorgeous lastly i m more a fan of the aoe2 ui than this one but that might just be personal preference and muscle memory if you re a campaign player and love history you ll love aoe4 the game comes with 4 campaigns spanning 1066ad to 1531ad chronicling the normans conquest of england france s eventual victory in the hundred year s war the mongol s conquests of the 13th century and muscovy s expansion from fledgling township to russian empire the campaign missions are varied and are presented much like a documentary we would ve once gotten on the history channel before it went to crap after each mission there are additional documentary like information videos and information panels all in all it s very impressive and it s hard not to appreciate the attention to detail for new players the game will throw you into a tutorial that starts with create 5 villagers and gather berries and wood it s a comprehensive tutorial allowing noobs to learn the game at their own pace 8 10 from this fan of c c brood war sc2 and aoc 9 10 if they can perfect the ui and 10 10 if they make an age of mythology 2
