early access review if you buy this game try anything below alpha 20 for me alpha 16 the newest updates limit your freedom to do what you want in the game and force you to play the way the developers want you to giant farms which speeds up progress developers add a heat meter to them and spawn a screamer every few minutes punishing you for being creative every update makes the game less and less like a sandbox and feels more forced with the way they want you to play in the end try all of the versions of the game and find which one you like the most there are many things which are better with new versions but some of you may be surprised by the older versions as well
