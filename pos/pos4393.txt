2017 turkey they are always the butt of european and arabic jokes because turkey is in both areas and yet part of nether how many great things can a person name that has come out of turkey struggling well here are a few to get you started 1 ratah lokum aka turkish delight not the cadbury s mock attempt but the real thing shove that glass and a half up your absolutely delicious it truly earns its nickname of r at al ulq m throat comfort 2 troy in all those homer epics the greek guy not the yellow cartoon idiot if you did not cheer during that epic bana v pitt your a heartless bastard 3 taleworld entertainment who i hear you exclaim well sit down lads and lasses and let me tell you if you have not heard of a game called mount blade you can be forgiven this was a sleeper hit in 2006 if total war and elder scrolls had a bastard child then mount and blade was it ugly and stunted yet majestic and beautiful at the same time then came its siblings m b warband m b fire and sword m b nepoleonic wars and soon we will have m b bannerlord this series of games put you at ground level literally of control of your destiny you can choose to become a merchant bandit lord knight sell sword bounty hunter or you could go straight to the top and fight for the right to wear the crown of all calradia it is less open world but more open life style you can anchor yourself to one of five separate kingdoms or to none of them and create your own slice of medieval heaven game playup front is the customisability of both your character and skills told through a story style intro though you do get to fiddle with sliders and skill points before hitting the game proper face slider physics are nowhere as pretty as skyrim or fallout but it gets the job done and you will get a fairly decent face out of it bannerlord looks to have improved on this so fingers crossed skill points are dished out between abilities general skills fighting skills and weapon skills making your character unique from game to game once done you pick a starter town or if it is your first time a training arena get your lights punched out if you suck at fighting and then you get your first quest find your attackers there is the world map where you travel from town to town chase track avoid bandits or armies or even sail up and down the coast singing sea shanties cities will give you quests trade routes major supplies and major npc recruitments towns will give you minor quests minor supplies and recruits castles will give you refuge from enemies as long as they are not your enemy if you are a lord or a self made king you can own any and all of these when in cities towns or engaged by an enemy you go to personal view 1st person 3rd person over the shoulder you can talk one on one with town folk or if in battle siege command your troops it is here in battle where m b really sets itself apart from other war games you get to personally command hundreds of on field troops and fight yourself like a real general you can give general orders covering all your troops or individual orders to select groups like your archers or cavalry field strategy and troop make up is paramount as the ai is no slouch its not too bright on easy but will still give you a run for your money and can mow down your veteran knights with mobs of peasants with sound tactics each faction too will have their elite troops and cannon fodder and there is nothing wrong with sticking to a set faction but if you really want to wipe your enemies aside mix and match your troops for example khergit horse archers can pick enemy from a distance yet evade with lightning speed follow them up with a charge of swadian heavy knights and sweep everyone off the board defensibly have a line of nord berserkers backed by rhodok spearmen with vaegris archers at the back how many troops you can field will depend on your computer but you can get up to 300 men on the field at any given time so battles and sieges will be hectic and epic the candyunder the hood m b s graphics is sub par compared to other titles but again they do the job and do it well trees people buildings and horses are pleasing but not beautiful bannerlord will be a step up from this but all in all great graphics don t always makes a great game out of the box there is no voice acting so boohoo start reading princess sound effects are pleasing but at times repetitive and musical scores are nice and at times authentic but again repetitive having never played multi player i will be side stepping this but from what i have read and heard it is top notch in a nutshelltaleworld s mount blade series is not the prettiest nor the ugliest girl at the fair but she is the best fun you will ever have this side of turkish delight yes giving commands to troops is a little finicky and sluggish and there is no actual story lineal or otherwise save the overall story arch you have to make your own as you go but there is a huge modding community that have ways of fixing her blemishes placing you anywhere in the historical time line anywhere in the known or fictional world including star wars g r r martin or tolkin universes now if that doesn t have you spinning faster than a dervish dancer then when m b bannerlords hits the shelf you may as well be just like the people of troy sitting behind your walls because that wooden horse is about to blow our minds once again
