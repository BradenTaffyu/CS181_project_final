2017 early access review beamng is not so much a game as it s just a big sandbox in the purest term there s no real goal unless you choose to participate in one of the few campaigns or scenarios what makes beamng for me is the fact that i can pick a location pick a car pick a loadout pick a colour and just do whatever i feel like doing roll a 3 wheeler there s a car for that tear up the tarmac there s options for that tear up low grip surfaces there s loadouts for that do all of the above at the same time go nuts you ll likely fail but the satisfaction of seeing your front wheel fly off because you bottled a corner is surprisingly long lived for fans of cars smashing cars rally car physics fun
