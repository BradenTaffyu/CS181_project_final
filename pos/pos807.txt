2017 this is a game i find very difficult to review simply because i m just not sure how to describe and explain how come i like it so much the general concept in stardew valley is to build and maintain the farm you inherited from your grandfather while maintaining your relationships with the town folks it s sort of a hybrid between a farming simulator and a dating simulator and i dare say that it s the first game of either of those genres i find enjoyable excluding agarest which also includes a dating component the graphics aren t anything special and neither is the soundtrack but the gameplay mechanics seem to be solid enough to carry the game without much help from the audio visual department basically you plant maintain and harvest crops and buy and take care of farm animals any time you feel tired of that you can go fishing socializing in town or go fight and find treasures in a local mine you can add buildings and features to your farm once you have enough money and resources so you can expand it and make it a money making machine add to that crafting and gathering and you get quite a lot of options of how to go about your farming carear while there is the ocasional bug or problem the game is stable and runs smoothly 99 of the time no special problems noted all in all if you like this type of simulation games try stardew valley as it seems to do everything right
