2019 it s the holy lovechild of dungeons and dragons path of exile and final fantasy tactics your character building and interaction is like dungeons and dragons in which every point and skill defines your character in what they do in your fights and the way npc s interact with you meanwhile the game itself is viewed in the style of path of exile a nice top down isometric view with loot drops that have little tooltips with well laid out menus to view all your gear items and stats combat as i mentioned plays like final fantasy tactics your built character and all characters go in a more open turn based combat style with their skills you ve selected and put on before the fights certain elements of magic etc combo with other elements so it becomes a very elaborate complex and interesting experience story wise this game just keeps evolving currently i believe i am only in act 2 with a friend of mine and we simply keep finding more and more to do that just keeps us having more and more fun the writing itself really sucks you into the world that was created and you really feel like you re making a difference as things evolve around you the best part is every single decision you make is not linear like most games of today most story paths have multiple ways you can go about them and fighting is not the sole decision that needs to be made 24 7 finally with workshop mod support if you wanted some mods to change things up a bit it s extremely convenient and easy i could go on for another 10 pages worth in this review but let s just end it here with i highly recommend this game tl drthe game is borderline addictive give it a try if you like games like path of exile diablo or dungeons and dragons
