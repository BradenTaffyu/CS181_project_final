2021 i started a cult there were five of us but we were still tribals with our only piece of modern technology being the red robes we wore our miner rapidly carved his way into the mountain creating rooms for us all to live in with a place to live secured we began to learn and hunt we farmed built beds learned the secrets of hydroponics and eventually we enslaved we shaved their heads made them live with tight steel collars stripped them of their name and humanity for it was what the red queen happy demanded happy deemed another was devout enough to be the abbot and so began the reign of blood every 15 days we sacrificed a lamb to the monstrosity that lived within the world s core and at the end of every year we held our festivities a slave duel to please the red queen and her minions followed by the sacrifice of the loser to feed the monstrosity everyone knew what we did was unpleasant but if not for us then who else the world had to be saved then tragedy struck we were attacked by bandits in the night had they no sympathy for their protectors we drove them off the red queen s laughter ringing in their ears but not without casualty our best fighter was hit a pellet of buckshot lodged in his brain rendering him ineffective in all but the most menial tasks it was the beginning of the end sensing weakness in her minions the slaves revolted beaten our researchers and farmers to death with stolen weapons the only ones capable of fighting were the red queen herself happy and her wife amine together they slew 12 slaves but their combined strength wasn t enough amine fell first decapitated by their first slave with the unholy relic sword and the red queen fell last but the slaves didn t kill her paralysed by pain her left arm severed and her home burning around her the slaves left her to die many scavengers have picked apart the ruins of the mysterious cult and every corpse has been accounted for save for the red queen no one knows what happened to her some say she was eaten by the monstrosity for her failure where as others say she escaped with her life and lives in some far flung part of the world plotting another rise to power regardless the cult lays dead and nought but the walls know what truly happened that day anyway that s one of hundreds of stories made by rimworld when the dev says this is a story generator he means it rimworld is phenomenal one of the best games available on steam and possibly the best colony sim on the market recommended at full price really can t go wrong with this game
