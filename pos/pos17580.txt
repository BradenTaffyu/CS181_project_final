2017 so your favourite tabletop game got axed and you ve set fire to your 3000 army out of despair whoops now you re wondering what to do next as your hobby has quite literally turned into smoke this might be the time for you to consider getting into a new hobby luckily for you warhammer fantasy didn t quite die yet as creative assembly has raised this franchise from the dead and gloriously implemented it into their total war series in the form of total war hammer if you re new to the total war series it s a strategy game that consists of two parts the first being a turn based strategy on a campaign map where you manage your empire s well being develop your cities send out your agents to do your bidding and critically fail every time engage in beautifully random diplomacy with your neighbours bolster your armies with new recruits and send said armies into the eternal meatgrinder where they will inevitably die on the fields of battle the second part of the game is where total war really shines and with the added fantasy tropes of warhammer it becomes a spectacle to behold it becomes a real time strategy where you take control of your armies in a system where your units are in squads of multiple models each ranging from 1 model of a giant to 120 empire swordsmen spearmen per squad and with the addition of magic beasts and monsters from warhammer it has elevated total war to new heights try numerous formations and tactics that you thought up while on the toilet as they fail miserably and you revert to the good old hammer and anvil this game has a bit of a learning curve but all the information you need is readily available and it s as simple as hoovering your mouse over what you re interested in as it shows you a tooltip the pros beautiful aesthetics especially the campaign mapthe battles are more interesting and diverse than ever beforeamazing singleplayer campaign with lots of replayabilitythey really cut down on the turn times from previous installmentslarge and developer supported modding scene as is the case with all total war installmentsactive multiplayerfaithfull to some extend recreation of the old world and its factionswith the addition of the other 2 total war warhammer games in the trilogy the games will merge and you will be able to play a grand campaign featuring a combined map from all 3 games that is if you buy the other 2 games the cons if you are completly new you might be a bit overwhelmed at first the game has 5 difficulty settings so you can atleast find what works for you and play at your own paceolder fans of the franchise argue that battle length has been shortened thus making the game feel a bit arcade ishquite a bit of content is from dlc packs which are on the pricey side 17 50 for a race with its own underwhelming mini campaign can be a turn off if you re on a tight budgetbridge naval and small settlement battles are not in the game while the siege battles have been overly simplified with a one sided wallloading times are on the longer side which is understandable an ssd solves this as your loading times go from 1 3 minutes to 15 20 seconds tl dr total war warhammer is an amazing game and a fantastic addition of warhammer into the total war scene it is however not without its faults and if you re interested in getting into it you should do a bit of research before dropping 60 into uncharted territory despite this i still whole heartedly recommend this game to old and new fan alike as you will undoubtebly sink hunderds of hours into this game and remember never trust the dwarfs
