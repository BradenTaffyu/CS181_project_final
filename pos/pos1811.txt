looks can be deceiving and this title is no different from the outside it might appear as an almost endearing little experience and the rabble s excessive air of obsession with a certain contraption s posterior does it no favor but do not let that fool you the seemingly innocuous frivolities of fawning over posteriors and wholesome destruction betrays a strikingly deep and even perhaps thought provoking tale my journey started with a bit of skepticism i admit but my fascination would be roused as this game started to invite genuine philosophical concepts pertaining to human nature and existentialism as time wore on i would immerse myself further into this subtle yet intriguing fable often finding myself in deep contemplation each time it would rouse a question relating to our corporeal existence unpredictably just as i began to grasp a thread of familiarity with said proposed concepts everything started to come undone right before my very eyes which i can only surmise as a trick by the creators to evoke genuine emotion from the rabble as i pen this analysis i can but faintly feel the weight of all that had occurred despite its thin and relatively tame veneer it manages to both captivate and bewitch be it by the enchantment of a fine posterior or by other less wholesome contemplations if you too seek to experience that which is second to none then i implore you to plumb the depths of this oddly enlightening experience
