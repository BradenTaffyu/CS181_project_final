2021 as is with all the dlc the game is about worth it s price the story takes second fiddle to gameplay and you have very few real choices but the non story elements like crafting colony management combat and stealth are all fun not great but fun the real value of fo4 and any bethesda game comes from modding better ai tons of new weapons new quests characters and gameplay mechanics all add their own special twist to the game i currently have 85 active mods the game is now a massive shootout 24 7 where you have a dozen companions fighting terrible monsters and your towns are fortresses the last bastions of humanity if you do get fallout 4 install vortex as quickly as possible and get the unofficial fo4 patch which fixes a lot of broken in game features
