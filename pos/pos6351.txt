2019 i m not sure what keeps me playing this game it can be infuriating to play and the grind is slow especially without premium still though it has something that keeps me starting it up maybe it s the satisfaction that you get when you do tear up the other team or pop out over a hill out of a bush and surprise someone it also helps the matches don t last too long so it is good to open it up and play a match or two when you just have 30 minutes
