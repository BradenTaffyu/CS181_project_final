2017 early access review oxygen not included this game is made by the developers of don t stave and is now an early access game i ll be honest here i never buy games that are still in development but i don t reget it for me it doesn t feel like a game in alpha especially not if you compare it to some games that are still in beta gameplay is fun addicting but can also be really frustrating especially when your colony is pretty huuuuuuuuge and don t see everything that s happening within your colony background music is kinda one sided but i m pretty sure that they will add more features along the ride controls are easy to figure out and keymapping makes sense there are still quite some bugs but hey it s an early access game and you can t blame them for that 7 1 10 worth the money only wished that oxygen was included
