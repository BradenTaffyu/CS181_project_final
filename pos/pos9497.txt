2020 loads of people say that the cars under steer too much and that it is exceptionally hard to drive it is true that when you are inexperienced and hopping in for the first time it can be very challenging imagine racing neck on neck with another car flat out down the straight trading inch for inch while you shift up gear for gear with the modded engine roaring at maximum revs towards a fast approaching corner you look to see if your opponent has slowed down yet but he hasn t your heart begins to pump and your body begins to tense and your eyes begin to widen as you get closer and closer to the corner because losing grip really punishes you in this game the fear of spinning out or overshooting the turn with under steer begins to overtake you causing conflict in your judgment you fight this semi adrenaline like state for as long as you can to brake as late as possible feeling the wheels skid as you push the car right up to the edge of grip you know accelerate too soon and you are off the track brake too hard and you are off the track slow down too much and your opponent takes the lead you take the corner wheels screeching engine sputtering at the apex you give it some throttle just to be on the acceleration before your opponent only to find that the rear wheels are spinning and your car begins to turn too much if you don t counter steer fast enough you spin out if you don t counter steer on time you spin out if you counter steer for too long you spin out your arms are twitching rapidly to find the grip and finally you feel the force feedback lock and you are on the straight again blazing until the next corner a race is filled with moments like these lap after lap the amount of focus and concentration needed to be efficient in this game is what makes it feel like you are a real race driver at least for the moment the loss of grip and control is different for each car but is possible to master like everything it just takes practice so this constant tension and rush at least for me of trying to keep the four wheels on the tarmac is what gives the optimal challenge immersion and the sweetest reward for even just finishing a race i love this game 10 10i love that it is moddablei currently have 593 carsi am using custom shaders patch and solthe game looks amazingmost cars with some sound mods and some not sound amazingi have yet to try this in vr but i cannot wait someone please buy me a headset xd
