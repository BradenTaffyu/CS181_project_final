2016 more than just a fallout 3 5 fallout new vegas is definitely an unique game for me the atmosphere the weapons the lore the npcs all of this make it my favourite game instead of having the focus on your character s story like in fallout 3 fallout new vegas puts mostly the focus on the background of those places the war between the ncr and the legion this background is so well introduced and so well placed when i met mr house for the first time i felt like it was a movie a true icone of the game thanks to this you feel like a part of the mojave and not just playing an rpg game about the gameplay the new crafting seems a bit too complicated and unworthy to be really used but the addons on weapons are really nice to get also the survival mode makes the game a great experience like in fo3 the locations are well detailled and even if they don t have a reason to be visited through some quests you ll end up doing it just to find the funny easter eggs finally about the rpg part you ll really feel like your actions have influence on the world and also how the world will react to you you have a karma with each faction and each one will change your own story in the mojave
