2015 tl dr this game is a must for anyone who likes first person shooters role playing games and open world games and hell even city builders my rating 9 10 the reason it s not 10 10 is simply the fact that there s so many bugs and gllitches it s just frustrating sometimes long version fallout 4 is by far my favorite game played so far and i played quite alot because it just has so many elements of so many different game genres it s just amazing the shooting what some fallout veterns may call boring and call of duty ish shooting mechanics i actually call a blessing because finally the shooting in a fallout game is actually fun the previous fallout games like new vegas or fallout 3 s shooting mechanics were just so sluggish and annoying and also incredibly inaccurate shots and no ads and fallout 4 really brings something new to the genre a solid shooting mechanics that are actually fun the story quests well what else is there to say about a fallout game when it comes to storyline fallout 4 has a really immersive storyline that really makes you ponder questions and dillemas that ll determine the future of the game me personally spent hours trying to figure our what to do and who to choose spoilers the brotherhood the railroad or the institute the side quests aswell are very intriguing and have a rich background story to it and also cool rewards for most of the quests in the game the characters the characters in fallout 4 both companions and just characters have so much to tell and such an interesting back story that you just want to take a seat and listen to them for hours most of the characters have a punch line to freshen things up the characters are really in depth and the voice acting is also excellent the settlements city building basically what was a complete surprise for the good the settlements feature for fallout 4 is just soooo fun you basically run a few settlements of your own scattered around the commonwealth and in the proccess fighting off synts or raiders etc building some new stuff and customizing your mini city and also make money off the market the customization pretty much anything you can imagine is customaziable and add mods to make it just the perfect experience for any one who likes to customize every little detail in his settlement weapons and wardrobe the only con i found was the amount of glitches and game breaking bugs in the game but i hope that bethesda will sort it out oh and also sprint my rating 9 10
