2018 man this is a nostalgic game i believe i can say i have played this game thoroughly but not to its entirety the basis of the game is fairly simple you collect sun and try to plant enough plants to survive the oncoming waves of zombies there are five stages total day night pool night pool and roof discounting the final level which is on the roof at night with each stage having ten levels each level gets progressively harder and most levels allow you to unlock a new plant there are 40 standard plants that are each unlocked as you complete the levels as well as eight special plants that are stronger than the others and must be planted on top of the others there are 20 minigames and 20 different puzzle levels overall you could probably complete every level and minigame within 10 15 hours or less however there are three different game modes that have an endless version the most popular of them being survival where you play on the day pool stage and waves of zombies continue coming and get progressively more difficult as you go on until nearly all of the zombies in the game are coming at once this is considered the best part of the game by many and once you get hooked into it it s difficult to stop playing it there are millions of different strategies out there and you can copy someone else s or design your own this is where the value of the games goes to me it feels like something along the lines of chess or checkers or jenga the rules and premise of the game never change but there are a seeming unlimited number of ways you can try to tackle the problem if you really enjoy this game from the start it never gets old there is always something new you can try and something more you can learn about the game pros hours and hours of replayabilityintriguing gameplaylots of different plants and zombies to learn to use and deal withfair simple to learneasy to pick up and put downwell made interfacecons relatively short story considering the price this isn t really an issue not incredibly challenging until you ve spent a few dozen hours in the endless modes all in all i would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a fun lighthearted game to play during down time or if you re just looking for a td game to play
