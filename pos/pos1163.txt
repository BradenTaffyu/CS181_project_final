2015 early access review i have now played this game more than any other game on steam basically i love it it is absolutely addicting as a basic warning you will die you will die a lot until you can find a weapon and set up a basic safe house you re in constant danger the maps are huge the zombie herds are massive this was the map when i started might help when trying to figure out where to make a safe house if you find the game too easy or too hard you can play in sandbox mode this will allow you to make it very easy or insanely difficult if you have any questions just ask on the forums you ll usually get an answer very quickly either from the developers or another player plus the developers release weekly email updates on what they ve accomplished to improve the game i ve read reviews complaining about the developers and i just don t understand it seems like they re in constant contact with the players unfortunately this game is still in early release i can t imagine how much better its going to be when officially released cause it s amazing now things to look forward to radio broadcasts npcs etc etc etc personally i m looking forward to the offical release so i can play multiplayer on a private server with all my friends that will be so much fun basically this is one of the best zombie game i ve played so far yes i m putting it right up there with left for dead 2 give this game a shot it really is wonderful 10 10edited review 11 27 16i recently restarted the game under the current build while the game is still considered an early release game it has changed quite a bit since my original review no npcs are still not finished but they ve added the radio broadcasts at the start of the game you now have radio tv broadcasts at the start of the apocalypse they ve also made the night music so much creepier there are also much larger groups of zeds all over the place and quite a few houses are already burned out as before the game is totally addictive give it a try it s an amazing game still 10 10edited review 11 27 17well it s now been a year since i last reviewed this game just started playing again i still love this game and think its quite addictive but must admit i m a bit disappointed at the progress made since a year ago i ve noticed strange changes like now my clothes can become dirty bloody why are they wasting their time and mine having to deal with getting new clothing or cleaning the dirty ones still not sure if continuing to wear the bloody clothing does some kind of damage to your health or not also noticed a change to the foraging system which is for the better you can now chose what you d like to forage for animals berries mushrooms etc the radio tv broadcasts continue to add an interesting dimension to the game however my big disappointment is that the cars and new animation are both still in testing and are both to be added hopefully soon i guess i must not have read the numerous dev posts on these topics close enough because i was under the impression that both were completed and added to the game so i guess i ll stop playing again and wait til these huge changes are finished before playing of course this game is still amazing even without these new additions give it a shot you will love it but i m still lowering my rating due to the small amount of changes i ve noticed within the last year 9 9 10edited review 11 27 20three years since i last reviewed this game the hilarious thing is that they still say it s in early access i first reviewed this game many years ago well i still play and it s still incredibly addictive even more fun being allowed to play with friends in a closed universe they ve added cars since my last review it adds quite a bit to the game you can now easily travel to other cities you also have a zed killing weapon that is probably way to strong you can just get in your car and slaughter the dead basically just buy this game it s fun creepy extremely addictive 10 10
