2015 early access review 8 10 great multiplayer experience pros 1 the multiplayer aspect changes the game from the previous one adding alot more fun and organization to your days surviving 2 the online modding community is great its got great modders who keep on adding mods to keep you hooked onto this game much like minecraft 3 the challenge in this game is rewarding and not afraid to be hard you can still adjust the game to fit your style of gameplay but the default is much reccomended cons 1 the game is intensly boring if you want to do a singleplayer game it dosent offer as much variety as dont starve rein of giants however is made up for the mods that can be added overall buy this game on a sale or if you really want to buy it now its a great example of how a survival game should be and unlike other survival games eg minecraft 7 days to die etc this actually requires alot of effort to survive
