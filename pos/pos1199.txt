2022 early access review project zomboid is a zombie survival open world 2d game developed by a small group of people based in uk it has been in early access for over 7 years at the time i am writing this review frankly i haven t played it for many hours but i can assure you that i ve experienced the game from scratch and until now i am still learning it project zomboid has many well thought out mechanics that ll keep you interested for a considerably long time it s a cruel game that is hard to learn and hard to master all the tension and enjoyment is built around you survivng for as long as possible one bite all it takes to ridicule perhaps months of irl time worth of progress the graphics are unique and immersive i never thought that a 2d game can be such a masterpiece before trying pz the atmosphere that the graphics and sound tracks combined create are magnificent even though the game does lack in few very specific areas such as rain not washing of blood of your clothes sometimes despawning or teleporting zombies a lack of sitting sleeping animations the pz community has fixed almost everything i mentioned meaning not only the small developer team are doing their job astonishingly well but the community is also way better compared to the other games communities i strongly suggest putting few hours in to the game before deciding if you like it or not since it does have its uniqueness that probably not everyone will admire 79 100
