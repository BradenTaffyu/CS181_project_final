2016 2nd update after 16 hours of play and one culture victory with france and despite some smaller flaws that still exist like not being able to rename any cities i nevertheless adhere to my former opinion this might be or at least become very soon the best entry in the series yet update after having read so many reviews stating that civ 5 is better please people remember how bland civ 5 felt before the two major dlcs were released compared to that civ 6 is a huge step forward original review while the new graphics style might need getting used to by some there s really not much to complain about the interface is sleek and polished and the new fog of war as well as the strategic view are gorgeous same goes for the amazin theme by christopher tin civilization 6 takes a fresh turn on well tried mechanics and is changing those that didn t quite work out as well as introducing a lot of new ones and they all seem to fit perfectly the base game includes nearly everything that was in the civ 5 dlcs not everything but there has to be something left for modding and dlc right let s end with this if you ever liked a 4x game in general or a civ game in particular you can grab this one without hesitation it might be or at least become very soon the best entry in the series yet
