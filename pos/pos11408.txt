2023 early access review so i ve been holding out my comments on this game for a good long time now been playing since a20 which was a decent version imo a20 felt as though you could really get the ball rolling and set up your base have folks spec into certain skills and they were your crafter collector defender stealth ops etc being someone that has speced into every play style i ve seen how the builds work and how they function and overall i enjoyed the different options and choices in both home defense and in how to execute your missions a few tweaks i would like to see would be to make things progress a bit slower and have the bloodmoons be better as in less hectic waves zombies that don t have 200iq and zombies that don t break physics ie pyramid zombies that stand on each other and have their block damage setting not be as though each one have a degree in engineering and a viable power drill aside form that farming is a joke of a skill since you get seeds and not enough to replant your harvest each time so you buy the seeds to get a handful of crops until you spec into it then it s maybe 2 profit after wringing out seeds enter a21 yikes where do i start rac random a chance runs rampant a forge and workbench takes you nearly 5 days to gather up you are chained to the traders for improvement a motorbike takes about 7 9 days if you re lucky i ve been lucky to find enough water to make ends meet since you can t collect it anymore with jars the first blood moon you re base is just going to be destroyed might as well get used to that a lot of what was implemented was not great however i do enjoy the skill book idea for when it comes to crafting the respective items i just wish the ability to find them was better chance or idk allow the crafters to still gain access to their respective tricks to be better ie the workbench and forge need to be lower for a base building game the essential item you need to do the base defense is locked till maybe the day before your first horde which let s talk about that for a moment shall we blood moon the special time of the week where zombies destroy your base if you don t have at least two smg turrets watching any ends a shotgun turret watching the doors two trained crew members with at least 300 rounds respectively and a dedicated repairman with maybe a bruiser of talented ability wading through the lines if i may offer some advice here set the blood moon to be waves not time because the mechanic is to have the time between 22 00 4 00 be zombies will spawn constantly with a cap based on the amount per player they will charge at any weakpoints in the defenses and will decimate a base that is not at least equipped with cement walls and proper trap outer defenses it s a point that i would itterate that needs the most improvement as it s a proper pain in the a each blood moon as time progresses the waves get more and more difficult with the addition of cop zombies that explode bomb zombies that explode with more force spider zombies that will leap over walls armored zombies that take more rounds to fix said issues i d recommend having slower zambaboways for the beginning waves to allow newer players to get warmed up to the pace and have the zomboids come in waves at set intervals ie wave one 6 common zombies per player set at 22 00 wave two 4 common 2 armored set at 23 00 wave three 4 armored zombies set at 23 30 so on so forth maybe even increase the amount each blood moon and their speed respectively instead it s sprinting zombies with claws made of steel to demolish your base cause a pox on your head and your family if it wasn t for setting tweaks and mods i feel this game would not have lasted as long as it has now the up selling points it does a good job of letting you just get lost in the grind of missions and just shut your brain off and take down zombies left and right satisfyingly so i might add once you get a motorcycle and then the truck you know you ve progressed to late game and you feel it the feeling of satisfaction that comes from having proper planning for each defense of the zombies takes a lot of luck and planning for those that just enjoy the mining and woodcutting of making a proper base it s a good feeling i just wish there were decent horde mechanincs from mindless zombies not einstein leveled cheaty drones all working for their undead queen for the mission runners and scavengers there is a nice point of need this need that level of shopping from locations that respawn each mission run your cooks are supplemented with a nice array of dishes that should be expanded on some more for added benefits just saying that can decided on what ingredients to send their crew out for in short the way i see this game is the crafters and home bodies give a shopping list of materials for their crews to get snag for them the scouts scavengers mercs go run jobs or shop around for the home bodies to be able to work on the base during this time random packs of enemies should be drawn to the overall noise being made by the settlement testing the defensive fortitude that comes from proper planning from the home bodies meaning when a land claim is down events should begin to take place around the base such as magnetizing mini hordes to the base the raiders that were teased in a21 coming to attack undead dogs starting to come attack local population of birds coming to try and raid the crops of the farmers banshees harassing the harvesters or local dogs wolves bears mountain lions doing the same perhaps having crawlers that can dig through the earth and having pockets of pois underground that these crawlers will be in that might be antagonized by mining operations having supply drops being centered around land plots instead of location of players having events at the traders such as an extra trader from time to time that sells you stock you couldn t make at a high price or full out vehicles or special items the good stuff so as to reward your mercs with limited time offers there are a lot of options this development team can go into and i m giving this game a recommendation because even after all of the stupid ideas and updates it s still fun mindless bloodthirsty fun with a community that is annoyed enough to play the game long enough to critique it properly and give their annoyed responses we love this game and really want it to be something special we just hope the development team will take what we say into consideration and actually implement the damn changes
