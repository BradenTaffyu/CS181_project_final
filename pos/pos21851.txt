2017 dark souls iiiimportant premise the following review is based on my personal experience pros cons soundtracks care for the details dubbing sceneries realism originality online functionalities gameplay faults matchmakingexplanation pros the soundtracks have been realized with an incommensurable mastery passion and love each one of them is perfectly coherent with the experiences the player is living and perfectly represents the story and the essence of every boss that is encoutered the care for the details is undoubtely impressive the ashes flying away from the torch with a direction based on the wind the areas and structures design the camera view getting blury while passing through a spiderweb the shadow of the main character getting bigger or smaller based on his distance from the fire and much more the dubbing is in my honest opinion spectacular i believe i have almost never heard in a videogame such realistic convincing voices other than perfectly coherent with every meetable character the sceneries are incredibly realistic full of atmosphere and some of them even majestic thanks to the praiseworthy care for details and the excellent sound effects realism is another strenght point this game has naturalness of the character s movements alongside with npcs common enemies and bosses in a specifical boss fight the huge wings flapping of the enemy makes the character tossing back due to the huge air blow during another boss fight the enemy roared as sign of victory after defeating me what i want to say with these examples is that it looks like reading a fantasy book and living it firsthand there is also a lot of originality you never know what s coming every boss fight is different from the others there are some environmental interactions that have to be done in order to proceed and much more i can t continue with the examples because they would be dangerous spoilers but i can surely say that after sometime i just kept being surprised over and over again and left for a long time speechless cons the online functionalities still have evident problems especially about pvp player versus player from my personal experience 70 of the times there was a huge lag that made the game session basically unplayable despite my internet connection is more than suitable for it the introduction of limited area matchmaking function helped just very marginally having almost an unnoticed impact luckily the pvp arena seems to be immune from this problem also the online is not free from hackers altough it s very rare i just met one in 127 hours of gameplay he didn t take any damage despite the constant blows that hit him there are some gameplay faults for example some enemies can still hit you through a wall there are very rare problems with environment interactions sometimes when i walk up and there are stairs my character got blocked and i had to change direction to unlock him artificial intelligence very rarely not working properly attacking randomly if provoked from distance attacking the character and then randomly returning to its position i have also experienced some rare random and huge fps drops despite my machine can easily run this game with every setting on maximum without any problem i solved it by reloading the area very rarely some enemies got stuck inside the surfaces finally when i tried to deposit some items in the storage they returned back to my inventory the matchmaking is indeed criticizable because it completely ignores the skill difference of the players this usually causes an almost immediate victory loss without the loser even having the chance to react for example out of the 70 pvp matches i did i won only one final considerations i personally do not recommend playing this game with a guide because it might ruin the surprise element one of the most important features this product has even if you are in great difficulty you can always ask for help to the community there are a lot of good players who will be glad and willing to help assisting you through jolly cooperations if you feel like you need a pause or simply do not want to go foward you can always help the others by being summoned as a ghost in any area you have already visited in this way you will be able to explore better the places you have already been at and where you will have to go while helping another player the main plot linked to the two previous games concludes here giving generally any explanation to the unanswered questions through dialogues descriptions and surroundings it s a game rich of contents probably the richest it took me more than 120 hours to complete it while the previous ones required me 82 and 90 hours each the dlcs are definitely at the same level of the main content quality speaking this game is good both for people who don t care about the plot and want to just smash everything and for the ones who instead are interested to it howewer for the second ones i strongly recommend to firstly play dark souls prepare to die edition and dark souls ii scholar of the first sin in order to understand what s going on or just watching a youtube video that explains it if you don t wanna i definitely suggest this game to anyone who likes the genre personal scores graphics 9 plot 9 gameplay 8 sound 8 music 10 overall 4 4 5 if you have any questions for further information feel free to ask may the flames guide thee
