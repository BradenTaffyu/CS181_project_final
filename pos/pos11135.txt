2018 i love this game as you can see by the time i have spent playing i pre ordered and have been playing since release some levels have been more challenging than others i move on then go back and revisit the ones that gave me problems i love the challenge i played theme hospital to death and it remains one of my favorite all time games this has been a game i have waited for all the fun of th with updated interface pleasing ai and lots more sick people to manage to some that are complaining about buggy play glitches etc some of them appear to be personal hardware or conflict issues rather than game issues did it have some bugs in the beginning sure but they fixed them pretty quickly i am an old gamer have played tons of games over the years i learned to stay away from the beta early release type games they are buggy they are not finished they change all the time and never seem to ever be finished in a way that you can play them with certainty everyone complaining about the money for this game maybe because you are used to cheap betas that are never finished and use your game experience to try and finish their game ideas that is why they are cheap this is a finished game it can be played right away they have been responsive to bug fixes and the community feedback and i for one am enjoying every minute of it on the price i paid more for theme hospital back in the day than i did for this game with inflation that makes that old game much more expensive maybe this just isn t the type of game for you thats an easy fix move on i dont play first person shooter games cause they frustrate me if i play one i am not gonna give it a bad review because its not the games fault its me i just don t enjoy that type of game someone mentioned in a previous review that this was for teenagers lol really i have grandchildren so there goes your assumption its for anyone who likes this type of game if you dont thats ok if you like time manaegment games sim strategy games etc or if you loved theme hospital this game is for you just my opinion
