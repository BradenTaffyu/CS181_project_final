2023 edit after finishing chapter 3 and with the new roadmap i think this review is complete if anything else changes i ll edit accordingly limbus company is good and fun in spite of all its problems i don t see this game as lesser than its sibling games of lobotomy corporation and library of ruina if you enjoyed the previous works this game will be good gacha and currencyi m starting right with the gacha because that s probably what most people are going to focus on it s okay but certainly not generous right out of the game rerolling on mobile devices is fast and gives you 30 tries to pull with rates considered it s about 8 3 chance to get a specific 000 ssr identity looking at what you pay for it seems to be about 16 usd per 10 pull not accounting for first time packages there are monthly packs at 3 and 7 dollars that give a small daily amount and the battle pass is 11 dollars a lot of people seem to be hung up on the day 1 battle pass but i m personally numb to it mind that they have already confirmed that all identities ego from the pass will become available once the pass expires so the arguments of fomo feel like they fall short here each season lasts for 3 months meaning the 11 dollars is more akin to less than 3 dollars a month the equivalent of a monthly currency pack people who don t want to pay for live service games are justified in their concerns but compared to other expoitative gacha games on the market limbus company is not one of those games and i feel comfortable spending small amounts on it knowing i won t be squeezed out for every nickel and dime for the people who don t want to pay for their pulls the story is a bit more complicated lunacy the currency for gacha pulls is very limited story missions and chapters are not particularly generous at the start of the game past the initial 30 pulls so you may find you have to reroll or work with what you get upgrading gear for their third skills and passives require turning shards the dupe currency into upgrade materials which eats into one s ability to craft identities i was worried about this and it does seem like the 400 shards needed to spark an identity you want is not going to be as accessible as one would hope edit as of the announced roadmap march 16th will add farmable content that gives identity exp and threads for uptying as well as adding lunacy to the weekly rewards for mirror dungeons while the lunacy is only one third of a free pull per week the fact is that f2p players will no longer have to decide whether to use their mirror dungeon farming to upgrade characters or to save for a spark free to play limbus is certainly feasible but i worry that new content and the frequency of new gacha banners will alienate those people who can t spend story and worldboth lobotomy corporation and ruina were known to have incredibly stellar writing ruina especially was good at giving a detailed look into the world of the city through its piece by piece storytelling limbus company has large shoes to fill and i don t really blame people for finding the initial writing lacking in comparison it s slow starting out and the length of each chapter is not used quite well as opposed to the short yet potent snapshots of reception stories in ruina the early chapters really do feel mostly filler even from the perspective of narrating and explaining the world moving on from chapter 2 onwards the story picks up immensely once the game familiarizes the player to its setting it takes off with typical project moon intensity new areas are brought in and the factions within the regions are as fantastic and wild as we d expect one thing i have to note as well is the way they pace their cutscenes limbus company feels like they actively want to avoid the bloated wordcount in cutscenes of other story intense games like arknights cutscenes are fairly short in comparison to those and are often split up between multiple different chapters involving fights while the fights can be seen as filler i personally think it s a good call to help break between the monotony of story and character dialogue there s a lot of thought put into the story and writing of this game limbus company certainly continues to uphold project moon s rich story and world building gameplaylimbus can be described as ruina but watered down but i think that s both misleading and also not even that bad of a thing ruina was lovely it s huge and in depth and once one gets a hang of the system each floor becomes a sandbox for a mess of builds and strategies but it s also confusing as hell preparation takes forever and often requires shuffling through massive amounts of ui hell and actual gameplay slows to a crawl as single turns can take 5 minutes to plan and execute i ve spent a large majority of my time in ruina rifling through different builds discovering ways to loop pages and find secret synergies between mechanics but i also know when i talk about ruina to most people they resort to 2 to 4 primary builds on 1 floor and rarely shift their strategy i don t think it s a bad thing for limbus to not want to repeat ruina in that regard this game is not library of ruina and the people who keep comparing it to library of ruina will be constantly disappointed targeting is automated compared to ruina but the order is consistent and encourages using defense dice to deal with attacks that you can t directly clash with clashes now use coins and determining potential values of heads tails flips creates more predictable results compared to the dice rolling of ruina teams often have synergies built into each other and expects you to find ways to make sinners work with each other the game is difficult just as ruina was but at the end of the day it s a functional and playable game most people need to learn how to play it instead of trying to play the game as if it s yet another ruina mod even so i agree that the main problem with gameplay is the inherit lack of control in the targeting system perhaps it s because the game s still new and we have to get used to the ai s targeting but the lack of control feels like it limits a lot of strategic planning even if we aren t able to have full control over our team i think being able to give some kind of general command to influence sinner s targeting would be more interesting limbus is a one of a kind game just as all of its previous games were i think the gameplay requires a lot of hands on learning and hard beats but it s the kind of difficulty and learning curve i ve come to enjoy last thoughtsi think most people will enjoy what limbus company has and it s worth looking into if you want to see more of what the city has in store the gacha aspect is disappointing to most people but believe me when i say that limbus company truly feels like a fully developed game firstmost and a gacha secondary in the best way possible i ve been following these games since library of ruina s initial release i remember when ruina first came out when we had to level up our pages and passives were functionally randomized i remember how long it took them to change major gameplay mechanics and how the difficulty spiked and spiked often the game only got better as it kept developing but even then still had its mechanical bloat and difficulty and it still takes hours to load compared to ruina limbus company s initial release has been almost dream like minus the initial bugs and server issues i can say limbus came out with far more than ruina did which only gives me more excitement for what more they ll release
