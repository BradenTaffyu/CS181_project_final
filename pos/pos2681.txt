2017 early access review you will love this game if you like games that don t hold your hand you like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences you like games that truly reward exploration and investigation legit if you don t sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests ladders ledges etc you re doing it wrong you like high strategy turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning you like finding using selling or collecting loot you have 1 or more friends that will play with you this game shines in multiplayerthe handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is and it s still in early access i see a lot of complaints that the story isn t long enough or really focusing on the bugs lets get real bugs sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit sometimes your characters won t be within range or have line of sight on a target they clearly should accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off 80 chance to hit is more like 30 anything under 90 is troublethat s about it story is too short well then play the rest of the game kid you can speed run the story in like 20 minutes if you wanted the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do i honestly can t believe how good this game is for an ea release and i can t wait for the full release come september could not recommend highly enough things i would like to see in future more races more in depth customisation options for spells and abilities think champions online or the oblivion spell creation asking for a lot i know a little control over what armour looks like on your character more spells more synergy between spells this is already great but why stop at great the more points i list the more i realise i m just asking for more of the game give me more of the game mate
