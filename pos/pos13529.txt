2016 i have spent so much time on kerbal space program this is one game i keep coming back to after years of play the sandbox nature of the game combined with the numerous parts available leads to endless possibilities for rockets planes space probes boats trucks cars and really anything you can think of take the base game and add mods like infernal robotics and tweakscale and you have so much more to do then add an additional 150 mods from ckan and there is literally no end to what can be accomplished 10 10
