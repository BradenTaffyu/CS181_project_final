2015 this is my first review because i am scared of people this is an opinionated biased or whateve review but enough of that so far i have been enjoying fallout 4 as i did with the previous games bethesda has made some more than others and while i do think it is good it isn t exactly perfect as no games are without their flaws positive i believe that bethesda made the enviorment of the game good in the aspect of some places creepy and some interactions funny i have been immersed with the game for a while exploring the wastes of nuclear fallout the game felt like it was giving me a full package unlike some that would supply us with dlcs to keep us interested in the game i was constantly in to the game i was playing fo4 was constantly supplying me with entertainment and there weren t many dull moments while i do enjoy the game like i said earlier the game isn t in my opinion perfect or great i can only describe it as a bethesda game each one are good with their own merits and their own interestes and enjoyment i enjoy the rpg aspect of the game and it is what i expected negative there are some game breaking bugs out there it detracts from the immersiveness that the game provides some may not encounter it and some may but some makes the game unplayable an example of this would be the boston after dark quest line where i m sure many people besides me have experienced many crashes while crashes in a bethesda game is common i kept getting constantly crashed and i couldn t complete the quest while i do think that bethesda would fix this it made me go from being immersed to now having a stronger obstancle to wait another would be the constant side quests from my settlements to help them at first it was interesting but after saving sanctuary from an area that s ten or more miles away that they are so afraid they would get invaded even though i put turrets everywhere the annihilating the raiders or ghouls quests have started to make me tired of them after doing it constantly for five times funny there are many funny bugs and glitches that maybe encountered through your playthrough for me an interesting glitch was that some feral ghouls would be docile towards me despite being in front of them until i engage them in combat in the end if you are impatient and couldn t wait like me i would recommend playing this game it is what you would expect from a bethesda game and that is all i can explain about it sorry i am bad at reviews but bethesda is one of the few companies i like and uhh yeah s thank you for reading 8 10 press e to activate skeleton
