2020 early access review think minecraft plus zombies and some added realism but zombies so not really realistic it s a hecka fun game that does a good job at being scary but incredibly fun to play casually with friends or on your own with a set map or a randomly generated one you craft things you build bases and you loot things you can change any type of setting in the game to fit your playstyle want a challenge crank up all the difficulty settings make zombies run fast at you and make them do more damage and spawn in higher numbers you want to focus on building instead of fighting the undead turn off zombie spawns and decrease the strength of blocks so you can farm faster even with all those configurable settings you can even create your own character put yourself in this fun game 25 for this fun game compared to 60 for a call of duty remake it s gonna be worth your while plus this game is pretty damn good for a hardcore
