2018 we need steam emote and background for tzynn empire jokes aside why this game has mixed negative reviews is the update 2 0 which changes major aspects of the game while some say it balances the game in a positive way the others say it made the game unecessarily complicated for me there are some changes i like and some i don t changes i like one of the reasons why it recieved many negative reviews limiting ftl travel to hyperlanes pre determined routes your fleets need to follow to travel from system to system while there were other ftl types as warp drive that allowed player to travel short slow but unrestricted routes and wormholes which i never used warp drive was far superior to any other ftl drives it allowed its user to bypass chokepoint which hyperlanes created and travel over systems where enemy had strong forces and turned the tides of battles to the favor of the player as ai never understood that you can ignore its fully upgraded fortress and continue your way but with 2 0 update everyone has to use hyper drive which allows more strategic ideas and in my opinion balances the game now you can upgrade your outpost which i will cover later into a full fledged fortress and stop enemy from entering your territories but the same applies to the enemy predict where enemy fleets will travel through and stop them on their tracks and vice versa but there is still jump drive available at mid to late game allowing one to make strategic skips like warp drive did but with a 200 days which is not that long if you don t jump into battle cooldown and combat penalties and this really really makes the game more enjoyable if you know waht you are doing i like how they changed borders from a dynamic and inconsistent area into static and strategic teritorries before 2 0 update your borders grew as you build frontier outposts colonised planets and researched technologies that increased borders it was stupid that you can almost take half of others teritorries just by abusing frontier outposts or fallen empires declare you war because you without knowing somehow expanded your borders and took their 2 mineral system if the empire you are at war destroyed your frontier outpost the area it covered became uncontrolled and was taken by others as you and your enemy are busy with war with 2 0 update you start the game with a single system your home world and expand your borders by building outpost that both don t cost much and don t require much maintenance and upkeep and while at war you can take outpost from your enemy into your control without destroying it which gives war a much more dynamic and strategic feel for e g before you end the war by white peace you can take their total of 43 mineral 21 energy systems and make up for your loses if you were unable to enforce your demands another example if the end game crisis lost its systems which previously belong to some other empire you can quickly build outposts to get them and their previous owner can t do anything same applies to them of course like i said it make the game more strategic and enjoyable rather than dealing with civilization v esque borders fleet limit that came with 2 0 update man it does not make sense by view point of an intergalactic empire but it turns battles from an all in into real fights before 2 0 you could fit as many as ships into a single demi god admiral and swoop up the entire battlefield with a 3 2m fleet consisting of only battleships now your fleets have a limit how much it can carry 50 early game 120 mid game 210 late game and you need to hire more than one admiral to make effective use of them of course you can still make a fleet with only corvets or battleships but it will be easier to hunt down them compared to a normal fleet layout you now need to send your fleets strategically to win the war if you keep them as one of course you can win againts enemy fleets easily but you will lose a lot of outposts making you the losing side another thing this mechanic balances is awakened empires and fallen empires oh boy if one of them declared war on you a whooping 5m would crush your hopes and dreams easier than a spaghetti strand now they spread out their fleets to maximize their capture speed with only five 1m fleets ganking on you if you attack one ground battles were a joke before 2 0 update what your enemy has a planet with 25 of the most powerful defense armies then rain upon them 7130682359 of cheapest of attack armies problem solved yeah there is a limit how many defense armies you can hold in a planet but there were no limit on how much attack armies you can land on a planet it was stupid to rub salt to the wound you could equip your armies with advanced weapons but you have to equip every soldier one by one by hand they did all oh and there was an planetary shield building that reduced the fortification damage your armies suffered which honestly did and gave no resources now the same building still exits but is much more effective and gives decent science output now wiht the limit of armies you can land and battle attrition you suffer from losing ground battles your army composition and general matters and now you bomb the planet to not reduce the defending armies fortification bonus rather to kill the defending armies and civillians and destroy buildings you can now bomb enemy armies to ashes to capture the planet without suffering war exhaustion before 2 0 update if you declared war on someone it could literally last until end of time if you declared war on an ai empire and could not support enough battleships to one shot their fleet it turned into a struggle of attrition while you tried to create your fleet again ai would create somewhat ok fleet and attack your planets and destroy your starports halting your reinforcement you had to stop its fleet which created an vicious cycle you destroy its attacking fleet lose your newly created ships build new starports to create your ships again get halfway through your reinforcement ai attacks again and destroys your starports and etc if you ever tried to attack it while it has lost all your ships oh dear i almost forgot the dreadful harass fleets of the ai empires if you crushed their fleets and tried to capture their planets instead of forming another reasonable fleet they just created 3 corvet fleets and would destroy your fully upgraded starports and harrased you to no end it was not fun so you could never leave your borders to attack it only the war ends when someone decleares war on you or your enemy but most probably they decleare war on you cus you know now with 2 0 update came war exhaustion and white peace war exhaustion accumulates for both sides and whenever someone loses a space battle or ground battle loses an planet or even spends too much on army and fleet upkeep they gain war exhaustion and there in no way of losing it meaning you have to think twice before doing anything and do them cautiously for e g now you can bomb a planet to completely remove its defense army to gain no war exhaustion from ground battle if ones war exhaustion reaches 100 after 2 years the other side can force them in to a white peaces which ends the war in status quo both sides hold the systems they got form each other during the war or if you successfully decimated their fleets and destroyed their starports restricting them from building more ships you can enforce your demands like humliataing their leader or taking your claimed systems and planets complete with their populations of course as a purifier you can never enforce your demand i mean who accepts getting killed or slowly turning into energy as far as i can remember these are things i like about this update wow i reached the character limit so more is at comments
