2016 do you like harvest moon animal crossing what if those two games were blended together well thats basically what stardew valley is and its perfect i love both of these games and having a game that takes great elements from both and puts them into one game and releases it on pc no less is a game i m all in for if you don t know what those games are or how they work i ll explain stardew valley for you otherwise you should pick up this game its great and you ll love it if you love either or both of those basically your just a person that farms and lives in a town with lots of activities and collectables to participate in you can build relationships with townspeople adventure in a mine explore the forest fish raise a family and obviously farm its a very relaxing game and probably isn t something you ll play for 12 hours in one day unless your super in love with it but to me its more of something i d pick up for one or two hours a day tend to my farm talk to people progress in the world and put it down for the rest of the day basically like animal crossing but a benifit to this game at least to me is its not real time it has its own game timer so you can progress through multiple days and build your farm over one game session thats basically stardew valley there isn t much more to be said about it its a great simulation of living on a farm and meeting new people i m glad to see this game doing so well and with the price of 15 bucks i think its definitely worth it even if you don t like it you ll know by 2 hours in and you can just return it honestly though if your into simulation farming rpg elements or exploring you should pick this up great game that came out of nowhere for me buy at full price
