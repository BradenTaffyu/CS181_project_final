2020 early access review fun car simulator that looks amazing the physics are spot on and the cinematic features make it perfect for making cool stunt or crash videos don t be turned off that its early access or 25 dollars it s definitely worth the price you can find loads of cool mods with cars trucks car parts and planes in them on the bmg drive website requires a beefy computer but that s the price for amazing graphics it is also well optimized for the graphics compared to some games
