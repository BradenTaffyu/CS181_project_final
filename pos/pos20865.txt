2023 it is an enchanting game that transports you to the magical world of harry potter i was thoroughly entertained for numerous hours by the game s excellent balance of exploration magic and adventure one of the things i loved about the game was the attention to detail that was put into recreating the world of harry potter it was truly immersive and exciting to experience the hogwarts castle quidditch games and magical animals all come to life also i liked how the character evolved along the course of the game into a powerful witch with special spells and powers however while the game is amazing in many ways it does suffer from optimization issues i faced stuttering and low fps throughout the game despite having a decent pc that should have been able to handle it this did detract from the overall experience as it was frustrating to have the game lag and stutter during crucial moments despite the optimization issues i still highly recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of the harry potter franchise or anyone who enjoys immersive rpg games the game s attention to detail engaging storyline and magical world make it an experience that is not to be missed
