an honest review after patch 1 1 6f1 before i deep dive into this for those who want a quick play or pass i say play the game is legitimately fun to play there are still plenty of cons and i ll get to those but first i wanna give credit where credit is due the game in the last two patches has made leaps and bounds in improvements the economy actually matters now just when i thought i had everything figured out my garbage dump was full and i didn t have money to just buy more tiles and build more i had to contract in these services and my economy essentially came to a halt perfect i had to dig myself out of a whole and it was fun the high rent issue is a thing of the past essentially and maybe that was fixed a couple patches ago i skipped a couple patches there waiting for one of more substance compute performance has made significant improvement there s not much more to say there i was able to get to about 90k population before it felt like my computer was turning into a slug i9 12900k 3070ti 32gigs ram the detailers patch didn t see that one coming and it was needed there s such a demand for education in cs 2 it really annoyed me having the same elementary school every 3 blocks in a densely populated area although a lot of these schools are still necessary they can be a little further apart with the higher head count and they blend in better i never thought i d really get into some of the detailing stuff that was added but sure enough i did and it was fun it at least gives you more to do while your waiting for the game to do its simulation now i think it may be time to talk about the cons there s still bugs plenty of them and the performance still needs significant work i ve encountered the mail bug which was really annoying but the larger more game breaking one for me was the mass fluctuations in population that seem to be unexplainable i got to around 80k population everyone was happy there was plenty of education and jobs available and then see ya people just seem to start dying and moving away in herds dropped like 20k cims couldn t figure it out and gave up came back a couple days later and almost instantly my cims starting coming back i was able to duplicate this multiple times as i stated early once you get enough cims it just seems like the simulation comes to a grinding halt i ll literally walk away from my computer and poke my head in on occasion while i m off doing chores because things are just moving so slowly the graphics still have room for improvement too most notably i ve encountered flickering lighting when cycling from night to day and visa versa ghosting from vehicles vegetation leaves much to be desired there s plenty of work to be done her but i am confident co already knows this closing thoughts it is my humble opinion that this is the state the game should have been released on the game has bugs and performance issues but it is fun to play i would recommend this game to friends in its current state so long as i knew they were running a pretty stout computer now for what may be an unpopular opinion between co walking back the lets call it for what it was mistake of a beach front properties dlc the massive economy patch and the surprise gift of the detailers patch co has regained their standing with me provided the next dlc had even slightly more substance per dollar then i feel i probably would jump on board i look forward to seeing what improvements they continue to make and whatever else they may have in store for us and on that note happy city building
