2022 i really love this game but i don t have the words to really describe it if anyone else should buy it its a classic resource management simulator the type that existed before the likes of the sims and roller coaster tycoon the game play isn t ancient it has modern game play advancements as well as slight multiplayer community goals it has humor in the form of lots of puns and attractive graphics your role is hospital administrator and you come into hospitals to get them up and running there are certain goals the game requires such as diagnosing curing patients research building different treatments and balancing the books so the hospital doesn t go out of business accessibility is just ok you can do everything with just a mouse pointer and clicking any accessibility devices that emulate those should work fine however some of the interaction works better when using the mouse with the keyboard which becomes more of an issue in later stages of the game depending on your disability level and accessibility devices you should be able to play and unlock the entire game but getting 3 stars at each hospital might be unrealistic i only have the use of my left arm and i struggled with placing objects and holding the control key to find tune where they go
