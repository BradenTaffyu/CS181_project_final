2016 i ve owned and played every single operation flashpoint arma and all their spin off s and this one is sheer perfection pro s insane level of graphical realism at all levels such as terrain textures facial animation destruction of enviroment right up to bots that look all too human very forgiving game system that allows players with out of date gaming rigs to still be able to play the most realistic shooting system bar none employ the ace 3 workshop mod and be the sniper the kit includes everything the modern military sniper has in his kit such as wind direction compass ballistic charts and this all comes into play with true real world ballistics buildings come down certain cover doesn t provide cover bullets go through multiple people with mods in play it gets very bloody unlimited number of workshop items maps scenarios servers etc already out there and tons more coming the best most real online gaming experience a full sandbox mode that is so good that i have not been playing anything else but arma 3 for months pretty much expect to see me living in this game in my spare time this is the best game i ve ever played thousands of weapons vehicles attachments bot types nationalities etc epic gigantic fully sandboxable maps that stretch miles upon miles in all directions there must be 100 maps i have at least 60 dowloaded and that i am playing with already isis taliban and other scumbagery to put hot lead into buckle up soldier you have tea bagging to do here is the biggest one of all the mods in the workshop that are totally free give you every single mission and map from all the other arma s and operation flashpoints so if you liked the arma gold edition and loved playing with the vehicles and different units then tada surprise there in here too so own one arma and own them all if you have 3 and the mods just check out the mods i subscribed to and go nuts i am stupid hillarity when you see the first guys reaction after you smoke the guy he is healing make sure you have the bloodlust mod and the head popper mod on this is a crazy one wwii units yes you can have isis taking on an ss panzer division if you wish one decision which scum bag to play as there are several mods that bring wwii units tanks and aircraft to the game and wow does it make this a game and a half to own 4 words moisin nagant sniper rifle nuff said there are too many positives to go on about the game is everything i ever wanted in a first person shooter 10 10 cons you down own it yet and are stuck reading this go buy it you cheap bugger p very few still thinking stop pressing me ok a few things load times are long the servers are filled with gaming gods some mods will get you vac banned so turn off the ones that apply to getting you banned their pretty darned obvious and it s simple enough to do with turn off all mods button then just click on the few that are allowed on servers no biggie some mods have issues with other mods so it s like skyrim so expect a few crashes here and there as you figure out what works with what however with me having over 150 mods in play at once i d say this is beyond minor you are looking for gripes right i don t have many so in the end i am going to say this is the fps you always wanted if you didn t know you wanted it and you are a gun nut a blood thirsty nut and overall fan of seeing heads coming off at the seams then luck be a lady tonight this is your game
