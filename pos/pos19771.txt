2019 i am a player from china and begin to play this game about 20 years ago i have to say that her aesthetic image historical immersion and rich in strategic attracted me deeply in fact even 20 years later there are still a lot of fans in our country who love this game deeply and of course i am a member of them even i am a total rookie in pvp mode so let me say this microsoft and the working team have done a nearly flawless job they not only keep the feel of the original game but also add many exciting features first of all the de version adds 4 new civilizations and 3 new campaigns like the aoe2 always do all of the new civilizations have their individual building style i hope that is a beginning not an end actually i think most gamers want to purchase new exquisite skin and dlc which has new grand campaigns by the way i think chinese campaigns are too less is that because of political if you will put forward a new dlc with chinese campaigns i will definitely purchase it and recommend it to my friends as well as in the chinese aoe community in another aspect de makes a significant improvement in the graphic including but not limited to the plant water and medieval style building and soldiers you can even experience this game like a scenic movie or a museum i am not a game graph designer but i think this is a challenge for the dev team is it a competitive game so you must keep the units in game are easy to identify as well have their individually own characteristics obviously the dev team has given a good answer to us another big improvement is the sound included the new orchestral remastering of the soundtrack and new in game unit voice line it gets more clean and fulness you know the sound in a game may not the most important part but can evoke the deepest memory in the people s brain after many years so it is definitely a necessary part of a great game actually to choose a villager and keeping right click the mouse on a tree then listen to ch ch ch ch ch ch chopper in chinese it is fa fa fa fa fa fa mu gong is one of the deepest memory for me and many players what s more the improved ui design and abundant detail also give me a deep impression now with the help of new ui you can easily know how many idle villagers you have now and how many military teams you have formed for me the most convenient new function is that in one operation i can choose every military unit in a box and not include any villagers on the other hand abundant detail also makes me very exciting for example every civilization have their own wonder they are made by different materials such as rock wood and so on that s not important the most important is all of the wonders have their individually collapse animation perhaps that s not a hard job but let me know how deep the dev team loves to aoe 2 another interesting new feature i have to point out is the art of war mode it comes from a famous art of war book called master sun s art of war which written by a chinese strategist called sun tzu i have to say i am so proud of this the new player can get significant progressive by overcoming the challenge in this mode to be honest after 3 hours of playing i still can t get the gold medal that seems to prove that i am still a rookie lol at last i want to give forward some improvement opinions to aoe2 de that s not complaints but because i want aoe2 de to get better and better 1 the cost of a huge volume of virtual memory i believe that s will be the most complaints from the gamers in the community for me my computer has 16g memory but still can t play the game with high graphic dlc at first the game will crash most of the time until i change my virtual memory to 20g i am a cs major graduate student so i know something about the game running but i don t think all gamers can solve this problem in a short time so i really look forward that the next patch can fix this or aoe2 will lose many players especially new players 2 i really miss the death voice and skeleton of every unit not because i am a madman for gameplay it will remind you that you lose a unit don t know it is just because of this feature just uncompleted or it will never back 3 for playing the recorded game i think a progress bar is very necessary if possible a cursor follows function will be good for us to learn from professionalism that s all i want to say for this game right now despite it is not easy for a non native english man i just want to say i love this game so no matter for the old player or those who want to come into a new world if you still didn t purchase don t be hesitate
