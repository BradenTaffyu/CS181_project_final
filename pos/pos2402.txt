2020 i had this from bethesda launcher and just moved the game to steam i played it when it first came out and disliked how empty the world felt so never went back to it now with the latest wastelanders update it feels more like a classic fallout game with so many issues still affecting the game from becoming a hit like fps issues and the aggressive microtransaction model it s hard giving it a positive review regardless it s the first time in weeks i sat down for more than 2 hours straight and had fun on a game with all the npc interactions and interesting building mechanics looting and just exploring the massive open world i guess that s all it takes for me looking forward to progressing the game and hopefully some of you joining me online
