2022 dead cellsdead cells dead cells what a game it s able to fuse the metroidvania and rogue lite playstyle into a near perfect title we re very fortunate to live in the second golden age of great side scrolling metroidvania games as we do now despite being quite old and being born in the backend of the mega man metroid castlevania and symphony of the night days i ve still played most of them today we have hollow knight blasphemous salt and sanctuary bloodstained the vagrant vigil and those are just the ones i ve played and there are so many more i haven t played yet as a big fan of this genre you couldn t be happier most of them are of the highest quality and offer hours of playtime and fun dead cells manages to pay tribute to all the original games and the new ones at the same time so let s talk dead cells dead cells is a side scrolling metroidvania game mixed with rogue like elements like permadeath and randomly generated maps and one of the most difficult and demanding of the entire genres at first i didn t even think i could beat the game on normal but after a few hours you get the deal getting stronger and stronger and learning how do make great builds and when you finally beat the game on the hardest difficulty and come back it feels like a joke and you really wonder why you were having such a hard time back then so the learning curve is there and you must master it and when you do you ll have some of the most satisfying moments in video game history so if you ve played hades which is somewhat similar on the rogue lite side of the game you might know what you re getting into but it s definitely harder while also offering more variety there are so many builds to choose from it s crazy well some are more op than others and some abilities and weapons are extremely underpowered but there s certainly something for every playstyle you can also vary your route and don t have to play the same level over and over again the overall story could be a bit deeper as the focus is definitely on combat pros side scrolling metroidvanian gameplay at it s finest with some rogue like elements fast paced combat using ranged melee magic traps shields parries dodges blocks really whatever you prefer pixel graphics with amazing hand drawn backgrounds randomly generated maps in a variety of biomes you are not tied to one path because you can choose from many different routes lots of movement skills secrets and lore rooms to discover multiple endings and some great dlcs most of which are free updates can t praise the developers enough for that these days great enemy variants and boss fights one of the best bgm i ve ever heard especially in later stages so many references and crossover elements it s insane from castlevania hyper light drifter bloodstained hollow knight blasphemous guacamelee vigil skul dark souls and many many more neutral story and lore could be a bit deeper it s still interesting but don t expect anything like dark souls or bloodborne difficulty i can understand why people complain because the difficulty only ramps up at one point and the permadeath doesn t make it much better you definitely need to be very patient but the satisfaction of beating the game is priceless the balancing could be a bit better but i can understand how difficult it is with so many weapons abilities powers and so oncons anyone who strives for all the achievements like me must be a bit of a masochist spikes and traps ok it s not as bad as blasphemous for example but there were still moments where i dived straight into some spikes yikes conclusio so if you re a fan of the genre and like a good challenge don t think twice and give them your money definitely one of the best games out there dead cells is an ode to all those wonderful side scrolling metroidvania games and rogue lites alike highly recommended at full price personal score 9 5 10
