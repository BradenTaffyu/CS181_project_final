2021 i was recommended the game by my an old partner of mine and didn t think i d like it at first because i personally struggle to understand things if they first seem too complicated i tried nevertheless and bought the game created my own empire and was pleasantly surprised with how quickly i grew to love it it didn t actually take me too long to learn the mechanics and i only had a few questions which were swiftly answered by the community online or my old partner now after a good 38 8 hours on record and more to come i m about to look into dlcs and modding to further spice up the game for myself even though it s so diverse and different with every playthrough by itself my past partner and even a few coworkers of mine have connected over this game some of them having played it for several years only going to show that the game itself is something you can enjoy for a long time another note is that i absolutely love how it s never the same every time you start a new game there are different empires events interactions star systems and more with every playthrough leaving me surprised and engaged each time i haven t grown bored of the game just yet and coming from someone who constantly bounces from one activity to the next i m pleasantly surprised to have been playing for this long i can t wait to end every workday only to come home and play stellaris again continuing a current game or starting a new one even after being around for so long the game is still actively receiving updates adding more content and fixes to the game there s an active community for it in many places including discord reddit facebook and whatever other social media you might use i guarantee you ll find others who enjoy the same thing i m glad to have joined in on the fun when i did and i look forward to many more years of it
