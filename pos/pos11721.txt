2015 early access review as of 12 31 2015 tl dr good more realistic minecraft style game dev s are active and the game is still under development and it gets broken periodically overall 6 5 10long version pros very well done apocolypse sim as of last update one of the better crafting systems i ve seen pretty easy to pick up and learn graphics are overall pretty good and improving as development goes on dev s are somewhat active in the community updates are somewhat regular motion captured zombies are neat minecraft esque building but with physics see other thoughts randomly generated maps pretty decent dedicated servers now really doesn t need that much pc horsepower to be playable weapon selection is broad enough for most to find a good weapon they prefer to usecons minecraft esque building but with physics see other thoughts melee combat is a bit broken climate system is currently buggy dev s have a nasty habit of half implementing features sorry tfp but you know you do frequent server wipes with some updates see other thoughts a lot of new features not a lot of new content see other thoughts other thoughts this game has potential to really be fantastic i ve logged over 500 hours playing it since i purchased it shortly after it hit greenlight i loved it then i still love it but i don t play it anywhere near as much these days the majority of the negativity i feel toward the game is not the game itself but to some of the way the game has been developed the minecraft esque building is really great except the physics of it can be a bit flaky there isn t a lot of warning when your house on stilts is going to start collapsing until your floor falls apart when you walk on it i would like to see that fixed somehow although i don t know what a good way to do that would be it s a good system and with the most recent updates pretty solid the maps are randomly generated and have been significantly improved since first introduced that said they re still broken too the caves are cool but they currently don t always generate properly or you will see a building which collapses the second you try to walk inside overall still highly playable what does cause issues though is digging mining the terrain does not always recalculate properly which leads to outcroppings that you can t walk past until you place and remove a block there then it recalculates and is fine the reason i don t play the game much is the developers the fun pimps overall they are great and doing a good job with the game as a whole when you take a closer look at the development however they ve done some things that i found and still find annoying a major example of this is half implementing features now a lot of you may read this and say things like it s a green light game what did you expect or you re being too critical back off and while to an extent both are true but also false this game is and has been fully playable for quite awhile now so to me it s in development in the same sense that minecraft is still in development meaning it s a working playable functional game that keeps getting new features and content what is a bit of a problem with that though is that in one update they will set up for features in the next a few very specific examples of this come to mind mini bikes which are sweet but you cut the player movement speed in half in an update that came out about 3 months before the mini bikes did constant screwing with the terrain generation cave generation etc but every time you fix it you have to wipe the server and quite honestly the routine is getting old especially when things are still broken with it skill trees which are interesting now you gain experience for doing stuff cool feature very similar to ark survival evolved in the sense of how xp is earned but it currently doesn t much beyond improve crafting quality and loot chance at high level important but apparently a class system is coming a prime example of what i am talking about wait do it all then push it out climate freezing over heating cool idea again works somewhat similar to ark but broken really broken how am i over heating when i m under water in a lake it s been acknowledged as broken the rocket launcher since fixed was removed because it didn t work right following a major update tungsten doors were deemed too strong and removed took a long time for their replacements to show up acknowledging is horribly broken and will be fixed i admit to an extent i am being hard on tfp here but i m also being honest between the we know it s broken and we ll fix it but hey look at this other new thing statements then after major update releases the game is typically broken to varying degrees which again i do understand happens and with a lot of regularity but i also feel like if the dev s backed off the throttle on the hype train a little and took a bit more time in testing and fixing their releases the player experience would be even better especially players who have owned the game for a long time the server wiping updates are a huge reason i don t play much anymore i ve dealt with the stretches where server wiping was a regular monthly or bi monthly cycle and right around the time you got back to where you were prior to the last wipe hey all new patch wipe your servers loose your stuff again sorry then rinse wash and repeat when in reality i am pretty sure they could iterate through the chunks and regenerate them with a secondary utility so that server wiping wasn t mandatory or minimally give admins a way to preserve player inventory skills as of now etc because for me right now i m done dealing with it a lot of the new features which have been added are cool once they re polished up the mini bike the skill system the new resource collection zombie stun ui revamp have all been overall positive additions or minimally look promising new content however has been nil for quite awhile yes they ve added better graphics which do look good they ve improved the weather system finally added some weapons etc but the end game is still basically same as it was a year ago it just takes longer than it did i understand gating a lot of the crafting and making things take longer gasoline and forges are prime examples but once you build a solid base with enough of a defense admittedly the defense requirements have gotten significantly higher a garden for food and a forge to make ammo that s it you ve done everything you need to now you can go mess with zombies or other players now again you may say it s a green light game or it s still in development and again i get it and to that i say fair enough except they aren t developing new content the overall end game hasn t changed much since alpha 10 except for the amount of time it takes to get to that point which to a lesser extent i agree with because there was a point where once you had a beaker an auger and corn you could have a fully established base in about 4 real world hours if you knew what you were doing all of that said and yes i know how harsh i was i still support the game and i do still overall recommend the game personally though i am done until it s done or minimally not broken
