2017 this is my favourite game on steam i keep coming back to it because it s just so endlessly playable and fun still haven t united the land of calradia even after hundreds of hours of playtime some of my favourite moments from the game a perfect headshot with my crosbow from a hundred yards out earned me a ton of experience charging at full gallop into the enemy ranks on my armoured horse and cutting my way through storming a castle that rush as you climb a ladder with arrows sinking into your shield knowing that when you get to the top the defenders are waiting with spears and axes the opposite defending my newly won castle against the endless khergit hordes just keep swinging that sword until there s no more capturing a king then ransoming him for a huge sum that visceral thrill as you cut down a fleeing foe from behind winning a jousting match and that s just the base game it gets scarily awesome when you start dabbling in the mods many of which can be downloaded very easily from the workshop on this very site these add hours and hours of free content everything from feudal japan and the napoleonic wars to game of thrones and star wars my favourite game cannot wait for the sequel
