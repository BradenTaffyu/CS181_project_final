2022 early access review if you see a shamway factory in a wasteland do not go in there my team of four went in to loot around thinking it was a good opportunity for food it was good opportunity for food to be fair if you happen to be a bearwe were all mauled and maimed by what had to be over ten bears for three days every time we came back to get our belongings it was only thirty seconds or so before we were once again murdered by these big grizzly hitmen it became total chaos and every man was for himself we would run in screaming our hearts out in a cry of war and scrambled to grab our bags quick enough to avoid their wrath so yeah it s a great game a wonderful game even
