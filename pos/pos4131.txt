2020 slay the spire is an absurdist masterpiece a modern myth of sisyphus an interactive retelling of the futility of the human condition and its absence of meaning you awaken at the bottom of the spire and struggle your way to the top regardless of your success or failure you fall asleep and awaken at the bottom once again as you succeed more success becomes more difficult and rarer but the only reward is more hardship there is ultimately no meaning to the climb other than what you give it as the only reward you receive is the opportunity to do it again which is also the punishment for failure even if you climb to the top of the spire at the maximum ascension and best it at its most difficult your only reward is the option to try to do it again even if you defeat the secret boss and escape the tower you awaken at its base again you struggle against the tower only because it is there and enjoy it only because you have decided it is fun the only knowledge you may gain through your triumphs and defeats is how to better struggle against a mysterious and unconquerable force there is no escape there is no true progress there is no ultimate goal or reason or knowable meaning the struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man s heart one must imagine sisyphus happy albert camuson a more serious note this game is fantastic and i give it a solid 10 10 if you enjoy roguelike games and strategy i d definitely recommend it
