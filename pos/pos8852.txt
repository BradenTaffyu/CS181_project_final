2018 i don t know i wish there was a maybe recommendation see when you first start playing this game you will be overwhelmed with all kinds of amazing variety of cultural and lifestyle choices for your species like government traditions to be a pacifist who focuses on expanding or a warmonger who wants to assert dominance on other species or devouring swarms fanatic purifiers who just want to destroy all life focus on science i even had a science species transcend their mortal flesh and literally all convert to a species of ai robots it was pretty cool i can t say this game sucks i can t say i don t recommend it i got 100 hours in it and i enjoyed those hours what i can say is don t believe that in the current state of the game it is a sandbox game the game starts off with you trying to develop and enjoy your species culture and traditions and roleplay them out a bit but every single time you hit mid game and then worse in late game it is only about war and military you will find no where to expand without having to conquor thy neighbor the victory conditions require war even the federation victory requires war if you need to force other species to adopt your government and traditional styles you can avoid war if you are a very diplomatic and loveable species to a greater degree but there s nothing to do but war in mid late game for the most part research is all done and you re just researching the infinitely progressing stuff like add 1 to core sector system or 10 hp to army health etc you can go megastructures but let s be realistic why by the time you re in a position where you can both get them and afford to build them the only one that actually benefits is the habitat and maybe a dyson sphere if you want to go over your naval capacity you can amass a ton of resources to support that to a degree it gets so expensive it becomes unsustainable though that s literally all you re doing mid late game habitats for more pops to harvest more resources to fund your war campaigns if you aren t at war you are doing nothing but watching resource numbers go up that have no purpose except to invest to gain more resources or to spend on war this is really what killed the game for me i went into it with the roleplay and culture and variety of traditions and potential playstyles and got hit with the reality that the game is only designed to devolve into war and there s literally nothing else to do diplomacy is incredibly shallow which doesn t help things the way the systems are designed it s just a strategic outpost meh if you do buy this game know that you will enjoy it for awhile until you get to the point where you really want to sandbox it and enjoy your species culture and stuff only to realize it s about war when it only is about war why design a species around anything else but war i hope the devs have a lot of plans to change this up it d be a shame really so much lost potential
