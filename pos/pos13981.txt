2021 in summary buy it for yourself for your friends and for your kids if you got them not only is this game hilariously fun but it represents the most significant progress in educational video games in 20 years that s a lot of praise but i ll spend the rest of the review backing it up i grew up with educational games like math blaster in this game you would solve math problems then you would blast some garbage by clicking on it as it floated across the screen no one really liked the math part but you had to do it if you wanted to blast we were still thrilled to play it in class because the general curriculum didn t have any blasting at all in a way these types of games worked against education because we internalized that math was just a barrier to blasting and fun in general no one played math blaster after school we wanted to play games like diablo pok mon and call of duty these games didn t have a math part it was all blasting all the time even better they came with a sense of progression that hit way faster than book learnin ever could when you did something wrong you were immediately punished with a respawn timer if you did something right your character would level up making you even more powerful with new abilities and weapons the progression felt amazing but unfortunately required about as much thinking as smashing your face against a wall until it would crack klei s other game don t starve has a different take on progression instead of overcoming obstacles by repetitively killing enemies until your character s power level tips 9000 you need think your way out of problems to survive there are no levels in don t starve your character s power is determined by how well you used the time leading up to a crisis to surround yourself with the tools needed to solve it if you want to be better at the game you must be smarter burning your time isn t enough still it s hard to call don t starve educational because knowing how many pig skins it takes to build the hogus porkusator isn t exactly useful knowledge enter oxygen not included which takes that same thoughtful preparation formula but introduces concepts from physics and engineering if you want your pathetic little people to live you had better think about the boiling point of water before you fill your entire base with hot steam not considering the volume and fill rate of your septic tank can quickly result in everyone bathing in sewage there is a whole buffet of tools to fix these constant problems and you are welcome to pick and choose them as you please you don t have to learn how to use a thermostat to regulate temperature in your farms but eventually your farms are going to get hot and shortly after you ll find your people are all very hungry you don t have to use an and gate to manage the airlock for your chlorine gas tank but eventually one of those doors is going to be open at the wrong time and nobody will like the smell of it these engineering concepts go deep imagine the surprise and confusion on a college professor s face upon finding their students had already been exposed to multiplexing through gaming to tie this all together educational games hadn t really been fun enough to compete for everyone s attention this game is fun the goofy cheeky and sometimes a little dark sense of humor on crisis management keeps me coming back thinking is difficult and in that sense so is this game however if things are going too catastrophically the option to pause is always available so pick this one up and get ready to giggle into your colony s apocalypse
