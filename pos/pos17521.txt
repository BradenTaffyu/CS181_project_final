2023 you need this to play the mortal empires and immortal empires maps in warhammer 2 and warhammer 3 respectively some things i ve noticed instantly as compared to my hundreds of hours of warhammer 2 and the couple of hours i have on warhammer 3 1 map size being smaller benefits the game significantly admittedly it does feel quite a bit more lonely and the existence of diplomacy is barely functional but there is nevertheless a sense of safety that you can get in this game that you will never experience in the other warhammers at least until way further down the line 2 battleground size being bigger is a huge improvement and i wish that this was still the case for the current warhammer games the larger map makes reinforcements have to crawl across the huge landscape which is annoying but it also gives way more opportunity to push landscape advantage and to control your units in a more strategic fashion this also means you actually have to utilize the run walk mechanic which is a nice change of pace 3 cavalry works perhaps a little too well admittedly as they seem to significantly outclass most ground units that being said there s actually a reason to have charge defense in your army as charges are actually an important part of the game now 4 missiles are way weaker and it s not really that bad admittedly missiles feel way more inaccurate and there s a considerable lack of satisfaction when unloading entire rounds of ammunition into on coming enemy forces but it s also not really that bad less missile units means more strategy in my opinion 5 heroes are way overpowered but maybe that s a good thing i definitely notice the overwhelming strength of heroes in this game moreso than wh2 and wh3 though that may be by virtue of the missiles being far weaker and relying on your infantry is just throwing wave after wave of them into an unstoppable force so the only way to counter heroes is with heroes they re also a lot rarer 6 some aspects of the u i are arguably better and i like the option to choose multiple of different heroes in the same starting location the other games have this too but to an extremely limited extent i don t really care that much about it though it just feels like each faction is more self contained 7 magical items are more rare quest battles are more casual why did this go away magical items should be rare by virtue of providing a stat boost to the strongest unit types in the game and casual quest battles teach the player how to play the game or provide a unique gameplay scenario they can t be that hard to set up 8 no environment just limited conquest this is an interesting design choice and i m not entirely sure how i feel about it on one hand it makes playing each faction especially different because they are bound to certain cities that they can colonize on the other hand you cannot guarantee the stop of a resurgence of your enemy due to the fact that razed ruins can still be colonized by them and only them i might add more later as i go further into the game but it s surprising how different this feels as compared to warhammer 2
