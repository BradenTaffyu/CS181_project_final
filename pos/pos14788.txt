2018 just a positive feedback for this game that doesn t deserve all the hate for being different from civ v or for having the redshell spyware civilization vi is a game that s so over the average quality of the games on steam and doesn t deserve all the negative feedbacks for so many stupid reasons i hope this doesn t discourage firaxis games to develop another wonderful title like civilization vi
