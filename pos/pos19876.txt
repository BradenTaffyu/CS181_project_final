an excellent remaster of an absolute classic definitive edition introduces several quality of life features that make the game more accessible to newcomers while preserving the overall feel of the original the new graphics are nice some of the old campaigns received a much needed overhaul and the devs put out new content every couple of months my one gripe is that the dlcs are steadily becoming more expensive for the same amount of content
