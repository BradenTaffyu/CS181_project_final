2019 dark souls iii is more than just a game its a test of your mental endurance its a frustrating and enraging experience that will leave you feeling confused why the developers are trying to kill you around every corner and making the game feel insanely impossible but as you continue to play you will learn the beauty of retrying never giving up and continuing to learn from your mistakes is the name of the game for every fromsoftware title i ve never had a rush of joy and personal satisfaction like this in any other video game to date feeling that adrenaline pump as you narrowly dodge an enemies attack with little to no heath remaining and getting the final slash on them is unmatched i cannot begin to describe the satisfaction you feel as you play this game the weapons feel meaty and real the enemies are more often than not better than the actually players that will invade your world the character progression as you go through the different areas levels feels organic exploring in this game is a fun and heart pumping adventure never knowing where the next bonfire may be carrying thousands of souls you ve just spent 30 minutes farming and battling to obtain turning the corner to see the firecoiled sword sticking from a pile of ash is a sight for sore eyes every single time relief washing over your entire body as a smile cracks on your face you made it when i beat the game i dropped my controller and the only reaction i could have possibly had was to applaud the developers for this epic adventure i d just gone through it was done but i was craving more the new game feature isn t a new feature in gaming but it was essential for this game i ve started my second play through and good lord it s just as fun the community in a game full of challenging fights and angry deaths is actually extremely friendly i ve had dark spirits invade my world and end up helping me defeat some of the mob npc s just because i waved and did the praise the sun emote at the same time as him the community is also full of players that will gladly be summoned to help you in boss fights because they remember how hard it was for them the emote system brings a whole other level of non verbal communication most of the time before you initiate a pvp battle you ll get a low bow from your opponent to symbolize they re ready to fight sometimes you ll even have players that are respectful enough to not gank you while being attacked by another person or npc which is stunning to me considering how much easier of a fight it ends up being for them i appreciate how friendly charming and welcoming this community is pro s above average game length 80 hours to finish friendly community excellent dlc content lots of replayability runs very smoothly fast load times teaches patients timing insane weapon and armor varietycon s some areas feel a little buggy pvp combat with a laggy person can be confusing as hits from 20 seconds ago register late this is extremely rare however in my 85 hours of play i ve only seen it happen once can cause yelling at your monitor d flat out impossible to play without a controller10 10 game i cannot recommend this game enough if you have the patience to repeat battles and learn enemies move sets you ll have an amazing time my one tip prepare to die
