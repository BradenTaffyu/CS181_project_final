2023 at first glance you re going to be asking me tyknighter why did you make an in depth review on bloons tower defense 6 btd6 and to that i ll say to you i don t even know why chief i just decided to do this when i was younger i did play a lot of btd5 on my elementary school computer when i was able to go to it i had a ton of fun playing the game and years later i found out that the series had a 6th game and that it was on steam so i bought it and it quickly became one of the most played games in my library pros and consprosfun and addictive gameplay that you can play for hours on endmultiple upgrade paths for all of your monkies towers15 different heros for you to unlock and utilizemultiple game modes for you to playvery nice 3d based art styleconsmay get stale at times as there is nothing fresh being added to the table in terms of gameplaygameplaythe gameplay for btd6 is very simple you place monkies along the tracks of the map you are playing on and from there they will attack any bloons that come across that path each game will have a set number of rounds depending on the difficulty chosen and each round will have a set of pre defined bloons to take out you will come across different types of bloons for your towers to take out and certain ones can help take out special bloons gameplay is very fun and addicting a screenshot of bloons td 6 by skyknighter there will be camo bloons that can only be hit if the tower has camo detection regrow bloons which will regenerate after not getting hit for a while lead bloons who can only be destroyed by magic or explosions black ones who are in contrary immune to explosions white ones that are immune to ice and finally fortified bloons that are just normal bloons but with some armor purple ones are immune to energy plasma and fire attacks and there will also be times when a combination of two or three special types will spawn so you have to take extra caution when trying to deal with them there are also moab bfb zomg ddt and bad which are blimps that can soak up a lot of damage and instantly end your run if not taken care of when a monkey or tower takes out a balloon or the round ends you get money you can use this money to get upgrades to that monkey or tower this will make them do more damage or have a secondary effect like when dealing with camo or another type of balloon to get that upgrade the tower in question will need experience points and they can level up to get that upgrade you want there is a new feature to this game compared to the predecessor that being the level 5 upgrade although only one monkey on screen can get that specific level 5 upgrade at a time each tower has three upgrade paths to choose from however can only ever invest in two of them at a time while also allowing only one of these chosen paths to progress beyond level 2 the other options become unavailable making for a huge variety of possible combinations within the same tower s abilities there is one other new upgrade you can get and that is the paragon these can only be acquired by you having a level five upgrade on all three paths from a tower from there it will absorb all three and any other towers from that specific type on the map and get more power when doing so the more expensive all absorbed towers are or the more extra money you spend on the upgrade the higher the paragon level of your tower will be amplifying it s already immense power even more this will be the final upgrade you can get for your towers and not every type has a paragon upgrade yet you can have up to four different paragons on the map at a time but only one of the same type however you can rebuy the towers absorbed and get their level five upgrades again if you so wish also new to this game are heroes these are special monkies that you can summon that will level up on their own and provide benefits to you most of them pop bloons but some of them can do other stuff too my favorite hero is benjamin who can get you tons of money to help you out in buying upgrades and towers he can also give you some extra lives in one of his upgrades too there are a variety of heroes for you to choose from a screenshot of bloons td 6 by skyknighter there are a few other game modes you can play to spice up the gameplay these do however have the same premise as normal modes they can have unique gimmicks though like giving you no breaks in between rounds which also makes you lose out on bonus money or having a boss battle with a giant blimp or if you want to have some sort of challenge you can play the game with half money one thing i should add is that you can use your creativity to play the levels this screenshot you see is how i play you can play this game in any way you feel like and if you want to dive into the game some pros will use these builds with just a few towers the builds and setups have endless possibilities that you can do and i love it for that bloons td 6 a screenshot of bloons td 6 by skyknighter however there is one thing that i do have to point out with btd6 s gameplay that would hinder the experience of the game it would be that the gameplay can get stale nothing really changes when you are playing it is always the same rounds of bloons on every map so outside of your creativity in new builds and weekly rotating events with slight variety it will get repetitive there is a high replayability factor though with community created challenges occasional new content updates and your freedom for creativity so don t be surprised if you find yourself coming back to the game after awhile just like i did graphics and performancethe art style of the game has changed from the previous ones it now has a 3d art style that looks very nice i tested the game on an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 3gb amd ryzen 5 1500x quad core processor 3 50 and 16 gb of ram i experienced no issues while i was playing the game and it should be able to run on low end pcs it will get laggy with speedup and a million effects on higher rounds though final verdictif you are looking for a nice casual game to play then btd6 is a fantastic option for you it can and will get addictive i do recommend the game on a sale though if you do it s usually on sale for around 2 dollars and that s a fantastic price for a game like that looking for more reviews like this one then follow life needs a little sin
