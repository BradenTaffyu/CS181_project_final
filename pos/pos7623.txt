it is a decent management game set in the two point universe where in the base game dlc adds more you manage 12 different universities and have 17 different silly courses to pick between a lot of the levels also come with a bit of a twist there have been a few issues i ran into while playing the item placement can be extremely buggy and in some occasions quite frustrating probably the worst thing about the game by far it could use an extra very fast time option you have the options between slow normal and fast but the fast one doesn t feel fast enough a lot of the time the ui could use a little bit of love some menus settings are not placed in the most logical places and are quite inefficient the worst one is the training staff menu which is so frustratingly bad and annoying to deal with that it makes you not want to train staff at all when you have 60 staff the last thing you wanna do is spend multiple clicks on setting training for each each staff and each level of training every time it is still definitely fun and i enjoyed my time with it but two point hospital is for sure the better game even if older linux version of the game works without any issues
