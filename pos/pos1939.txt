2023 swtor is probably in the top 3 of the best story based mmos and holds a special spot in my heart as many other veterans and star wars fans who have been playing this game for the last years it always feels amazing to just go back create a character and begin your journey the game is not at all pay to win as the cash shop is mostly for convenience and you can experience the all the amazing class stories without spending a and that s hundreds of hours of fun and the community is helpful all class stories and most of the vanilla content has been voice acted written by bioware s best it is no secret that swtor is now run by a skeleton crew and is in maintenance mode for the most part don t expect triple a expansions as the new content is mediocre at best customer support pvp and end game pve content require a sub in the end you can enjoy all class stories which are the best part about this mmo without having to worry about sub or spending real money what are you waiting for and may the force be with you always
