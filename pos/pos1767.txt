2018 are we trapped in a cycle of eternal return or is it an ascending spiral in a process of development does history have a teleological sense those who don t know history are doomed to repeat it first as tragedy then as farce if there were a god would we have to kill him if god did not exist would we have to invent him if it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god what would you wager should you believe in god weighing the gain and loss living in fear of his punishment is the individual a product of the social relations within a collective what are our relations of production in a classless and stateless society would i remain the same if i were replaced entirely piece by piece would i remain the same if my memories were replaced entirely why would a nuclear family be required in a post capitalist society what is the meaning of life what is the purpose of existence is it imposed or voluntary how much does our labor in the means of production alienate us drifting into reification do we have self consciousness is it developed through a lordship and bondage dialectic is our raison d tre what defines us what is a human being what makes us different could an artificial intelligence develop a natural or human intelligence if a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being then is it as intelligent as a human being can a machine have soul is learning the development of ideas buried deep in the soul if there is a mind body dualism could the human soul be transposed by metempsychosis can the universe be explained by mechanical principles or by autodynamic principles caused by the unity of opposites why do we fight for is it worth is there such thing as an absolute timeless enemy could emotions be learned and imitated do you feel it like i feel it when does social learning become cultural learning are our memories what defines us does human life have value do we have free will is our psyche structured into id ego and super ego do we conceal our true self behind a character mask is fear what pacifism teaches is life s meaning and worth a matter of a leap of faith could there be a belief in god if there was no death is death another plane of existence does existence matter precede essence thought are we what we do of ourselves and our own essence are we condemned to be free is gender a social construct why do we enjoy violence am i myself and my circumstances are we driven by our instinct of eros and thanatos what is love do we need a social contract and state to articulate our society where is the origin of the state in family and private property why do we value some lives more than others does the consciousness of life s meaninglessness lead us to despair are we social beings that need to live in community what is duty does the good will of an action have moral worth despite the outcome are we formed through identification of external elements in order to form a sense of self what is our state of human nature is it goodness and pacifism or is it evil and bellum omnium contra omnes does seeking common benefit unite us despite our morality is the dialectic conflict between thesis and antithesis the driving force of history does development arise from the struggle of opposites are the changes of nature a mere perpetually self repeating cycle and therefore only from changes in the spirit does anything new arise does death give a meaning to life why do we need company does it mean something when you are with someone are we slaves of desire should we reject that life has a meaning and goal what things do we do
