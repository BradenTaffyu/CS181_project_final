2018 early access review at one point the settlement had as many as twelve colonists but bad luck dwindled the number down to three only one of which was among the original survivors i considered her to be our leader it s winter one of my dwellers is hospitalized from a previous raid and has a deadly infection i had our leader tending to him and administering treatment while our hunter was outside trying to replenish our dwindling food supply a warg proved more than our huntress could handle she began trying to run home but was too slow and was struck down our leader was already running out to save her getting shredded with deadly claws but managing to barely kill the warg she dragged the hunter back to the shelter and laid her down in the bed she bandaged her through foggy vision and gushing wounds then lay down in the bed next to hers the pain became too great and she fell unconscious our other settler s infection had gotten worse but he had just enough energy to walk and care for his leader s wounds she needed to eat or she d starve and on the way to fetch her some food his infection proved too great he died in the front doorway food in hand the leader awoke completely paralyzed she looked to her right and saw the hunter had died in her sleep the leader lay there starving and unable to move she remembered every face she d known through the hard years of survival she remembered her first friends beloved pets and her lost husband she remembered the grueling hardships they d endured together she wanted to weep but hadn t the will and then she slept never to awaken this game breaks my heart and i love it these little characters will make you fall in love with them and their interactions and they form their own stories as you play then they die
