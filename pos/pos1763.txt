2021 oh my this game is a gem not only because of 2b great ass but also because of its philosophical history gameplay music art you name it you control 2b a very heavy sexy android in a post apocalyptic world full of robots and androids the history is not very complex it s the topics that implies things like purpose meaning of life and all of that stuff the game is very entertaining and its variety is really something you get to play different situations and perspectives not only feeling empaty with our protagonists but with the enemy as well i had a wave of feelings playing this fun joy frustation betrayal sadness hapinnes and a lot more i highly recommend you play this
