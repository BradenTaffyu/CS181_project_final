2015 i wanted to write a review because after looking at the forums you d get many impressions and all of them bad bad graphics bad game play terrible optimization and horrendous base building and everything else under the sun with seemingly 100 s of posts all claiming this game is trash these are all wrong quite honestly none of them have any basis of value in their posts i ll admit the release is buggy but what game isn t it s also not working for some but again when has a game ever worked perfectly or completely for every single console platform and graphics card in existance on release none so the majority of these complaints are immediately wiped under the floor as well game isn t trash just because its not released bug free fallout 4 has far more custimzation and choices than fallout 3 i m finding it far far easier to rp my character how i want her to be the new perks system is wonderful more than fallout 3 and with deeper customization you can certainly put 1 point of perks into the basic of each perk and be a wild card able to do a little of everything but you won t really master anything either the more points you put into a perk the better it gets and on the final level of that perk you generally get a very nice bonus to it either way it allows for much deeper crafting of your character an example would be the stealth perk as you continue to put points into it it goes up 20 harder 30 harder etc but say you also favor long range weapons and you only wish to put 2 perks out of 5 into stealth because of your longer range youd on t need 40 50 and you can put those other perk points somewhere else this allows for deeper customization rather than just 1 perk point in stealth for a flat bonus all around the graphics as well are pretty damn good even on all low settings many are whining about them but i see absolutely no problems most of the screenshots you re looking at are probably in low settings yet they look awesome i ve yet to see an ugly texture or flat surface gameplay wise the area s as far as i can tell don t scale with you unlike oblivion fallout 3 and skyrim you will come across area s that you really have business being in yet and the enemies will be very dangerous this to me makes the game far more adventerous and feel dangerous and alive sometimes you gotta retreat and come back later better prepared and armed for what you re going to confront over all this game is awesome and delivers on everything it promised it has a great story that pulls you in a more believable environment and one which is more interesting than fallout 3 in my opinion the ability to build your own towns and manage them which is a very fun meta game in and of itself something which took me 8 hours of playing with and still tons to go the writing for the characters is not bad either with nice mix of personalities and backgrounds so long as you aren t expecting a game that s 10 years ahead of its time like it seems so many were and it s a type of game you enjoy or like fallout games this is one that is most likely well worth your money on release note it seems people aren t understanding me i m not saying its bad to have high standards i do i m not saying its bad to dislike this game there are parts i don t like either i m not saying its wrong to say this game just isn t for you even if it is for me my review here and my rant post here explains this but also why i did write that rant post and this review the way i did people are going off the deep end with expectations and presumptions of what this game was supposed to be without realizing this game is exactly as it was meant to be and just because it didn t hit what the hyped up version they expected in their minds doesn t make it a bad game i also explain why expecting no bugs in today s world is both idiotic and shows a very low understanding of the world you live in depending on the engine of the game and such some games may have a better chance of having few to little bugs on release but bethesda isn t using uneral 4 or cry engine which have their own dev teams working around the clock to make it as streamlined as possible for every major graphics card bethesda is using their own game engine one which allows for extreme non hard locked code so anything can be altered and changed by the players allowing for extreme modding capability this unfortunately does have the side effect of making the code less balanced i won t get into why or how or the specifics but it does because the devs aren t hard coding it so we can go in and mess with it to our hearts content without screwing up anything else in the game except for what we wanted to screw with
