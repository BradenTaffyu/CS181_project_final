2022 early access review a true finnish masterpiece my summer car is without a doubt a must have for any car enthusiast provided they have the right pc i currently play on a rtx 3060ti with an i7 and 16gb of ram on golden eye settings i normally achieve 130 200 frames per second with a gtx 1650 on my old computer i barely managed 60 frames per second but i might just have a power supply issue in my summer car you build your own satsuma which is based on a datsun 100a from the 1970s in spite of the fact that i would recommend this game to anyone with a powerful computer i do not believe there is a single game that deserves a score of ten this is a list of things i believe are bad or need to be addedin spite of the fact that the game is extremely violent it would be so much better if it had multiplayer capabilities yes i am aware that there is a mod available for it but not everyone is knowledgeable about how to install one a no clipping glitch occurs when you are crouching and the items you are carrying gain the ability to no clip the items are then lost forever if you do not use msc editor while playing on my second playthrough i was getting the tiers for the satsuma when i accidentally crouched this caused the tiers to disappear into the ground never to be seen again
