2021 at first i was going to write an extensive review about this game but then i realized no matter how much i wrote my words would never do this game justice it would just reduce the beauty and uniqueness of this story nier automata is such a unique and beautiful experience with a compelling and emotional storyline remarkable characters and unique gameplay elements i realize the first playthrough can be weird since the game doesn t reveal all the plot points to you at first when you see the credits for the first and you think it s over this is actually where the game truly begins however this game does have a troubled pc port but nothing that a couple of mods can t fix this game is a masterful sequence in storytelling and it will be forever one of my favorite games
