2019 early access review i have over 300 hours played at the time of writing this and have very mixed feelings about 7 days to die my friends and i have spent lots of time in both this and ark because we enjoy the base building survival explore type of games and they bring us together we ve played 7 days for a long time since it near first came out and the game has progressed immensely since those days the items the vehicles the zombies the buildings and structures it s loads better from where it began which is expected then there s that but 7 days is still fun we still hop on from time to time join a random server and play for a couple weeks it s nowhere near what it used to be of gathering every night 4 5 of us looting building surviving in our mountain base it s because even through the patches and updates it gets boring repetitive it s definitely a fun game with friends and even for a couple hundred hours there s enough to enjoy that is with player mods and modded servers but the game still has weird bugs glitches and recently changed the skill system zombie spawn system and it s less enjoyable and natural feeling than it used to be i d recommend the game i would probably pay 15 20 for this game and feel like i got my money s worth if i spent 100 hours in it with friends but i m very multiplayer driven and being able to strategize with friends is key to me the devs don t always work quick on the game unfortunately and with it being out so long it s surprisingly still in alpha if you can look past the weird bugs or glitches animations you ll enjoy this if you enjoy builders minecraft ark etc then you ll enjoy this if you like survival games that pit you against the elements ai or people chances are you will enjoy this the only question is for how long
