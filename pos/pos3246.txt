2017 divinity original sin 2 is the making of legends in modern games a fully voiced acted superbly written 40 50 hour journey tailored for both single player or four player local online cooperation with as much reasons for replayability to shape the narrative and to bite further into its sense of challenge as the amount of genuine affection and rpg craftmanship made into this one game when you feature dynamic instrument options for battle music in a character creator and even after a hundred hours you still have more to learn and to explore in the world you know you have stumbled across a game unlike no other this is also ignoring the extra features made for the community to expand the life of dos2 with a pen paper style mode game master and a dev kit of modding tools to create your own adventures that harkens back to the glory days of neverwinter nights there is simply too much care crafted into the soul of this game that it is simply impossible not to fall in love with it even if the gameplay can pull some cheap punches for challenge leftover from the previous title at its worst dos2 can be so mired by its hurdles that it makes the pursuit even more tempting to overcome unlike the original this diamond in the rough illuminates all traces of imperfection the more you become lost in its brilliance it s not what you say that counts it s what you dobefore i begin to address the issues the writing techniques of dos2 need to be given their praise unlike the original which made itself into a buddy comedy experience to a fault for its abundance of comedy and non cooperative dialogue dos2 keeps some of the buddy chatter for only multiplayer and the game focuses more on second person dialogue to create the amount of choices and role playing opportunities instead of creating lines for every character in every scenario the dialogue creates the illusion of what you want to say and how you say it by smartly giving you options written as commands if you are not sure what i mean then think of the situation this way the writers can write as much options as they need to convey all available options without having to take into consideration of the character s tone instead of writing out a angered elated depressed etc response the narrator only has to give you options like a choose your own adventure book ex assume you know what he is blabbering on about this method adds far more role playing options without breaking immersion of your character and it adds far more vivid choices that can affect the moment even if you prefer a character with all voice acted lines dos2 also offers origin characters which are the companions of the game that you can play with their own backstories and voice actors you still can make choices but the character is more grounded than custom ones and unlike the original the companions or players you tag along with have a greater sense of companionship because of this dialogue system and the story being focused on deciding whether to stick together or to divide amongst yourselves this is a beautiful system that caters to all preferences in rpgs that does not weaken the storytelling nor the role playing of the game and it s a system i hope more rpgs include this method to save money on voice acting every single line call me unreliable well i m none too clever i just adore younow let s discuss the biggest issue with dos2 that stems from the original the seemingly unpredictable difficulty until you learn the game from the inside out after nearing 200 hours starting from explorer and reaching the modded infernal difficulty my experience has become a well rounded experience and this statement is still true this is why i think it s important to revisit this section to delve into the discussion once more compared to the first game dos2 has a more creative approach to difficulty than rigid standards of what it defines as challenge it is by no means an easier game than the first as fort joy is the first major obstacle to overcome due to resource scarcity and the importance of synergy with your builds however there are modifiers to enhance the challenge to suit the player these things include making undead characters who can only heal by poison which isn t as much of a problem as it sounds as you can make interesting undead teams straying from traditional party set ups like having no main healer or by adding more less characters to the experience the ironic twist is that a two man lone wolf party is more capable than a seven man team on the same difficulty all of these modifiers are creative means for players to create a game as difficult as they want and still retain its sense of balance this balance is largely the result of all the new changes to combat for starters the armor system is completely reworked into physical and magic armor which helps divide enemies by targeting their weaker armor this also prevents stun lock skills like battering ram to be abused without removing all the physical armor as a result it s more important to make every party member have decent equipment and weapons which in a strange way makes adding more companions more difficult with less good armor to go around as enemies often will use area of effect attacks to weaken your party second the environment has more usefulness in combat one simple change is the addition of elevation scaling that can add lower damage based on who has the higher ground archers gain stupidly insane damage scaling as a result of this feature which makes them the most worthwhile member on the team elemental effects remain as potent but the magic armor helps negate their damage spiraling out of control ui problems like line of sight are no longer an issue as hitboxes have proper sizes as i never made one mistake in my decisions however certain elements like curse are often annoying because if you cast bless on a pit of fire to remove them it should heal your party but it will damage them instead you have to cast it again a limited resource to make it heal them as a result of these features the inventiveness and fluidity of combat never becomes stale which only rewards players more incentive to play around with its systems and its immersive storytelling features that the infinity engine games always aspired to be whenever i think i have discovered everything even 150 hours into the game i manage to discover something new this beauty itself is forever stuck in my mind after deciding to restart the game again because i wondered if two undead can romance if a game can tantalize you back with a simple what if then this game is truly something special an ocean of content with 20 000 leagues under the seaaside from those issues the game is phenomenal any way you look at it as an rpg the role playing itself sets new boundaries and standards for all rpgs single player or cooperative the sense of freedom and cooperation is leagues better than it was previously even the story itself handles its comedic elements far better with its grit that the darker moments are never too far away from a chuckle to lighten the mood lastly modders will be able to take all the lessons learned from its community and larian studios themselves to create a thriving landscape of future potential for this game and the future of divinity whether or not you are familiar with the divinity series dos2 is great on its own merits however a lot of meaning will be lost if you do not know the series history as it takes place 1 000 years after the original four years after beyond divinity this is not a criticism but something praiseworthy that describes dos2 as a whole it s a game with 20 000 leagues of depth beneath the sea and an ocean of content that spans across the horizon this is a journey that will make you crave more adventure
