2021 this review is the worst thing i have written but simply too goated to delete enjoy this is it my favorite game i cant write all my feelings for this game here because i lack the attention span to do so but i will try my best to sum it up this game has one of the best stories in any game i have ever played despite looking the way it does which might be off putting for some still gets you invested in the world and characters speaking of the characters they are amazing the companions all are filled with so much personality and most even have character arcs that you are able to help them go through by following their questlines the music is something so special aswell i do not listen to country or cowboy type music however something about how great the rest of the game is allows me to fall in love with these songs even when the radio is off the soundtrack of the game still manages to send chills through my body especially the ending slides track which gives a sensation of reaching a goal you had been striving for but was what i did really the right choice the morality of the game is another really interesting thing as there is no right choice unlike fallout 4 which i am so grateful to for making me go back and play new vegas where all outcomes are pretty good choices you have fallout nv which gives all of their factions flaws making it feel not only more realistic but also making the world that much more complex the dlcs though are what i think truly make this game i played the game all the way through without dlcs first then bought them and replayed the game as a basically the same character oh my god are they so amazing the base game has characters talk about these important influential characters that are never seen and only learned about through dialogue i cant say how cool of an experience it was to see the burned man or father elijah in person each of the dlcs are absolute slappers best order to play them btw first with honest hearts takes place in zion with amazing characters and a great setting dead money the best one that has left a huge impact on me it has an amazing atmosphere and gives me a feeling i dont know what to call its sad but in a way i like anyways the soundtrack in this one is top notch and please play it it may not be that good while playing it gameplay wise but the feelings you are left with after just make you want to return and soak the amazing story and everything in it all over again old world blues is really good i love traveling around its location and like that it covers some harsh things through a fun lighthearted goofy story lonesome road tbh i did this one really dirty i played like half of it while in a voice call dont do that with nv it completely ruins the experience and because of that was not able to get fully immersed with the story i really do want to go back as what i did play i thought was really cool however still prob the weakest still great tho also my opinion for that one does not count this was a horrible ramble and i cant type out how i feel very well so sorry about that but just trust me this game is worth experiencing i wanted to make this mess of a review in hopes of convincing one person that hasnt given it a fair chance i was in your situation once i came to nv right after beating fo4 and played halfway through the story thought it was bad dropped it came back to it and fell in love have a goodnight and i am here reminding you that you re nobody til somebody loves you and that somebody is me i love you10 10
