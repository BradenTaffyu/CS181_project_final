2015 buy this game buy this game buy this game i just finished my first playthrough in a single sitting took me roughly 8 hours with some moderate exploration on the side as a testament to just how awesome and unique this game is i can count on one hand how many games are able to keep my interest for more than a couple hours before i need to take a break and i played this game for eight hours straight did you buy this game yet don t let the simplistic graphics fool you into thinking this is some lousy indie game everything in this game oozes with charm from the lovable and memorable characters to the rockin soundtrack i don t want to spoil anything but heed my advice you owe it to yourself to pick this game up if you re willing to get past the simple appearance you will not be disappointed buy it be the hipster among your friends who knew about this game before it was cool
