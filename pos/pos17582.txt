2017 88 hours in and i can safely state that this is the total war fantasy crossover we ve all been waiting for hell i d hoped for lotr but this is actually better and i m no fan of games workshop i associate it with strange kids who paint models if that describes you i m sorry pros diverse and varied factions each faction has its own mechanics which contributes to a steeper learning curve but also many more hours of rewarding fun awesome battles arguably the best seen so far in the tw series the campaign is long but tense throughout and fun as hell you face constant threats and challenges there are sometimes moments of relief but they are soon overtaken by moments of major tension this campaign really keeps the pressure on stunning visuals i don t have the blood dlc yet but the combat is spectacular without it you ll find yourself losing concentration in battle because you end up focusing on the minutae whether it s watching your lord ripping enemy troops to pieces or keeping an eye on that giant destroying your army it s hard not to watch in awe immersion i ve never played any warhammer games before but this creates a very typical and competent western fantasy setting think warcraft for a total war game i couldn t help but really get in character as the vampire undead faction they were a blast to play new unit types such as large monstrous infantry monsters beasts and flying as well as heroes all agents are now usable in battle and act as warcraft esque hero units with special abilities spells etc this adds to a massively increased strategic depth that goes way beyond anything total war has done before which experienced tw players should appreciate cons very steep learning curve i say this as a huge fan of tw especially shogun 2 with over 800 hours played this is both a reward and a curse it makes the game tougher but gives it more longetivity auto resolve odds are ridiculous in this game even on easy mode it ll tell you it s basically impossible to win a battle when it s actually really easy with some basic strategy often as a result of the hero and large units mentioned before i try to avoid using auto as much as possible due to this potential for imbalance with the sheer variance in factions and unit types there are some imbalances but nothing too serious half of the campaign factions and 2 3 of the campaign types are dlc granted i don t own any of them and have spent plenty of time playing the base game and i ve only really learned how to effectively play as 1 of 4 base game factions in that time this isn t a major complaint in fact it s far more optional than it sounds i will probably buy the dlc in future after i ve played a few hundred hours in the end we have a fantastic total war game that is totally unique and innovative in the series i find it hard to complain about it and i look forward to playing tw wh2
