2016 this game combines all that one loved of the total war franchise adds in all the best bits of the warhammer franchise and combines them perfectly miss the old days of total war medieval but always wanted fantasy and magic added in then this is your game love the warhammer lore and all that but hate the price or model gaming then this is your game of course in current total war greedyness outside of the core game there is and will be to come a lot of dlc you should know this by now going into a total war game this does not ruin or end the game for me personally as the core one has more than enough for the price in my opinion it also lets me pick and choose what factions i may want in the future what stories etc bring on the skaven
