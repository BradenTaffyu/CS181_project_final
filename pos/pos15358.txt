2021 by far the best survival game i ve ever played and one of my favorite games over all the animation music and art style are beautiful and amazing and gives the game it s own very distinctive personality and feel the world is surprisingly deep you have a pretty wide selection of interesting characters with their own perks and flaws and there are an endless amount of things to do and discover biomes to explore seasons to adapt to resources to gather things to craft creatures to hunt monsters to fight bosses to kill and of course a preeeeetty high and unforgiving difficulty if you like a challenge all of that applies to both the base game and dst but overall the biggest perk of don t starve together over the base game is that the developers add most of the base game s dlcs as free updates on top of having a lot of content exclusive to dst that you won t find in the original game the only thing i could complain about is that the combat can be a little bit janky and lacking at times and maybe needs a little rework but it s overall still pretty solid nonetheless conclusion one of the best games ever created in my opinion and i definitely recommend it to everyone
