2017 early access review message to potential buyers ignore the haters this one is good people are entitled to their opinion but you ll notice that the naysayers have all the same complaint the game has been in ea forever and they re right it s had a long development cycle but they fail to mention two critical points 1 the game is still being consistently developed 2 the game is quite stable and quite fun as is yes i d like to see npcs as much as the next person but if they stopped development tomorrow i d be disappointed in the lost potential but my money would still be well spent pz is a story of how you died it is a fairly realistic survival game where you try to stay alive in a town as long as possible against the zombies you craft you fight you hide and you die it s not charming like don t starve or more of a puzzle like neo scavenger it s not trying to tell a moral story like this war of mine it s a straightforward survial against the zombiepocalypse and while the whole zombie thing seems a bit played out now pz is easily the best of the bunch in that area a typical early day might go like this wake up eat some food before it rots celebrate head outside to scavenge for tape and nails to fix your axe go house to house sneaking by zombies as you can find what you re looking for celebrate on the way back see another house that you haven t ransacked go in find lots of food celebrate get jumped by a zombie and get scratched uh oh scramble for disinfectant darnit left that at the house run back to the hosue attracting zombies along the way put bandage on pray hear zombies breaking in fight them off get fever and die of zombie plague that s a day in the life if you set things right like not on easy you won t live forever in this game inevitably you ll get bitten fall sick run out of food or water you ll make a mistake and you ll pay the ultimate price for it i m awful at these types of games and i love pz i have 100 hours in and that represents a great value for my money it s one i continue to play from time to time the towns are huge and the workshop has additional player made towns if you like the zombies can be walkers or runners depending on your settings there are plenty of things to craft areas to see items to gather defenses to build etc there s no risk here that you ll be waiting for something playable so unless the whole ea moniker bothers you it s a game that you can and should buy now
