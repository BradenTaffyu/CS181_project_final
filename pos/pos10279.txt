2016 early access review owned rimworld for a long time before it was steam released by far the cloest thing to dwarf fortress that isn t incredibly hard to get into this is another top seller for a reason gameplay is challenging and fun worth a try if your into sim games has a great potential for steam workshop support although curse has a mod page for it already i feel bad for anyone who didn t buy it earlier for the early development price but it s actually worth the money far more content then most triple a titles and you ll expirience no bugs what so ever from anything upto this patch now
