2016 before i delve into this review let me just say that i have logged 488hours on civilization v and have been playing civ for the last 15 years overall score tl dr 8 10 overall i give this a score of 8 10 as it feels as innovating as a new iteration of a long time award winning serie should be looking at the history of civilization and especially comparing this to civ v i feel that this is gonna be a great platform for future generations to introduce them to the world of civilization the 60 euro price tag can seem a bit daunting for some but i d recommend buying this game if you are a veteran of civilization and if you are new player wait for a sale at which time most of the bugs that are currently in the game will have been fixed this is what civilization beyond earth should have been a complete game that doesn t feel like just another dlc with a high price tag best regards yilmas staff of the unknown borders communitywebsite link unknownborders net for a part by part score look below music cinematic 10 10 right of the bat we are met by some really astounding cinematic a bit doe eyed characters though and background music this of course doesn t change the game but makes us believe that they actually put some effort in to the game but lets head on into the review worthy parts of the game that we all want to know about graphics 9 10 from the very beginning when the first gameplay videos surfaced on youtube we were all met by a dramatic change in the style choice which at first glance looked a bit plastic like many was upset about this aspect but i personally decided to reserve my judgement for when the game had been released after a full standard map game on prince research victory i ve come to a bit of a bland feeling about the new look it definitely looks great on my 4k running at max settings but does it change the gameplay in any good or bad way no as the game progressed i found myself using the strategic view more and more as the screen was cluttered with unit and information however this was something i was expecting as it was the same for me in civ v in the beginning of the game i did feel though that the style was pretty to look at but after some time it was the gameplay that caught me and the graphic was ignored which is just the way i believe civilization should be this game should not be selling itself on its graphics user interface ui 7 10 the user interface is very clear cut i didn t feel they were wasting the space they had and for once the ui scaling worked great on 4k we have all the information we need and the rest is found through ease of access menu buttons located where you would expect them one a side note i was very much annoyed that you couldn t right click out of a town interface but had to click on a unit and then right click to hide the info cards builders 8 10 the changes with the mechanics behind builders i felt to begin with was quite drastic and as the game progressed i ve come to feel that 3 uses of a builders is a bit too little i think 5 would be ideal 7 with policy card but overall it didn t change too much gameplay wise though the point of killing the ever living builder principle worked out districts 6 10 all right so this is probably the biggest difference between civ v and civ vi the districts even after a full game i still don t know whether or not i like them as much as having multiple buildings because let s face it they are basically just buildings and with the builders mechanic change the districts is just a way to fill out those improvement slots that are left available now can you dedicate a city for one or two purposes yes could you do it in civ v yes does it feel different after a full game no sure the cities looks much nicer than civ v with these new districts but i just don t feel like it makes such a big change in the game as it was promoted to do i decided to bump this sections rating by 1 because of the aesthetic aspect that the districts definitely brings civic policy 10 10 the civic or policy aspect of the game has been changed quite drastically compared to civ v but i really love this new iteration of it i feel you have so much more power over the customization of your nation s policies and the use of the governments are perfect especially the legacy attributes are a nice idea relations war 8 10 i love the new relation window as it gives you much more useful information about the other leaders and the feature of each leader having a secret and known policy was integrated perfectly in my mind though it does take some time to get used to it i expect firaxis will be releasing a patch once all the crash fixes are done to boost the ai s strategies now of course i only played it on prince difficulty but the ai compared to civ v was a bit dumb at times moving too much around instead of attacking and misplacing the encampment districts
