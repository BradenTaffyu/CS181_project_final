2015 gameplay 10 10graphics 8 10story 9 10looks great runs great only encountered a few bugs and the occasional frame drops protip switch godrays to low and notice a 20 fps improvement with no graphical visual difference edit 20th november 2015 after 80 hours of gameplay and completion of the main storyline i can safely say this is one of the best bethesda games so far the choices you make early on are easy to live with then the story gets much more intricate and you will be frustrated before making a choice i recommend this to any action adventure rpg fan p s mods
