2023 play this game not playing this game is a disservice to yourself it s a classic but still holds up to this day and i would argue is still one of the best games i ve ever played if i could wipe my memory and play this game for the first time over again i d do it and then promptly wipe it again so i could do it a third time fallout new vegas is a beautifully crafted example of what games can and should strive to be there is never a dull moment you will feel the impact you make within the world and it s very very rich and well written story in every other fallout title 3 and 4 i skipped the main story and had off to do what i wanted because the game gave me such a narrow scope to play the role playing game but i was hooked instantly by this game by literally being shot in the damn face that being said this game is not without it s bugs a common one i ran into was the continue option loading forever uninstall and then re download i recommend using the load option and physically select your latest save file you d like to start from and sometimes when using scoped weapons the scope was blurry like i was looking through a kaleidoscope save quit your game shut down and then restart the program however to discount this game because of 2010 bugs would be a crime that all being said go get shot by benny trust me the game is completely worth it with or without steam sale
