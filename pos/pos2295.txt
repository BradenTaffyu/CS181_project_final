2021 i am fairly experienced with fallout series this game being my 3rd this one does not disappoint it has all the improvements of fallout 4 and a huge world full of action really if you like fallout 4 this is really similar except it is mp not overcrowded and low carrying capacity see below i was hesitant to buy it many reviews were negative and i fear a pay to win game or a pay to have fun game so i waited and bought it for cdn 20 whatever the negative reviews are saying the game is not a pay to win game sure you can pay to have some enjoyable frills such as carry capacity indeed this is a very nice frill and one could consider paying for this but not one as cheap as me so instead you manage your space carefully and return to your base often also theme events happened all the time and the theme change punctually it is fair that somehow devs are getting some cash for the work cash they won t get from this poor canadian player but most likely from princes from africa there are so many i received so many emails from them at the time of this review i played 119h i have yet to complete the main quest and have tons of side quests to complete so i will likely play 200h to finish the game a cost oriented customer such as yours truly is quite happy with this investment i can only recommend this game i don t regret waiting for a more reasonable price but truly this is a good game fun full of action and interesting stories if reading is one of your perks editunfortunatly i finished the game today for cdn 20 i play above 200h and explore a fantastic world while doing this i completed 54 of the achievements without planning it i said unfortunatly because this is truly a fun game sure it has it issues such as the annoying carry capacity the maximum caps you can get from trader per day same with the legendary trading machine but overall this is the best fallout experience i ever had you discover locations with fun or sad stories you see details left by the artists devs on the walls on the floor everywhere unfortunatly there is little left for me here at the time of the review i did not understand how build works you must plan your perks and create an efficient compo of skills and perks even vats i never use it melee here but you can lock a target when shooting now after playing with a melee brawler armed with a fantastic deathclaw gauntlet i had a blast fighting furiously and being almost godlike ndlr this is a awesome action rpg the mp mechanic is well done the events are fun various and players are active if you played a fallout game before or enjoy rpg with a deep story but a lot of action this is your game don t listen to the poor souls here that pretend it s a pay to play game worst game of 2018 or whatever i complete the game with only my initial entrance fee and enjoy each minutes
