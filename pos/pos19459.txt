without a doubt the best fallout game not to put down the others i love them all but new vegas is just so satisfying to play and explore if you re new to the franchise i really think 4 is the best introduction but if you re a returning player or want to move beyond 4 this is the game for you the game runs great on the steam deck maxed out setting and consistent 60fps of course this is new vegas its infamous bugs did cause a few crashes but not only were these few and far between but the game is so good that i hardly cared when it happened so many guns so many skills and perks so many decisions to be made and consequences to be seen this games replay value is legendary ignore the crazies who claim you need to mod the hell out of the game anything beyond a stability mod or two is sacrilegious besides jsawyer mod i m just so lucky that this game still entertains me nearly 15 years later after over 1000 hours on all platforms
