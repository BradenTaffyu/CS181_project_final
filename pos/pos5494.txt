2021 early access review the main questline is not finished as of writing this but there s so much you can do you re all here from sseth s review so i m just gonna name some of my favorite things that he didn t talk about you can drink water until you vomit and then use that vomit to cure fungal infections but only if you eat a worm raw at least sometimes you can clone a psychotic old man as a joke you can stab a cop with an aphrodisiac and convince him to give you all his stuff you can summon the spirit of a race purist out of a box and have him subsequently stab you to death you can stab a block of concrete with some wires and make it have an existential crisis you can create copies of yourself and beat an ape to death you can get in an argument with a sentient plant you can literally stop time you can go too deep and encounter creatures who have become so strong they ve become ordained by god you can get a tractor beam you can be insulted about your race by a computer you can have over 10 limbs not including heads yes heads plural you can cook so well you can shoot slime out of your hands or sleep gas or fire or plants you can be captain america you can watch a dumpster diver and a homeless person beat each other to death and then take both of their stuff you can get schizophrenia except that you re not wrong and people really are out to kill you you can get cut by a holographic plant but then you realize it s a hologram and feel better you can accidentally anger a flying bull rhino that hits you so hard you get thrown 2 screens over you can attack a traveling trader and then instantly regret it when you realize those car sized tortoises aren t for show you can have your tongue rot out of your head use nanomachines son to grow it back and then have it immediately rot off again because you forgot to actually cure your disease you can use nanomachines son for basically anything but most of all and most importantly you can die a lot like more than probably any other game i ve played i haven t even mentioned anything related to the main questline all of this stuff you can do on your own time the main questline is even more crazy but i m not going to spoil it since it s an experience please play it
