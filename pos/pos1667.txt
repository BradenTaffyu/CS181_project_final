2019 another sneaky hit of a game at first glance i fell for the opening trick of getting me to stop playing similar to how spec ops the line makes you think one thing while something totally different is going on it s a hard concept to explain in writing but nier automata made me think the entire game was going to be a pointless one life playthrough as in once you run out of lives that s it game over bullet hell well half the fun of these games is the journey of discovery figuring out that the game is testing your patience for a reason and i fell for it it wasn t until a friend suggested i try it again because i never made it through the prologue i had played for over 30 minutes what prologue i asked shouldn t the game let me progress shouldn t it let me save who likes these kinds of games where i can t continue when i want to just keep playing he suggested and set aside a time when you can get through the opening sequence in one go it s worth it ok so i don t know 45 minutes of playing and the game as part of the plot lets me start saving my progress i now have a full fledged character i can walk around with there are things to do besides just mindlessly slinging bullets and swords at my enemies in a 2d esque sidescroller what was i thinking on my first couple of attempts this is an awesome game great characters a cleverly done parallel plotline from different characters perspectives jiant swords tons of enemies to bash slash zap slice dice and splice one of the more fluidly fun fighting experiences with a plethora of upgrades and chips to experiment with customize the game how you want things like a hud that can be tailored to your style of play in regards to enemy damage objectives health bars etc are woven into the game as pluggable upgrades for your character a lot of game menu elements are part of the game and not just arbitrary real world settings in a game menu they are part of the game itself this is also difficult to explain because i don t remember ever seeing this mechanic in other games certainly not done to this degree and so well this game makes me think about the implications of artificial intelligence how unfeeling robots can have feelings life and death real or artificial epic game has instantly become one of my core gotta have this available to play at anytime games there aren t that many but at least the list is still growing we live in an awesome age of gaming this game is a true work of art visual and philosophical i hope more people give it a chance
