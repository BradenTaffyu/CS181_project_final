2019 i never write reviews but for people who may be on the fence about this game like i was let me ease your mind it s incredible i have been a gamer for a long time and have played a great variety of games from all genres i would place this game in my top five favorite there is a slight catch it s hard real hard i spent hours researching physics aerodynamics and orbital mechanics just to play this game effectively but don t let that scare you away learning all these new things is part of what makes this game so amazing i had never been so interested in physics nor understood as much as i do now before trying to play this game learning the real world science genuinely makes the game better modding expands the game exponentially and there is an endless amount of creative possibilities however i would strongly encourage new players to at least play a good 30 50 hours or so on just the vanilla game complete the tech tree and then play some more then start adding mods and kerbalising the crap out of everything it s worth it this game is worth both your time and money i have not regretted buying it and look forward to logging my next 400 hours edit after well over 400 more hours and multiple actual years my review remains the same ksp2 has crashed and burned and this game still maintains its status as the best physics based space sim ever made
