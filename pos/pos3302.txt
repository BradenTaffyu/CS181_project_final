2022 this recommendation is a very hesitant one this game has many good aspects but it is heavily marred by mid to late game execution of those aspects as well as heavily contrived story moments the combat is fun and strategizing for encounters to trigger status effects and stack dots is very enjoyable however the game does not encourage strategizing it encourages cheesing encounters are heavily balanced against you and while that might encourage you to be thoughtful about how you approach them all it really encourages is metagaming you will rarely approach any encounter where you are on equal footing with the enemy from square one and it is almost unheard of to find yourself in an advantageous position this usually means that by the time one of your turns comes around the enemy will usually have stripped you of all armor and left you close to death rare is it until much later that you ever have the fire power to do the same to the enemy as their armor values and health are usually heavily bloated meaning that you ll struggle to chip away at their armor for many turns an issue only compounded by the many 6 8 man encounters the game likes to throw at you this encourages heavy meta gaming rather than roleplaying and many encounters feel as though they end with you obliterating the group with 50 pre placed explosives or a barrel of deathfog additionally the story is very rough act 1 is a great introduction to the world and story possibly the best starting area in any rpg like this act 2 however proves meandering and poorly paced act 3 falls just under act 3 for me in terms of storytelling and consistency whereas i would argue that the 4th and final act of the game is among the worst of them all with a contrived and unearned twist that practically feels like a spit int he face the music is good your party members are enjoyable but the world while fleshed out at times feels less than thought through and the story is all at the same time too slow and too fast the combat is full of potential but you ll likely only ever play it one way however this game offers something not readily available elsewhere so it s hard to dismiss it for it s flaws outright a difficult to make recommend but a recommend all the same
