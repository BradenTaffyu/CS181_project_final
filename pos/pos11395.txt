2022 early access review this one is a bit on the ok side if they would stop fighting the community zombie killing is always fun base building is fun too so is scavenging but the developers go out of there way to combat everything the community comes up with for defending their base these zombies just get more and more powerful to the point where they know where you are 200 feet underground and will dig down into the earth to destroy you and your every time a good defence is figured out by the community the developers find a way to overcome it or not allow it anymore you can have a steel building and yet these will find there way in and destroy your that s my only gripe about this game let us play how we want to and if we want to avoid the zombies then let us i don t remember if i bought this game or if it was free but if i haven t bought it yet i doubt i will if they keep on changing stuff other than that its a good game lots to do amazing when played with friends now if they really want to fight players defences then make zombies playable by people and they will find away but make sure you make it worth it
