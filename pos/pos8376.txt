2018 if you like sim city or anno this game might be nothing for you it is city survival and you feel it from the beginning do not expect to have a good run on the first try it is awesome i played all 4 scenarios on the standard difficulty and it was hard i loved it some people considered the follwoing general hints section how to succed in any this survival strategy game as spoiler for that reason i warn you that you might get some hints to start more succesfully your frost punk game if you want to learn explore everything by yourself do not proceed further no events spoilered just some general struggles highlighted independet from any scenario everything can be expereinced within 1 to 2 hours of game play useing the acceleration of the game just some hints all optional goals can be reached without children working relegion or rampaging like a dictator it is like pure exploration capitalism you need to go out look around and take everything if one of your resources always blocks you more capacity if you need work force automation or search for people if you have unused work force available probably you are to slow in two scenarios i had to replay half of the scenario because i was to slow i read stuff like to frustrate the player well this is how a challange works if you not able to adept or to learn you will keep failing it is challanging most probably you will fail at least once and you have to replay each scenario once to accomplish all scenario goals you need to optimize your society your laws your research your resources your hungry people your ill people and your city you need all of this otherwise you might not be able to fullfill all goals or even fail completely there is a short tutorial at the beginning of the main campaign and a data base whenever you do something research and so on there is something like a library where you can study more you need to use it and ready a bit there are hints as well how to use the stuff you just researched or built it is not so much to read in the end you need some kind of plan if you cannot imagine to find or optimize a strategy for your city community survival than the people will overthrow you i liked the social aspect a lot people sometimes panicked like you could imagine in such a situation you need to estimate the reaction on your descisions there are two social indicators which are pretty real discontent and hope decide your fate as a leader often it gets pretty tense towards the end of each scenario every scenario has a unique mission with unique events very good the scenario in general is pretty realistic for example imagine for yourself if you work several times more than 12 hours you will die in a survival enivroment as i said it is not sissy anno with non human workers even the automation needs power from your generator from time to time if you lose hope or you are unhappy you will try to escape the system in which you are right now no matter how stupid this acutally is or how stupid the other option acutally is pretty realistic a little bit like nowadays when you think oh i do quite well the game often throws something at you you eat it and go on but it happens that it is too much to chew the main scenario is a good example during the first try i did not care enough for the heat so i got frostbite and many ill people i lost a lot of work force got filled hospitals and care houses and failed end of the first story this is the game in a nutshell buy it if you like city building survival and you have some kind of society understanding like in real life every bad thing you do will lead to more bad things you have to do enjoy to get frustrated and evolve d
