2018 early access review disclaimer the time on record does not reflect the hours i have played this game i ve played a lot more if you need a story fed to you this isn t the game for you if you want to become a zombe slaying god this isn t the game for you if you think a game is bad because it stays in early access for a long time this isn t the game for you project zomboid is a game where you make your own story you create a character you make up their backstory you choose their strengths and weaknesses and you play that character as you attempt to make them survive in the zombie apocalypse this isn t a game for people who don t want to lose a lot this game gets a lot of flak for missing things that individuals want luckily the modding community for this game thrives and adds so much stuff i don t even know where to start if you want to roleplay the slow agonizing death of a character 20 hours into a game because you got cocky and bitten this is the game for you
