2016 as i am writing this war thunder s most helpful reviews are almost all negative as i am sure you have noticed while i m certain many of these reviewers points have merit i believe it is important to consider their viewpoint and that theirs might not be yours by all appearances the game is not fun anymore for people who have played it for thousands of hours and or prefer tier v highest tier most modern vehicles realistic simulator mode tank battles as non russian nations as someone who has spent a couple hundred hours playing as germany u s a and gb in up to t iv air arcade battles and as germany in up to t iii tank arcade battles i am here to tell you this game is a lot of fun i have encountered few balancing issues and fewer bugs and i m relatively sure i ll be playing another few hundred hours before i get bored of it and move on if you are interested curious just install the game and try it for a few hours it s f2p after all due to the slow progression i definitely recommend getting a premium account to speed things up a bit if you end up liking the game if you aren t stupid rich enough to buy the ridiculously overpriced premium vehicles that offer no real advantage apart from another progression speed boost you will find war thunder to be well worth the subscription cost
