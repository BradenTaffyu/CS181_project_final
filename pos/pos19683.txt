2017 you know the drill war war never changes the ultimate edition is quite a package and after playing endings for the three major factions ncr house yes man out of four i feel really full of waging war i gotta go back to experience the ultimate bad guy route as the roman psycho sometime later after i have survived the hangover from having drunk hundreds of sunset sarsaparillas its a really good rpg with extremely well written dialogue and abundance of choices up to you the vanilla game really has it all on its own the dlcs are just a bonus like spin offs of the main world of mojave wasteland i dont really have anything bad to say about it except for some annoying bugs like enemies getting stuck inside the terrain and the player occasionally falling through world etc gotta lock that fps to 60 as well to avoid severe bugs with physics you can even make the game look decent ish by todays standards by exploiting the offerings of nexusmods com and enb so the dlc loved dead money great story building around the theme of greed with intriguing gameplay elements it deliberately makes you approach the game from different angle than you were accustomed in the base game honest hearts was a bit of a letdown kinda uninspired area with basic gameplay and run of the mill storyline it answers some minor questions and rumours heard in the base game though old world blues was amazing definitely the best dialogue offerings in the whole game and such a fun story with ludicrous weapons and gadgets to be obtained i didnt want it to end d i m bit on the fence with lonesome road it has its moments as a final boss of sorts and discovering the rest of the courier s tale but it falls kinda short with its boring map design endless 4 radstorms and fighting sections full of deathclaws and ghoul grunts with deathclaw like health it gets a bit old to get ambushed by an instakilling monster while crossing a minefield the hundreth time and that freaking storm always comes out at such a time you will find yourself thinking if that crap is scripted or is your luck just running completely out overall the ultimate edition is a very good game with not too many annoyances well played obsidian entertainment
