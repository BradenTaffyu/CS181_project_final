2016 it s dark souls 3 so if you re a fan of the series then you ll know exactly what to expect awesomely responsive and intuitive combat you ll die a lot an immensely detailed and dark fantasy setting loads of cool weapons and gear to dress your dude or lady up in you ll pick up items with vague and cryptic descriptions and think what the hell is this and what the hell does it do you ll die a lot it s hard but fair and nowhere near as difficult as people who don t play the series think it is you ll die and shout at your screen something like daaaaaamn and then come back and try again about 25 times there will be huge scary bosses to fight and you ll think to yourself i ll never beat this and then on the 10th try you ll beat it summon someone to help no one will judge you and scream at your monitor you ll reach that point in every souls game where you have to bite the bullet and do some grinding to get stronger you ll probably spend more time exploring wiki s than playing the actual game
