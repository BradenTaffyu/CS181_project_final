2020 graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it paint exe gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh starring at walls is better just don t audio very good good not too bad bad earrape difficulity easy significant brain usage easy to learn hard to master difficult dark souls story story text or audio floating around average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average but it can be infinity depends on the player long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs in my opinion
