2023 graphics are nice and civs have interesting bonuses but there needs to be less focus on ranked games seasons and profile icons and more on adding more civilizations it s been a year and a half and all we have is 2 more civs for a total of 10 comparing that to other aoe s which have as much as 20 is honestly just disappointing
