2020 being a long time total war fan and as chinese i was suspicious that this game would be a disaster at first but it turned out i was totally wrong i loved the aesthetics very very much the much more realistic graphics and cosmetics are definitely a hundred miles better than the koei s japanese cartoonish crap hope ca can make the second game of this series
