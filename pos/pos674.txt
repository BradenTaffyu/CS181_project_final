2017 i ll be honest when i first heard about stardew valley i thought it wouldn t be my kind of game but i started hearing some good things so decided to pick it up and i m glad i did rarely do we see games with this kind of heart and soul put into it from the simple yet colorful visuals to the charming story and characters a lot of time has been invested into making this game starting with a simple farm with a few crops and growing it into a ranch full of animals never felt so rewarding from fishing in the nearby streams to exploring the deep mines there s plenty to do and you ll spend many hours doing it i highly recommend this to anyone stardew valley is truly something special
