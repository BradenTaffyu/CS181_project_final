2017 it s a great way to get a realistic drive experience you just need a combination of a good ffb wheel and good settings matter of taste the tracks are laser scanned and there are a lot of available cars dlc mods in my opinion pro drive experience laser scanned tracks car and track mods many updates car sounds many dlc s graphics you can use mods con menu looks boring to me i never had an issue till now so i can t say how the support is
