was rather sceptical of this product having not tried any of owlcat s prior products and given games on 40k tend to miss the mark entirely sadly i was actually very impressed with this game in not following suit there from not so nice word aristocrats to a space nun with guns dodgy dark eldar shenanigans and even techno religious suped up honda civics mechanicum which are shown too in the trailer and pictures what isn t there to praise the corpse emperor for after all they have spent time to understand the lore and it isn t presented in a way that is entirely overwhelming for someone new to the 40k universe it has depth that 40k fans nerds like myself would love but it presents plenty of guide help info explanations to help understand key terms and bits of lore for those new i have enjoyed the game play thoroughly especially coming off the back of baldur s gate and can say it stands up pretty great actually i ve enjoyed the levelling system and plethora of skills and abilities and this game really can be quite strategic and tactical for those who are wanting more of a challenge but is equally fun for those wanting to cruise in the story on easier difficulties the progression of abilities and gear weapons was great to see there are some cool weapons you get to use as the game progresses but be patient using a pea shooter for a bit at the start and pretty cool skill ability character synergies you can do if you re looking for something a bit more tactical reminds me a bit of xcom combat and baldurs gate combat wise for a basic loose reference for idea while i would like to see more voice acting implemented into the game as there is quite a bit of reading that remains like this review though very well written unlike this review due to the recent major patch has implemented large chunks of voice acting in the prologue early game i am hopeful more voice acting will be added in time i have also noticed many reviews have issues of bugs and problems and i honestly can say i have not experienced a single bug yet though i am well aware many are experiencing bugs especially in the late game of which i have just begun so i can t really speak to the degree of game play interruption on that front however there does seem to be a commitment to ironing out bugs which is great and qol improvements as displayed in the recent major patch so i am hopeful what bugs there are will be smoothed out and fixed in time which is great since the overall game is pretty good overall and tldr i really would recommend this game it is immersive pretty engaging good writing story characters with depth and range if you liked bg3 or xcom and have an interest in 40k go for it i would like to see more voice acting implemented which i am hopeful of in time given the recent update i do think the price is absolutely reasonable for the content d
