this game is a lot of fun though it s somewhat random and thus you can feel frustrated waiting for your first win as with all games like this where more items are unlocked as you play it might actually be easier to win early in the game since the number of potential items is lower thus increasing the chances that you ll get a good combination of jokers and other things so you might ask yourself what is this game about well it s a card game where you play poker hands to earn points in the form of chips to achieve a set round goal called a blind in a set number of hands with a set number of discards each ante has 3 rounds blinds small big and boss you play poker hands from a deck discarding cards the boss is mandatory and each has unique challenges e g verdant leaf prevents scoring until a joker is removed the eye prevents hand reuse defeat each blind earn rewards and shop access for jokers arcanas planets vouchers to buy cards that boost score discard or restock or affect gameplay for example the first round goal is 300 chips and you start with around 3 5 hands to attempt to reach that goal you ll also start with 3 5 discards per round with each discard being up to 5 cards at a time your hand size will be around 7 cards to start out with but the actual number depends on the starting conditions given by the type of deck you play there s 5 colored decks red blue green yellow and black some decks give extra discards some give extra hands some give extra money each deck presents its own challenge once you beat the game with a given deck you can change the chip color which further changes the game difficulty anyway as i said this is kind of random so you may find yourself losing a lot even if you play the game perfectly or you might find yourself winning even though you play really sloppily if the random seed is just so stacked in your favor you don t find out the seed until after the game is over though but if you ve ever thought maybe you could have won if you did something differently then this is a great option the only caveat here is that you don t unlock anything from playing a seeded game and so it would purely be for the fun of playing there s lots of room for strategy but since you can buy usually 2 jokers at most per round you may find that it s difficult to form a good strategy with what you have one of my favorite combos is to have the four finger joker allows you to make straights and flushes with only 4 cards combined with the square joker starts with 16 chips per hand played but increases 4 chips for every time you play only four cards and the seance joker straights or flushes creates a random spectral card you can see how each card works together but the odds of these jokers all being available together is slim cards can be modified to have extra effects like multiplier 4 per card played wild used as any suit bonus adds 30 chips to the current card value glass x2 multiplier but 25 chance of being destroyed once played steel 1 5x multiplier added as long as you hold it in your hand and it s not played and there s more you can also have card editions foil polychrome holographic etc and seals applied to the card small colored circles that give an extra effect to that card under certain conditions you can also add cards to your deck to have more than 52 cards or you can destroy cards to have fewer than 52 the card modifications aren t permanent so you don t have to worry about messing up the deck but you can mess the deck up for your current run for example it s possible to change cards so that you have extra cards of a certain suit by changing them from another e g from hearts to clubs which can make the odds of making a flush go up for clubs but down for hearts there s also a spectral card that will change a large number of cards to be all the same rank e g a whole hand full of 8 s making it possible to get a 5 of a kind you don t have to have any special knowledge of how to play poker to enjoy the game as the game will tell you what the hands are as you select it and you ll learn the difference between a flush a straight and a straight flush as the game goes on in conclusion if you like games that are both random and give options for strategy and you like unlocking new stuff this game will give you all of that if you prefer games that rely more on strategy and skill this will be a bit frustrating for you but honestly how many card games are there that rely solely on skill i think it s a fun game though and worth the purchase
