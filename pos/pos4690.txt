2020 tl drgreat shooter mediocre fallout game 8 10 my ratings don t mean protip if you do buy it watch your step you ll see what i mean later long version i m a massive fan of the fallout series as you may be able to tell but despite my obvious bias for the series i thoroughly enjoyed fallout 4 another thing to keep in mind while reading i will be making several comparisons to fallout new vegas throughout the review unlike fallout nv fallout 4 plays more like a shooter which i personally have no problem with but it s missing some of the intricacies that new vegas had such as ammo crafting and a general karma system a lot of people including myself have said fallout 4 is a good shooter but a bad fallout game which indirectly summarizes my thoughts on fallout 4 weird sidenote i d be more likely to recommend fallout 4 to people who liked dying light and far cry 3 to 5 than i would recommend it to people who liked earlier fallout games fallout 4 mechanically is a vast improvement over previous games in my opinion at least i much prefer how power armors are treated like vehicles rather than a giant suit of armor the player wears all the time i very much like how deathclaws are a more constant threat rather than powerful enemies you encounter in specific zones the game generally is much more stable compared to nv weapon and armor modding is more varied featuring a decent choice of mods for weapons you find as far as story tone and depth go though i will point out now where i felt fallout 4 felt short the perk system and levelling up has been a bit dumbed down compared to my previous experiences weirdly the commonwealth has a lot of wooden structures left it doesn t have the same rustic decaying charm nv had downtown boston recoups on that a bit there s much less variety in enemies nv had raiders fiends powder gangers legionnaires great khans while fallout 4 has raiders and that s kind of it super mutants aren t nearly the same threat they were in previous games they re just kind of beefy raiders i know it s hard to compete with mister new vegas but the host of diamond city radio on my first playthrough really turned the game into a snooze fest who gave the assaultron boobs the sole survivor is a set character with a set backstory although some in game plot devices can with that which leaves less room for roleplay compared to previous games the game kind of babysits you right after spawning you get the change to obtain a set of power armor and a follower and other followers are not far behind it kind of goes against the vibe new vegas had the commonwealth feels much friendlier and sadly littering mines in places that don t make sense doesn t change the atmosphere there s also a bunch of new features that i personally liked but won t go into because they re best explored on their own as a closing remark i will only say that i miss the ncr and viktor fun drinking game everytime you notice a reused asset from skyrim take a shot so is it a bad game not at all i really loved playing it just don t expect a similar experience to previous games it s less rpg more shooter so far fallout 4 only crashed on me maybe 5 times in total when new vegas could crash every 30 minutes
