2020 fantastic hunting sim and a worthy successor the thehunter classic though they are both very different games please check out classic too this game is so beautiful it ll have you stopping to take screenshots constantly pros beautiful landscapes and huge maps the amount of work that s gone into this game is breathtaking the majority of animal models are excellent and detailed truracs brought a whole new level of realism and excitement the story missions are surprisingly involving especially the african one trophy lodges are fantastic especially since the score update and multi mounts a great community i don t play multiplayer games often but i enjoy multiplayer hunts in cotw a good selection of weapons including bows rifles shotguns and pistols ew are constantly updating this game working with the community and releasing new animals and content dlc is generally cheap and is often on sale cons the lack of loadouts hurts this game quite a bit it s frustrating having to manually restock my entire inventory every time i change map extremely predictable animal behaviour i dislike the use of need zones as it really makes the game too easy no animal to animal interactions they do have predator prey now but not as detailed as you d expect it would be awesome to see stags fighting or wolves playing the wolves not only are the models really messed up they are constantly aggressive towards humans not only does this damage wolves reputations in real life it is straight up inaccurate behaviour for a game that claims to be realistic regarding the trophy lodges many game animals are on plaques that are way too big for them and it looks awful there used to be a work around for this but ew patched it out of the game hopefully they will listen to the communities feedback there are still many bugs in this game though they seem to have ironed out most of the major ones ew are generally good at fixing things that the community bring up though it can take some time conclusion a really great hunting sim certainly one of the best it s incredibly immersive and will eat away hours of your life while at the same time making you want to get outside to the wilderness and leave civilisation there are some problems as highlighted above but ew are a small company and it is understandable they are constantly producing new content for the game and the dlc is always very cheap compared to other games some of my best gaming memories come from this game and from classic if you re not completely certain wait for a sale but honestly this game is fantastic especially if you are a fan of hunting sims i m not a hunter irl but i love hunting sims as i find them engaging and relaxing
