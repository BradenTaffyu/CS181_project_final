2020 stellaris is a fantastic game though it s easy to admit it s not for everyone the game is not meant to be beaten while the end is possible and a victory screen exists it s meant for you to make your own story and path and eventually settle with the results it s not a short game it ll take hours to get major progress done but for those who enjoy a long massive strategy game filled with twists turns and insane battles then this is a game you should give a look i would highly suggest watching some videos of the game to get a basic grasp of what to expect you ll likely end up playing for some time before you find out if you like it or not i would recommend it on sale or at full price but don t rush the dlc get it on sale for sure now get out there and conquer the stars
