2018 its been a few years since i first recommended this game and both the game and i have changed a lot over the years i am however glad to say that it s still one of my favourite and feels like chatting to a old friend every time i boot it up and mercilessly slaughter the entire galaxy stellaris is a brilliant 4x game which is constantly changing for better or worse and has a huge variety of random events and in depth event chains which assists the roleplay aspect if you re the roleplay type recommended dlc s utopia adds ascension perks and much more a must have distant stars adds more events and flavour to the game synthetic dawn adds machine intelligence and more ai related stuff anniversary portraits its free so there is no reason not to get it apocalypse haha planet go brrr also mechanics maybe dlc s megacorp allows you to extort an entire galaxy for fun federations game literally becomes star trek aquatics phees also aquatic origin with 30 size homeworld is broken atm over all would still recommend2020 is my 4th year playing this game and my 3rd reviewing it and i must say it has delivered the overhauled federation system and newly implemented galactic law compliments the controversial planetary updates and changes of previous years i enjoy the star trek esque path that the game is taking also with a few more runs under my belt i can confirm that the planetary overhaul has grown on me and that it is reminiscent of the paradox games of old the year is 2021yet another year of stellaris with addition of the nemesis dlc allowing you to become the crisis as if i wasn t already you can now raze the galaxy to the ground in ways that make apocalypse look like a playdate the aquatics update has shot yet another breath of fresh air or lets say water into the game while eating away at my bank account this is also the year that my younger brother has started mercilessly massacring zenos on mass we will track his future with great interest
