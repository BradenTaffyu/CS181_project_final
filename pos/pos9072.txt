i started playing this game to play with my boyfriend and his friends i struggled to keep up and the constant pop ups got overwhelming yes this is a positive review recently i decided to give it another try just on my own with all the pauses and taking time to read through the pop ups this game is amazing in every possible way it is fun intriguing and very easy to tune for your own kind of play through if you are a new played and you got overwhelmed the first time you played it give it some time take breaks allow yourself to fully understand the story of your empire it is beyond rewarding once you get a hang of it good luck with your empires everyone keep it up
