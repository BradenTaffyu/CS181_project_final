2022 early access review poured hundreds of hours into this game outside steam it s the best driving simulator on the market there is absolutely no competition in terms of how accurately everything is simulated in beamng drive and with the smallest things suchas oil temperature block temperature tire brake coolant temperature the amazing soft body physics actual mechanical failures an ever growing roster of official cars and levels the best dev team i ve ever seen behind any product ever and a constantly expanding modding scene this game is worth more than its price and the developers are more than deserving of every penny everything is physically simulated in real time no scripted movement or anything of that nature the weakest part of the game are the visuals but even those suffice 100 10 absolutely recommend to every car enthusiast
