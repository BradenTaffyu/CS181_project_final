2020 after several years or say in a decade there comes a game which becomes an inspiration or puts dramatic influence on genre maybe it is game s amazing story line or combat or even soundtrack that makes it special divinity original sin 2 is rare combination of all three above mentioned elements this game is indeed special to me i am going to write review step by step in such a way that you might find why you should play this game how much fun you are missing of course no spoilers are included the game is turn based i think it is equivalent to chessboard but nevertheless much more interesting story story is the important part of any game which gives it meaning a game without a story is like a man without an aim the game takes place in fictional world known as rivellon ravaged by supernatural powerful entities known as voidwoken which want nothing more than destruction of mankind world the last saviour is missing without him the world has fallen into more chaos sourcery is considered as evil as its use draws these supernatural creatures into rivellon what you will be in game is anybody s guess there are four races in game viz humans elves dwarves lizards how the characters in world behave with you depends on the race of your character humans are largest group in game of course somewhat dominant they are heroes when they are not they still claim to be elves are on the verge of extinction so they are in dire need of new leader dwarven kingdom has collapsed and is also in need of saviour finally lizards the enigmatic race which is always two steps ahead of others but do not underestimate anyone all of them have special skills i liked the idea of rivellon it gives fair chance of equality its writers made it very modern day like world by giving it a good political theme you can play as any gender any one of the above mentioned races still be equally influential you can take good actions be a perfect saviour or take evil actions but still get things done the choices in game are given to make it more interesting there are origin characters which have unique storyline goals in game these stories are very well written to say the least you can create your own custom hero but it will not have story of course story is incomplete without any comedy this game has plenty of that the quick witty humour well written dialogues banter i personally enjoyed it a lot voice acting the voice actors really turned this game into a masterpiece they made these animated characters so lively one might think they are truly alive no doubt the talents of these voice actors their dialogues get stuck into our heads music i think this games music is even more interesting i would say it is legendary it is melodious sometimes harmonious very few times i have heard such masterful performance of musical instruments basuri themes are my favourite if you like guitar then you can change it to oud from options menu there is also cello tambura all in all quite quite good symphonies songs are sung by talented artists combat game mechanics competitive highly smart ai which punishes you harshly for a single mistake is what i loved most no wonder i outsmarted it in the end really one may ask believe me this was not easy but i completed this game wihtout taking any damage including civilians allies you can play this game on lower difficulties you can have three companions maximum or you can play solo there are total five difficulties in this game 1 story mode ai is ordinary players get high vitality damage npcs get very low vitality attack power easy mode2 explorer mode ai is same as story mode but player s character bonuses are halved npcs have 20 stats 3 classic mode no change in ai but no bonuses to player character no reduced stats for enemies 4 tactician mode ai is really challenging you must improvise and npcs have 50 stats 5 honour mode highest difficulty in game everything is same as tactician mode but you can have only one save game if everyone in your party perishes then your save game is deleted it is highly challenging requires complete knowledge of game random rewards which are useless to your build glitches ruined some part of the game but it is fine by me the game introduces physical magic armour in game which protects player from negative statuses once the armours have depleted players become vulnerable to status effects unless you have immunity there is variety of vocations in this game you can do elemental damage fire air earth water you know the standard elements physical damage vocations like archers fighters rogues fighters etc all vocations have unique advantages disadvantages but combat is still good i prefer to be an archer as i have written earlier the game is turn based in every turn you require action points to perform some attacks or movements this game has civil abilities like bartering haggling of prices persuading npcs thievery etc you can put points in loremaster which gives you advantage over many enemies as it shows their strengths weaknesses game has too many ambushes i recommend using loremaster divinity originals sin 2 has initiative system which determines the turns of characters highest initiative means first turn only two battles are exception in entire game that do not consider initiative graphics aesthetics i loved the graphics of this game and it requires a dedicated gpu guessed it higher the gb size of gpu better the performance level designs do not seem repetitive are arranged in spectacular way once or twice i thought the scenes were breathtaking characters have good fashion of clothes variety of character customisation it is highly recommended by many to not miss this game
