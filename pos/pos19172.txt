2015 one of the best games i ve ever played my experience of the game in a nutshell speech is op trying to be a good guy is really hard when it gets near to the end of the game punching is also op when you happen to have a robotic hand if not don t even think about it vats doesn t differentiate friend from enemy so if you re using it quickly it is possible to go from fighting on one side of a huge battle to being violently abused by enough soldiers from both sides to make you wonder whether they ve been killing each other at all there is a comedian next to one of the doors on the strip his line about not being able to get to sleep will help you pick up girls in real life side quests can be ridiculously long winded but worth it everything you eat is irradiated so i survived on hardcore drugs alone don t try this at home kids10 10 would spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find a sniper rifle again
