2018 i have come from an era when everybody played baldur s gate icewind dale etc at first that game made me feel oh ok another boring game with boring dialogues but nooooooooooooooo i played this one for 111 hours and i am still at second part and i am not bred you can literally do anything as some people already mentioned play solo play multi do pvp create game and manage it the more you play the more you want to play you wonder what other possibilities can come across once you encounter something you always think about what would happen what if i did if you change your combat strategy npcs also change that too i was planing to create second party right after i got more involved with scenario guys this game is a must have
