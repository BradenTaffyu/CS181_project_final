2020 this is not my usual kind of game i hate strategy and i hate turn based combat and that s the reason i didn t buy it until now i saw the reviews i saw the praise but i was scared i wouldn t like it a few days ago i bought it in the sale to finally give it a go it started off a bit rocky the first few hours had a very steep learning curve and i remember ranting to my boyfriend 3 hours in that i should ve stopped before hitting 2h because now i can t refund it anymore i pushed through though starting over one more time with better understanding of skills party composition and not much later i got to level 3 opening up a few more options got some gear and i was super hooked straight away 3 days later and i m 22 hours in so if you re like me and you re not sure get it give it a few hours to sink in don t stress it but really give it a chance push through just a little longer if it doesn t hook you straight away it s amazing
