2022 amazing game if you had played the base game and liked it the dlc makes it even better base game gives you a huge map to do everything in 1 spot and to restart a new game on a new type of asteroid sometimes feels too heavy 500 cycles in the dlc lets you experience many different asteroids in a single playthrough not mentioning the improved rocket building starmap and space exploration also klei is always great in improving and updating their games
