2022 reading through some of the reviews for this game is hilarious and it definitely seems like a polarising installment in the franchise while it is very different from fallout 3 and fallout new vegas in many ways for me it still feels like a fallout game yes f4 certainly dumbs down many of the rpg and other elements that made the previous games so fun to play but what it lacks player character immersion it makes up for in sheer freedom to play the how you want to play in a way that is far less restrictive than f3 and fnv if you re looking for a game focused on exploration and combat i would highly recommend this game
