2020 the gamethe game is phenomenal the best strategy 4x game there is in my opinion it looks great ca has put a lot of time and effort in making the map look interesting and beautiful it plays and controls very intu tively so even if this is your first 4x game it will be relatively easy to pick up then again there also is plenty of room to become better at the game this i think is a hallmark of good games easy to learn but hard to master this applies mainly to the way you play differently with different factions races and the battles you control yourself a lot of people do not like the main campaign vortex or think the main campaign is not as good as the secondairy campaign mortal empires which is locked behind a paywall i would disagree with that i started my first mortal empires campaign after i had already played 300 hours of vortex i do admit that i got the mortal empires because vortex got a bit stale but 300 hours is a good run for any game the dlca lot of people do not like the dlc practices for games like this which is very understandable if you look at the total price for the full game then you would indeed end up somewhere around 400 but when i bought this game i had none of the dlc and it was still very fun to play and i also would like to add that every update that comes with dlc also provides some upgrades or tweaks to players that do not own all dlc i think this should be the norm so this not a big commendation for ca but they deserve some props overall i think the dlc should not be a reason to put you off of the game most dlc provides different ways to play different campaigns more choices and i think most are fairly priced and every now and then there are big sales for all warhammer and total war titles which are perfect times to pick up some dlc you don t have yet my biggest recommendation for dlc would be the tomb kings the tomb kings provide a very unique way to play and a very unique campaign the only exceptions are ofcourse the blood for the blood god dlc and the prophet and the warlock the prophet and the warlock provides one of the best lords and some essential units for the skaven race without these units you basicly are playing with a handicap this i think really wasn t ca s fault since these units only became essential when the other races became stronger with their dlc and the skaven just didn t have a lot of ways of dealing with some of those units the blood for the blood god dlc provides blood graphics and some minor flavor text and events this is just a bit sad final verdictgame good go play
