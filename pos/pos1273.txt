2016 early access review amazing just amazing deep survival simulator that will only get better with more updates hunger sicknes depression fear temperature etc logical crafting system that goes way beyond other games and is very very extensive huge map every house building complex can be entered and can be turned in to your homebase fort you can even wall in the entire downtown area and be a self proclaimed mayor imagination is the only limit realistic zombies with tons of options to customize them to your liking in sandbox mode only want shamblers with bad hearing excellent eyesight average smell dont respawn after being killed and is urban focused you got it plus a ton more options looting and scavenging for survival break in to every house and see what goodies you can find maybe it is a former survivor house with tons of food stashed away or maybe the house alarm will trigger and draw massive zombies to you location leg it i mean i just scratched the surface here i could go on and on about this game it is fantastic and it will get better with a mature community and a developer that listen to its players thing can only go in one direction
