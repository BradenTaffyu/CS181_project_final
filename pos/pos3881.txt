2022 tldr if you enjoy xcom turn based style games and jrpgs and min maxing grinding for items skill drops you ll love this game this game continues to be worked on and updated even in 2022 which is amazing also important to note this game has received many updates and tweaks over it s lifetime so you should be cautious with reviews that are more than a year or two old for example crafting at launch was straight up terrible and crafted items required many many hours of farming to create 1 not good item which unlocked the pattern for the next not good item crafting has been changed so that material cost is actually reasonable and crafting is actually worth doing downsides the story is more on the okay side than amazing and you ll be confused at the translations sometimes but there are some interesting twists and characters a few criticisms character unlocks can come really late in the game like absurdly late and by then it s difficult to integrate characters into the main lineup it would have been better if the devs added special missions to add gain a third character class or have characters learn new characters classes as part of the story line as the characters grow and change over time it is possible to play the game through once see the story and then move on however where this game really shine is if you love to min max and obsess over your characters and make broken interactions between skills and abilities then you can pour hundreds of hours into this game regrinding missions over and over to unlock skill drops or items and trying out different skill combinations then trying different classes and skill combinations if this sounds fun i highly recommend getting this game
