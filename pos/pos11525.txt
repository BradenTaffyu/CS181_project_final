2022 product received for free early access review i ve been watching friends playing it for a while some years back and i ve had the game in my library for some time however i never got around to playing it myself i never found the graphics and everything around it too exciting and there was a lack of players so i was recently forced to play the game and i have to say it is fun yes the graphics don t really blow you away and at first glance it looks quite unimpressive but you quickly realize that the game has an incredible depth and the game mechanics are super tuned you expect nothing and get a lot every hour you play more you discover new things that you didn t think were possible in the game the zombies are no walk in the park and you really have to plan and think about every step i was also quite happy to be thrown into the game without much prior knowledge and information so i remain quite vague here in the review just discover it for yourself would definitely recommend to play with friends uh and the music is also really really nice
