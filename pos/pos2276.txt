2020 i started playing this game in august 2020 because i ran out of other games to play freaking covid man i watched all the launch reviews and heard the horror stories of bugs and crashes so i never intended to play this but i m glad i gave it a chance so here s my most honest review i can give fallout 76 it s not perfect but it ll entertain you for at least 40 hours which is the metric by which i rate a game s worthiness a dollar per hour for a game is fair in my book at the time of this review i have over 300 hours logged because i fell down a rabbit hole with the base building aspects so i got more than my money s worth
