deckbuilding royaltyalthough its difficulty systems and build variety leave a little to be desired balatro s instant accessibility satisfying strategy and thrilling balance of risk and reward make for an instant deckbuilding classic the gameplay loopa typical run goes as follows after selecting one of 15 starter decks usually comprised of the standard 52 playing cards and a powerful unique modifier you ll take on your first poker blind combat rounds demanding an ever increasing quantity of chips for your seat at the table and your run s livelihood naturally you ll earn those chips by formulating straights flushes or any other traditional hands with the eight cards dealt at the start of each round and refreshed after each play a paltry high card will score a handful of chips but drill a royal flush out of nowhere and you ll be rolling in them you ve got several hands to tackle each blind with alongside a few handy discard and redraws giving back both some control as well as facilitating the brilliant and constant gamble underpinning every hand find yourself with three kings and you can either hedge your bets sending what you have for fewer chips and keeping your options open or go for broke committing your discards in the hope you ll finish that lucrative four of a kind potentially clearing the blind in a single shot and earning some extra cash for your trouble cash you can spend in the ever cycling shops between blinds on an array of beneficial items assorted booster packs increase the value of a specific hand add new cards to the deck or improve the ones you already have with all sorts of positive modifiers after stocking up on what you need and overcoming the boss appearing every three blinds complete with any one of a variety of vicious debuffs you ll up the ante raising the demands of subsequent blinds gamble up to and conquer the boss blind of ante 8 to achieve a well earned victory before carrying on into a sudden death style endless mode if you so choose strategy deckbuilding and the jokersassemble hands satisfy the blinds purchase what you need to keep doing so as simple as poker itself really but don t mistake that low buy in for an absence of depth your funds will provide interest should you hold off on spending for a few rounds and although you ll lose access to a potentially impactful shop and any money you could have earned from the encounter any non boss blind can be skipped for a hefty reward every decision carries some amount of risk yet not always a reward of equal measure and it s up to you to spot the difference capitalising on the smallest edges the slimmest margins and honing your judgement with each inevitable defeat it s easy to get caught up in the immediate ease of access but an hour will turn into six in the blink of an eye and you ll suddenly find yourself knee deep in a deceptively broad and mostly satisfying difficulty curve that always seems to have another ace up its sleeve however balatro is so much more than just helplessly trying to make the best of a bad situation and with the perfect combination of joker cards you can stack the deck ridiculously in your favour whether it be through simple flat chip increases and additive multipliers multipliers that multiply your multipliers and economic benefits that ultimately facilitate buying even more multipliers blowing the relatively lacklustre base rewards of most played hands into the stratosphere is their speciality and you ll quickly find they re your most important purchases to look out for in the shop you ve only got five slots for these guys by default though and that s where most of the strategy behind your build lies many jokers interact and synergise with each other for ludicrously potent outcomes however you re severely limited in how many you can wield at once and between what you have and what you can buy figuring out what s most beneficial for the next few blinds is all too often a tricky practicality argument with no clear solution yet although you re largely at the mercy of whatever the shop decides to offer you learning what works best together as you tag in and out progressively more optimal jokers for your strongest hands is a deeply rewarding and exciting process as your build slowly comes together i honestly can t remember the last time i was this delighted and cackled this hard at seeing big numbers get bigger a screenshot of balatro by heath one joker for example turns every scoring face card gold an enhanced type of card that grants some money if it s still in your hand at the end of a blind another intensifies that effect by forcing every card to be considered a face finally throw in the vampire a joker that gains a stacking multiplier per enhanced card played at the cost of removing the enhancement and you ve got one of the most hilariously overpowered trios you can find stacking your multiplier with literally every card played however these strategies come with their own set of risks too only one of that trio is actually empowering your hands and if you re struggling to find that all important vampire you re stuck with two economic jokers doing little more than making the upcoming blinds that much more difficult alternatively if you happen to sell those two and swap them out for a safer setup a few shops before you hit vampire well that s just heartbreaking higher difficulties build variety and overall longevityi called the difficulty curve satisfying earlier and although it is for a good while the peak of the curve is frankly an rng riddled nightmare with every winning run the successful deck will unlock a bigger and badder optional stake a stacking difficulty modifier up to a maximum of 8 think slay the spire s ascension system yet although you can reasonably expect a certain degree of unsalvagably bad luck from anything that invokes poker of all things these higher difficulties scale up ludicrously fast demand watertight builds you ll rarely hit and kill even the strongest of runs with a single bad draw damaging the experience s overall longevity for those craving a little more challenge after learning the basics the excellent bespoke challenges handily fill that gap but they re much more finite than a properly balanced hard mode would have been a screenshot of balatro by heath there s a lack of mid run adaptation too particularly in the hands you can realistically play around not only do you have to invest in improving the base rewards of any given hand you also have to tailor a deck around it if you think you can reliably hit a four of a kind with a standard 52 card deck you ve got another thing coming the result is the need to almost always skew your build around flushes pairs and the few other easy to land hands in the early game and spend the rest of the run taking upgrades and jokers that suit those hands by the time you re able to modify your deck enough to start drawing full houses regularly either the run s almost over or your other hands are so upgraded that it s not worth pivoting at all furthermore this limits your choice of jokers as many only trigger when you play a specific card or hand i wouldn t mind so much if i had more agency going into each run but what you build around isn t really for you to decide you have to play what you re given and if you re looking for any semblance of consistent success nine times out of ten you ll be playing solely around the lower scoring but more reliable lower half of the list of hands even more so on the higher difficulties of course you ll find a healthy amount of opportunities to consistently hit the upper echelon of hands but the stars truly have to align a screenshot of balatro by heath final thoughtsso my recommendation is definitely a little more reserved for those looking for their next slay the spire to dump thousands of hours into however for the rest of us balatro is an unbelievably polished addictive and satisfying roguelike deckbuilder i can t recommend enough standing tall even among its nigh insurmountable and esteemed contemporaries
