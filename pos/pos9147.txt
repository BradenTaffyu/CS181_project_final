2019 so my recent obsession with this game was enabled at least in part by my unemployment rip for the first week or two that i owned this i played it for at least 10 hours a day pretty much every day it was the most fun i had ever had with a game in a long time this game doesn t really feel like a true paradox game it s kind of like a mix between paradox games and civilization in space the key to success in this game is prioritizing expansion and research you need to expand quickly to avoid getting boxed in because playing tall isn t very strong you will use planets that are rich in resources to fuel your industry which you will build up on worlds that are poor in resources you also need to prioritize research because the faster you reach the late game technologies the better the ai does terribly in the late game so you want to get there faster than they do to press your advantage let s look at the pros first even though it didn t take long to understand the pattern exploration was really exciting for me for the first few games you are setting out into the vastness of space to colonize explore and expand your dominion the diplomacy and economy mechanics are good lots of micromanagement of the economy which i like there is a fair bit of rp potential in this game especially if you grab some mods although i have difficulty rp ing in strategy games like this because they feel very depersonalized to me compared to say ck2 now the cons the ai is terrible the war military side of things is quite lackluster at the moment and the game is terribly optimized there is a lot of late game lag also if you re coming from other paradox strategy games then you might find this one to be a tad bit on the easy side i wouldn t say that this game has the best replay value either personally the gameplay becomes too predictable once you get the hang of it that aside i d say that it s still worth buying it the game becomes better with mods for sure i would say that it s worth trying out i m not really interested in playing this much anymore but it was a lot of fun when the game was still fresh
