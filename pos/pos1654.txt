2021 a troubled pc port and it s been in my backlog for 3 years until today after finally finishing this game i can say it s hands down one of the best games i ve ever played it takes a little effort to get it working correctly but with the far mod and a few adjustments tweaks i can say the experience was more than worth itone of the best soundtracks i ve ever heard in any medium paired with great gameplay and an emotionally investing and absolutely wild and incredible story that fully sucks you in from beginning to end i ll be thinking about this game for a long timegive this game a shot if you love action games i absolutely adored it9 2 10
