2015 the best racing experience you will find anywhere one thing to note you get enough content when you purchase the subscription to race but you are limited you must purchase additional cars and tracks to race in them additional cars cost a one time fee of 11 95 additional tracks cost a one time fee of either 11 95 or 14 95 depending on the track if you buy 3 pieces of content cars or tracks at once you ll receive a discount of 10 if you buy 6 pieces of content at once you ll receive a discount of 20 if you own either every road or oval car plus any 25 tracks every new car or track you buy gets discounted at 25 if you own all the cars and tracks every new car or track you buy gets discounted at 30 this is a bit of a negative but it really does separate out the 10 year olds and the guys who really want to race not to mention the tracks and cars are laser scanned so you re getting the most accurate stuff out there the rookie series is a bit of a mess but once you advance out of that the racing gets much cleaner updates come 4 times a year approx every 13 weeks drivers that are reckless and intentionally wreck others can and will be banned anyone can be protested after a race and a 30 min cool down plenty more but i m trying to keep this short if your interested in a real racing experience look no further this is the place for you feel free to add me and ask questions if you like edit lots of ac fanboys i see fyi i own ac and pcars this is better then both but downvote away let me know when someone finally gives a proper negative review
