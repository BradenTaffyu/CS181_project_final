2014 i need to update this review how people gave it 79 user approval is astonishing this review was rather silly and inconsistent the fallout series tripped my trigger during my middle school years however i was really rude to this game before playing it and i slumped it with some awful generalization while i was young personally this game was one of those most fantastic games i have ever played it is full of what obsidian wanted and they deliver a much more fine tuned game compared to what bethesda released a few years before this the reason i like this game a lot more than 3 is the fact there is more involvement lots of things to do and it is overall an improvement on what fallout 3 had to offer having true iron sights more customization a more fluent battling mechanic sure the shooting mechanics are often bullcrap but really they are not so bad as the point it hinders my enjoyment of the game there is tons of lore and quite a few interesting questlines the game feels more massive than what it really is exploring is a lot more fun on this game because there is not a overwhelming feeling of emptiness that you get when you play fallout 3 and this game offers an overall great experience to those that liked the early fallout games but hated the turn based combat mechanism yes this game still isnt the most rpg of the fallout series but it is definitely better at being an rpg than the bethesda games the companions on this game are much more interesting and they have more involvement with the story as the end potrays your character feels like he has much more involvement in this game even if three of the endings might seem similar they each feel different what this game does wrong is the fact that unlike fallout 3 you cannot continue after the game ends but personally that is not something i argue about becuase there is mods that allow you to do so and thats really that do not get me wrong games like fallout 3 and fallout 4 are both good in their own intricate ways but fallout new vegas seems to combine everything i wanted in a fallout game what will turn you away from the pc release of this game is the constant crashing and the annoying bugs that sometimes come about in this version of the game installing mods is quite effective but even with tons of crash fixes i still crash every now and then and it angers me to the core the pc version is not very stable compared to lets say the xbox 360 version but i still very much enjoy playing it so if you want a game with decent combat fluent story and an immersive experience i can easily recommend this game to you if you want lots of mods and a dedicated playerbase this game is for you however if you get angry with games that crash a lot and are full of tons of bugs you might not want this game yet i will still heavily recommend you at least try it to me those bugs and crashes are worth it
