early access review i cannot even begin to tell you how much i love this game i am amazed at how it s already so polished especially whilst being so early in it s early access and that makes me feel all the more eager for the finished product i love the all of the characters so much especially juniper i am in awe of how much personality radiates from each of the character design and dialogue it s so charming on another note i am unsure how they could possibly improve upon the amount of inclusivity embedded in the game the pronoun options the use of pride flags the hijab it s all so amazing to see i am already so thankful that i purchased the game i cannot wait for more to come
