2017 generally speaking i wouldn t bother writing a review however the current reviews for this game do not really reflect its quality and i felt compelled common complaints include overpriced dlc a matter of perspective but a i disagree and feel the dlc is generally fair if slightly more expensive than it needs to be and b not indicative of the quality of the game as none of it is necessary to have a complete gaming experience this is a game where you should play the base game and buy dlc to extend your time with the game if you ve enjoyed it up until then also buy the dlc on sale if you feel it is too expensive as none of it is necessary to enjoy the game day 1 dlc a policy ca has since admitted was a mistake though i would encourage any readers here to do some research into why this policy exists it makes more sense than viewing this from strictly the consumer s point of view and various complaints about the mechanics generally from veterans of the series most of this will be a matter of preference which is why i think that the fact that this game has a very involved and growing modding community will address these concerns most completely for those concerned about the incompetent ai not that any strategy game has a competent ai if you think the total war ai is stupid you must also give negative reviews to every civ game paradox game etc there are mods that cause it to create very effective and interesting armies to fight against and the battle ai is the best it has ever been in my opinion difficulty can also be modified heavily in game with the 5 difficulty settings and through mods which make the campaign ai smarter and or stronger anyone who has played dozens or hundreds of hours of a strategy game will have a laundry list of complaints and everyone wants games to be cheaper even though they re far cheaper than they used to be this game isn t perfect but it does an excellent job capturing the warhammer fantasy universe and provides a great deal of replayability with a satisfying core gameplay loop the muliplayer isn t half bad either although it certainly isn t for everyone
