2023 recommended with caveats the unfortunate reality is that company of heroes 3 is not in a finished state it s a large ambitious game four starting factions two campaigns including a vast dynamic italian campaign in an entirely new style for relic battlegroups that bring international allies to the core factions and overall more abilities units effects and interactions than any launch product in series history the cost of that ambition is a launch with unfinished assets bugs balance issues and design flaws i recommend the game because you can pick it up and have fun today since launch i ve been playing the campaigns skirmish and multiplayer and having a blast this is an intricate nail biting strategy game that can turn on a dime it can be a laugh riot in a group or a brain burning duel in 1v1 if you re willing to play a game as it finds its footing you ll find a very entertaining rts here right now if you d prefer a more stable polished release check back in a few months
