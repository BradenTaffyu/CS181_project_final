2016 perhaps the greatest space exploration game there isauthor s note upon reaching 100 hours in this game i decided to write a lengthy review recently however i reached another milestone in the form of 400 hours as such i felt that the time was ripe to write a new better review i was born on the exact same day as the mars polar lander was to touch down on the south pole of mars this nasa probe was going to broaden our knowledge of the red planet not unlike countless other probes that had already visited but this was regrettably not to be prior to landing an error caused the craft to crash into the martian surface at a high speed errors like this are common in kerbal space program as well we all know how it is you ve sent a lander type probe or capsule through the kerbol system and at last the target is right below you be it the mun duna or any other solid object at some point you discover that there s not enough juice or not enough electricity to keep the baby under control or that there is enough fuel but only for a landing which is fine if it s an unmanned probe but good luck if you have three unlucky kerbals on board it s a good thing they cannot die of thirst hunger exhaustion or boredom the interesting thing about ksp however is that these errors do not matter you might have an impressive explosion on the launch pad a complete failure while trying to leave the atmosphere or a more annoying error like the fact that your fancy satellite doesn t have enough batteries or that you forgot to bring science instruments but guess what this game encourages you to try again if you fail in this game it will not shove you into a ditch and laugh rather it will help you back up and tell you what went wrong in kerbal space program it is quite simple to spot errors by experiencing them and then it is equally simple to fix that error with a small upgrade say an improved booster or some extra batteries eventually new problems will appear and you fix those too and through this trial and error you get the perfect rocket at last this is where the game suddenly becomes truly magnificent for quite a lot of time i didn t have any idea how to get my crafts into orbit so i created a proper rocket tried to figure out what went wrong the last times modified the rocket accordingly and then gave it a shot minutes later a satellite is safely in orbit around kerbin telling me interesting things about the atmosphere and cheerily transmitting signals down to the surface obviously i got a massive confidence boost because of this you can probably guess what happened next i put together a saturn v ish rocket and tried to send some un lucky kerbals to the mun it didn t go as planned to say the least they all ended up burned or exploded mostly the latter so guess what i did i went back to the drawing board created a better rocket took it through extensive testing and then the day came it was my own july 1969 jebediah and bill were now neil and buzz and guess what the kerbin flag was planted firmly on the mun and my brave little kerbonauts returned as heroes becoming the public favorite for a future mission to duna but that s another story moving on from stories of trial error success and joy it s time to look at what the game has to offer as you ve probably guessed by now it s about building rockets and sending them into space the wide range of parts physics planets and celestial objects allows you to create your own little nasa probes space stations capsules landers rovers and airplanes are all possible to design and cr fly as you please why the kerbal in the name well this game takes place in a fictional planetary system with smaller planets moons and distances the sun is named kerbol and orbiting it is moho basically mercury eve basically venus kerbin basically earth with humans being replaced by green skinned adorable kerbals duna basically mars yeah you get the idea the game has lots of planets and moons to visit most of which are fully explorable the game modes you got three different modes suited for different playstyles sandbox is simple no progress credits or reputation we ll get back to that but every rocket part and all upgrades available at no cost if you enjoy building whatever you want with no consequences sandbox is fitting next out is science it works similarly to sandbox but with another interesting factor you have to research and unlock new rocket parts by doing science science can be anything from taking a ground sample outside of your local space centre or landing a rover on a distant planet to do geological surveys the more interesting the more science the final mode is career in this mode it s money earning time you start off as a small space agency with sheds instead of hangars and no capability to reach space whatsoever so what do you do there are three things that you need to focus on first of all science we ve already gone through that second money this is self explanatory earn money buy rocket parts build bigger and more expensive rockets and upgrade your facilities but how to earn money this is where reputation comes in to put it simple you earn reputation by doing cool stuff and not messing it up take a tourist into space land a probe somewhere et cetera if you do mess up you lose reputation here s the fun part higher reputation means better contracts there are plenty of corporations that are willing to give you some money if you can satisfy their demands complete a contract and get more reputation science and money fail a contract yes you guessed correctly now let s move back to space exploration let s say that you ve done all your preparations signed the necessary contracts and launched some nice stuff into space you got some satellites here and there and even some kerbals screaming for help at the munar surface let s pretend you have a rescue ship underway now what well there s mods this is one of the many areas where kerbal space program really shines mods the game has an active engaged modding community and you can find a mod for just about everything there s a mod that allows you to place a wall near your space center and have those pesky kerxicans pay for it seriously there is but i m not here to talk about that mods available include but are not limited to part sets with massive fuel tanks engines and more intricate advanced space capsules for all your exploration needs plugins that allow you to time your maneuvers get better at docking or put things on autopilot visual mods that give you enhanced skyboxes and magnificent atmospheres whole new planets altogether that expand your frontiers greatly and more i could probably talk for hours about the various mods that are available but i won t i ll just say that most of them are amazing if you re buying this game make sure to grab a few mods if you already have it but don t use mods why if you have mods get some more mods mod it till it breaks as some people would say there are plenty of things that i have omitted from this review mostly because i want to end things here i could probably talk about the magnificence of docking the beauty of well placed orbital maneuvers or other things that could make a nasa engineer smile gleefully for now though i ll advise you to place yourself firmly into the capsule and go into space to summarize kerbal space program is an excellent space game that provides great experiences combined with interesting gameplay and great mods all while being a highly successfultake on sandbox exploration and simulation alike i can absolutely recommend it
