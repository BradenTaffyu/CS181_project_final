2018 early access review you start on small few blocks raft while below the shark is waiting for you to snap your arms and legs off i must say shark was really annyoing me off each time i went to explore into islands below and not to mention how many times he destroyed blocks in raft like a lot the first thing you see on sea are plastic planks barrels palm leafs use ur hook to get them faster but beware you got limit on all used items hook axe bow and once that limit is out you will need to make one again once you had a long adventure through sea you will start to see islands from small to big ones hah thats what she said lul small build boats with a crate on to get now if you want a lot of grind park the raft at island and get as many resources you can bonus hint if you can get antennas and computer working with a battery you will find a secret base which reveals a bit of the story of the game beware about plant farming the seaguls will try to eat your plants so try place scarecrow near plants as for hunger and thirst these two are going down insanely fast on easy mode which feels like hard survival the forest as an example i cant imagine on extreme mode or hard mode on raft but ill test it out soon as well singleplayer feels lonely if im honest but is more fun with a co op friend or more friends because you can build and get resources faster and learn faster too me and my friend at beginning of the game didnt knew what to do but pick up stuff from ocean but as time went on we started to figure all out what to get and where to get the resources for specific item and after long hours of grinding and exploring we got a huge house raft built with a great farming system and my god it is fun dthe game is ea early access so expect bugs too ill name few here sleep dying bug while your thirst and hunger and health are near zero and if you lay or sleep in bed and when you die when your co op friend picks you up and puts you in the bed and then you wake up you cant move mouse around with your character which you will have to restart the game again to fix it again this happended to me many times definitly needs a fix shark no clip bug speaking of shark i hate him so much xd its just unreal so yea if your near the island and your exploring well the shark is gonna attack you from no clipping through island into your face and rip it off the shark is cheating pls nerf it definitly needs a fix as well i expect the game to be fixed and progress as well im excited for new content from devs keep it up what can i say its an awesome game and i recommend it if you like sailing through the sea like a pirate cheers
