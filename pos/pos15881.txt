2022 early access review i admit it sounds like a boring game on the surface it s not challenging in the slightest but makes me feel super relaxed whenever i play it if you enjoy sitting down with a sheet of bubble wrap and popping every single bubble one at a time you ll love this game perfect game to play after you pop on some youtube lofi and spark something up
