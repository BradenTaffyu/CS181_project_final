2023 i love this game but it s missing a lot of simple but game changing features one being co op i would 100 keep coming back to this game if i could fully smash down and reno a house with friends you re very limited with what you can do with a bought house which i think is a massive downfall over all i would give the game a 8 10 it s the sort of game you play for hours for one day forget about it for like a year come back to a half decorated house and remember why you exited in the first place
