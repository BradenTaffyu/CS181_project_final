2015 early access review best zombie survival game available if you havent played it its like never having tried sex drugs or rock n roll you ll be telling your friends omg its amazing dayz is great for the first two weeks close up experience 7d2d is great for the building fun and zombie killing action project zomboid however is the best at giving you a simulation that captures the real fear the melancholy and the grim seriousness of being a survivor in a zombie apocalypse the level of detail depth and design of the game is sheer brilliance and the development team is a case study of how to do things right you cant say enough great about them many different settings to tailor the game to your own taste fast or slow zombies strong or weak is a bite something that just needs a bandage or should you start making funeral arrangements aka drunken bleach fueled suicide run going down guns blazing you decide
