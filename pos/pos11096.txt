2021 first i would like to say i love jurassic park while other kids where playing with light sabers i was playing with dinosaurs this is my thing i was so pumped but after playing for a couple days i was pretty let down but we need more dinosaur games so i won t give a thumbs down but i ll list what i ve found annoying the game s graphics are of course awesome the ai for npc s and dino s is great nothing has gotten stuck or glitched voice clips are great and easy to follow but if you want a game where you can decorate your park have a relaxed progression or do not wish to micro manage leave now you do not get everything in sandbox unless you unlock it through challenges and you will have to micro manage most everything i ll try not to waste time and keep it to complaints i think would be helpful it s obvious that the creators tried to lengthen the play time by forcing you to micro manage things but it s done to an extreme that isn t fun i don t mind waiting on things but the speed up button will become your best friend i love watching my dino s but at the same time there s to much to do for me to sit around smelling the roses so i miss out on watching my creatures and instead just see them all zip around unnaturally fast just so i can collect fossils after the first jurassic world game we asked for decorations and this time around we did get a couple all the decorations are tiny and look alike there are only about 20 to choose from mostly the same flag a different color their barely worth using unless you want the exact same thing everywhere enclosures are kinda the same you get a brush that adds trees shrubs and water but you can t actually choose where anything but rocks and water go the paint brush circle thing is also much to big even on it s smallest setting not much wiggle room for creativity and that s one of my favorite parts money is also a huge issue in challenge modes i ve never had much trouble in the past amassing money in games like this but they actively keep you on your toes it s an interesting thing i don t hate the idea but i went from making millions a minute to being so far in the red that after 8 hours of play it force quite the challenge telling me i failed i had near zero time to try and sell repair or just process what happened this happens way way waaaay to much one storm late game could ruin your entire run through for no real reason there is no challenge when things are out of your control and it auto fails you quickly scientists again i don t mind the idea behind it and i wouldn t mind fiddling with their skill points more but it s just not all that fun to deal with them the starting 3 you get aren t usually all that great but to get more you must research which is fine till you realize you re forced to waste your new points on your less then good scientists or fire one and hope for a better replacement you do not get a lot of ways to increase their skills if you want anything in the game or need to finish an objective quickly for challenge mode you better hope they have enough points or you just have to sit there waiting fail or start over most can also only do a few tasks before they need to take an expensive work free rest too not a huge problem as i m sure it s fun for some people to figure out the best way to use them but kinda annoying enough to mention
