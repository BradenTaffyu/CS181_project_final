2017 i bought this game with a certain degree of skepticism hearing the hype from my limited circle althought the hype isn t that high just a tad warm i approach the game expecting some kind of tame nostalgia over a mediocre genre kitsch i couldn t be more wrong to begin with and in all fairness this game is indeed a genre kitsch heavily reminiscing the old days of harvest moon yet this game does it extraordinarily well so well that it exceeds its kitsch ness aspect delivering a solid and charming experience this is the case where copying a nostalgic feels didn t resort into nostalgia bait but it somewhat surpasses what it copies turning itself into something new harvest moon genre is still a classic for me and stardew valley manages to simulate that classics and turn it into something so well i bought this game at full price in skepticism now after all the tine i spent and taking a break from playing for months i feel like the price does did justice the overall quality sure doesn t warrant any high budgeted game but its charm are what makes this game worthy of praise i haven t even mention the fact that concernedape did this on his own gameplay wise i love the control the progression the learning curve and the rewards it all feels balanced and fair though after getting the gist of it the game turns easy it still rewards me the player by its sandobx y elements when you re rich and capable then you re privileged to challenge yourself challenge yourself to tidy up your farm that s what fantastic about the gaming experience first you begin with nothing learning all the way to warrant that privilege and eventually you became master of everything all that s left is to challenge yourself through that process of learning you re given a set of goals and charming characters that you re ended cared so much by the time you ve became that master in my three playthrough i ended up following the same pattern and i d say that s a rewarding and satisfying experience in itself though to be fair i d like to nitpick a bit and this might be hugely subjective that i found from personal playthrough events and dialogue branch i m not talking about the joja community cebter branch but the character branch this game offers a great setting to roleplay but the lack of recognition to the pc profile kinda disturbs the immersion of roleplaying for me to put it frank playing a gay character and a straight character offers little to no difference in dialogue and that s a bit of nitpicking from my side i m not planning to writw an in depth review i m just rambling over these ideas about stardew valley i ve been thinking to write this ever since i got so hooked to the game but always refraining to do so now i decided to ramble a bit to fulfill the community badge goal i feel like i ve layed off a bit of burden i might want to revisit this comment some day just like i want to revisit this game and be charmed again also i m aware of the impending multiplayer patch looking forward to it and hoping that the patch would bring an entirely new experience of playing an already splendid homage of a game
