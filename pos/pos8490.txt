2021 i posted a review yesterday but if you re like me you ll love it i m 65 can t hunt anymore due to a bad knee back but in this game i can be a kid again with the dlc s you can hunt on any reserve you own you can climb moutains use tree stands learn to tell if a track was made by a mule deer buck or a doe drive an atv get to hunt all over the world but always watch your six you can be attacked and killed while looking through your binoculars or scope i can t count how many times i ve been run over by a water buffalo or bull moose or torn to shreds by a grizzly bear timber wolf european wolf warthog or lion if u can t get to your first aid kit in time you re dead there are hunting structures you can buy for between 1 700 2 100 throughout the reserves sometimes there aren t any suitable trees available i suggest you buy one if you can t afford a treestand they cost 10 000 as stated before this isn t a run gun game you must use all your knowlage stealth calls cunning to bag your trophy you have the option to purchase a throphy lodge taxidermatize or just harvest it if you wan t to play a very realistic simulation game then like me you ll love it too caution once u start playing u become the character hours fly by before you know it you ve played for 6 hours straight very adictive but i love it make sure you get a clean kill or you ll spend the next hour tracking the blood trail unless u have a bloodhound for all the money i ve spent on this game all the dlc s i rate this game 10 stars p s this game gives u the most bang for the buck well worth it
