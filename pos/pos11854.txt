2021 a great example of a roguelike game lots of weapons and skills unique metroidvania like design and highly replayable all of this with beautiful pixel art and a great ost the devteam is in great sync with the community taking feedback in consideration and every time i come back to it there is a significant upgrade playing since early access cannot recommend it enough
