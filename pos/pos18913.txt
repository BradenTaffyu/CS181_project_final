2017 sure it crashes sure it s buggy sure the end game is rushed but by god everytime i want to experience a real rpg game and get myself really immersed in something i will always come back to this even with its petty 18 months dev time with an outdated engine it is still a better game than fallout 4 i cannot recommend this enough
