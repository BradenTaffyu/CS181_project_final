2015 69 hours and on i haven t gotten far in the story line with all the miraculous things you can do there s not enough time to do all of them let alone time for the main quest content wise so far i am very satisfied the combat gameplay is done nicely much like its predecessors but with less pathing glitches npc rarely gets stuck in the game even with the newly introduced base building system they don t trap themselves unless you build a deathtrap on purpose npcs even your comapnions will take cover during combat its a nice touch the new crafting system brings another good thing on the table your first weapon won t be just another junk waiting for you to toss away or sell it do some wastelander on the road you are able to modify weapons and enhance it to match higher level threats in your game within all these hours of playing time i have yet to experience a crash or any form of bugs i ve alt tabbed countless times minimized load up another game in the background nothing seems to stop this beast from running smoothly stability its an important aspect for all games i m glad to see fallout 4 s performance to be in top shape great job programmers the graphics it looks nice now the downsides with the new dialogue choice wheel the role playing element suffered a great deal some wheel options i selected was not what i had in mind for my character to say or do other times i don t see an option that d suit my character s ideal of handling the situation sometimes the options are really the same just another way to say yes or no in terms of voiced main character it does bring a problem into this player s character won t match the voice they had in mind seeing how there s only one voice option for your character although this does not bother me much since i enjoy having a voiced character beats standing still and listen to every single npc blabber on about things without any input as of all modern video games dlcs or the stripped contents there aren t that many weapons to choose from but thanks to weapon modifications its not a major issue they ll be in the dlcs weapon seletion will remain incomplete until they are released
