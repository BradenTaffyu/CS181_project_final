2021 honestly i m not a huge paradox fan in fact i rather despise them for their greed and just uninteresting games but the eight hours of stellaris i have currently played i have massively enjoyed if you enjoy space even in the slightest which i can t really say i do or just want to have a good time with friends on multiplayer this game is for you genuinely a lot of fun it took me like five minutes to learn the basic mechanics and i was already a prospering empire definitely pick this game up when it s on sale the graphics in this game are top notch however as per usual some things are locked behind paid dlc which is typical for paradox so just be aware of that however you honestly don t really need the dlc to enjoy the game
