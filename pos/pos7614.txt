2022 let s be real this is a reskin of two point hospital with a college theme instead of a medical theme i m not saying that s a bad thing i m just saying temper your expectations if what you want is more two point this is a fun and interesting expansion of the concept if what you are looking for is a revolution with all new mechanics and a whole new paradigm you ll be setting yourself up for disappointment there s some small quality of life changes like being able to alter the building shapes a little you can decorate outside not just inside and it s even more laid back than tph with a fairly fixed schedule of classes instead of the emergency pacing that hospital attempted but you re basically comparing two kinds of apple not an entirely new kind of fruit if you re new to the series get whichever theme suits your mood first if you re a veteran you ll slip right back into your room building habits be aware however that at launch your decorations are fairly limited just like hospital was if you haven t exhausted hospital you might want to stick with it for a bit longer the expansions and updates have added far more room decorations than what campus currently has at launch regardless this is just as fun as two point hospital was but with an all new spin on humorous classes for your students to take instead of patients to save the radio dj and announcers all return with the same style and a few new jokes the music is a few new tracks and the only knock is that currently you can t add your own custom music but it might be something they add later like tph has you can expect the next year or two to include numerous dlc releases with more decorations so if you would rather wait and buy them in a bundle i wouldn t hold it against you the game will only continue to improve as they have a history of supporting their games post launch with updates i personally didn t buy into two point hospital until it was discounted and it was a much better value to wait two point hospital reviewbut then again i enjoyed it enough to buy into campus at launch with no regrets i m only an hour into this and i expect i ll get a couple hundred hours out of it edit 12 hours later launch day bugs have been minimal for me and nothing game breaking what few bugs i ve seen posted from other people that didn t effect me are getting active responses from developers so overall a fairly reasonable launch imo bottom line two point as a franchise is a very casual management sim with a humorous spin and a laid back style while you are here would you consider following my curator page want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones
