2022 maybe i m late playing this game but this is one of the best stories i have ever seen in a game it drags you in for every twist and turn the voice acting is out of this world you can feel the emotion as kratos grows as a person and as a father throughout the game on the gameplay side the combat is brilliantly designed to not become boring and is easily tailored to your preference one of the very best gaming experiences i have had in a long time
