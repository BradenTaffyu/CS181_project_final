2019 as a new vegas fanboy as indicated by my profile picture this game is difficult to review on the one hand the dialog system quest variety moral dilemmas and perk skill system are severely dumbed down on the other hand holy crap is this game fun weapon customization power armor shooting things and explosions the combat is insane and if you re the creative type you ll probably enjoy crafting and settlement building in short fans of the original fallout games may be somewhat disappointed but if say you re a borderlands fan or heck even a minecraft fan you will love this
