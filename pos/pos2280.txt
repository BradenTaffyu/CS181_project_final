2020 updated ahh fallout 76 the game that launched to the most negative reviews i think i ve ever seen admitably it was extremelly broken and glitchy empty nothing to do no end game well i m happy to say that s definitely not the case now 6 years later this game is definitely worthy of the name fallout plenty of quests npcs story the building is absoltely addicting and in my case i fell for the money trap and spent a looot playing this game with friends is a absolute joy though i will say i m not a fan of the private instances where some quests won t progress for your friend only the team leader and you can only get like 15 caps while your firend might get some plans or legendary loot other than that the game is a absolute joy to play now and i can t reccomend it enough to anyone wanting to come in lots of fallout quests and things to do now definitely a loooooot of grinding and stuff like that but its multiplayer fallout lol
