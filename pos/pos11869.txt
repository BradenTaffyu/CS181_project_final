2017 early access review combat and movement is very fluid the game feels good to run jump and fight monsters are unique require different strategies to combat so you can t just cheese your way through the game or use exactly one strategy game has some nice mechanics to force a different play style for example there are timed doors that reward you for not being super cautious or explore every pixel of every level there are challenge rooms that require you to be quick but also thourough downsides after beating the first two bosses only two in the game as of now it doesn t seem worth playing much more the upgrades unlocks i don t have will require me to grind for hours with not much gain overall this game is very good i will play more as they add content hopefully they figure out how to make sure there is more to do to make upgrading unlocking the weapons worth my time
