2023 as a longtime coh 2 player and someone who dabbled quite a bit with vcoh i ll try and give a balanced take on this game tldr at the bottom for starters the game is very well optimized keep in mind i have an intel i9 32gb of ram and an nvidia 1060ti gpu it runs more smoothly than coh 2 i m getting frames well above 100 and it s such a non issue i haven t been tracking fps beyond that the loading times are also much faster across the board there are some odd things in the game that cause fps issues like tilting the camera or some artillery strikes though these affected me too much graphically i think the game looks good i don t like all of the lighting color decisions but it s not a bad looking game by any means the one place they did drop the ball though is the explosions with some of the rocket strikes or mortar impacts looking very weak graphically sound design is another issue with a lot of the sounds leaving you unsatisfied or questioning what it is you re hearing the m1 carbine used by the pathfinder unit sounds like a pop gun is barely audible for example sniper rifles sound good though as do most of the voice lines in the game the voice acting has references to the older games and is not half bad i haven t found a unit with lines that outdoes the conscript in coh 2 or rifleman in vcoh for myself yet but they did good here for multiplayer as of writing this review there is no ranked mode only unranked the gameplay is fun and varied with four factions to choose from and a ton of tactical options through the factions and commander choices the game is a bit barebones when it comes to maps with 14 multiplayer maps total across 1v1 4v4 for online and skirmish play there is also no ranked matchmaking currently only unranked so no tracking your progress up the leaderboards or anything like that balance wise it s impossible to comment currently as i ve yet to face opponents that didn t seem new to the game though it seems like little has changed from the multiplayer beta for those who played that the build variety is amazing and i look forward to seeing what the meta ends up being and the different ways people will try and offset it the game is alive and well in terms of finding the optimal strategy though without a ranked matchmaking system yet it s a bit disappointing this should be added soon though onto the singleplayer which has two campaigns one campaign is linear where you play as the germans in africa and the other is non linear where you play as the allies in italy the linear campaign is similar to the coh 2 and vcoh s campaigns while the non linear dynamic campaign is like ardennes assault from coh 2 or the total war series for those familiar with that i started with the german campaign which took me 4 hours to beat on the second hardest difficulty setting while watching all the briefings and cutscenes there were some challenging moments and i ll retry it on the hardest setting eventually but it was disappointing in length and frankly wasn t too difficult for the italian campaign it s got a lot more meat and will be where people spend most of their time in singleplayer so i ll go into more detail when getting through the tutorials you re finally given a choice between a starting company this choice reflects the units and abilities you ll have in tactical battles the choice is a bit redundant though as you can acquire additional companies which include the starting options you had as far as companies go so far i ve seen two british companies and three american ones to choose between if this is all there is then that is a bit disappointing as well you re mainly picking a company to start leveling up quickly at the start which can be an important part of your strategy such as attempting to use your experienced company as much as possible to strengthen it and weaker companies in a more supportive role the level up system is pretty good with lot of passive buffs but also active choices in terms of where you put your points going for the passives or instead unlocking new units or call in strikes for more tactical options the campaign itself is okay so far with companies getting into tactical battles when coming into contact with important towns or other companies every tactical battle takes place in as an rts with traditional company of heroes gameplay unless autoresolved by the player the two types of tactical battles are skirmishes and missions skirmishes i ve found way too easy generally they are fun for a while as the objectives are varied and side objectives are thrown in though i ve already seen these side objectives more than once halfway through a campaign the skirmishes do seem to depend on what is happening on the strategy side sometimes like if your company is low on strength and being attacked you have to defend your position other times your goal is to capture three points outside the enemy base and hold them sometimes it s as simple as draining the opponent of victory points like a traditional 250 point match the problem with skirmishes for me is that they can be cheesed fairly easily hopefully relic will do something to make this harder to do but one example is the objective to capture three points outside the enemy base i take my starting units and ignore capturing the map to blitzkrieg towards those three points i also call in a light vehicle immediately to help my infantry do that with one or two light vehicles and strong infantry it s easy to defeat the ai very quickly and most battles play out similarly with these cheesy rush strategies i don t mind them but on the hardest difficulty i was hoping for more of a challenge the missions are much better than the skirmishes being similar to scripted missions in ardennes assault your objectives will depend on the mission and are varied the difficulty on these is much higher than skirmishes and i ve even had to replay a few of these due to losing the balance seems to be a bit all over the place between skirmishes and missions i ve had fun with the campaign but it has issues i find it focuses too much on emplacements and other systems that make it harder to get into tactical battles the ai doesn t seem very strong with enemy companies ignoring undefended towns to try and fight one of my companies or to run away and defend their own areas i currently only have two companies and a swathe of undefended land which the ai hasn t retaken the campaign also isn t this large dynamic campaign right from the start you have to take certain objectives to unlock parts of the map and it seems like the map is slowly unlocked more and more the further into it you get this is good for preventing people from getting overwhelmed but limits the replayability and dynamic side of things if people could choose to land and start the campaign from any point with the whole map unlocked things would be much more interesting than what is there now so i ll leave two tldrs summaries below and a quick outlook on the game and it s future multiplayer tldr 4 factions and 14 maps total on release a lot of build variety available and the game is well optimized so performance shouldn t impact your multiplayer games singleplayer tldr 1 long dynamic campaign and 1 very very short linear campaign if new to rts these campaigns are a great way to learn though experienced coh players should definitely turn up the difficulty to the highest settings especially for the linear campaign final thoughts i d cautiously recommend this game i think in a month or two the game will be looking great with community maps and more content in the game itself for right now if you want a fun rts to play this isn t a bad choice at all and as far as coh releases go this game is already looking real good
