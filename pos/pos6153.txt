2020 smh i can t believe i had to buy the base game again this is a pretty poor migration to steam the dlc s are ridiculously expensive but at the end of the day as a long time sims fan i still enjoy the game enough to give it a positive review edit my major issue with this steam port is they didn t add steam achievements for the game if they did i d be inclined to buy the dlc s so i can get all the achievement like the brainwashed ea slave i am
