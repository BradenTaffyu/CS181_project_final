cities skylines 2 has had a bit of a rocky start and i believe it s due in part because of paradox probably pushing to get cs2 out earlier than it ought to have and co being the victim of its success with cs1 that it s set expectation way into the stratosphere that being said with the release of the economy 2 0 and the now additional assets just released i would say if you ve been on the fence about getting cs2 then i think now is a good time to get into it co have been working hard on getting optimising the performance they have listened to the community and have retracted the beach property dlc and incorparated them into the main vanilla game instead they have reworked the economy which is a welcome change and actually makes the game a challenge and fun to play the newly released assets are fantastic additions that now allow me to build smaller communities and cul de sacs the game still has more promise when co release a working version of an asset editor this game will explode with potential there s already some fantastic modders and content creators who are able to make truly stunning cities if you re happy to mod your game and are into high level detail then i advise you check out sully s youtube video on detailing snowdonia it is utterly breathtaking this is what i wanted from cs2 and im glad we have it i m not one of these people who set unrealisticly high expectations i knew full well that any base version of second game will be a rough diamond much like cs1 was when it released cs1 very much enjoy this game
