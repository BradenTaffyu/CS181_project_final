2023 8 10first review i have ever posted 80 of all the time i spend gaming is the the turn based rpg strategy genre praise progression is fantastic ng mechanics are amazing i m somewhere in my 3rd play through i spend more time in the camp menu than i do in the stages squad strategy micros affect the game heavily and you are punished for not understanding or utilizing it properly this allows room for growth and a depth of game play not common in the genre right now coming from fire emblem since i was a kid sow brings back that nostalgic feel except the customization in this game is 10x better good freakin job room for improvement i had to source a lot of information from youtube combined with in game tutorials and even the dev s own youtube streams to fully understand all the mechanics as well as i wanted to master the system in game guidance could use some improvement especially for people unfamiliar with trpgs like this taking my party members for certain portions of the game with the gear they had on etc feels bad enemy turns take way to long especially later in the game probably my biggest complaint overall for the devs what i would like to see if you make new games dlc is more variation in traits on characters for more variation in maxed characters a little bit smoother quicker ui in battle maps a little more customization for the main character s class would be a nice touch but overall keep doing what you re doing this a gem of a game and i would buy dlc additional games as soon as they dropped thank you for this classic
