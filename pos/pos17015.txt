2017 total war warhammer 2 is the latest game in the epic grand strategy franchise set in the fantasy version of the warhammer universe the player can choose to play as one of four races high elves dark elves lizardmen and skaven giant rats as they battle over control of a magical vortex the vortex is basically a barrier preventing the forces of chaos from invading the world some factions are trying to save the world while others want to cause the end times as is usual for total war gameplay is divided into two major sections the turn based campaign map is where you focus on the big picture empire wide tasks train armies move them around the map capture and defend settlements research technologies construct buildings to improve your economy and public happiness forge trade agreements and military alliances with other factions then fight large scale battles involving thousands of soldiers in real time and by soldiers i m not just talking about your standard swordsmen spearmen archers and cavalry the fantasy setting provides a wide variety of unusual creatures including giant eagles phoenixes dragons hydras rat ogres hell pit abominations and many more this is the fourth total war game i ve played after shogun 2 rome 2 and the original warhammer after spending almost 50 hours playing through the high elf campaign i can confidently say that tww2 is easily the best version building on what was good about the previous games and improving in several ways the most obvious improvement is how the vortex affects the campaign i was never really comfortable with the victory conditions in any of those previous total war games they usually required you to control a certain number of settlements and sometimes eliminate a specific faction i often felt like i ended up going to war with factions that i didn t really consider to be my enemy just to expand far enough to satisfy the victory conditions in order to gain control of the vortex and win the campaign the four main races need to collect resources to perform five rituals each controlled settlement provides a small amount of resources but some settlements in specific locations provide a larger amount this means you don t necessarily need to have the biggest empire to win each ritual takes place in three of your settlements simultaneously and you ll have to defend them for ten turns until the ritual completes starting a ritual will allow some chaos armies to pass through the vortex with the intention of destroying ritual sites and the four races can always see each other s ritual progress so this naturally triggers conflict between them especially in the later stages in my high elves campaign things were looking good at the halfway stage as i was first to complete the third ritual i was intending to stay defensive for the rest of the campaign but after a while i noticed the dark elves had pulled in front after a period of aggressive expansion this forced me to start an invasion of their lands to slow them down the lizardmen had the same idea as me so the dark elves got pushed back quite far at one point i thought that the skaven were going to sneak a win while everyone else was fighting each other then one of my allies destroyed a skaven ritual site giving me a clear run to victory it really felt like every faction was involved in an epic world war the world map is quite varied from the frozen wastes of the north to the elves mountainous island to the tropical jungles and deserts in the south there are many minor races scattered around including vampires dwarves bretonians greenskins and wood elves any race can now claim any settlement the previous game had some annoying restrictions but will suffer penalties to growth economy and army replenishment if the climate isn t desirable you re also encouraged to explore the seas as you can often find shipwrecks containing treasure which could include extra gold weapons armour to equip on your generals and temporary buffs for your soldiers in combat the ai was good in the previous game but another improvement in tww2 is that the ai will attack the player more often on the battlefield instead of always just sitting back and waiting for you to come at them each faction can also spend gold to perform rites different to rituals which give temporary factionwide buffs for example the high elves have a rite which makes armies immune to attrition soldiers dying while travelling through bad weather conditions which is perfect when attacking enemy settlements in harsh corrupted environments each of the main races has a unique mechanic which makes their playing style different to the others the high elves are the only one that i can talk about as i haven t played as the other races yet they get bonuses to diplomacy through a political intrigue system periodically you ll encounter multiple choice scenarios and your decisions will result in gaining or losing influence as well as other temporary factionwide effects influence can then be spent to improve your relationship with another faction or to damage the relationship between two of your enemies in the early part of my campaign i was frequently being attacked by two minor factions the skaeling and the pirates of sartosa using influence i was able to make peace with sartosa convince them to declare war on the skaeling and then i made an alliance with sartosa and pushed the skaeling back completely wiping them out my only complaints with this mechanic is that there aren t many different scenarios so i encountered frequent repeats and they often referred to the leaders of other elven factions that had long since been eliminated total war warhammer 2 is an absolute masterpiece and i ve loved every minute of it its going to get my vote for best game of 2017 if you re a fan of total war or strategy games in general warhammer 2 is an essential purchase considering the length of the campaign and the variety of playable factions you won t regret a full price purchase
