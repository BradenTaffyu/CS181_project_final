2020 one of paradox interactive main titles highly recomended sadly as with other paradox games you ll need to stack up on dlc but i guess that beats a subscription model and hoi iv as most paradox titles has constant updates i appreciate the linux support ps idk if it s the nostalgia but kind of liked hoi iii better
