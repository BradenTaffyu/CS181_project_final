2021 for years i ve known about this series and just didn t see the appeal started playing it recently and i m pretty hooked the game is exactly what it seems a career truck driving simulator that so far spans the entire western us for the most part with dlc i ve always known this is what the game is but had never experienced anything like it and as mentioned wasn t at all interested it s seriously one of those things where actually experiencing it goes way deeper than just looking at it from the outside
