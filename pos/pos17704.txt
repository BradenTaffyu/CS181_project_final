2017 i wish i had started playing it multiplayer right from start on this games battles are very enjoyable and i think i spent as much time in their replays as in the battles itself its amazing to watch them afterwards to see all the great animations the learning curve in multiplayer is somewhat steep but you get used to it if you put in some effort unfortunately there are not many online games left i mean dont get me wrong you always find between 2 and 6 game to join but theres not much diversity and a big problem here is performance there is always a 50 50 chance that one of your teammates or enemies either has a bad connection or a bad rig which both slows down the battle for everyone else and if you dont have an ssd or some kind of hybrid hard disk the loading times may be veery long the single player mode is a great thing to spend much time on but if you are more the impatient person you will probably leave it after playing it through once with one faction on the other hand if you have some friends to play this game with you will have lots of fun there are a lot of mods in the workshop that even implement new armies appart from maps or cosmetic changes the dlc s are also really nice and add new armies or heroes and units to existing armies definitely a recommendation but you should know what to expect from it
