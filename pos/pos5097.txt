fallout 4 is a pretty great game in my opinion though it is probably the weakest fallout game mostly due to decisions from bethesda that i consider to be more experimental please make sure to experience what the other games have to offer instead of sticking with fallout 4 just because it has better gunplay or something but also don t let this review discourage you from trying and enjoying fallout 4 itself the whole series is worth giving a try
