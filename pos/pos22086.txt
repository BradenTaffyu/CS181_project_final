2023 it is now hard for me to believe that i actually refunded this game on my first attempt at it when i was greeted with a lagging feeling 60fps locked and tips that only showed controller buttons i could not be bothered dealing with it it was only after falling in love with elden ring a game i also initially hated that i decided to give this game another go and boy i am glad i did sure it looks and feels a bit dated sure it is frustratingly vague and obtuse as far as any help with where you are meant to go or even basic mechanics but at its core ds3 is one of the most engaging and rewarding rpg games i have ever played i found myself getting up early and choosing to miss out on sleep just to discover the next part of a map i had been grinding towards opening up a good rpg should make leveling up something you want to keep doing and it should feel rewarding and ds3 most definitely does that map design is fantastic and i frequently found myself saying oh damn that is so cool at how cleverly maps would twist back on themselves to reveal and hide shortcuts and secrets the gothic styling and the grim feel of the world all set such a foreboding scene that the brutal difficulty compliments yet there are moments where there is a lot of beauty in this depressing world below is an example where i was in a dingy underground cave only to exit to this breathtakingly beautiful view dark souls iii a screenshot of dark souls iii by ted while this is obviously a difficult game i actually found most of the boss fights a lot more manageable than some of elden ring s bosses while they are tough their animations are not too fast and the game doesn t throw unfair bs like godskin duo at you the only complaints i have there was one later optional boss where the biggest enemy you have in that fight is the camera i hated that fight with a passion there is also the same clipping of weapons that elden ring has where bosses can hit you through solid objects very unfair in such a difficult game they also make you run an annoying long way back to some boss fights often through enemies and when you die so often this can get tiresome fast overall i cannot recommend ds3 enough and while it is difficult if i can play it anyone can as i am generally too lazy to learn every attack pattern and counter but can still fumble my way through in fact the difficulty is one of my least favorite aspects of ds3 it is the incredible world design and rpg elements that make me love this game i would go so far to call this a must play game if you love the rpg genre and you are willing to put in a bit of effort with the expectation of some pain
