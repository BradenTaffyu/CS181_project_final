2016 this game is great even with only 4 1 races is more various than previous total war and weird to say it s really faithful to the warhammer universe yes of course has its flaws ia during siege and more but i simply don t care why pros are way more than the cons and as everyone knows gamesworkshop discontinued warhammer fantasy for age of sigmar so this is probably my only opportunity to see a non amateurish work that deliver the same rich lore that made me fell in love with the warhammer universe in a strategy videogame the last opportuniy to see the tomb kings in a videogame this will be the definitive warhammer compendium game with all the races my last goodbye to warhammer fantasy p s you gamesworkshop maybe here you can read me you haters too dp p s for any warhammer fan out there that isn t sure about this game we ve played march of chaos seriously
