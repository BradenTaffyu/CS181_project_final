2021 early access review very fun when you re in huge battles but everything else is pretty much a grind to get to that point the game needs some serious quality of life changes frequent crashes companions family members teleporting around the map when you re trying to collect them all i e it will say they re at one city and once you arrive they ve teleported across the map to the place you just came from smithing is extremely slow to grind and unlock new designs there may as well be no tutorial and you have to figure most things out halfway through your campaign when you ve already screwed yourself into a stalemate
