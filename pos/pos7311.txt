2017 i bought this game a week after it came out i knew it would be fun but not this much fun i had 18wos haulin along with 18wos extreme trucker and american truck simulator is a huge improvement over them ive played over 400 hours on this game and i love it it feels like your really driving a truck if they add washington i would go crazy because i m from washington accually i hope they add in the whole united states honestly i think this game is amazing i dont think it could get any more realistic i hope to drive a truck when i am older but this game will deffinitly do for now 10 10
