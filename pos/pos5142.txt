2020 fallout 4 is an amazing game with much better graphics and lighting compared to 3 or new vegas here you play as either a man or a woman looking for their kidnapped son you can enlist with either one of 4 factions for the endgame the aesthetics of this game is a cool 50s atompunk style fo4 adds a new feature where you can build settlements where you can redirect settlers and companions and also a place to store your items taking care of your settlements are not necessary you could just claim them and leave to continue the story but if you like customizing an area you d probably love it gunplay is also much better they are easier to use even outside of vats my main problem with fallout 4 is that there is too much combat my favorite thing to do in the series is to explore ruined abandoned places with a companion now most ruins are either filled with human raiders or other enemies which ruins the creepy feel the main story also seems a bit shallow especially compared to the dlcs of new vegas you can create a peaceful ending but the downside is that it feels more like an exploit rather than a proper peace another problem is the addition of infinite radiant quests where some starts directly after turning in the previous radiant quest and might clog up your quest log there is also less unique weapons and armor fallout 4 is also quite buggy with quests that stuck sometimes or disappearing characters luckily most of these problems can be resolved by save load or using console commands console commands won t disable achievements but mods will although the story and some gameplay mechanics might not appeal to fans of the older games fo4 is still a great game with lovely aesthetics
