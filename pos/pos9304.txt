2016 i don t often write reviews for games this game has compelled me to do so what an absolutely fantastic game it is i have never been much of a 4x player or a grand strategy fan in the past but something told me to pick this one up man am i glad i did stellaris really captures the feel of role playing a galactic empire from the ethics and traits to diplomacy and trade to combat and wars each game takes hours and hours to complete i m currently on my 14th hour of the current game and have plenty more to go the fact that you can completely customize your starting race complete with ethics and traits and the fact that ai species are all completely randomly generated is what makes this really shine also you can design your own ships with the technology you have researched awesome idea the only thing that has bugged me a bit is the ui needs an overhaul there are many areas where efficiency can really be improved when managing a lot of fleets and planets if you re a fan of space and feel like ruling the galaxy pick this game up with improvements and dlc over time this might be one of the greatest space games ever made 9 5 10
