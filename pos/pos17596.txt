2016 so i never bought attilla and delayed buying tww for a long time because i had my faith seriously tested by tw r2 this game also appeared so expensive for me and ofc there is all the dlc issues which adds up to more than the retail price of the game however now that i have bought it i can not stop playing it was so worth the money i spent on it the stuff that i thought were going to be issues are not issues they make the game example 1 you can t paint the entire map this is so not an issue it actually works quite well the sack raze is great and makes perfect sense in the game design and there is so much to do just winning your own campaign and seeing off all the invasions from the areas you cant control makes for a great game 2 the chaos invasions these add so much pressure to the game it creates a driving purpose to be ready for the next wave of invaders it makes every turn precious 3 the whole dlc to unlock content thing i can now see just how much effort has gone into making each faction a completely different play experience the entire campaign mechanic and storyline and imperative changes with each faction they have different units unique technology tree and totally different playstyle it is almost like an enirely new game when you switch factions i cannot wait to get enough of the starting factions and will definitely be buying the other factions as well vampires chaos here i come
