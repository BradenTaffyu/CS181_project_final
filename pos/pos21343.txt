2022 tabs is more of a fun distraction then a real game but it works for what it s trying to be create your own battlefields filled with silly looking figures from many settings and time periods it can however get stale pretty fast so check out these two short lists to see if it s for you cool the game s theme is silly and you re encouraged to fool around with lots of units to choose from you can create many funny situations and battlefields this is what 90 of the game is about making your own units with massive choices for gear powers and look is more then half the fun but has a huge caviat check below despite the physics being overall janky the game is surprisingly stable frameloss is expected but barely any major glitches or the like units are reasonably good at targeting even with the wide variety of weapons there is a single player mode of sorts where you are send through many different levels usually with a disadvantage you have to figure out what composition of units is best to defeat the level kind of like a puzzle game within these maps there are plenty of secrets to be found to unlock other units the way they ve done this feels very fitting and is one of my favourite design choices of the game little known fact you can take direct control of one of your units putting you in a first person perspective of the unit and giving you all the abilities the unit has this can be really fun with all the different units to try out this doesn t work for about half the units though as their mechanics don t work when you re controlling them which isn t explained so it s a trial and error thing as of writing this it s still being updated which means there might be even more units in the future to play around with not so cool over a hundred of different units but only a handful of maps helps making the game get stale soon making your own units is basically useless you can t use them when doing most challenges or playing with friends which seems like the oddest of design choices why stop us from having fun with friends in a closed game really baffling if you want to win the single player challenges especially if you re going for achievements be prepared to use stalling tactics and exploits to win levels as they re always stacked against you this can be fun at first but will feel like a chore in it s repetitiveness aside form sandbox and challenge mode there is nothing else multiplayer could ve been much better if it included your own units but it doesn t so there is little to nothing to come back to after you spend some time with it and i think that s it buy it on sale for a fun distraction a videosnack if you will but don t expect much more from it if they ever do add custom units to multiplayer then it might bump it s entertainement value by a lot but for now that doesn t seem like it ll be the case thank you for reading and if you have any questions please leave a comment cheers
