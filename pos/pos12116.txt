2022 been racing on this sim for a few months now quiet satisfied with it i have spend a bit on cars and tracks after trying the free with subscription which is damn cheap for me on steam may be they price using ppp content the good parts 1 full grid on most car and track combo i only do road racing at any hour of the day 2 many fix setup series which leads to close and fun racing 3 physics damage model are realistic and predictable4 almost all gameplay features that other racing games have5 short and long races both are usually available for most cars can pick a race for how long i have6 graphics good balance between performance and looks nothing crazy but nothing ugly the bad parts 1 ffb is need to set per car basics each time i recent started using irffb because it will remember the setting for each car once set 2 cost 15 per track and 10 per car it s one time and i am fine with sending a bit on tracks i like because of the service they give is worth it it s a racing sim not engineering sim you can load the game and hit the track without touching anything in the setup ofcourse you can fine tune things if you want for me just the in car brake bias adjustment is good enough and dont want to spend hours fixing tire temp for a sprint race
