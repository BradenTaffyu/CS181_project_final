2020 this game started out as one of the worst releases of the year but its nice to see the devs didn t give up on the game and actually made it enjoyable with the wastelanders expansion sure its not perfect all the daily caps for legendary scrip caps gold and reputation are waaaay to low and reward playing a little daily other than binging the game which will make some people forget the game quickly after they finish the main plot that being said playing with a friend made the game really enjoyable the camp building is quite nice and more polished than in fallout 4 the build system is one of the more flexible i ve seen and love the versatility it gives you switching between builds is almost seemless and doesn t require grind if you spent minimal thinking ahead to what you might want to achieve the build system also allows you to basically play however you want and with whatever ridiculous weapon you want and still do pretty well the weapons are so varied ranging from literal guitar swords to heavy gauss mini guns and provide a lot of modification options coupled with amazing legendary traits which makes min maxing your weapons addicting and always keeps you out looking for the god tier weapon you were dreaming of if you just wanna have some fun love the fallout universe and want to find yourself playing more in it i recommend this game if you want to find the most polished multiplayer rpg you might not find this here
