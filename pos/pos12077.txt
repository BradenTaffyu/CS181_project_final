i ve been playing about a year just don t log in thru steam always i m 54 and i m probably the lower end of the average player as far as skill goes i had some serious computer issues in the last 2 months and my only goal was to get back to iracing so during many attempts to try my points took a horrible hit as in test sessions it would run but in live matches it crashed at start turned out to be a ram card not fully seated my 4 cards are connected with a water block so it was a hidden issue anyway the game is very good in my opinion with low level gear and an average windows 10 11 i think it would run good for anyone i use a thrustmaster tx servo fanatec pedals and my pc is 10th gen core i 9 10900k asus rog maximus xii 4060ti asus video card with high level gear i think its probably as real as you can get without buying a race car and risking your life there is a huge range of competition and player level it seems expensive on first sight and might well be i have a low level income but the monthly fee is worth it to me as i m single and don t watch cable tv im on the game and after you purchase the cars and tracks you want that expense is gone i don t have a whole lot of tracks i just found a series i would be happy in and started getting a track or 2 a month i recommend playing with the free tracks and cars until you find what you like they give a wide range of cars to start you so you will find your bag be patient starting i was sure guys were cheating cause in the same car they were so much faster but now im sure some new guys think im cheating i m still a lot slower than half my field but now i m fast enough to know that it s just my skill level and i don t see anyone is cheating i just see better skilled drivers than me now i just blame it on my bad eyes and reflexes lol i was intimidated to race with real people and they are competitive as all get out but when my pc was broke all i did every night for weeks was trouble shoot trying to get back on the game ive got a 600 hp 5 3 ls motor in my garage and a 06 impala stripped down in the drive and rather than start building my frame and cage for my project i m on iracing every night lol
