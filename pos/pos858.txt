2016 okay where should we start there s so much about this game but i ll just make it short just get it why pros stunningly beautiful pixel graphics brings back childhood memories 3 tons to explore plots are actually intriguing esp for a farming game nominated for just 5 more minutes awardcons forgot to finish an important task cuz i m so into this game and now i fear i might not graduate college 10 10 would miss deadline again and again and again
