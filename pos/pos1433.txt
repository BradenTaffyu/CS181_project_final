2023 early access review this game genuinely makes me long for the world to end so i can build a fortified compound with my friends living off the land and honing our various specialised skills i become an electrician while my friends teach themselves woodworking and how to make cars that being said the game is an ongoing reminder of my own mortality and how my life could be cruelly snatched away from me at a moment s notice by the smallest mistake 10 10 game
