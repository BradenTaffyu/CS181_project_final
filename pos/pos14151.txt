2020 this game is the best management basebuilding game the 1 0 added lot of balancing so oxygen not included is not as hard as it used to be furthermore the mechanics do remain complex and deep you can easily manage the difficulty by adding mods or simply by using the no sweat option oxygen not included seems being hungry for more content than it already has the first dlc looks amazing already even if you don t need it for a first experience as a negative aspect i have to admit that this game steals your time sessions are really long if you don t manage your ressources well during your first run you will feel frustrated and might give up take it as a first try and improve yourself in the next run
