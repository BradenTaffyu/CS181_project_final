2021 early access review raft this is the game i go to when i want to just relax zone out and enjoy a game without feeling any pressure or anxiety in any way between the pacing the graphical design and the music the feel of this entry is very zen it s almost akin to a sort of cognitive therapy in it s own right the game concept in and of itself is elegant simplicity you are on a raft in the middle of a vast seemingly endless ocean and must collect flotsam to expand craft tools and workstations and scavenge for resources on the few islands and derelict vessels you come across in your journey onward there is a storyline and while there are some mildly disturbing elements you discover in uncovering the story the pace is so relaxed and easy going that such a plotline seems almost a background consideration while you focus on your own survival and comfort and that s not meant in a negative way in feels very natural in the story of our own lives we find out the background of things around us in an almost haphazard way gleaning what information we can and where we can sometimes it makes a difference in our lives but most of it does not even if it s interesting or insightful such as it is with this game you ll find things out and maybe it ll have a point maybe it won t in the grand scheme of the game it has little consequence beyond finding new blueprints or items to use for your own survival yes the game was in a long development don t let that fool you the developers value quality over quantity and thus didn t crank out updates just to satisfy the impatient gamers out there they waited until they were satisfied it was as bug free as possible and worth the effort before putting it out into the game that s not to say there aren t bugs there are but i ve not encountered any bugs that are game breaking in any way and i ve been playing since raft first launched on steam years ago this game is not for people who like fast paced in any way from gameplay to development if you re a laid back easy going sort who is willing to be patient has common sense and the common courtesy to understand the hurdles and obstacles life can place before all humans gamers and developers alike then i highly recommend this game it is among my most favorite of games and is one i now feel has more than paid for itself alone or with friends it s a rewarding and relaxing experience every time that encourages creativity innovation and exploration at a pace you set this game is a prime example of the idea that life is a journey not a destination enjoy the journey and don t be in a hurry to reach that destination
