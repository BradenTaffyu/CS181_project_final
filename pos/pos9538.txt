2019 straight up this is a sim you have to approach it as such you will enjoy it to the fullest with a steering wheel and good pedals and lots of track time dedication and patience drive offline first get to know the tracks get to know the cars and understand how to setup a car properly now i bought it during the dreampack 1 2 3 era and i gotta say i only needed those because i drove lots of nordschleife day in and day out and also only offline for almost 2 5 years just recently started driving online and its definitely another world that pushes me to improve myself even more when more and more dlcs were published i bought em while they were on sale and now i definitely suggest buying the ultimate version when its on sale definitely a must have as the ultimate package goes good track diversity and car diversitybut the standard version definitely lacks serious content maybe best handling reasonably good force feedback depends on steering wheel and decent graphics also well optimised no stuttering and issues running full grid races insane amount of modding possible lots of tracks cars and other ui mods to improve the experience unfortunately misses night and weather conditions in racing and a good user interface so the two must have mods are content manager and sol mod day and night and weather mod nonetheless absolutely a yes from me
