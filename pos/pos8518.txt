2017 disclosure i am british non gun user non hunter and have no desire to ever do this irl this version of the franchise has been getting a bit of flack from buyers especially after the first dlc due to it seemingly straying away from it s original purpose which was to provide an alternative to those who are wouldn t be the most out of the pay per season model of the original game i brought the game as this wave of negativity started and it might have been justified in parts there seemed to be a slightly cynical way in which the dlc was being put out but since then personally i feel the devs have been excellent in listening to feedback adjusting the sale strategies and the regular patches have been coming in to get rid of the wrinkles and creases pros beautiful to look atgood implimentation of multiplayerplenty to do for someone who dips in and outhas a good balance between sim and less serious game cons some missions can be a bit of a choremake a few assuptions on only being played by people who already know about huntingthe animal types in the two maps are quite similar in style minus the bears it s been nice to wander around a take a shot at antlered beasties every now and then i feel like it s making a very bad user of mouse and keyboard get ever so slightly better without the pressure that most fpss would have i even feel a bit more confident going into a pubg game after warming up on here for a bit that feeling lasts about one round i get why there are some criticisms of the dlc but i think that is being addressed and for me the price of adding these packs is minimal to what i have happy sunk into games like destiny etc i am not saying the method they are using is perfect but it s not bank breaking and i think a few some who are being the most vocal about this stuff are probably being a bit over the top considering the very transistional period the games industry seems to be lumbering through for me the biggest negative has been sticking points with some of the missions it s perfectly possible to just play without them but they have been good to show me some of the different things in the game to do i would have never tried night hunting otherwise but there are some early missions that are exceptionally challenging to complete without items that take a considerable amount of time to level up enough to buy there is still plenty to do while you wait but for me i just wanted to fire up the game do a mission and the get back to work playing something else once i unlocked a new more powerful rifle though this became less of an issue mainly due to opening up the larger animals as sandbox prey future maps with a bit more landscape and animal variety would be the icing on the cake as there were 2 included with the 25 pound base game i think an extra 7 for each would be fair for new ones but we ll have to wait an see with the pretty nice photo mode too it doesn t just rely on the shooting of digital things which is nice hey this game clearly isn t for everyone and i get the impression people will either get it regardless of review or not and it s pretty packed with stuff so covering every aspect in a short ish review is tough i brought it after looking at many many free to play with hidden costs cheaply made and priced or more arcade y style games i feel i made a good choice now to just wait for that just cause thehunter crossover game isn t that just farcry though
