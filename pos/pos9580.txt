2018 love this sim played it with a controller at first was difficult but you end up learning how to not smash the joy stick from left to right to correct steering lol as of now tho im having more fun than ever with my old g25 wheel usb ebrake system and my oculus rift huge pro for this is the modding community tracks from famous mountain passes to some actual online free roam maps cars almost anything you can think of is there example like a jzx100 skyline from the 2000gtr to r34 madmike s rx 7 f40 even go karts and buses lol there s also the srs mod for more for the competitive people all in all it s a must have has alot of replay value and with a vr headset wheel it s very immersive
