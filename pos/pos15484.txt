2023 5 stars game amazing addicting fun 2 criticisms still a 5 star game first the game doesn t include or mention anything about the difficulty of actually timing an engine you have just built you don t just throw everything in the engine and then the car starts every step in the assembly process requires lining up dots and making sure different timing markers are in the right location degree not a big deal but the game just acts like you throw the parts into an engine however you want and then the engine just starts timing engines is an art and is one of the most difficult parts of engine building swapping second no torque wrenches or regard for the fact that different bolts can require vastly different torque numbers i don t know maybe it d be annoying to have to add a step and have to set a torque wrench for every type of bolt but i just think they could have included it somehow even a quick animation showing a torque wrench or something idk just a thought you don t just use an impact tighten things arbitrarily in cars some people do and then the next time something needs to be worked on it breaks the part or the bolt is stripped torque values exist for a reason all in all still a 5 star game i love this game i love the auction system i love the freedom to make money however the hell you want in whatever way you re clever enough to think of realism is obviously very good 9 10 just a couple missed opportunities in my personal opinion
