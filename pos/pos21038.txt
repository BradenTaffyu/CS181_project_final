2017 i bought this gem when it came out in eerie access no typo didn t expect much but was suprised much it is dumb has a shallow boring story isn t technically the fanciest stuff and its gameplay can be very repetitive but who cares it s supercute partly funny relaxing pretty unique and overall a very cool relaxing and chilly game i even played it two times in ea and will again now after its release the whole game is actually you gathering slimes for herding purposes you build pens where you will then throw tons of slimeys in there and wait for them to errr poop which you will then collect and sell that currency you spend on new pen upgrades like auto feeding or preventing them from escaping or gadgets to improve yourself the market prices for poop vary so you can try to bunker some until the price is right and then sell you also have to feed them for that you have to grow different types of food each slime has a special diet and a favourite food for optimal results you want to give every one their favourite food blahblah and there is lots to explore and discover on a rather big map one big remark it s really more a relaxing game than a challenging no time limits no perma death you can t really screw up just start the game enjoy your time leave whenever you want it s one of the very rare examples of how early access actually can provide good things the devs were always active showing and improving you could literally log in every other day to see something new and they finally delivered totally worth the money if you somehow find the gameplay interesting enough oh and it has cat slimes cutest things ever
