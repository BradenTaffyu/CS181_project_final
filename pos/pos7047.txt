2018 it s 2am in san diego ca you just picked up a double of gravel and it s your job to get it to carson city nv in one piece or two pieces whatever it s your first double and you just bought a longer truck so you re on edge as you snake your way through the narrow corridors of the miniture representation of southern california praying that you took that turn wide enough to avoid that stop light you finally make it to the highway on ramp traffic is pretty heavy for this early in the morning luckily a tour bus stops in the middle of the highway and lets you merge weird but appreciated none the less the next hour or so of your life is filled with constant taps on your a and d keys as you snake your way through california you put on some music to fill your ears with something else besides the low rumble of your pete suddenly traffic in front of you comes to a halt thankfully for you and your fellow commuters you kept enough space between you and them and quickly pressing on the brakes brings you to a rather abrupt stop you see flashing lights ahead of you and is that a plane after waiting for a few minutes for your brothers of the road to figure out how to zipper into the left lane you pass what is indeed a small plane on the highway surrounded by cones and a cop car confused and introspective you cruise into carson city this is it the moment you ve been waiting for you roll up to the little booth at the entrance to the company yard and press enter two options flash before you isn t there usually three anyway auto complete or where do you want it your mouse hovers over the auto complete i m basically done it s just a few xp right no earn those points carry that weight you defiantely click on the harder option you slam it click it into gear and hammer down you get about five feet down the dirt path then thunk your truck stops on a dime you slowly swivel your head to your left mirror and horror grips your heart your last wheel is stuck on a pole let s be honest you re not that great at backing up a single trailer let alone two you ponder what to do before deciding to just go for it you gingerly put the truck into reverse slowly backing up into traffic trailers going north and south back in drive you ease forward your last tire clears the pipe by a hair you breathe a sigh of relief as you cruise past the gate guard who seems too awestruck at your driving prowess to react or move or breathe rounding the corner you see the little outline on the ground cut it wide right then back left ease her up until that little prompt flashes and you re done one double lighter and 15 000 heavier you pull into the gas station after filling up your truck you check the job screen after that ordeal you look for the smallest trailer possible but what s this an oversize load can my truck pull that probably not but it ll be downhill all the way numbered reviews don t do it for me 5 7 or 10 10 ign doesn t tell me what i need to know but a story does an experience does if a story is filled with glitches bugs and general hatred i ll pass you read through all of this or skipped to the end idk and you can make your own choice based on this and the thousands of other reviews for this game it s not everybody s game sure it s not too exciting the ai is weird at times and a poor judge of distance at others however if you re looking for a game to sit down with grab a nice cup of caff rum capri sun and zone out for a bit i think you ve found it it runs well the trucks are fun and responsive the loads are varied enough so you won t be hauling the same thing over and over unless you want to jump in the cab fire her up and i ll see you on the road
