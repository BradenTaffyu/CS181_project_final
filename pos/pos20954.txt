in the approximately 15 years that i ve been on steam with around 273 games in my library i think this is the first time i ve ever done a review it is super chill and enjoyable the story and characters are great there s always a sense of getting better and evolving your various endeavors it s also beautiful i would highly recommend the dredge crossover dlc as its very good as well it may be my most favorite game despite the fact that i am usually drawn to rpg and shooter genres this game absolutely slaps 5 stars
