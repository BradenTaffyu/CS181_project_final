2021 i bought this game blind just knowing i liked turn based strategy games i m glad i did so because troubleshooter is so much fun i haven t been able to shut it off since opening it it is a bit like xcom but without the constant rng misfires constantly missing shots fired not 2 ft away from a big alien face in this game i am rarely cussing over missing a shot swing or magic bolt in fact i think the balance is exceptionally well done as i don t fully understand all of the systems just yet but i haven t had an issue playing just because i m not a master and what questions i have had were all answered by the fantastic community this game has it reminds me of fire emblem or final fantasy tactics a touch too as it has a sprawling story matched with some lovable anime characters each person i ve met so far has been likable and i ve enjoyed reading their stories the character designs and in game models are top notch too the levels here are replayable and meant to be replayed and there s an option to play always online so that your progress is constantly saved and you can tab away or close the game anytime this has quickly shot up to a favorite of mine and i d recommend it to anyone who likes this type of gameplay because troubleshooter has mastered it and made the experience especially fun and rewarding
