2020 i highly recommend this game progression is rewarding and it s fun trying out new strategies i just wish that the xbox 360 ps3 versions got ported because those are by far the best versions of pvz the hd widescreen support on those versions make the visuals really stand out there was even local multiplayer i hope someday there s a plants vs zombies deluxe version with widescreen support hd visuals controller support with local and online multiplayer and the exclusive mini games found in the ds and dsi versions just sell that for 15 20 and i will gladly buy it not saying this version is bad or anything the value is amazing just only sitting at 4 99 your pretty much getting the full experience
