2019 epic store on a slightly more serious note i ve genuinely enjoyed the newest instalment in the anno series never really know how to format these reviews i make but as far as anno games go it s resources are more numerous and go more in depth than past installments i m glad to see items are back and the ui also works well for me not everyone has that same opinion though on either of those i enjoy the graphics a ton though they are very laggy and needed to be turned down even on a computer i just finished building about 6 months ago even as an experienced anno player that s played through several of the previous games i constantly found myself moving backwards or restarting because my layout didn t work or i planned something janky and normally failing feels awful but the ability to move buildings really saved my sanity also the expeditions and the zoo museum are fun as hell to go through and collect as much as i can the idea of having the same one city empire map throughout the whole campaighn was also something i ve wanted for a long time felt great to put work into one island and watch it grow through the whole thing in general i would recommend this game if you enjoy citybuilding resource management or anno games from the past for sure if when it goes on sale in the future also has to actually go on sale here epic cant wait for what the dlc turns out to be 1701 was my favourite anno game of all time specifically because of the dlc
