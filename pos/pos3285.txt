2021 a beautifully crafted masterpiece that is arguably way too overlooked from unique character storylines to memorable encounters to endless routes to play d os2 is genuinely one of my favorite games of all time the pre recorded voice lines really help you connect with the characters it may be a bit difficult for newer players but it s beyond satisfying when you push through a challenging area or boss fight it s a genuinely rewarding adventure i found myself bonding with a lot of the characters who tagged along with me
