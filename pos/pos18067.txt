2016 whenever i talk to people about rome 2 the immediate reaction is that rome 1 is more fun and more accurate than rome 2 well agreed there is no free for all mode in rome 2 which sucks majorly i mean what is the point of a 2v2 if you can t beat up your ally for being incompetent or backstabbing everyone around you it may not seem like a make or break thing in a game but the free for all defined rome sure the javelinmen sucked ass and if your spearmen couldn t form a phalanx they sucked ass as well and all the barbarian infantry on an equal leg without upgrades would get beaten up by romans everyday of the week furthermore the carthagianian mecernaries were underrepresented the spanish suck many things as a faction and spain at the time compromised of multiple tribes armenian spearman are to pufta macedon do not have the right symbol to represent them the historical accuracy of what artillery pieces each faction had available are sketchy at best unit details in general are misleading from being culturally inaccurate like seleucid archers are less likely to have resembled greek archers to german spearmen having a pike phalanx formation wtf on these many point i am therefore a greater fan of rome 2 because rome 2 allows you to fight battles with much more accurate unit compositions meaning the battles are more realistic javelin units suddenly have a purpose and the tactics you can employ with them much more sophisticated this is no longer a swords vs archers vs cav vs large tactical game it is way more expansive campaiging has also been a touchy subject when i have discussed it but given that not many people buy all the expansions it can be hard to explain nonetheles wasting that amount of money just to make it a full game is criminally insane and certain people should experience ancient warfare without any safeguards or be sent back in time to appreciate why dividing the cost between the main game and so called expansions damages what the game is trying to achieve for the player an immersive experience with a context of historical warfare that is far superior to rome 1 it is easy to point fingers that greece was not divided betwen sparta and athens and that in reality there were many city states but why would the total war team have added the greek states campaign in reality it is impossible to include every singe faction in history into a grand campaign as the map and interface would become incredibly distorted not to mention the change in where settlements are routes roads etc for instance for a armenian history buff where is tigrano nowhere is a good answer that is why rome 2 with everything packed in is a great game provided all the extras are stuffed in sure it still falls short of real history but hey everything does as we find ourselves increasingly finding holes in the past the further forward we go its time people just learnt to improvise again just not to a rome 1 standard more sort of stop picking small holes and making them larger my only concerns are the lack of a free for all mode in multiplayer the cost of the so called expansion packs which you need to make the game run and as always with rome 2 the accuracy of siege engines available to all factions but don t let that ruin the game it still feels more realistic than rome 1 ever will
