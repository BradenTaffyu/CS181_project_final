2016 although this is now an aging game of medieval warfare it still constitutes one of the best examples of the genre until the release of warband 2 namely open world gritty style medieval combat on horsebeack if you want lord of the rings stop reading the review now although the last days mod is a dedication but many prefer classical medieval combat this is not might and magic its rundamentary sword combat the multitude of different major total coversions and mods keeps this game from getting stale particularly different eras of history such as the early middle ages feudal japan and age of firearms who plays the original native version of this game from 2010 and rates the game from the original release there has a bit of advancement since the dark ages explore the world of m b mods i am partial to several in particular namely anno domini 1257 ad floris expanded mod pack 2 54 brytenwalda the hundred years war and gekokujo viking conquest dlc is actually very good now since most of the bugs and problems have now been fixed and the environments are quite historically atmospheric the new features like hunting added a lot to the game along with the brutish level of injuries overall gameplay play mechanics are rock solid fighting is inituitive and natural horseback riding just feels right very addictive in the just one more battle kind of way you may start off as a lowly peasant but will eventually rise to glory as a knight and lord with a lot of work the number of hours i have played offline does not contstiute online hours hundreds since its original release maybe well over a 2000 very rare for me as i do not play many games anymore as an old fart in my 40s there are even a few really good multiplayer persistent world versions persistent world comes to mind but that was not the games original focus lack of voice chat without using skype or teamspeak makes is less entertaining the only real downside is the threadbare repeated quests this game is a choose your own adventure style make up your story with a creative mind the other downside in the lack of optimization of the game engine battles of over 500 soldiers can cause serious fps issues especially on sieges more than 500 causes frame rates start to just become absurd especially with large amounts of mounted calvary more than 1000 at one time and the game can actually crash even if you have some type of gaming super computer as i stated the limitation is the game engine not necessary your system fortunately an external program called battle sizer can make the adjustments you want i generally run battles around 500 as less than 250 soldiers makes large siege and land battles take between 30 minutes and 2 hours with reinforcements and makes formations nearly impossible to control recommendation download anno domini 1257 ad version 1 13 angry peasant edition moddb has the last version that was updated to my knowledge from dec 2015 it is not on steam workshop just do it you will understand the scope of the undertaking it is just massive in terms of scope decades will pass before you are able to establish a proper faction to contend with many of the largest countries such as england france holy roman empire crusader states and the golden horde smaller countries generally never stand a chance and get eliminated and aborbed early in the campaign it actually has significant historical accuracy for the time period both with people places castles cities and equipment london is an excellent overall representation of the actual city during the period take a walk around the town and be prepared to go holy i did not know m b warband could do that there is no magic elfs hobbits dragons or plate armor here sorry an incredible amount of depth in areas like the crusades lance recruitment system diplomatic relations and alliance management challenging tournament singular and team battles army enlistment versus independent action sea battles and expanding your manor and fiefs with actual physical improvements you can see and use they are not just eye candy all in first or third person views including recruiting from your own fiefs and build up your armies from the historical nationalities nations will fall and get eliminated permanently from gameplay lords will defect to your cause if you have high levels of reknown and honor maintaining your armies feedng and paying salaries without proper planning leads to disasters and revolts basically it is like playing medieval total war inside the world your individual combat actions can actually turn the tide of a battle or even a war but you are not a one man army you will be easily knocked out a battle if you act like a tard some mods result in broken equipment permanent death or crippling injuries this is not call of duty you do not recover your health with health packs and you cannot hide behind a wall and regenerate you have what you have damage is determined by your equipment and skill or complete lack of intelligence until you rest over time with wound treatment and surgery skills choose your individual actions and battles wisely or you will have more than you can handle and will fall and never get up again choose your alliances carefully as well as the more factions you have as enemies the more difficult you will be able to maintain your kingdom and crown just think of it as an earlier version of chivalry or war of the roses without the full mutiplayer and many less fruitcake player jack wagons let me me know when you score your first perfect headshot with a mongol bow at 100 meters on horseback at full gallop it is an art and takes practice and high levels of skill you don t need a guide you will master it with time and go huzzah
