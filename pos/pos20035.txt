fallout new vegas is one of the greatest roleplaying games of all time its publisher bethesda has finally managed to achieve its goal and completely destroy new vegas legacy bethesda has undeniably opposed new vegas vision of a post post apocalyptic narrative filled with compelling factions of reasonable sensible humans seeking to rebuild society hundreds of years after armageddon instead bethesda has always preferred to indulge in the fantasy that humanity would remain in a permanent state of devastation and ruin after nuclear bombs fell so that their perfectly good or perfectly evil archetypical protagonists could play in an unrealistic sandbox so be it bethesda and the original writers and creators of the fallout universe could coexist with their unique and distinct visions on separate coasts of the united states at least through fallout 4 and fallout 76 but it s clear in retrospect that bethesda s development team seethed at just how popular new vegas was and how beloved it remained among its dedicated fans because the fallout tv show not only retconned new vegas straight of canon it did so unnecessarily and maliciously the malice is the point the fallout show could have devastated the ncr and the city of new vegas while still retaining some elements of the original storyline instead bethesda deliberately took painstaking lengths to write plotholes large enough to ensure that new vegas simply could never have happened in fallout canon the fallout tv show could have simply taken place 20 years after new vegas and all the plot points could then remain intact but no bethesda has deliberately ensured the timeline can t work new vegas has to be erased from history because bethesda couldn t implement five minutes worth of additional worldbuilding into their tv show to allow the two properties to coexist that s intentional bethesda does not want new vegas to coexist with their fallout bethesda wants their vision to remain paramount and for new vegas to be buried in the dustbin of history again it s important to reiterate that the malice is the point bethesda could have promoted their own vision for west coast america and still respected the work of new vegas brilliant writers and development team instead bethesda spit in their faces and laughed uproariously as they defaced a masterpiece so all the nuance and strenuous worldbuilding of post post apocalyptic america in fallout 1 fallout 2 and new vegas are now gone erased bethesda couldn t stand to be reminded of their own weaknesses as storytellers so they had to burn it all down the west coast is now replaced with the same dreary nuclear ruins that dominate the skies of washington and boston the same clear cut morality plays the same tired and overwrought cliches of good and evil the ncr the legion house the khans the boomers the followers and the courier were all too complex too intricate too interesting and too difficult to digest in a short teleivision series so they re all gone now bethesda wants you to forget them i won t forgive bethesda
