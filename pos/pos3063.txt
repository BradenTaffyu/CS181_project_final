2022 wow a game that actually requires you to think this is pretty rare nowadays the highlight of divinity original sin ii are its quests which remind me of old rpg s like morrowind and baldur s gate there is always more than one way to complete a quest and there are very few quest markers even then they are usually pretty vague if you want to understand what s going on you actually have to pay attention to what the npc s are telling you also there are a ton of hidden side quests that you can easily miss if you dont talk to everyone you meet or if you don t explore every nook and cranny the combat is very fun and engaging but tough you have to take advantage of stuff like terrain combining skills and status effects and having party members that synergize with each other if you want to win you can t brute force your way through every fight and you might need to completely change your tactics before tough battles this game is honestly amazing and it s such a breath of fresh air in the current game industry and i am not even a huge turn based rpg fan i highly recommend it
