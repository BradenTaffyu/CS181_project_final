2014 yes this game has its flaws i like the traditions system and the new diplomatic functions i have not experinced the bugs for which people seem to be complaining about rome tw the orginal is still my favorite tw ever this game runs better than emipre does framerate is good sometimes the ai gets a little off in the battles but in the campiagn they are very intelligent diplomacy actually works unlike previous titles atleast on hard the hate for this game seems unjustifed i would give it a solid 8 10 not strategy game of the year but good p s i believe this game runs better on intel processers i use an i7 try to get this game on sale which is where i got it for well worth 30
