2021 early access review what is it the dyson sphere program is a production line factory style game very much in the same vein as factorio for anyone who hasn t played a game in this genre before it is all about mining a resource then creating a component with it then transporting that component to another device to manufacture a more complex component all with a view to automating it all and making some great machine that reaches the end goal of the game how does it compare comparisons will be inevitable with all factory games factorio satisfactory factory town shapez io production line and more but factorio is its nearest comparison the good news is that there is totally room in your library for both well for all of them while both games offer exactly what makes this genre great they are both sufficiently different that you could play both simultaneously and not feel that one is better than the other or one replaces the other dyson s futuristic vibe is rendered in much better graphics than factorio s slightly more pixelated flatter rendering and the scope of dyson is much much bigger given its space exploration and bigger much more satisfying end goal and there is no enemy at all but factorio has a gritty steampunk vibe to it with a hostile planet that truly feels atmospheric and alien huge maps with mass transport solutions the level of danger is greater and is more granular in the amount of components you will need to make the gameplay automation much more detailed and complex and modding can give you a totally different game all over again so there really isn t one is better than the other get both honestly just do that rip off so let s address the elephant in the room is this a factorio rip off i think the claim is unfair while there have been production line games occasionally over the decades it s fair to say factorio really cemented the genre in its own right factorio paved the way anything that comes along after will contain elements of factorio as is inevitable to say dyson is a rip off of factorio is to say dishonored is a rip off of thief one might inspire the other but basically dyson is another title in a relatively new and extremely popular genre factorio deserves the credit for giving us this new type of game dyson should be applauded for giving us another game in the genre and taking it in a different direction one has enemies the other does not one has space exploration the other does not as said one is not a replacement of the other fans of one will undoubtedly love the other too intuitive other than the basics and some simple explanations you re on your own you know you need to create an energy sphere around your procedurally generated system s star but how the fun is in figuring that out every so often as you research and craft more components a new building will be unlocked and you won t always know what it does until you try it you will be forever battling energy and resource limitations but that is the point of the game creating a sustainable and stable energy source the game never feels difficult to understand but there is no hand holding either so you made that thing now figure out what you can do with it depthonce around 80 hours in to my heavily mined starting system so long ago already and having unlocked most of the research tree i suddenly realised that the research tree is a bit misleading probably because other games of this genre pace their resource tree to span to the end of the game but in dyson research is just a fraction of the game i ve unlocked nearly everything and have yet to make any significant in road to building my dyson sphere i realise that i m nowhere near the end goal yet i have so much more to do right now in factorio i would be well on the way to building my rocket and escaping the planet in dyson you are aiming for much more than a rocket it is much much bigger i expect i will be playing my current playthrough for a long time to come as yet anything not to like personally i say no i have read criticisms about the space flight but i disagree i think the flight model is more realistic being sucked into gravity fields of gas giants overshooting a planet creating difficulties in swinging back for a return sweep another criticism i ve read is that the planets are so small but i think that s necessary to make resource management critical and can absolutely see why that design choice was made i ve read criticisms about balancing issues and there is a degree of that especially with chemical plant related construction but that is an issue that is more a staple of this entire genre and not just specific to dyson sphere program i think the only criticisms that the developers do need to look at is firstly handling properly a lack of inventory slot when manufacturing something especially something expensive like a logistics station because all those valuable resources are lost if no space is available and also making the end goal essential right now it s not i don t want to say too much because spoilers but that does need addressing however taking into consideration that this title is still early access the absence of more major flaws is impressive currently this game s rating stands at 97 overwhelmingly positive and that s with good reason the fact it s still in early access is a credit to its highly active and public focused developers as the game runs flawlessly my only technical issue is that it does turn my gaming laptop into a hot toaster pretty quickly but that aside i ve run into no problems bugs or crashes at all in summary dyson sphere program is a lot of game for its diminutive price and the bar has been set very high for the factory building production line genre of games while it is clearly inspired by all the best of factorio s offerings it also takes the game in a sufficiently different direction so that it doesn t act as a replacement or a blatant copy i cannot recommend this game enough and it thoroughly deserves it s overwhelmingly positive rating
