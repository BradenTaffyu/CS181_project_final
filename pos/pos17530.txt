2016 so far i really like it they stripped down the tech and social trees to stream line the battles there are quests to get geared up and equipable and swappable retainers the whole thing seems way more like a battle intensive rpg set in the total war engine which is why i bought it the graphics look great with diverse little toons amongst the units they yell they fight they die they get swept through the air and rag dolled by trolls you can even cast magic and watch them all fry like pork sausages the game itself runs good too i have currently played 3 hours over a remote connection with no issues there was a point on the very first splash screen where i waited for about 10 minutes before the intro started i thought it was broken but it started eventually i don t know if multiplayer is working for anyone else but it crashed my game the two times i clicked multiplayer so that s definitly a bad mark for the game right now if you wanted to play this game for the multiplayer hold off till they fix it fixed now many people have said that it black screens or constantly crashes on them i haven t experienced that yet outside of attempting multiplayer this game runs on my low end bare bones laptop that i m remoted into from a crapy dell i give it two thumbs up for optimization now all i want is an army painter so the warhammer theme would be complete
