2019 want to experience medieval depression in the most scuffed way possible look no further than mount blade warband settingthere isn t a lot i can say here that the game doesn t cover in the opening but i ll do my best basically six kingdoms with vastly different cultures but all somehow on the same peninsula take turns hating and or tolerating one another and deciding whose turn it is kick swadia in the shin this week not that harlaus will mind he s too busy organizing a feast in praven and you should totally go in comes you a total nobody who stands to throw an army sized wrench into the mix maybe eventually kinda depends on how you play presentationoh boy this game is comically stiff even at the best of times in terms of its presentation and atmosphere even if everything is functionally competent it doesn t distract away from whatever melted ken doll you selected in character creation it s not a pretty game and the music ranges from flat to not even there half the time the matter of computer specs come to mind for as old a game as it is you d be surprised to hear that yes you ll need a fair amount of power to keep it from turning on you and bricking your computer faster than harlaus can host another feast at praven and invite you to it despite you being halfway across the universe and physically unable to attend because you re in prison and nobody wants to save you even haringoth that coward after you broke him out of the kingdom of nords after he was stupid enough to wander near there while a war was going on and okay okay deep breaths now you d think with a condemnation like that so early that i wasn t very keen on this game you d be wrong gameplaywarband is a role playing game uh warband is a strategy game okay warband is a city building warband took my wife and kids mount dew code red is a peasant oppression simulator where everyone walks like the concept of legs was birthed less than a week ago and siegemasters can only afford one ladder to share among everyone on the plus side harlaus is hosting another feast in praven and you should totally go jokes aside it s a rather eclectic thing to fully summarize it has a deep basis in rpg elements for starters but then you throw in army management and now it s a strategy game wait but then you have towns trading territory control and it all just starts to get slightly overwhelming in broad strokes first off is character creation where you pick your appearance backstory and most importantly gender why is gender so important because playing as a female character may as well be the secret hard mode of the game because it turns out the medieval experience isn t complete without a little bit of misogyny on the side now off the boat you play as your guy or not a guy who sets out to do something that something really depends on what you the player want to do but it ll probably involve harassing several villages and getting smeared across the ground by the local shirtless robbers that throw stones personal recommendation do the tutorial and head to the local training field where you can practice the odd combat mechanics of the game with relative lack of risk speaking of we move to the meat of the game the combat oh good lord the combat depending on first impressions it may end up being the worst thing you ll ever experience or so fun that you can t put it down combat is messy slow and flows as smoothly as a can of baked beans but for what it s worth it s endearing there s even a skill ceiling that you can pick up on if you take the time to learn the ins and outs you have four directions of attack except when you don t you got the side to side the overhead the forward stabby stab maybe it s not a stabby stab maybe it s your fists it all depends on the weapons that you use or don t and boy howdy there are a lot ranging from useless to how is this fair the stats and distribution of weapons and armor that you can loot and buy is varied enough not to get too stale and can leave you feeling pretty powerful if you invest properly such stats even befall horses a method of travel that is objectively better than your 13th century chicken legs one thing that is constant though you have a foot use it kicking your enemy to death is a viable tactical strategy but you can t fight off those shirtless bandits yourself and for that you ll need to bring friends well friends is a loose term they re only friendly so long as your pockets aren t empty but an army is invaluable in this game knights archers horse knights horse archers man with stick the possibilities are endless there are even special npcs that grow in stats just like you do and can be invited on your kingdom ruining adventures be warned they can be opinionated if you re not doing things the way they like then much like an ex they can and will leave you on the drop of a hat so it s important to surround yourself with allies comfortable with your peasant popping and are okay with going back to praven because harlaus is hosting another feast and you should totally go after your army s assembled reached nobility and went to praven for that feast the game shifts gears from rpg to strategy ally with existing kingdoms found your own care for that one village that s always on fire thanks harlaus how you do it is up to you just be prepared this game will not relent extras dlcmount your friends waistband has a few side features to note of besides a single player campaign one such is multiplayer with a shockingly alive playerbase despite the many years it s been more on that in the community segment there s also custom battle which lets you start a player created scenario to challenge yourself or goof around with in various ways as far as dlc goes there are two of them which includes the multiplayer specific napoleonic wars and viking conquest which even comes with its own expansive single player story campaign mod supportmaybe warband is looking too much like warband maybe it needs to look a little more like japan or middle earth or a galaxy far far away not to worry as do or do not there is no try has you covered with an extensive library of mods courtesy of the steam workshop mods for the game range from a few technical tweaks to vanilla like fleshing out the technical aspects of the game to complete overhauls like the more than slightly busted star wars conquest it s truly a treasure trove for playing anything else besides the actual game if that s what you re aiming at communitythis game has been around longer than my future life expectancy and yet the community around this game is still insane you ll never have a hard time finding other people to play against in multiplayer and there s never a lack of servers where people scream and punch each other like there ain t no tomorrow as this game is what it is you re not gonna have a huge amount of interaction with these people and sometimes you may not even want to but it s always a good time if you bring some friends along for the insane ride if even once try the multiplayer just to experience the kind of sheer madness that the warband community provides summaryyeah it s pretty good i don t think i d have even placed a fraction of the time i have into it if i didn t at least enjoy the base design of the game to begin with and with bannerlord coming out sometime in the future it leaves me all the more excited to see where the series goes next all the same this game has a special place in my cold dead heart for being the kinda derpish fun i don t think i d have ever expected
