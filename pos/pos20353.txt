the concept of a poker roguelike deckbuilder feels like something that should always be there reviewing balatro now that i m aware of its existence feels like reviewing clouds or the sun i like the way it combines powerups to bend the rules of poker hands and create new strategies each run also this presentation is gorgeous i like the chill song the hypnotic swirling background the way the power ups references cards in general playing cards baseball cards trading cards holographic cards tarot cards even a credit card it s so much fun
