2020 disclaimer be aware of long reviewafter playing this game for 300 hours and doing all achievements i wouldn t be honest with myself and wouldn t be making this game justice by not making a review of it and telling people why you should at least give it a try i don t know exactly what went through miyazaki s the creator of the series mind when he conceived the primor idea which have brought us demon s souls and then dark souls 1 2 and 3 some might call him crazy and some might call him a genius but i thank god he came out with that idea this game is unique even though there s a lot of games out there that tries to follow the same primor idea conceived by miyazaki this is a souls like at it s finest there is an old discussion in the souls community about which of the games is the best but that s nothing more than just an opinion the game is set in a post apocalyptic medieval environment ruled by those who either have linked the fire or have extinguished it and you the ashen one are only one among the thousands of lone travelers that have struggled to link the fire steal it for themselves or to let it fade away the beginning of the game won t be that much of a struggle if you have played the previous games but it s going to be a really big challenge for newcomers the game has it s pros and cons and i ll point out some of them here starting with the cons cons pvp it s just unfair what some of the veterans do with newcomers creating low level characters and using cheat engine to spawn itens such as high level spells estus flask and undead bone shards just to bully newcomers with 1shot miracles and lots of full hp healings hur dur but it s always at least a 2v1 against the invaders gitgud hur dur doesn t matter still unfair with you 1shot everyone with your sunlight spear piece of advice in your first playthrough play it offline or at least skip playing online in high wall of lothric undead settlement and road of sacrifices controls the game was designed for controlers lazy fromsoftware so if you only have keyboard your struggle with the game will be a little bit intensified by something that shouldn t make it harder pros the entire game is a piece of art from the soundtrack to the environment design the lore boss fights voice acting it s all built to make you feel like you re in a world that once was a mighty empire and now it is really close to it s ending and there s no hope to a bright and happy future every new place you get to is a painting every boss fight intro makes you feel like you re so small and meaningless compared to everything that surrounds you honorable mention to darkeater midir nameless king abyss watchers and dancer of the boreal valley every soundtrack gives you the feeling that what you are facing right now once was mighty and glorious and now it finds itself in complete misery feels sad but honorable and glorious the lore is rich in a way that words are little to describe but it is told in a subjective way what some might find it bad and some might find it really good it s up to perspective it has a rich lore for those who wants some lore to read and interpret and you don t need to go through long cutscenes and dialoges for those who just wants a really good and challenging gameplay talking about it the gameplay is another really good pro in this game it is an evolution of all the past soulsborne games it s fluid and the hitbox works ancient dragon bossfight in dark souls ii cries in the shower it is challenging and takes time to master and once you ve mastered it the pvp finally becomes interesting and exciting despite what a lot of people say the game is difficult and challenging but it isn t unfair it s all about learning from your mistakes when a veteran say it is easy it s because he s a veteran he played the previous games e he knows how to approach the challenges of this game so my final word about this game in this review is that if didn t play it before because it s too hard and you get mad easly and stuff like that maybe this game is here to teach you something maybe it is not that hard is just you that need to figure out a better way to approach obstacles maybe you need to let yourself make some mistakes and learn something from them i don t know but this i know is that you should let yourself have a deep dive into this game it will be a great experience after all thanks for reading and praise the sun o 3
