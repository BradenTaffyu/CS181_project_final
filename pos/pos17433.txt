2019 i mostly want to compare this to other total war games i was worried this would be the same kind of crap as rome 2 or something uninteresting like warhammer i m not a fan of table tops so it makes sense i wouldn t like the warhammer games as much as the historical games still recommended in short the first impression i was able to get out of this game so far are this 1 it runs well 2 it feels like a new experience 3 it doesn t feel out of place like warhammer did so i have a pc that was built in 2015 sort of on the cheaper end of the spectrum it was able to run witcher rome 2 and skyrim all on high at least with some bumps this is still the same experience the good news is it is that way at launch rome 2 was not which honestly was my greatest fear for this game i can play it the general feeling i have for series like total war is if they can keep the same basic elements but add something new i started to fall out of love with the genre as it did start to feel stale i can only look at a map of europe for so long this game fixed that i can now play a total war game and not feel like i ve played it a thousand different times before it s great total war for me has been a history of europe kind of series i start playing rome 2 go to atilla medival 2 then empire and finally napeolon this is fine for the most part but after 1000 hours of looking at italy i sort of want to stab my eyes out warhammer was a good mix up in this area the issue is that it felt like another series in the genre and not something created under a total war title i would compare it to the difference between assassins creed and the arkham series two very similar games but they feel totally different three kingdoms feels like an actual total war game to me not some fantasy table top game those are my thoughts as objectively as i can put them i should note that i do love chinese history and i am not a big fan of table top games so this has influenced my review i am much more likely to want to like a game based on chinese history than a game based on warhammer or fantasy if that sounds like you i think you ll love this game
