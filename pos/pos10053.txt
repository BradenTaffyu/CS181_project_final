2018 early access review i ve sunk a huge amount of hours into this since getting it i was a little apprehensive because of the price tag and how a similar game dwarf fortress is free it was definitely worth it a lot of enjoyment from this game comes from dealing with awful situations that come up and knowing that the colony you build will eventually end each iteration of base you build is better each time you come up with new ideas and learn from your mistakes i don t want to make too many comparisons to dwarf fortress because rimworld stands up by its own right but i couldn t quite get into the complexity of df specifically the military aspect rimworld removes a lot of unnecessary baggage and simplifies other features in my personal opinion this is for the better but i can understand why many people enjoy the additional complexity of a game like df if you like management or strategy rimworld is for you
