i love this game as many players know the catastrophic release of the game and how many players hate the game i will stick around until the end or if the game proceeds and gets the reputation it needs to survive i put aside the fact that the simple features from payday 2 were not put into the game and that operation medic bag has to do it and the fact that it wasn t in the game from launch and many players would be upset and many even return the game but i oversee them and i like to think of the game as a work in progress and how the simple features are what payday 3 is all about i love the massive changes from payday 2 to payday 3 and how they have fixed many things i was mad about in payday 2 and even though in payday2 they will never be fixed i still like the game and that same with many other players who went beck to payday 2 because of how bad they thought payday 3 was now i love this game because of many changes that i will list 1 graphics not a big deal but a massive change 2 1st person animations i love the aggressive reloads and all of the new animations they added is medic bag 11 3 the new type of loot progression and how you can do certain things to increase the amount of money you gain example dirty ice now i can go on for hours listing things but those are my favorite 3 and no matter how many things people complain about i think that the good things over weigh the bad and how many people are complaining about such little things that many are already fixed like server issues i love this game and star breeze needs to keep working on it waffle head
