2018 early access review created a 4 armed regenerating mutant with echolocation went to explore an ancient dungeon tavern library where a sultan lost his sword found the artifact sword turned out it had interdimensional powers and it would turn things into portals accidentally walked into a portal that got created when i hit a turtle got teleported to a cave with creatures way more powerful than my level 5 character salt krakens walked around and ran away from every other creature found god like loot laying on the ground albino apes murdered some robots a giant fire spitting crab started chasing me got murdered by different albino ogre apes 10 10 would roguelike again this is definitely a great take on an open world roguelike and there is enough content for hundreds of hours it seems like another shallow roguelike at first but there is so much depth once you get to the higher levels the graphics personally are great and very relaxing the music sets a great mood definitely worth the first 5 15 hours that it takes to learn how to not die and get into the real game
