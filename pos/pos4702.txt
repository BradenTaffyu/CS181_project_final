2021 fallout 4 is a house flipper with guns and better written dlc than the base game 8 10i played f4 for 150 hours a couple of years ago and got bored without ever finishing it i d wander the wasteland doing missions for grubby randos and then occasionally one of them would let me build a shed or wire up a laser turret in their wife s bedroom and i d spend a few hours trying to snap some wooden walls together when there s a perfectly serviceable house ten feet away this quickly got tiresome and i felt i was just going through the motions it sat un played in my steam library for a few years until i watched many a true nerd s video retrospective on the game and decided i d give it another go almost from the off i had a better time with the game thanks to my own personal gameplay loop i started building at the red rocket truck stop the first settlement you can unlock and build in and began the gameplay loop that would see me sink 300 hours into a single character i would find a settlement come up with a cool idea for what i wanted to build build as much as possible until i ran out of materials then i d head off into the world to do quests scavenge or trade until i could afford to build more of my settlement on it s own this could have gotten boring if it weren t for just how easy to abuse the settlement building mechanics were very quickly building settlements went from being a paradoxical house flipper rip off where i delete perfectly usable stone walls and replace them with some sticks and tarpaulin to one of the most engaging puzzle platformers i ve ever played the snap mechanics on building walls are dreadful and brilliant at the same time if you can place the first wall somewhere the game thinks it ought not to be possible the snap mechanics 9 10 superceed the invalid placements so once you have one wall where it shouldn t be you can usually snap some more walls onto it there was a sort of sadistic satisfaction in the settlement building i felt like i was fighting with the game to make things that shouldn t have been possible every wall i clipped through the world every schoolbus i placed on stilts every bedroom i crammed into the tiniest crawl space and every second i spent watching the ai trying to path through it all was payback for pretty lousy stories repetitive fetch quests or errands for one of the game s factions and the janky and uninteresting dialogue like i said i began at rrts totally ignored concord and explored the entire north west of the map before meeting preston garvey red rocket would be my centre of operations for the rest of the game a place where i d leave my favourite companions fill chests with special weapons and collectables in building these spaces for myself i discovered something unexpected fallout 4 is often and often rightly criticised for its lack of roleplaying potential the writers seem to have come up with a character and a story which is engaging and personal but that doesn t leave much room for that character to be what the player wants with most dialogue no matter how the player chooses to conduct themselves leading to the same outcome but with the settlements the player can roleplay to their heart s content but instead of creating a character you re creating a community it s worldbuilding it feels like you are adding to the game that the settlements you create with their individual backstories and structures all invented by you are a part of fallout 4 s world building these narratives was fun and afforded way more freedom to roleplay and act on the world than the dialogue or story each new settlement felt like a new character with its own story red rocket was my home in the wastes where i lived with my dog and horded comic books vault 88 was an underground shanty town run by wastelanders who indentured the vault s population with a checkpoint charlie in the cave between the town and a local cult of atom starlight drive was a sprawling market bazaar hangman s alley was a neonpunk crime district kingsport lighthouse was a thriving fishing village croup manor became a hotel run by ghouls castle became a sprawling city built within the safe walls with strata of society divided by their location within the fort the potential for settlement building is limitless technically unless you change the building limit in the console which i wholeheartedly recommend you do and it s honestly the best thing f4 has going for it as i said before dialogue is pretty janky except for in a few scenes that were actually good the standout sections which allowed for roleplay and some well written dialogue were the interviews with piper and valentine i will also mention the silver shroud quests because the hammy comicbook dialogue is hilarious it s worth mentioning also that all the dialogue in farharbor is great with more engaging factions too combat is pretty standard the gunplay is functional and vats are still useful especially with high luck weapon crafting is fantastic i have basically no criticisms of any of the crafting the legendary weapons are also brilliant especially if you get a good one out of the rng these weapons can stick with you for the entire game if you get a really good one i for example got a disciples knife with the powerful effect giving it 25 damage this weapon was so good it single handedly encouraged me to put points into melee perks just to upgrade it in the workbench overall i recommend fallout 4 as a post apocalyptic hybrid of house flipper and the sims a brilliant exercise in world building that more often than not will see you segregating your societies by faction or class or maybe that s just me i don t want to think about it the gunplay is fun exploration is rewarding crafting is great the dialogue is mediocre in the base game but good in the dlc especially if you play the mechanist dlc wearing the silver shroud costume part of me wonders if this game wouldn t benefit from just being an open world survival game with crafting and base building and no npcs to interact with oh tldr combat is fun crafting is good talking is an exercise in early years education and settlement building is a kafkaesque dystopian nightmare of your own making but at least you get to feel like you re getting revenge on the game for all the stuff you didn t enjoy by breaking the placement engine
