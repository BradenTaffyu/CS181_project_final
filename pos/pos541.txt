2018 probably the best farming game on steam i was a harvest moon player for the last decade and since that i hadn t really thought about playing another farming game till i saw this i have to say that i really did not expect to be so captivated stardew valley is a game without time limits leaderboards or any sort of competitiveness associated to it for me that s what makes it so awesome you take your time to do whatever you want and if you miss anything there s always another chance this game has plenty of things to do and activities to accomplish you can pursue what you want in many ways there s no right way of playing it in stardew valley i feel like i have a purpose the sense of accomplishment and progress after finishing what you ve planned is great the characters you get to interact in the city have compelling and somewhat realistic stories behind them dont get fooled by this game s colorful looks some storylines are depressing and not everything is perfect in this city as you ll learn the relationship system works and there s a vast amount of goods you can produce in your farm overall this is one of the games where i had the most fun in the last decade
