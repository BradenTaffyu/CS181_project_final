2021 early access review no contest the best open world roguelike currently in existence and a pretty damn cool rpg besides deep freeform character customization a fun and interesting world to explore great writing even in places it s outright unnecessary try using the look command on the walls as you wander around and most of all procedurally generated interdimensional hammers that run on blood and make robotic bugs appear when you hit things i used to stay up til 3 am playing this game and then get up for work at 7 and i didn t even regret it
