2022 i ve spent a lot of time agonizing over whether i want to put master duel as a recommend or dislike in this review this one s very hesitant there is a lot to dislike about master duel but regrettably i still enjoy it and know several people who enjoy it and got into ygo through it master duel is modern ygo in a video game it s relatively barebones honestly there s a simple and often not so perfectly translated solo mode going over the lore of various cards there s a best of one ranked ladder that occasionally hosts unique events you can buy cards and make your deck yup that s about it let s talk about the elephant in the room first the economy and being f2p ish the f2p economy is generous at times harsh at others and often feels like konami isn t entirely sure what they re doing early game gems dry up fast and later if you re playing optimally you can get enough gems for abouuuut two packs per day which isn t much the methods of gaining packs are strange and encourage saving up for a long time and spending all in one inning or getting impatient and spending money for more the irl money to game currency exchange is prohibitively expensive even the absolute best deal which you can only get for 3 months after starting the game is a costly ask but at the same time the events that run each month or two are shockingly generous in terms of new gems and the amount you ll get early is probably enough to make one or two decks either for metagaming or for fun but if you want to make more than that gods help you the fact that both actually powerful in the metagame decks and neat for fun decks are often around the same cost is a double edged sword that s for sure the presentation honestly despite it all master duel s presentation isn t all that bad the music is nice though nowhere as numerous as the selection of duel links although that game has a ton of its own problems the graphics are engaging enough and it s far more easy to understand what s going on by watching it than the card game is irl i ve had a lot of friends tell me that even when they re losing games in master duel they re still enjoying it and understanding what s going on so that s definitely a good sign the solo mode is a neat series of trying various loaner decks and the story of various card groups is neat but the translation is far from the neatest and it often feels like konami didn t feel to put all that much work into that part seriously they mistranslated dark magician strong contender for the most iconic card in the game as dark spellian for a bit find and replace algorithms moment gameplay and the metagame we can t really talk about master duel without talking about ygo proper yu gi oh is a messy game decades of power creep in a format without rotation has left many games often decided by turn 1 2 this isn t necessarily a bad thing games in older ygo formats were often just as unbalanced but it s not for everyone and when the solo content is finite and playing on ranked duel is essentially required to earn gems after a while the metagame needs to be addressed the fact that games don t include the side deck means several decks in master duel can essentially make something unfair that unless you have the very specific counter to you lose to on the spot lookin at you d d dynamite burn and skill drain eldlich hell this is coming from a non floodgate eldlich player even it can be frustrating it can be unfair nonetheless there are somehow perhaps accidentally diamonds in the rough of all this the current n r festival event which uses only cards available for essentially no cost has a neat format and is easily accessible though even its meta still has a few of its own problems there s ways to play with friends but the function behind it is quite janky final thoughts master duel sure exists it s as messy as the card game itself many of its successes feel like accidentally stumbling into good ideas and i worry that the economy or game might only grow worse as time passes but for now i ve enjoyed it i ve enjoyed playing with friends i liked the solo mode the current n r festival is delightful and i even enjoy ranked duels more than i d expect play it if you want i guess don t spend money on it though lmao
