2017 first fallout i played i bought it a year ago when fallout 4 was already out most of the time i am looking for games that are story rich that s what attracts me the most i did not frankly appreciate the main story of this one added to the fact that the graphics are a bit outdated i really struggled to enjoy the game at the start especially since i had just finished both metro 2033 and metro last light redux games with stunning stories and graphics it did not help but it is by discovering the humor the huge open world the fact that our choices and our way of behaving with other characters have a great influence you can actually choose to be a gentle guy or an ultra selfish bloody monster this excitement of finding powerful weapons that i started to really enjoy the game fallout new vegas a screenshot of fallout new vegas by hellinouille the error i made at the beginning was also to rush in the vaults without reading all the notes without taking the time to find all the small side quests of the game that s why i did not manage to appreciate the game from the start much as i found the story of the four factions fighting to take control very basic and not interesting to my eyes it is the vault and stories of the little characters that are the treasure of the game besides it is by reading on a website the scientific experiments carried out in the different vaults that i saw the game from a different perspective dlc are great i found their story more interesting and richer than the main story old world blues was very funny on the other hand i hated dead money not because it was bad but from a personal point of view i found it hard and more boring let us now talk about achievements as a proud 100 achievements hunter i suffered a little for some of the achievements some needed more time than others like healing 10 000 points of damage by eating i think by playing only in hardcore mode i would have had it faster the gun runners arsenal challenge 3 stars was also a challenge as the name suggests as much as i grumbled i was sooooo satisfied and proud once i obtained it however i found completely annoying to finish the game 4 times with the 4 factions because it got very repetitive in any case it s not impossible to get the 100 it just takes time and energy fallout new vegas a screenshot of fallout new vegas by hellinouille in summary i recommend this game to fans of open world fps kill and be mean to everyone to evacuate the frustration of a day s work considering the price if you are just curious do not hesitate and try it out fallout new vegas a screenshot of fallout new vegas by hellinouille furthermore i bought fallout 4 very recently and i also really enjoy it my curator page
