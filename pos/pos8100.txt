2018 early access review all right i ve played 500ish more hours felt like it was time to update my review the game is really good you have an ultra realistic soft body physics automotive sandbox at your disposal every part of the car is simulated in real time allowing for highly realistic car handling the soft body physics part refers to this game s incredible ability to realistically simulate the deformation of objects such as cars beamng drive has a wide selection of non branded cars to choose from from classic 50s sedans like the burnside special to modern muscle cars like the 2022 bruckell bastion this however can also be expanded upon with mods which beamng supports natively with it s own mod loader and repository this game has something for everyone street racing circuit racing rally rallycross rock crawling drag racing drift gymkhana touge stunt driving f1 hill climb nascar demo derby you name it you can do it with the right selection of mods installed also this game allows you to import custom made cars from automation the car company tycoon game they don t have as high quality deformation but this still means you can make a car from scratch in automation import it over to beamng drive and drive it around i don t care what you say that s amazing now for the bad only one complaint really you need to make sure before buying this that you have a fairly powerful pc this simulator is very taxing on your cpu and ram i actually upgraded my pc to 32gb of ram specifically for this game very simple job btw basically the easiest pc upgrade you can do my next performance bottleneck is my cpu which is an intel i5 9700k its a good cpu more than enough for just about any other game but the performance takes a big hit with more than 4 or 5 vehicles loaded if you re computer has the specs to handle it and you re a big car nerd like i am go ahead and get it you ll love it
