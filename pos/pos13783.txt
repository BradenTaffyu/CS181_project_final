2017 video review youtube video res reviews arma 3 views 524 resoula s arma 3 review for more res reviews check out our playlist twitter some parts of the text review are omitted because of review size restrictions arma 3 is a tactical shooter first person shooter or infantry combat simulator whichever term tickles your fancy better modern warfare simulator is probably a more accurate group of words to describe it though in arma 3 you play as singular soldier that is sometimes in command of other soldiers your goal is to follow typical real world military objectives in a highly realistic at least in comparison to all the other war games on the market war simulation with all different kinds of variables influencing how things work and weighing you down to the capabilities of a real life soldier instead of a super adrenaline pumped super soldier that can jump out of a plane shoot an enemy pilot and take his plane mid air like in battlefield or something else with an arcadey focus arma 3 has a huge modding base and mission editing capabilities along with regular dlc content coming out to support it to ensure you always have something to do but mods and dlc aside is arma 3 worth your time or money well let s start with the gameplay as i said the gameplay is highly realistic while still being fun and that s what the whole arma series is known for being fun to play while also being as realistic as they can manage not aiming down your sight does not result the shot curving off to the side and spinning around like a ballerina like in other shooters that think making all non scoped shots miss is realistic you can do pretty much anything you imagine in war here fly a jet a helicopter be a co pilot drive a tank be a gunner fortify bases build bases lead squads lead platoons run around solo in the middle of a warzone with nothing but a pistol as a helicopter lands russian soldiers beside you the point of what i m trying to say is that anything that can happen in real war can and will happen in arma 3 and that s not scripted all the mechanics are set up pretty solid there s good support for everything and there s so much detail from zeroing your gun to manually calculating and firing artillery should the situation call for it laying ambushes with explosives and making intricate plans on your side s map that can affect entire operations if done right or wrong how much your gun sways is probably the biggest con i can find in the mechanics as they are laid out as it sways way too much you d think your character was constantly having a seizure but even then you can adapt to it and things can just work out the way you want them to it s not game breaking or anything like that the big problems when it comes to arma 3 s gameplay are the same exact problems every other game in the series before it has had the game s engine is clearly meant more for simulation than actual player gameplay the controls are now and always have been through every iteration clunky and just not what you d expect of a shooter it feels more akin to the slowness and lack of precise control of a third person melee brawler styled game nothing about the real virtuality engine seems to allow smooth gameplay because no game ever made for it has ever been anything other than clunky to play that being said arma 3 is probably the least clunky of any arma title however this is offset by the bugs and the level of graphical optimization which i will get to later for now let s move onto story now even i can admit no one is going to buy an arma game for the story every arma campaign has always been hopelessly buggy and unfinishable without restarting certain missions over and over until the game finally works while also combatting the twitchy ai which i will also cover shortly arma 3 however puts a much larger emphasis on story than any other arma before and provides a 3 part campaign with a prologue to boot it is the most narrative driven of any official arma campaign i have ever seen with very guided objectives and very defined paths to complete them they gave it a far more lower ranking military feel than the open sandboxy feel of previous campaigns that s not to say that the open world aspect is necessarily missing it s certainly here it s part of what allows almost anything to happen even in scripted story missions sometimes you re just in the wrong place at the wrong time and you only realize it after you see an enemy vehicle closing in 20 feet away from you with a mounted grenade launcher aimed right at you the story here is easily the most engaging and interesting narrative i have ever seen in an arma game with the prologue included you play as one of a few nato soldiers and just generally try to survive an enemy onslaught and overcome their power some of the story moments are very easy to see coming but many of them still hit just as hard and are really the result of some unpredictable yet talented writing i found all of the main characters certainly engaging and was very sad when any of them died and some of them can die very suddenly there are some choices of course like in arma 2 that affect certain outcomes but thankfully nothing as tedious as collecting evidence of war crimes while on a timer the campaign also features a sort of side quest mechanic during the 2nd episode called adapt you ll play basically on the defensive and using guerilla tactics as enemy forces outnumber and outmatch you and you can choose to try to even the odds by venturing out by yourself or occasionally with a small squad to complete some optional objectives to acquire some static fixed weapons or other weapons that may certainly be superior to what you re using i never really touched it because it was such a temporary feature you can get to the 3rd episode really quick and by that point weapons and ammo are of no concern overall i d certainly recommend the game s story especially when you take into account the extra missions and dlc and user created campaigns and missions you can buy and or download respectively but we haven t touched all there is to this game just yet large chunk of the review cut out here due to length restriction arma 3 itself though gets an 8 10 from me probably a very generous rating given all of the flaws it has but the pros are just so strong and so many that i can t possibly give this anything lower than an 8 even though i wish i could give it a 10 and that i feel like i should give it a 6 instead it gets an 8 i totally recommend buying this game if you have any interest in a realistic war game simulator or what have you if anything could have won a game of the year from me in 2013 then it would have been arma 3 hell i d give it that award for every subsequent year to date just be aware of the flaws i mentioned because they are prevalent and some of them may be too much for some people to really find the game worth it there s just so much huge potential to have fun with this game whether you just enjoy the base content include mods as well and or play this with friends there s over 37 thousand missions created by the community and on the steam workshop for you to download there s probably even more on armaholic that never made it to the workshop there s entire communities dedicated to creating on the fly missions to simulate realistic wars and encounters that you can get involved in arma 3 gets a huge thumbs up from me because there really is something here for everyone and i mean everyone
