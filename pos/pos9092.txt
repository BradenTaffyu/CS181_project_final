2018 probably one of my favorite games of all time lots of great story bits to find in anomalies good amounts of customization when designing species and a few different play styles to choose from dlc opinion is mixed for most people but i feel like there s a few that are definitely worth getting such as utopia distant stars and apocalypse many mods are available for the game and upcoming changes will allow even more to be possible i would say the game is much more mod friendly than most games but there are a frustratingly large amount of things that are hard coded the 2 0 changes to remove ftl choice upset a lot of people but overall i feel like it helped your ability to play a certain way even more now being able to fortify your space properly the upcoming 2 2 update le guin will give a massive overhaul to the way planets work and many people dislike it as well in my opinion this may be even better than the 2 0 changes however as it will decrease the amount of micromanagement you require as well as increase how immersive planets feel i would wait for a sale and then pick up the base game utopia and distant stars you ll get a ton of content that way
