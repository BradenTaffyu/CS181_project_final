2014 early access review i love it especially the open sandbox feel i m also glad there s no swearing and it s pixelated blood is right up my alley for a dad with three kids constantly prowling behind me watching what i m playing i also enjoy exploring a new place for the first time stealth based games are also fun looting at 3 am in the morning game time with nothing but a bat and a flashlight has a certain appeal the pros the above the cons mainly inventory management it could use some work but it s really not too bad once you get the hang of it
