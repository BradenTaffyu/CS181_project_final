2021 i recently picked up the logitech g29 because i had recently gotten back into dirt rally and wanted to spice up my game play it was really fun but i knew that after a while id just have a 250 wheel sitting around doing nothing because one can only drive the same few rally stages over and over before getting bored i then decided to grab assetto corsa because i knew that it had amazing wheel support upon first loading up the game i very surprised at just how much of an understatement that was the force feedback was insanely good it was night and day difference between the quality of dirty rally 2 0 and assetto corsa you could feel everything and tell what it was you were feeling all the way from a small bump in the road to the lack of power steering in older cars i spent the entirety of yesterday just playing with cars and different maps in practice mode alone and never once did i regret my decision to purchase the wheel or the game one things for sure im getting a lot and i mean a lot more use out of this wheel and this game will likely see many hundreds of hours by the end of the year if you have a sim racing wheel and are looking for a game to play this is that game
