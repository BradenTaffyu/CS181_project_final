2021 people love to hate these days with a ton of games whatever isn t the same as the old stuff but also very new is trash to most people 76 started off very bad and stayed that way for a while it was a cash grab an excuse to test out a battle royale mode that ultimately went nowhere except the grave due to lack of players 76 was it s own game but peopled wanted fallout 3 nv or 4 part two not something new didn t help that it sucked early on however since the wastelanders update the game has been very good the story is now compelling and personal the build mechanics are a vast improvement on fallout 4 and the dlc diving into the bos has been moving and controversial in the ever present feud between traitorous paladin and loyalist knight the encouragement of groups allows for meeting some pretty cool people and most of the playerbase is not toxic and really welcoming you should ignore a lot of the crappy complaints about cash grabs you can play totally fun without spending a dime and in a game with the point of being for more than one person paying to play alone makes a lot of sense like reserving the whole restaurant for a romantic date move allbeit money flex so it s gonna cost you i also have never experienced a ctd or much in the way of bugs aside from one about uneven floors and power armor stations essentially trapping the power armor away from you though i blame fallout 4 for that with the introduction of frames being on it s head not f76 s people complaining probably just have a terrible pc
