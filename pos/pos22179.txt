2023 this game is absolutely brilliant from dark souls 2 to 3 is one of the biggest redemptions i have ever seen ds3 doesen t have that much colour to it the most you ll see is a few gradients of grey brown and blue and yet the game is stunningly gorgeous absolutely beautiful the combat just like the first two games is relatively simple yet very very rewarding the bosses are some of the best i have ever seen in any game especially the dlc bosses they are on another level the level design is great but is missing a bit of interconnectivity somehting i feel makes a world feel more real the soundtrack is phenomal almost every track has a hint of melancholy to it and thats what makes it beautiful in my eyes it s bittersweet this game is in my opinion the best dark souls game and is what truly sells the trilogy a fantastic masterpiece with many fantastic aspects however there is one glaring issue with this game i cannot ignore the trophy hunting when i m trying to platinum a game i want it to be a challenge but not in the way this game does it if you want all achievments for ds3 you need to put in a tedious amount of hours into farming it s so annoying and takes so needlessly much of your time it s such a boring way to drag out the game and i don t know why they made it this way other than that this game is a fantastic way to send off the trilogy of dark souls and is one of my favorite games of all time thank you fromsoft
