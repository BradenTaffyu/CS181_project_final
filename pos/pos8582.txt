2023 a relaxing hunting simulator that lets you explore breathtaking locations across the world there are a wide variety of hunting gear to use and animals to hunt each with their own behaviours my favourite map vurhonga savanna is based on my home country south africa and makes me nostalgic for the area i grew up in in the end it s just a game and i will never hunt in real life
