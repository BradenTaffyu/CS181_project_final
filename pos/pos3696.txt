2021 this beautiful and horrifying game helped me someone who deadass forgets for years on end how to cry thanks to an upbringing that shunned and suppressed expressiveness and feelings that didn t fit the perfectionist s agenda remember what i loved most in my life and brought back one of the most vital human functions in my life if not just for a brief momenti initially wasn t affected at first until i went back and really thought deep about what this masterpiece presented to me and i broke down into a bittersweet sob for the rest of the night before i went to bed feelings refreshed with years of weight being alleviated from my shouldersit doesn t matter if you re too sensitive you re sensitive for a reason and this game will challenge whatever reason it may bedoesn t matter who you are or what you can tolerate there is a crystal clear warning at the beginning of the game that things get but the lessons the game teaches feelings it evokes outweigh whatever trauma discomfort whatever you can come up with surfaces during playdon t miss out on omorilet it tell you a story of tragedya story that s eerily relatable to most every person alivea story that feels so real in more ways than one that you forget it s entirely fictionlet it make you smilelet it get under your skinlet it challenge your deepest fears and feelingsand most importantly think about what messages it s trying to tell you all throughouthopefully nobody s going through what the protagonist is living but his story has so much you can take from it and deserves to be known for that reasonthat is why you should play omori
