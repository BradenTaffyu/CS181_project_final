2020 overall one of the best games ever the hours i have in this game speaks for itself if you re a fan of classical history or ancient civilizations and strategy games there is no reason you wouldn t like this game awful launch that has been more than fixed years ago and has only gotten better over time it may lack some depth in some areas for veterans of the genre and franchise but it makes up for it in spectacle and the modding community get the divide et impera mod if you want a hardcore historical experience
