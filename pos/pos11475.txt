2019 early access review i play this game a lot with my husband we alter the mechanics to make it a little easier and we had a lot of fun up until alpha 17 the new point system is terrible unless you alter the mechanics to get a lot more xp youll never get enough skills to have as much fun as you did before the patch that being said my review is still positive because anyone new to the game will find it entertaining probably the best zombie survival game out there just sucks for us older players who much its changed
