2023 early access review don t let the broken obviously machine translated tutorial voice over discourage you i did for a long time and it was a mistake while that is a hokey aspect of this game and may make it more difficult for total beginners to the genre to get started this is a very well fleshed out game easily imo worth the current price despite being in early access like most games in this genre the early game can be slow and a bit painful if you re figuring things out for the first time but as you make your way down the tech tree it accelerates and expands rapidly and massively feature wise i would say that this game qualifies as a complete experience exactly as it is now there is quite a bit of room for improvement in terms of optimization the game gets very demanding on your hardware in the later endgame and some players will find their upper ceiling set by their hardware rather than their willpower that said the developers have already done a lot of work on optimizations and i m confident they will continue easy 8 10 currently with more optimization work and an actual native or at least fluent english localization for the tutorial and tooltips that remain a bit incomprehensible at the moment it will be an easy 10 in my book
