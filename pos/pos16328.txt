2022 early access review this game is fascinating it really is more of a being finnish in the 90s sim than a mechanic sim i left my sauna on and forgot while i was up late working on my engine my house burned down i accidentally fell out of my boat after spending 1000 and the boat stayed in gear and stranded me in the middle of a lake you can grill sausages you can make coffee there are very detailed guides about doing this efficiently i forgot to pay my electric bill and the power in my house suddenly went out you re allergic to bees i got very drunk and crashed my uncles van into a tree and died it goes on and on at this point i still have not started the car for the first time and i obsess over it i have such a long way to go before i even enter the rally let alone win it and i feel like i need to do it
