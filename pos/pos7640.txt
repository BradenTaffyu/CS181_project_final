2021 early access review i ve been driving for well over 20 years now and i ve never gotten myself into an accident 20 years of uneventful driving just cruising along always watching out for other drivers and reacting so imagine my sheer glee at the amazingly destructive power in beamng drive i ve been playing for a long while now and it still never gets old i ve driven myself off cliffs smashed into guardrails and decided to see what happens when you do get into an accident beamng drive is basically like my playground that lets me do all the bad things that i ve always avoided in the past 20 years of bad driving i get to smash and mob around like an absolute loon chuckle and nod at the destruction and then do it all over again there s also apparently other modes other than freeroam which i ve played a few times and are loads of fun buuuuuutt if you ll excuse me i need to see what happens when i take a 3 wheeled unstable vehicle over jump
