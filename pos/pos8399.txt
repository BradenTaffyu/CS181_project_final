2018 if you ve played any version of simcity you know how fun a disaster can be in frostpunk 11bit studios presents a city builder set in a neverending disaster and it s just as much fun as those simcity disasters here you re tasked with establishing a community fighting an apocalyptic global scale cooling disaster intense cold and scarce resources are your enemies unlike simcity your work follows a narrative structure in a specific scenario a sandbox mode has been added but the main focus is meeting the goals of individual scenarios the scenarios are varied and interesting and the game s developers have made each new scenario better than the one before it which bodes well for the future of the game i ve found the game to be largely bug free and pleasant to play even on a computer that doesn t have much power you may notice slowness in the endgame as your city s population rises overall i d recommend frostpunk to players who enjoy construction over destruction and triumph over long odds
