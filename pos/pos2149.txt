early access review dark and darker is easily my favorite game right now i played the game on the blacksmith launcher for a season or two and while i loved the concept of the game then i could not really get myself to enjoy the gameplay i took a multi season break and figured that dark and darker just wasn t for me but then a new season came out and ironmace had made some incredible changes no circle new maps new classes new gear better but not perfect stat balancing i had to jump back in and now i play this game after work almost every night does dark and darker have flaws yes it does but the devs are active and constantly trying to improve and polish thier game is dark and darker fiendishly hard yes the new player experience while miles better than when i first started is still pretty nasty your first 10 20 hours will be painful there is no getting around that but stick through the pain and you may find that you enjoy dark and darker this game is not for everyone but if you want a fantasy looter extraction game please give dark and darker a try it is fun and has the potential to be a great indie game free from triple a studio woes
