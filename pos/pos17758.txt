2023 it s really sad to see the controversy around this game while i agree that the price is too high for this game especially at a time with a cost of living crisis and the recent fallout from ca s handling of shadows of change this game is really good total war pharaoh brings a host of new mechanics that make it a worthy successor to the historical mainline games and with dlc i foresee this becoming one of the best historical total wars the period is very interesting and the campaign reminds one of total war attila or barbarian invasion where you must survive a collapse of civilisation and guide your faction through these troubling times it s fantastic to see egypt in its prime represented finally in a total war not counting rome 1 the outpost system is a welcome addition that brings back forts and watchtowers in a good way this also adds a good layer to province management that is welcome it brings to mind a similar system that was in empire total war the new court legitimacy and civil war system feels like a vast improvement over rome 2 s clunky political system with it feeling more natural for civil wars to break out and legitimacy playing a prime role in the authority of the pharaoh or great king i also like that factions aren t bound to their home culture and can participate in any race for the throne which echoes real life where egypt was ruled over by foreign dynasties the scope is limited i agree the lack of babylonians assyrians and mycaneans is noticeable but i m hoping in dlc we will get this and the eventual ultimate edition on sale will make this game a must buy for historical fans i just hope this game reaches that point and ca doesn t drop support
