2016 after the launch debacle that was rome 2 total war i swore that i would never pre order or maybe even buy a total war again now here i am after playing over 150 hours of total war warhammer and i think it is worth every penny yes i get it the dlc policy is kinda overpriced and maybe some of those things should have been in the main game from the start but really in my opinion this is the best total war so far and i can only say i can recommend anyone that loves rts games or maybe u just like fantasy there are moments in battle where i get that lord of the rings movie feel and that is prolly the best compliment i can give the game finally the last thing i want to add is that this game will become way bigger then it is now in terms of content many cool dlc and flc free downloadable content is being added on a 2 month basis or so i love this game and i am sure within 2 years i will have more then 1000 hours played
