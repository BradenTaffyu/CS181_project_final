2015 it sure was a fallout game ya ll complaints combat ai is still uninteresting to fight and raising the difficulty just raises the amount of fighting you get to do and resources you have to suck down to survive majority of quests were militaristic solvable only through combat lots of mechanics left poorly explained especially scrapping settlement mechanics writing had a lot of unexplored potential but had a few highlights and loads of interesting ideas i understand that a lot of these issues are compromises to it being a titanic open world game maybe revisit after geck mod community works on it more before doing a completely different second play
