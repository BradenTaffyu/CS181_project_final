2023 sieges and battles unit variation bling bling and feel there are unit variation one of the new features with this game is local units meaning if you take a settlement in another cultural sphere you ll unlock more often ethnic tribal units however that said there are no puking frogs or cavalry tactical depth the actual tactical weight and play of units if warhammer is high on the unit variation scale but low on the tactical depth scale magic destroys armies armies are there to die basically and look good doing it 3k the opposite low unit variation high tactical depth elephants defenders of earth etc then pharaoh is in my opinion more in the middle with both ok in unit variation and tactical depth battles the biggest downside with the battlefields are that they re small and their big at the same time big enough to do the job but not as big as they should be imo while on the other hand the terrain matters more now then previously some have said everybody suffers the same from terrain and weather effects which isn t true in order for them to matter you have to exploit them you need to look at the enemy army before going into battle and ruthlessly position your army fight and maneuver so that you get the gain also what plays into this is how you build your armies if you mix and match units too much all this exploiting will become harder say if you have an army where all units are immune to desert effects and there s a desert storm the enemy isn t desert friendly now you will have an advantage if you take it battles imo are ok there s both good and bad in them sieges their a lot more fun now as the defender the capture points are way more important now unlike 3k i can t just let the enemy in let the enemy get attrition by the towers and defend the centre now your army gets penalties for every lost capture point that means upgrading a settlement to have more units is often more important for the defending side too few units means your exposed to flanking and losing those capture points and thus losing the siege as the attacker you really need to get in there try to attack the defenders from the sides you also need to weigh options do you deploy your best units first or last also building and employing siege equipment is more akin to some older tw if you fail as the attacker in these you might end up getting out grinded and lose graphics oh boy this game is true eye candy the graphics are not only that but also authentic historically speaking it shows the the team has read some books as an example the gods in game could have been taken from a wall paining in a pyramid and the characters cloth and style is also what i ve read they where oh and the weather effects look cool in battles map s it s both big and small small in the sense that it covers most of modern anatolia syria lebanon israel palestine egypt and norther sudan however the way it s implemented is imo perfect there are lot s of provinces settlements and outposts it will take planning and time to take provinces there are 72 factions at start that s pretty high though not quite immortal empires 270 but then again warhammer also started small and built up to the immortal empires after years so the map feels big strategic and immersive egypt is no longer pieced into 4 bulky regions like in medieval 2 lore look up end of the 19th dynasty for egypt and fall of the hittite empire on wikipedia for more info ramesses iii should not have been the game s poster boy but otherwise good representation heroes hallelujah no heros unit size it s not quite historical 250 men company but close enough imo some militia units go up to 240 while most mainline will be around 160 ish ai not seen anything game breaking yet if those bugs exist their not too common overall i would say the ai isn t able to outsmart me but it can defeat me by overrunning me even at normal difficulty and especially in early game the ai is a little better than in early access imo i lost my 3 first campaigns because i made dumb economical choices or stayed too passive at start and got butt f ed by the ai now i learned and i m slowly becoming top dog diplomacy i feel this is one of the areas of greatest improvement in the game i have to interact with the court to gain certain benefits and trade resources to stay afloat and avoid attrition economy there s the troy resource system which i honestly didn t like in troy in pharaoh however i absolutely like it in troy i felt the ai sent me resource deals that where just bad but sent deals only that there would be some interaction between the player and ai the resources didn t either matter as much you could get the resources you needed pretty quickly without trading just by taking and developing settlements in contrast pharaoh you actually need certain resources or your start is gg the game is much better balanced resource wise and you actually need to trade to gain grain to avoid attrition or similar the ai also offers you more seldom deals and when it does the deals are actually useful say you had tried to find said grain in your turn you hit end turn and then you get a substantial grain deal though also where you have to pony up something less needed in return religion court and legacies oh my never did i pay attention to this in any other tw religion is just something in the background now there is a legacy of akhenaten that allows you to combine the effects of all the gods otherwise you can build shrines to certain gods as irsu you can worship el as an example the same el as in isra e l there are a trade legacy which allows you to send trade convoys and buy sell resources like a true capitalist there are a warrior legacy that helps you take settlements with other things hittite legacies to help you out with vassals and so forth all this allows you to completely customise your play and that adds replayability thats just with vanilla traditionally i ve added to replayability with mods in other tw the amount of choice is to me really immersive the court system also creates a feel that there is one egyptian realm that your part of you have to interact with the sitting pharaoh can create inter egyptian alliances and get dragged into a war when someone else wants to claim the throne which can be a disadvantage or advantage to you sound system the sound system reminds me of rome 1 tbh it s not the same but the immersion of it the music is ok not the best linux with patch 1 0 1 works out of boxsummary all in all i would give this game a 8 10 with it s weakest part being in the tactical field such as small battle maps but the strategic and grand strategic fields being where it shines the most with it s legacies and economy in coming dlc i hope ca sofia will expand on the maps section both bigger battle maps and new regions on the campaign map such as assyria babylon here are some of my experiences that i brought up in the communitybattle of akhetaten pharaoh for first time pharaoh as hittite kurunta
