2023 the developers of this game took an utterly mundane concept and made it both fun and relaxing with lots to do in it that alone would be good enough for me but they take it a step further by continuing to support this game with new locations and themed packs i really loved the spongebob story mode and the attention to detail on it was very charming i have nominated this game for a steam award
