2023 i have 117 hours in this game all on steam deck but it has been many months since i have played i opened the game a couple of months ago and found that i could not get a playable frame rate and good enough graphics at the same time which was weird because i did not have any problems before so i forgot about the game again for a while i now have the steam deck oled which has slightly better all round performance and find that the situation has not changed when i used to play i tried to do so as authentically as possible no hud no glowing tracks etc no assists no atv which are all cheating and limited fast travel and i had a great time i finished the entirety of yukon valley maybe half of all rancho content maybe half of cuatro colinas content and bits of other maps using 3 weapons packs the bloodhound and the tents dlc i never got around to playing the medved dlc that i bought but i may do so if the game runs better some day the game nails the atmosphere of certain locations though not necessarily on every part of each map and not in all weathers i have spent a lot of time in spain in real life and quatro colinas has areas and views that are distinctly evocative of parts of spain it is annoying that you have to download the entire new dlc map when one is released whether you will buy it or not which really eats away memory card space about 10gb per map which is not nothing the justification is that you can play all maps for free on other peoples servers but i would rather have the 50gb of disk space from the 5 maps that don t interest me at all the plot of each area is mostly just ways to try to justify gunning down the various species in the name of conservation or population control in reality the best technique is to re establish top predators typically having been wiped out by hunting not to kill them and the other kind of mission story tends to be improving facilities for the rich hunters who pay to hunt in the area though you never see them notably the free trophy lodge that they added a few months ago is absolutely atrocious apart from the view i wish i could get a refund for it i just thought i d mention that the african trophy lodge is ok but i would wait until you have a good number of actually worth displaying trophies before paying for a trophy lodge or you will end up with mostly empty rooms it s obviously not a perfect simulation but it s a good tracking and shooting game and a great price when on sale now fix it for the steam deck please
