2020 product received for free got my free steam copy since i own the game already on bethesda launcher i was an early adopter and played until level 25 until i became weirdly trapped in a mission and just stopped playing at all this is already some months ago with all the updates the npcs fallout 76 feels fresher and better than ever i played immediately 7 hours with my new steam character sure the performance could be more smooth better sure the game still looks blurry and the controls the gameplay shooting is not always very clean fallout 4 vr is for this reason my favourite since shooting is there the best in all of fallout games but put this aside fallout 76 is a good maybe not perfect game does it have the quality that most fans expected or desired certainly not is it however an enjoyable game absolutely music alone is so chill and you will wander for hours through the massively huge map give it a try
