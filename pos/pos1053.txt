2023 early access review tl dr one of the best zombie games i know 10 10it s hard to understand what can your character do so if you don t want to go on wiki grab all tools and try all buttons it s a type of game where the player defines story mods are reccomended but before installing try out vanilla game to get familiar with basic mechanics don t be sad if you character dies because it s inevitable this is how you died
