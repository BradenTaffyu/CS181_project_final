2023 steam ask me if i would recommend this game for other players stem must be wasted to ask me such a ridiculous question i mean duh it s fallout the real review after 500 hours in this masterpiece i can t say anything but that it was a blast it was a great time filled with great moments hilarious jokes lovely classic radio songs cool companions and a vast world with extensive exploration fights loot and endless quests and for the first time ever in fallout your protagonist is completely voiced taking a psycho during combat the protagonist will scream yeah it s cool it s a bird it s a plane it s a bug well yeah of course bugs are a part of any old bethesda games but nothing big nothing really game breaking one born every minute the game has one of the largest and most active modding communities ever seen for any game every minute new mods are created ranging from small text mods to massive total conversion modsmissing a hand the game is missing some old aspects from the old fallout games and two of the biggest ones are karma and the heavily rpg elements i understand that bethesda tried to make the game very casual friendly but it just doesn t fit in fallout fallout is a heavily rpg game and it should stay that way the score 9 5 10and 10 10 with mods yeah mods can fix anything even broken hearts fallout 4 a screenshot of fallout 4 by gendarme zero
