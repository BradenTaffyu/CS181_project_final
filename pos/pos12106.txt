2020 if you have plenty of money to burn are willing to invest lots of time to become proficient and competitive this is the best online racing sim available the game is insanely expensive with a 110 dollar a year subscription fee 50 discounts are regularly available on top of that it only comes with a few cars tracks to move up in ranks or progress to more advanced racing you will be required to spend 15 bucks per track and 12 dollars per vehicle easily rack up 150 bucks in a 12 week season i have probably spent north of 300 dollars just purchasing content in the past 6 months and have barely scratched the surface combine all this with needing a mid range wheel pedal shifter cockpit setup and you can easily see why it is not for the casual gamer the sim is no joke when folks say you have to practice it is not forgiving at all and unlike any of the other racing sims currently available once you have timing corner lines throttle control and braking control efficient the game can be very rewarding combine these factors with really advance car setup outside of fixed series i can see why many users get frustrated and bash the sim the online community can be both great and horrible at the same time i have had users give me driving technique instruction and tips on how to setup a sprint car for certain tracks it is extremely competitive which can also bring out the worst in people triggering the hot headed nature of competition the sim uses a no fault penalty system to try and keep everyone civil penalties cause your safety rating to go down stifling your ability to progress to higher license classes and more advanced racing the no fault system can be frustrating at times but it works really well in my opinion keeping your irating how well you place in races above 1500 will allow you to race with more skilled drivers resulting in cleaner racing and less chance for penalties get above 2000 and it gets really good vr support is excellent and makes this one of the most immersive games i have ever played overall if you have the commitment time and money for iracing it is well worth the investment they have the market cornered for what they provide
