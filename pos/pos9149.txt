2018 if you wanted a 4x game as i did the first third or so of any game will be exactly what you were looking for i ve played a couple of clones and stellaris with dlc remains the best of them definitely worth it though try it naked before you get any dlc because past the first 3rd or so once you ve explored most of the galaxy and met all the other empires the game takes on more of a grand strategy feel with the victor usually being determined by whoever has the best fleet composition the grand finale coming in the form of the crisis assuming you enable them the game is packed full of original lore as well as references to other popular works of science fiction from star trek to event horizon and gives you ample opportunity to explore its stories through the situation log in the top left i ve sunk many hours into the game and intend to sink in many more if you like me like to have something to look at while you watch tv or listen to podcasts stellaris is exceptional in that role once you ve gotten the hang of it compared to other paradox titles this one is comparatively easy to get the hang of if you ve played 4x games like sid meier s civilization you ll already be familiar with many of stellaris mechanics
