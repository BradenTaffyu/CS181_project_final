2016 after playing fallout 4 for more than 120 hours i think i can finally write my opinion about it but let s answer a few questions first is it the game of the century everyone hoped it to be no is it flawless no is it disappointing kinda is it good yes a million times yes well let s take a look at its pros and cons pros world design bethesda has always created amazing worlds and fallout 4 is no exception everything about world design is just perfect and can make you forget about fast traveling and go everywhere by foot character customization fallout 4 offers a very rich customization system you can customize every little detail on the character s face and with lots of clothing options you can truly create your own unique character power armors some may disagree with me but i freaking love the new power armor system it s finally something different than a normal armor and makes you feel like a true beast and as a catch they are limited by fusion cores yes i know it isn t really lore friendly crafting another thing i really loved about fallout 4 imo fallout 4 has the best crafting system in all of bethesda s game you can create and attach various mods on your weapons and some of them can turn your weapons into an entirely different one which is really great you can also create upgrades for your clothes and armors make chems and grenades and even paint your power armor and in near future make your own robot which is really nice combat though melee combat is still a bit clunky shooting people in the face is much smoother than before unlike fallout 3 and fallout new vegas combat is now tolerable and actually enjoyable without using vats voice acted protagonist this was a bit controversial but i m one of the people who actually liked this new addition in previous fallouts and elder scrolls it always annoyed me that my character didn t show the slightest of emotion now i feel like my character has a personality and is actually alive companions this is also my personal opinion and not everyone agrees with it i found all of them except preston garvey it s pretty obvious why much more likeable than new vegas and 3 s companions especially nick valentine the charming synth detective who is undoubtedly the best character in the game and one of the best in the entire series neutral the story let s face it fallout series isn t known for offering deep bioshock level stories though personally i found fallout 4 s story more interesting than the previous titles it still isn t anything special dialog the thing many hated in fallout 4 yes it does not offer multiple options like new vegas for example you can no longer use your intelligence or strength in conversations and only charisma checks remain also there are many instances which your character says the line in an entirely different tone than what the dialog wheel said the sarcastic option is the worst example sometimes it s just a joke sometimes it makes your character a complete with that being said it still didn t really bother me thanks to the voice acted protagonist i repeat this is just my opinion otherwise it would ve been in cons bugs i got to give some credit to bethesda this has to be the most polished and bug free game they have ever released though many people have faced a lot of bugs and glitches i only encountered two or three small bugs in my entire playthrough graphics and performance this is by no means the prettiest game in the world but it still looks really good despite some textures performance is ok most of the times but strangely the frame rate goes nuts in urban areas and i have a gtx 970 settlements i admit i was surprised by the settlement system it offers lots of options to make your own settlement and honestly it s very enjoyable but it suffers from a horrible horrible and horrible user interface it s so confusing that personally after playing the game for 120 hours i still haven t got the hang of it and i discovered many of the options in youtube videos cons simplified rpg mechanics unfortunately many of the game s famous mechanics were removed in fallout 4 no karma i was personally fine with it though no reputations no skills i hope bethesda does not continue this trend in their future games lack of choices my biggest problem with this game in previous fallouts there were lots of choices that really affected the world around you in a big way i mean you could see the consequences of every choices you made and they largely affected the ending that was the main reason i fell in love with fallout sadly that isn t the case with fallout 4 there are much less of them in the game and most of them have little to no impact in the world around you even the main choice you make in the game suffers from this problem i hope bethesda fixes this in the dlc overall despite some of the game s kinda annoying problems i really enjoyed fallout 4 and it s my 2nd favorite game of 2015 second to life is strange that masterpiece but i really hope that bethesda does not continue their trend of simplifying or as some of you would say dumbing down their game because it will hurt their future games more than fallout 4 and for s sake use a new engine my score 8 8 10
