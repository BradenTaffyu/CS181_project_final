2020 while it feels like this game has less content compared to sims 3 it runs better and the graphics are so much better its a great game overall but you should wait for it to go on sale the game and the million expansions it seems to be pumping out are way too expensive otherwise my recommended dlc are cats dogs adds pets city living offers the most fun neighborhood and a myriad of events in the city get to work adds more careers you can interact with fitness stuff because bodybuilding is life get together has my other favorite neighborhood allows you to form clubs with other sims
