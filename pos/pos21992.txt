2016 the sequel to dark souls 1 that we deserved i love the series and so let s get down to the things i dislike about the game rant begins rant ends with all that said dark souls 3 is a wonderful game and feels like a true successor to the original dark souls even if it doesn t quite manage to be as good as the first installment the controls feel amazing the enemy and boss design are as strong as ever if not stronger and the world and lore are worthy of the name weapon arts add an interesting layer to combat focus bars instead of spell casts as it was in demon s souls increase flexibility the music might just be the best in the series though that s obviously heavily subjective npcs have less dialogue overall but almost every single one of them has a questline to pursue in truth these may not feel like groundbreaking changes from the first game and really they aren t yet dark souls was never really about innovation for the sake of innovation but solid design polished to a mirror sheen and even though dark souls 3 has a few flecks of tarnish it is a fitting and satisfying closing to this beloved genre spawning series and even with it s flaws it s better than most games out there
