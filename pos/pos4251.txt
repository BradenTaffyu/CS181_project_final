2014 with almost 500 hours in this game and probably another 500 hours more that will come in the second one i feel like i can finally review it m b warband is unique in so many ways you truly just start with few gold and some weapons that s it from there you have to build your way to take over the world which is not as easy as it sounds there isn t much of a story in this game everything said above is pretty much it it lets you create and do what you want in the game world all you care about is take over the world kill everyone else how you choose to do so is up to you there are small quests within the game that will give you exp to level yourself up as well as your army with skills that will benefit either you your army or your entire kingdom this game is not something you buy for amazing graphics or amazing sound it is a game you buy for its depth and for the fun of leading grand armies to major battles and sieges i can honestly say after my 460 hours i haven t won the game not even once always made a mistake or didn t capture enough castles or even worse did get too many it is a game that has a deep connection with the middle and dark ages marry kill capture your way to conquer the world mount blade will live for a long long time and there are amazing mods all the time that get added to make the game even better the two important things you should add to get an amazing experience floris mod pack battle size two mods make it possible to have battles up to 600 units on both sides and it looks amazing seeing your proud army just clash and kill 100 s of other units is fun they also provide further more depth to the politics and basic gameplay of the game all in all m b warband is one of those games that proves that a game doesn t have to be all about graphics sounds or any flashy flashy stuff to make a truly unique and amazing experience that will keep you trapped for years so if you are looking for a game that will take your soul for 100s of hours grab this game for sure it is one of my favorites and is really one of those games that is 100 what you decide and make of it
