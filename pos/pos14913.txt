2021 early access review look something about my ape brain says when this monkey pushes dirt and the dirt falls down endorphins are released its physics to a fault since you can often go from a 60 fps scene to a 1 fps scene at the drop of one nuke tornado or black hole mod the core game is a puzzle thief blow em up but the mods and custom maps are where the game shines ray tracing is a novelty feature but you don t actually require ray tracing spesific hardware to run it really well
