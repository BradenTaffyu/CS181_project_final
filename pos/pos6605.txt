2013 for some reason my review got deleted even though i could still read the comments and it was marked not recommended instead of recommended no idea what happened there so this is my second review naturally i do highly recommend this game it s the best driving you don t race in it game i ve ever played initially i was turned off by this game because of the whole truck thing i love the idea of travelling hundreds of miles on an open ended map but i don t care much for trucks i d rather drive a car that said i tried out the demo hey i ve got nothing to lose and got hooked immediately while still not a totally realistic simulation of a truck driver i learned that driving a truck is nothing at all like driving a car but i had gotten used to it quickly gotta go wide when turning the best part of the game is when you re actually out on the road with your own mp3s playing or one of the many radio streams you can turn on and miles of open road in front of you ets 2 is the ultimate game to unwind if you re all stressed out from work etc play this game there s no aliens to kill or kittens to run over it s just you chilling out in your truck with your cargo if you have a delivery while singing animaniacs songs no really that s one of the music i listen to while on the road off key rain effects are really good although there s no other types of weather the maps aren t exact representations but they are perfectly balanced enough so that those long jobs say from warsaw to aberdeen don t feel that long cities aren t that interesting but you rarely spend much time in any anyway as you re mostly on the road going east the dlc adds much improved cities though some of the roads are questionable and there s no penalty for delivering cargo earlier than the scheduled time which are some of the little flaws in an otherwise excellent package form your own truck company buy trucks and hire drivers to drive those trucks expand by buying garages for your company take deliveries and earn experience and money or simply drive around in free roam and let your drivers do all the work ignore all the people who scoff at this game i haven t heard of anyone in forums etc who after playing the demo didn t buy it afterwards it s engrossing and the relaxation factor is high scs software has been making truck driving games for years so they sure know what they re doing ets 2 is the best of them all p s american truck simulator is in the works if it s anything like ets 2 it will be yet another excellent game
