2018 early access review 4 5 5 be it cars planes helicopters or if you want a fricking cannon you get it all in one sweet package dlcs not sold at all for a driving sim you don t want to drive here this game has exceptional play through time there are mods for cars engines engine sounds maps scenarios and mother truckin campaign missions so you ll never be out of something to try the community is always active and content is constantly pumped out by the devs the crashing physics is the usp of this game never have ever seen better crashes you can slow them down do them in moon gravity sun gravity and what else the crashing is what makes this game worth every penny the sheer amount of realism makes me wonder why this game isn t mainstream yet it looks the money and it give you a jolly time the only major problem is the graphics engine is still not optimized to the maximum extent it can play on potatoes but it ll crash the load time on maps are abysmal the menus freeze a lot but the game compensates it all for a good time overall this game is worth buying even in its early access stage you won t regret it
