2021 i know it was a total trashfire on release but if you re a fallout fan you should pick it up at this point it s a ton a fun and there s a ton of content at its current state it s a always a shame when publisher s force a dev studio to release before the game is finished but luckily development continued past release most of the game breaking bugs are gone not that there isn t still the occasional janky element but they are working on those too all in all i ve enjoyed my time on fo76 it took them longer then projected to get to a solid state of affairs but what was once promised is now delivered vgirl tiextinguish
