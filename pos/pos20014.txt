2019 fallout new vegas has honestly given me an experience that ive sought out in other fallout games but haven t been able to replicate the lore and characters in this world are so rich with obsidian isles writing and talent that the level of quality is hard to find in other titles aswell as ignoring the limitations of the older generation of fallouts and the bland dialogue that plagues the newer fallout titles like 4 and 76 great game highly suggest
