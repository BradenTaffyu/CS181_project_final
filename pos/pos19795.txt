2021 the definitive edition of the first part definitely did not look like a modern game it was nice but also clumsy and generally empty on the other hand the definitive edition of the second one with the original game mechanics and the preserved retro style is beautiful and very very full there is more content here than any ordinary mortal may need the ancient campaigns from the original game attract you with wrinkled fingers and the finished crowd is made up of a huge grayish collection of campaigns from a previous less ambitious remake the authors of the remaster knew very well what they were doing this can be seen not only in the cleverly composed new nations but also in the gameplay supplements camera zooming an indicator of what your building is currently producing clearly marked groups smarter labeling to automatically filter out villagers from the crowd showing the number of villagers mining each particular commodity possibility to automatically sow the harvested farm all these allowances are great as is the new way of entering the order line freedom of choice is unprecedented yes it s still basically the same somewhere deep inside just like a same knight and paladin they both ride horses they both have armor but one is stabbed by a guy with a blade on a stick while the other goes through the enemy like a blessed knife with cursed hellishly rancid butter wonderful new graphics and lots of game enhancements ensure that you enjoy a legendary medieval strategy like never before a relic that deserves to generate gold 60
