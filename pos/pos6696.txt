2020 this game is pure chaos i mean just the sheer brutality in the game is absolutely stunning from tire screeching from cars passing by to the air horns with their loud sounds this game does reflect the perfect truck simulator not only is the game beautiful but the mechanics behind the driving is awesome the community is so much less toxic compared to all other sims and companies the players here are old and new and are extremely friendly the driving are intense from the people talking with each other over the radio to trucks that you can drive the loading play is so in depth that it s a stick shift realism invested in this game is top tier not only is the game play amazing but i believe anyone can play it i say this because my pc isn t high level it s outdated with a low to medium build but even with the graphics to low medium the game still looks like tremendous only negative stuff that i would say is that you really have to grind to get items such as new parts trucks etc like hardcore grind but if you enjoy this game that shouldn t be a problem
