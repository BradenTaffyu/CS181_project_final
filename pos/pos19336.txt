2023 for fans of the first three age of empires games and their subsequent expansions and definitive editions this game is arguably a must have it s nothing revolutionary but it s another huge block of content for rts fans with new and interesting mechanics a visual style similar to aoe iii decent campaigns and another flawless soundtrack my only real criticism of the game is the civilisation mastery system which does become a rather tedious grind for completionists but otherwise it s exactly what people have likely come to expect of age of empires i think the best word to describe it would be consistent as it s another good entry to the series albeit not a perfect one
