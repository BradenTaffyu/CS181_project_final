2017 early access review all i have to say after 150 hours it manages to do nearly everything that dwarf fortress does on a far more accessible albeit smaller platform want to rule a over a colony full of people detailed individuals with their own daily routines people who live work and die by your command then get for the love of god man get this game now let me tell you a story its some pretty dark tbh in this game you can set traps turrets and killzones to protect your colony capture and recruit attackers capture and sell attackers capture attackers and harvest their organsi m particularly fond of the last option there because of the major ducats involved harvested organs net about 4x the amount of a live whole person in my most recent and prosperous colony i suffer from large scale tribal attacks frequently i mow them down easily with turrets and machine gun fire of course but it is a major inconvenience and it takes a long time to clean their mess up they even manage to kill a colonist once in a while so lately i ve taken to capturing as many as possible colonists then proceed to patch the surviving attacker s up before harvesting both of their eyes and releasing them its a sad and lowly fate but thats what they get after nearly 10 years of endless raiding profits have never been higher p s look i m not exactly proud of this but the mere fact that this is an option in the game proves that it can be played in a myriad of ways and is worth a try least edit a word
