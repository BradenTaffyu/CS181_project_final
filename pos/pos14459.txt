2020 recommend on sale fact is the game is great but only if you got gathering storm at minimum the base game is missing a lot of end game content and falls off a lot it s missing the climate and disaster system and the governors and loyalty that was introduced in rise and fall getting gathering storm gets you all those mechanics but that means it costs extra the full price base game just feels incomplete but overall it s well designed and fun to play
