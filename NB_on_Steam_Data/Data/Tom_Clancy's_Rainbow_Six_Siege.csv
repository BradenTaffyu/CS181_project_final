53574,2016 edit the starter edition mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists my approval still stands as a 30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time i ll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone i ll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that i was really into was titanfall causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers the starter edition is a smart implementation by ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many to be clear there is no difference between starter players and regular players besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new operators classes starter players play on the same servers as everyone else play on all the same maps and have all the same unlockable operators available as everyone else to explain how your starter game would begin i ll briefly explain how this game rather generously doles out content all maps and operators are free and included in patches the operators only being paid for in time played or with ubibucks if desired this makes the season pass practically useless on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map operator access which is now a six month or so privilege this means the player base isn t segmented and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the season pass or dlc that said the starter edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender along with enough ubibucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal everything you do in the game earns you renown which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins cosmetics starter players require about 12 000 renown to purchase an operator while regular players only need about 2 000 ubisoft calls this grinding to reach 12 000 but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn t feel like grinding to reach anything the reward is that the game is fun to play that being said i know that in game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing titanfall if there s to be things to unlock i m actually glad it is the operators in the 9 10 hours i ve mainlined since buying the starter edition i earned enough renown to purchase an on sale at 7 500 with a few thousand left over the grinding is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown and there s at least one operator on sale in rotation every week here s the thing though operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents my point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators you ll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and or bought a couple to see how they play that should be the clarifying out of the way i ve always wanted to try this game from a glance it looked like the evolution of cs go i ve waited years for without the harshness and indie mod nature of a game like insurgency and i wasn t far off like many people it was hard to justify a full 60 purchase when cs go is 15 and regularly goes on sale but ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me i want to address the issue of the full price for only multiplayer argument i don t see the issue as that was par for years ut 2k4 quake 3 arena etc especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here this game doesn t need a campaign the addition of a high budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single player content does in fact do there are 10 situations each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills gadgets and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into siege multiplayer there s also the option to play co op terrorist hunt as a lone wolf instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself i only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future the game already has deadly bots for other single player content and the possibility is definitely there why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter especially if you re experienced with them because nothing else on the market plays the way that siege does it is a slow game with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly the lean left right buttons are essential to leaning around corners the time to die is extremely fast with 1 3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading it might be a slow pace at times but it causes a white knuckle tension that i haven t seen matched it s thrilling to rappel up the side of a building toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that s made me cheer out loud sometimes siege is like action shooter chess a game that s simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master a high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay it may not be for you but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen the port if it even is a port is excellent offering all the options that pc players expect to scale from low end to high end rigs it has 2 unique aa solutions an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub pixel aliasing and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies msaa between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies it has built in twitch streaming features it natively supports xbox 360 1 controllers and dualshock 4 offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable basically the devs understand pc gaming and this is no hobbled ps4 port this is also the first time that i ve had to deal with uplay it s annoying i guess to have a second client launch on top of steam but that s all i notice of it it doesn t crash it doesn t use up multiple gbs of ram it doesn t install adware and it didn t give me or my computer or my family aids i was expecting at least some of that based on what i ve heard but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game a minor annoyance at worst for me so that was a of words and i might sound like i m gushing but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it the 15 entry made it possible for me to play and i wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you re getting into can t wait to put in even more hours,259.8,638.0,34,Recommended,"June 3, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"DrunkonEstus

53637,2018 this game is fun if you re into competitive and fps games just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game don t get the starter edition you only get like 2 operaters one per side and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest which is just time consuming its best to get the standard edition if you re on a lower budget you get all the base game operators which is 10 per side so 20 in total the community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5 you will all have a good time sound matters in the game any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map there are so many ways to enter breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun you may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms i hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works have fun playing it update this is my fault as of march 6th 2018 ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now 3 per side so if you d like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators including dlc year operators for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown in game currency then go ahead summary good game boys get it now,658.3,333.0,16,Recommended,"August 7, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"HEIMER

53643,2020 initially i started playing rainbow six siege back when it was released i absolutely loved the game especially as a fan of competitive shooters like cs go i have since then came back to rainbow six siege multiple times as it s just a blast with friends rainbow six siege is a tactical shooter where one team defends and the other one attacks at the start of each round the defenders get time to set up their defense while the attackers get time to scout the level and see how the defenders are setup both attackers and defenders have multiple operators 52 total at the moment of writing that can be bought with points that are earned in game each operator has it s own weapons as well as gadgets that require a unique play style the cool part about this is how in depth everything is all these weapons gadgets and maps make sure you never know what to expect and always need to adjust and work together with your team not only this but it s just awesome to zip line on buildings blast through roofs and sneak around in all the different maps the graphics are good especially for an older game and sound design is amazing sound also makes up for a big part of the gameplay as listening to footsteps can be crucial so to sum it up would i recommend this game yes ofcourse but you do have to like competitive shooters however good to note is that this game relies less on pure aim then games like cs go as it s more about strategy,435.9,328.0,17,Recommended,"February 11, 2020",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Colonel Patrick Sanders

53647,2017 i am not sure if you noticed but i don t play multiplayer first person shooters at all with the exception of games like tf2 that i played a long time ago and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up i mostly avoid it because i suck at these sorts of games i have terrible aim terrible reaction time terrible eyesight and add in a pinch of just being plain crap so why this and better question if i am so bad how can i even possibly do well and recommend this game well i started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them everyday they would ask me to buy the 20 version of the game so i could play with them keep in mind this was maybe 5 6 months after the game launched so i know it had a rough launch and was not well received eventually i just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore i played some matches i was understandably bad as expected sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing it is just a fact of life the game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though so i kept with it until i unlocked some new operators to try out after unlocking them i was also bad with them i messed up bad felt embarassed wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone but i stuck with it learned and was to a lesser degree a useful member of the team as long as i got whatever my operator ability was used up i could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team i tried things out practiced more got better tried new things where did that put me well my aim is still bad i still miss obvious stuff and i still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me but what i did learn was that you can still win with better tactics instead of always needing more skill see i just need an extra half full second if i can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time i stand a chance with better tactics you can usually counter many skilled players thats how i can get the success i have had in this game it feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming reaction time skill the game is good and has only gotten better over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on and the new characters are always a treat to use the only thing that has gotten worse is the community with all the csgo kids moving over to playing siege but that is tolerable at the very least as for which game pricing option to get the 20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it if you do you can spend 40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators thus equalling the normal game purchese price meaning no net loss for you it is what i did so in other words i highly recommend it coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters i think that is saying a lot,683.7,801.0,75,Recommended,"November 4, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Riko~Nyaa

53686,2020 rainbow six siege this is a game with which you will have a love hate relationship you will enjoy what this game has to offer but you will also hate it when you see your favorite operator getting nerfed this is not your average competitive fps shooter like cod where you can go guns blazing with a good aim i have 864 hours on csgo highest rank achieved lem and even csgo s learning curve isn t as steep as this game s intel is paramount in this game the more intel you have the higher the chances of winning and because of this unique nature of the game the player base is forced to learn the mechanics and strategies to play decent enough with over 56 operators to choose from different units you get to be flexible with your strategies these 56 operators are divided into two parts attackers and defenders there are three playable scenarios in multiplayer pvp and they are bomb defuse hostage retrieval and secure area these three modes can be played in different game modes such as newcomer quick match formerly casual unranked mode with ranked rules but doesn t affect the rank and ranked attacker s objective is to strategize their entry points and devise a plan to fulfill the mission objective and defender s objective is to deny attackers this game will force you to gather intel before entering any room or else you might just get interrogated by caveira a defender op whose ability is silent steps and she can interrogate you in game after you are downed to reveal the real time location of your team members i struggled initially but slowly i understood how this game is meant to be played the community is toxic people will kick you in quick matches curse you but then again turn off the chat and focus on improving yourself important if you are a newcomer get a team of 4 players with you and play along with them it s essential to note that you don t want to be discouraged but if you do in fact want to improve then play with good people and squad up with them add me if you want to play with my friends and me we are an absolutely chill and relaxed clan and few of my friends will even teach you the basic gameplay mechanics and op gadgets placements and working i love this game and i love how it s just getting better and better with that being said i ll end this here and hope this helps anyone who is just starting in this game here s what one of the most renowned csgo youtuber has to say about rainbow six siege rainbow six siege is more tactical than shooter you spend more time collecting intelligence and setting up for the battle than actually battling clicking on people is easy but figuring out how to counter elaborately set up defenses that change every single round that s the meta thewarowl,525.5,341.0,22,Recommended,"May 30, 2020",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Disistripsy

53755,2023 hi there i am a chinese player i am writing this comment in english because i just want to explain what is going on with r6 these days in china and why ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from chinese players out of sudden of course what i am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding i definitely do not mean to represent all chinese players for the record i am not really fond of pvp like games but i still bought the complete version of rainbow six siege part of the reason as you all know is for the green discount mark made by fatty g chinese nickname of gabe newell for another part of the reason is about the topic that i am going to address first we shall start with some background information about a chinese company called tencent as you may already know wechat and qq are two of tencent s most famous products for you guys who don t you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages from my personal view i d say four out of five chinese people use wechat and or qq so that makes a billion letting alone foreigners these two products bring quite a lot of convenience to chinese people yet tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in chinese internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation so basically video game is its most heated debating part there are still a lot of chinese people however spending their wages in tencent games as they curse its unfairness why i think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon the first reason from my humble understanding relates to chinese social structure the middle classes make the most part in chinese society while it may seem to be natural to some countries it brings problem in china due to the large population and limited resources chinese people have to compete with each other at schools we compete for the access to better educations at companies we compete for higher salaries at governments we compete for stronger power time for me to shut up as a result winners are few and losers makes the major so when it comes to games many in case of misunderstanding i dare not to use the word most but i really want to chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game like spending money in the pay to win games which most tencent games are based on like cheating methods again i personally feel sorry for what s happening in pubg although i barely play it and i do not cheat for the record i just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding i do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat the second reason is basically like what is happening to nba 2k 18 it receives only less than 30 positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they ve seen the bad comments which means a monopoly is happening here right steam is like a shadow region in china so literally it is not a legal platform in the mainland of china using this convenience tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games for instance call of duty series we chinese people cannot reach the access to its steam store because of tencent and what is worse tencent itself launched a game called call of duty online and when it comes to online you should know that it is a game that is for free to play but costs to win you ve got to pay for stronger weapons i mean it is still ok if you pay for skins right but since it is a fps competitive game i do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons it is bound to break the balance of the game similar things happened in need for speed online you pay for faster cars to beat other players and naruto online you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players not to mention numerous tencent self made games pay to win is everywhere and now ubisoft china has just announced that tencent got the dealership of r6 chinese r6 players began to worry they are worried about whether they will be region locked they are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken it should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to r6 in china is still unknown thus it is to some extent unfair for ubisoft to receive so many negative comments yet it is important for ubisoft to pay more attention to chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don t want it to become the next online product of tencent thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad english if you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections please feel free to discuss,422.4,267.0,17,Recommended,"January 2, 2023",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,ඞSILLY.SUSඞ,False

53767,2022 the hog rider card is unlocked from the spell valley arena 5 he is a very fast building targeting melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage he appears just like his clash of clans counterpart a man with brown eyebrows a beard a mohawk and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog a hog rider card costs 4 elixir to deploy strategyhis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an ice golem in a push at the same time he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as goblins as he still has a fair amount of health most cheap swarms complement the hog rider well as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent s hand the hog rider struggles with swarms as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender s part though be wary of spells a hunter can kill the hog rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it however if you place something in front of the hog rider the hunter s splash will damage the hog rider and hit the card in front of it more the hog rider in conjunction with the freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the hog rider to deal much more damage than anticipated especially if the opponent s go to counter is a swarm or swarms are their only effective counter to him skeletons and bats will immediately be defeated by the spell while spear goblins goblins and minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up zap or giant snowball however this strategy isn t very effective against buildings as the hog rider will take a while to destroy the building giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter against non swarm troops it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush for this reason players should either only go for a hog rider freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible it is not a good idea to send in a hog rider simply to destroy a building especially if it is the only building targeting unit available as defeating crown towers becomes substantially more difficult spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective the exception to this is an elixir collector placed in front of the king s tower if a hog rider placed at the bridge he can destroy the collector for a positive elixir trade though the damage from both princess towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them however if the opponent sends in defending troops it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value in a deck with several low cost cards it might be worth it to simply send the hog rider against one building these decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough that they will arrive to their next hog rider before the next building arrives in the opponent s card rotation long ranged troops like musketeer and flying machine can snipe those buildings preserving some of the hog rider s health possibly allowing it to get some tower damage when there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the hog rider understanding the placement of the hog rider and the type of building placed can help the hog rider to bypass certain buildings passive buildings such as spawners and elixir collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent s side then it is impossible for the hog rider to bypass that placement as the hog rider will get pulled to that building defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent s side a hog rider placed at the very left or right side of the arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox if the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena and the opponent tries to bypass it with a hog rider at the edge of the arena they can use certain air troops to push the hog rider towards the building as it jumps over the river effectively denying the bypass attempt they must be already hovering over the correct placement as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique for bats skeleton dragons and minion horde they should be placed right in front of the hog rider as soon as it is deployed for minions skeleton barrel mega minion flying machine electro dragon baby dragon inferno dragon balloon and lava hound stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the hog rider is placed on the left side of the arena and vice versa they can also use ground troops to achieve the same result something like an ice golem deployed at the hog rider s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the crown tower the hog rider can kite very fast non building targeting troops due to his own very fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge slightly into the opposite lane he can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge he will pull them towards him while deploying and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge after landing he will pull them back this can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending it will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push a tornado placed on the second tile front of the player s king s tower and staggered two tiles towards the princess tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the princess tower helping them in defending future pushes this can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a princess tower but doing this more than three times may result in the king s tower s health being low enough to be targeted directly opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown a better alternative is to pull the hog away from the princess tower into the attacking range of all three crown towers which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracteda very powerful combo is the hog rider the musketeer and the valkyrie typically referred to as the trifecta the musketeer will defend against most troops while the valkyrie can protect her and the hog rider from swarms or high damage units the hog rider is used to deal damage to the tower this can be effectively countered by lightning one shotting the musketeer and severely damaging both the valkyrie and hog rider the minion horde is also effective but the enemy can zap them and the musketeer will one shot them all even if the musketeer is defeated the hog rider and valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the tower the hog rider should be placed behind the valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the hog rider protecting it a hog rider combined with a goblin barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against timing it so that the hog rider is tanking the tower shots for the goblins is the most effective way to deal damage however a barbarian barrel can shut this down with minimal tower damage for a positive elixir trade as long as the goblin barrel was placed directly on the tower,131.1,501.0,193,Recommended,"February 16, 2022",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"dougstaro

53774,2018 you know when you are bored so you decide to write an in depth review about one of you re favrouite games well here it is bare in mind that this review is aimed for new players starting out intro tom clancy s rainbow six siege is a tactical first person shooter where it excels in intense 5v5 highly competitive close quarter combat rainbow six siege or r6s is one of the most inovative first person shooters focusing highly on teamwork to gather information and take out your foes operators in r6s players will have a choice of operators to pick from before a match starts these operators have to be unlocked through in game currency called renown that is earned by completing matches completing terrorist hunt missions and finally by successfully completing challenges that are given daily in game as well as weekly in the uplay overlay anyway depending on the edition of the game you bought you will start of with some default operators usually easy to use for begginers every operator in the game has its own unique special ability or main gadget these gadgets in the right hands can aid you and you re team to victory ubisoft done a great job adding personality into these characters all which have their own voice actors and quotes in game all of the operators come from well know counter terrorist units that are active around the globe ctus such as the sas gign and fbi swat and many more are all featured in this game the devs are always coming up with new operators and they always surprise me with what the release in terms of new gadgets attack the attackers in r6s must work together to secure an objective that is situated inside a building when the match begins attackers will have some time to prepare the attack by scouting the area using remote controlled drones that can be used to relay intel to you teamates by spotting enemies and finding the objective attackers may use their drones as much as they like as long as they have not been destroyed by the defenders when the preperation phase has finished the attacking team will now be able to enter the building and fight their way to the objective every attacking operator can scale the map by rapelling up and down to get better angles or reach a roof balcony finally attackers have exclusive equipment that can also help them to secure objectives such as claymores to watch you re back smoke granades to cover lines of sights and frag flash granades to flush out defenders in the objective defend defening in r6s is always different many maps have their own characteristics and defenders must adapt to defend specific rooms while the attackers are droning in preperation phase defenders have to fortifiy their position by reinforcing walls that can be breached and destroying attackers drones to prevent them from gathering intel when playing as a defender in r6s players may conjure different playstyles roaming where a player will run around the map trying to harras attackers before they make their way to the objective or just simply holding you re ground in the objective room and watching angles this all depends on what operators have been picked furthermore defenders are also have exclusive equipment that can can be deployed a deployable shield can be placed in doorway to force enemies to vault over and reducing their accuracy slightly or they can be used for mobile cover barbed wire is a excellent choice to gather information through sound and to also slow down the attackers c4 or nitro cells can be used to blow up you re oponents remotely it can be stuck to surfaces to blow up walls and ceilings too finally defenders have access to impact granades which instantly explode when they make contact with a player or wall they are usually used to create rotation holes in and around the objective maps environment r6s has a vast selection of maps where different tactics are required a typical map will consist of three floors basement b first floor f1 and second floor f2 each map contains destructible walls that can be destroyed and penetrated by both teams higher caliber weapons will siginficantly increase the damage to a given surface shotguns are a great choice to quickly open up hatches or holes in the wall every season a new map is added and it reflects the new operators that come with it for example with the new operators being spanish the new map will be featured in spain gamemodes there are only three gamemodes in r6s secure area where attackers must access a specific room and hold it for a certain amount of time defenders can contest the objective if they are together with the enemy its very similar to hardpoint from other games if you wish but it stays in one place hostage where the defenders must prevent the attacking team to capture the hostage and extract it outside the map if the hostage is killed by an attacker the defenders win the round but if a defenders decide to execute the hostage for any reason then the atacking team will win the round finally we have bomb where one attacker is equiped with a diffuser that is needed to diffuse one of the two chemical bombs that the defenders are protecting when the diffuser is planted defenders must act quickly to destroy the diffusing device by approching it and holding the interact button attackers will win if the diffuser completes its job or all the defenders are dead community this is in time of writing the 4th most played game on steam the r6s community is a mixed bag so to say i personally came accross amazing teammates which i have become good friends with online there are a lot of friendly players that you will come across that will communicate with you and praise you for doing the same and playing well however you will also encounter trolls and toxic players in this game but ubisoft s anti cheat battleye is constantly banning toxic players that have been reported for toxic behaviour such as intentional teamkilling and constant use of homphobic slurs and racism in chat if you encounter those people just igonre and report them they will almost guaranteed to be banned since the devs have took toxicity seriously in this game recently cons although the game is very well optimised it suffers from hit registration problems where headshots are key in this game as they will instantly kill you players like myself have become quite frustrated when you land a headshot and it just does not connect in some cases you can hit an enemy see blood come out but they will take no damage you will know this becaue when they kill you the kill cam will display the killers health however ubisoft is working hard and they are implementing a better system to help with sight missalignment to provide the best hit reg moreover there are some minor bugs when it comes to the ragdoll physics of the game some dead bodies may spaz out and have their arms or legs elongated although its not gamebreaking most of the significant glitches that players exploited have been fixed such as the shield operator no recoil glitch that was found by accident conclusion to summarise i would higly recommend tom clancy s rainbow six siege to all fps lovers take your time to learn the maps and operators there are lots of guides out there and videos that explain how to play as each operator this game is absolutely amazing when played with friends so don t be shy to make some in game bartozy,814.6,124.0,17,Recommended,"May 25, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"BartZ

53778,2016 i am gonna go ahead and compare rainbow six siege to cs go like many others do but there s a good reason for that to give you an understanding of my transition to siege you must know that i ve played over 1 600 hours of cs go on this account and another 600 on my smurf account to this day i think that cs go is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made but at this point it has been heavily malnourished by its creators and in turn the community what i love about cs go is the factor of skill a testament to a good game is that you get better at it the more you play and cs is or was just that that was when the only thing that mattered in the game was how good of a player you are but that has changed a long time ago cs go has become a money making machine and nothing more valve has proven to not give a crap about the everyday player by having an anti cheat system that is beyond broken for a company that makes so much money you d think that protecting the game from cheaters would be their priority it isn t the priority is new cases skins simply just more ways to make more money i came to a point where i had to pay an additional 7 a month for esea to properly play cs go but i gave hope of supporting a game that is simply heading nowhere and i m not going to dwell deeper into the community anyone who has ever played the game will know how toxic immature and unpleasant it is after i gave up hope on counter strike i started looking for a shooter that would replace it i ve tried many insurgency battlefield call of duty well i had to try to no avail because even though i had fun playing those games they were all missing something something that would keep me there for longer and then i found siege even though i m only about 90 hours into the game i already know i m going to keep playing for a lot lot longer it has everything i was looking for skill factor check good maps mostly and a lot of ways to approach a situation check customisation that doesnt require you spending hundreds of dollars check with siege you get to appreciate the hours you put into it because the game might be easy to get into but it requires a lot of hard work to master and that makes it a good shooter it plays however you want it to play either fast paced or a slower tactical approach and it rewards you for actually using your brain i was never a big fan of ubisoft but with this and the few hours i played of for honor they re finally heading in the right direction so if you re tired of cs go and you re looking for a replacement try siege if you give it enough time to realise the depth of the game i m certain you will not be disappointed,336.3,297.0,17,Recommended,"December 17, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,SNEK,False

53786,2021 this game is kind of a mixed bag for me i think the golden age of the game is at 2018 19 gameplay is unique the designs of the operators are fun without being too out there for a rainbow six game and there are two new operators a new map and new guns every season the game was balanced and changes are made only when needed it was when i spent the most time in the game but after that things kinda went downhill with only one new operator each season with sci fi level designs next to none new weapons bunch of whatever new gadgets an unnecessary amount of map reworks questionable nerfs and buffs and weird story element i just care less and less about the game don t get me wrong the gameplay is fundamentally still siege and it is undoubtedly fun but i think the new dev team kinda blew what the original team established for new players i would still recommend it because of how different this game offers gameplay wise comparing to other fps titles but it is probably time for us the older players to move on,855.0,111.0,2,Recommended,"October 16, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Fiercedeity

53788,2021 i ve enjoyed this game ever since alpha it was the perfect fit for competitive non toxic fun 5v5 attack defend gameplay that had me coming back every day just to meet new friendlies we even replayed against the same guys over and over again just because we had a good time then the toxic players started rolling in and ubi started monetizing the fact the player base started rising we got more and more cosmetics bordering the line of tom clancy realism we started seeing operators that could ve come from an overwatch drawing board we saw countless downgrades to lights textures animations effects you name it they downgraded it just because they thought adding cosmetics would keep the game alive now i have not played siege since year 2 season 3 until today and boy oh boy is the game far from what it once started as in an extremely bad way there is no heart or love when playing the game everyone is way too serious in casual the game looks like it has regressed in finesse and quality house is gone i seriously loved this game and i have over 600h combined on both uplay and steam i loved coming home booting siege up doing strat roulette and laughing together with the other team via chat it lost that the good times now it s just a husk of what once was and i m disheartened to see such a great game fall into the limbo that is extremely mediocre and catered to all other mainstream media kinda poetic if you think about it,266.5,149.0,4,Not Recommended,"August 5, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Fhil

53797,2022 i am going to give this a negative review and i will explain why this is a tough review for me as i have a love hate relationship with this game and its developer i cannot recommend this game to anyone that has never played it before i can only advise that you steer clear and find something more enjoyable to play and sink your time into when i first purchased this game at release 7 or so years ago the game was in a great place ubisoft were steadily adding maps operators and fixing bugs and exploits to the satisfaction of the community at the time they seemed really engaged with their community and player base matches were exciting and enjoyable the maps were reasonably balanced as were the operators the player base was growing albeit with some toxicity in the chat and the odd cheater you ran in to but this was always going to happen with a popular game fast forward to now and its a completely different game firstly map reworks for majority of the maps have been slapped together hell some of them make absolutely no sense operators have mostly gone the overwatch valorant route with space age abilities player skill based match making is just plain strange every single game you enter is either toxic in chat someone upset because someone has killed them and resorting to insults and being toxic or just doing it for the hell of it team killing is still an issue despite attempted deterrents cheating has become much worse during free weekends it s at its peak and out of control and these people seemingly are able to do this for a long time before any action is taken the same applies for people playing out of region with 200 plus ping bogging down latency network issues are still a thing despite server moves from google to amazon servers in fact this seems worst hit reg can be non existent at times despite the kill cam showing otherwise you squelching bullets into someone s face when they magically turn around and hit you once with a headshot out of nowhere despite the fact you re landing shots first even showing this on kill cam customer support is pointless copied and pasted replies and even with a single ticket you end up speaking to different people throughout the conversion which frustrates and confuses things further feels bot like i still find the whole ban click system very strange ubisoft claim to investigate on a case by case basis when you 1 click a player in game but it s already been exposed that they go off pure volume of reports without checking this this i m sure leads to many innocent people on the receiving end of bans for breaching the terms of service ubisoft once a great company with in previous experience great games and customer service now just copy and paste queens only interested in greed generating revenue to fund more copy and paste game titles and badly thought out game changes a terrible greedy company with a non existent customer service focused attitude i feel sad for the employees despite my negativity and experiences of the above i must confess i still play this game from time to time i think it s some form of stockholm syndrome as a small part of me believes things will change and they will eventually see the error of their ways sadly deep down i know this won t be the case if you haven t bought this game yet please don t it s a train wreck invest your time and hard earned cash in something else,445.5,341.0,20,Not Recommended,"October 1, 2022",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Karl

53814,2016 this is a long review from someone who has played the game since release reached high ranks in ranked mode gold ii and seen some turn to diamonds i m reviewing siege in terms of its current state july 2016 also i m too lazy to proof read so excuse any typos grammar errors summary siege is an online only game i ve played this game since it s release and i can definitely say i recommend this game to a certain audience simply this is a tactical shooter where patience truly is a virtue i can see how some players may find this frustrating compared to other popular fast paced shooters but in my perspective i feel they are completely different genres using the same elements of game play for instance you ll find yourself crouching 80 of the time to avoid detection and remain out of sight of the apposing team in my experience this is the best tactic to use when starting out which again may be frustrating for some now for the issues which i personally have come across and still exist note that there have been bug and minor gameplay fixes i e increased mute s jammer range people hiding in certain spots of the map which cannot be accessed on the other end issues hackers the obvious issues which i ve come across while playing of course are the hackers the new anti cheat system has potential and i encourage ubisoft to keep improving fairfight in some cases hackers are still getting away even when five players report suspicious behavior there have been times where the other team was co operative enough to boot the player who s using hacks in ranked it s much less likely to happen because the team you start with is the team you end with despite popular opinion i ve found most of the player base non toxic compared to its first release what i ve noticed however are that majority of hackers are around the gold and beyond ranks of siege meaning casual and early points of ranked are relatively hacker free fps drops on yacht one map maybe this is just me but for some reason i m guessing due to the snowy environment my fps drops from 60 to 25 30 in this map amd radeon 380 4gb vram 8gb ram 6 core amd processor for the curious this seems to only happen on yacht but i ve read that some have similar issues on other maps otherwise i m running siege on almost highest settings available pricing i bought the game full price on it s release and haven t regretted it however i can see how intimidating it is for the general consumer being 70 cad for basically two game modes split into random objectives on both bomb secure and hostage this i believe is the biggest issue since i ve come across the same players in the game over a span of days weeks and to my surprise months which i m fine with but going somewhere with this the price pretty much lowers population of the siege community and i fear once the game gets a price drop siege will become irrelevant thus a dying community the starter edition which is gone now i think did help boost player base but in game currency the grind the starter edition is a massive grind let me explain i m totally fine with the system siege has for unlocking weapon skins headgear and other aesthetics but i bought the regular edition meaning i don t get access to new and upcoming operators for free on their release where instead i must collect in game currency reknown to unlock them which is arguably fair regular operators in other words classes are easy and fast to buy new ops cost much much more unless you buy them with real money to skip ahead season pass gold edition etc 2k vs 25k each match typically rewards 200 450 depending how well you did to put this into perspective i ve only bought two of the four new operators in my 160 hrs of playtime although i ll be fair to say i spent 20k on aesthetics but still 160 hrs and i havent unlocked all operators the good graphics sound beautiful and stunning it s such a great success that the game gets little more challenging when i m playing in a daytime vs nighttime map because it becomes hard to focus your sights indoor vs outdoor other than yacht i ve had smooth performance in the game in almost max settings the game emphasizes on sound which really got me hooked on the game 9 10gameplay very well done and is slowly improving as updates come maps are as destructible as possible meaning you can blast through walls barricades windows floors whathaveyou pretty much anything made of wood no mini map no kill streak garbage and the only info on your hud are bullet count available items to use and compass bugs have been fixed however some do linger and some operators obtained improved gadgets traits for pvp given you re playing people with a similar skill set it s very fun and intense you re more likely to win by communicating than staying silent i e rather than complaining about your death you instead notify your team of the position of the opposing players and what you think they re planning even in death you can be useful by navigating cams pve terrorist hunt is also fun but i use that game mode to blow off steam in some cases can be challenging but again patience is a virtue don t run around i use some nice high quality headphones which help gameplay drastically you can sometimes hear enemies at the other side of a wall where you can shoot through if you have a co operative team all the better guns are great however there are a small amount of op guns which need nerfing particularly guns new operators use 9 10community despite popular opinion and not taking in hackers in consideration i like the siege community yes during it s first months there had been much unnecessary talking and team killing don t get me wrong though i m fine with people boasting about their wins however people look stupid after talking while playing on casual save it for ranked bud anyways when i play casual i try my best to give new players tips and ideas which mostly have respected and taken in consideration but i don t let the bad apples spoil the bunch the sense of community is a big deal to me in siege because of it s co operative aspect listen to teammates follow them if you aren t sure what to do which i always remind people don t yell on your mic cause you ran in my line of fire therefore don t be a lastly sometimes i ve come across teams which just don t want to communicate at all but that s just casual casual vs ranked really does feel like a different type of community 7 10overall i like that ubisoft hasn t forgotten about this game and are at least doing somethings to improve it even since release i ve been able to avoid ignore issues which were first introduced in the game and still am because they re manageable it s super fun rewarding challenging realistic ish and my favorite tactical shooter i recommend this game but not at it s full price given the content and how likely you are to stick with the game be aware though that for a good experience you re hardware may need to be of some quality but this seems to be the standard for aaa games nowadays i give this game a confident 9 10 at a sale price,512.1,156.0,10,Recommended,"July 4, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Super.C0,False

53835,2016 rainbow six is back with a new title and it s only multiplayer but will you want to play it rainbow six siege the new game in the rainbow six series this game rose up from the ashes of what once was rainbow six patriots the game is set in current times where the fight against terrorism is full blown out terrorist are conducting massive attacks around the world and you play as either the terrorists or the rainbow unit which consists of worldwide response units as stated before the game has no story whatsoever the only thing you can do solo is a situation mode which teaches you the basics of the game and the incredibly fun terrorist hunt mode the game has one story mission which is online only which tasks you to go to a us college and defuse a toxic bomb the mission is notable because it obscures your vision with toxic gas and you need to work as a team to defuse the bombs cause the mission is really difficult the ai for solo mode is not stupid so you won t be able to rambo the entire map you will have to be smart with your actions since the ai is pretty smart they change up they re routes and will try to flank you and rush you any chance they get they re aim is pretty good as well now for the reason you might want to buy the game the pvp trust me when i say this the game is no joke this game is incredibly difficult and doesn t hold your hand you will need to work as a team if you want to win a well placed shot will take you out and a well planned attack might earn you a sweet victory the game suits many play styles from a support who helps out teammates in the field to a pyromaniac who likes to blow up everything in sight you will definitely find an operator that suits you the best even though there s not many maps each map is very dynamic it s big enough for you to defend but no matter what remember you are never safe you can destroy almost every wall ceiling or floor so you never feel safe no matter how good your defenses are the game has one major flaw and that s the horrible servers the servers are way too unpredictable at one moment they work fine the other they won t give you any money or won t even load you to the game ubisoft stated that they are working on fixing this issue so i trust them to get it sorted out the game is optimised incredibly well it runs at 60 fps maxed out if you have a high end pc you will have no trouble running this game in the end do i recommend the game yes i do i do suggest at the very least waiting for the server issue to be fixed and you have one of the best squad based games ever made get a few friends for the ride and you have one incredible game on your hands final rating 9 10 a must own after servers are fixed if you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review for more reviews follow snort s review curator page here follow for regular updates on reviews for other games,155.9,358.0,19,Recommended,"January 6, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Snort Cannon

53844,2022 depending on who you are this could be a really good game it s a perfect storm for toxicity but i feel like it also has a huge amount of potential for the same reasons a lot of people hate r6 for good reason but if this is the game for you then it really is for you pros game basically has limitless potential there s just so much to do strategy wise can be extremely fun with friends frequently goes on sale for 8 which is a pretty fair asking price imo frequent updates content occasional free weekends cons extremely toxic sometimes game was made with the sole purpose of raising your blood pressure unless you play escape from tarkov regularly you will probably find r6 stressful to some degree can be really frustrating sometimes even if you normally enjoy r6 insanely large learning curve you are much less likely to enjoy this game if you don t have friends to play withi think r6 is more of a strategy game than a shooting game and there is a lot of strategy to unpack between the operators you pick the map the way you interact with the map how you work with your team and what the other team does there are tons of unique ways to solve any given problem i have dreams of playing this game the strategy is fun and this is all ten times more true if you have a group of friends to play with that being said r6 is not for everyone randoms are toxic the game is inherently stressful there s a huge learning curve and it takes a very long time to figure out what s happening valorant s 5 minute tutorial is enough to get you into a game it takes 5 minutes of searching online after you lost a round of r6 to figure out why the floor blew up below you the moment you entered a room with no visible traps you likely won t see what makes r6 so good within the 2 hour return window and if you ll want to return it before then it s understandable if you re looking for a casual experience and aren t used to playing competitive games casually this won t be a walk in the park it s stressful and people are sweaty once you know what all the 60 operators do and what all the maps are like and which walls are destructible and if you have friends watching cameras for you your chance of cardiac arrest goes down but getting to that point takes some time tldr if you re looking at this game and you think you ll like it do you have a couple friends to play with this is the most important are you ready for a very big learning curve are you okay with playing a stressful game watch a tutorial on how to play the game just so you know what you re getting into maybe watch a tutorial on 1 2 operators you re interested in still feeling good if you answered yes to all of these questions r6 goes on sale for as low as 8 if you re still on the fence there are occasionally free weekends keep tabs on the game and try it out with friends when it s free to play there s a 50 chance this game will mess you up and a 50 chance you ll find it really interesting hopefully this helps you figure out which half you re a part of,556.3,100.0,8,Recommended,"April 9, 2022",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Tuna43

53947,2017 people are going to ask me dude how the hell you can review this game when you got less than 100 hours and i actually can understand you at some point but this is my first impression from the game as the time passed on i pretty much got bored of playing cs go all the time and really wanted to find a new game that based on similar concept and my friend told me you really should try r6s for sure cs go is not the same as r6s but they pretty much got one thing in common it requires a lot of strategy and teamwork in order to win matches gameplay by my own experience most of the time the gameplay was feeling kinda slow but that s how it s supposed to be i guess as this game requires strategy and careful planning or you pretty much going to die and you know that you did a huge mistake and as a result you got punished by the game but at the same time it feels rewarding since you learning from it and trying not to do the same thing again community i have already experienced lots of toxicity and many other things from different games that i m playing at the moment such as cs go overwatch and league of legends and i thought it would be quite the same on r6s as well well i was actually really surprised now of course nobody is going to avoid toxicity since people with anger management issues would play the game and i have met some toxic people on this game but most of the time i have got matched with people who actually know how to play the game and also being very helpful for the new players you know how good it is to meet people who act as human beings after coming back from a game with toxic people graphics and optimization when i hear that a game is made by ubisoft my thought is going to be ohh damn another broken game with lots of performance issues but it was really far away from what i thought i m playing on i7 4790 and gtx 1070 on the maxed out settings with the ultra hd textures as well with the t aa and indeed can maintain above 144fps without any problem and the game indeed looks wellin conclusion i really looking forward to keep playing this game in the future and would try a bit the competitive match making really soon would update the review about it later on and have to say that ubisoft did here a great job with the game and indeed improved it overtime and kudos to the devlopers of the game about it i can without any doubt recommend this game for people who are looking for a strategic game that they can enjoy for a long time competitive mm it took quite some time for me to decide how the mm is each game has it s own flaws but the mm does have some really serious issues that make the competitive mode to look like a joke and yes i m mostly talking about leavers the penalties are pretty much worthless and doesn t do anything in order to prevent players from leaving the matches 15 minutes for each penalty may be fine for the first cooldown isn t enough by any means and some matches can be frustrating not because of a poor teamwork but when you have to start the game as 4vs5 or even worse in some games when a person disconnects in the first round it should offer to the team the option like a remake that exists on lol if they want to continue the match or shut it down and only the leaver would get a lose but when everything is going as it should be getting a great teammates or going with your premades then indeed the competitive is worth it and can provide a lot of great time overall rating 8 1018 1 2018 added competitive mm sorry if it looks like a rant,124.7,140.0,11,Recommended,"December 15, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Lixire

53965,2017 i just noticed a fellow steam reviewer proclaimed this game got mixed reviews actually metracritic gave it a 79 and pc gamer magazine awarded it 90 that s high praise coming from them still i debated before picking up the full game not the infamous starter set which limits your operators to a paltry pair reviewers decried the microtransaction mechanic which is all cosmetic weapon skins no pay to win here and then steamers cried foul when the game required uplay a third party launcher overlay i actually found uplay s in game voip crisper and clearer than steam voice so at the bequest of some buddies dedicated to playing the game consistently i took a chance boy howdy there are two modes of play either attack or defend given a single minute to devise a plan the defenders fortify bases and safeholds erecting wall supplements planting claymore anti personnel mines and ensconcing themselves in efficient or not so defensive postures awaiting the onslaught of the attackers the attackers have that same minute to send in radio controlled wheeled drones to espy the defending objectives defuse bombs rescue hostages etc and then the action phase begins each mission is a mere four minutes i ve talked to amateur boxers and they can tell you a three minute bout can last forever this game is akin to that now imagine an extra minute added to that racing hearts beads of sweat trickling down underarms adrenaline surging with the thought that in your five man crew one mistake can wreck the whole mission as an older gamer my twitch reflexes just aren t there anymore they simply disappeared over the horizon like yesterday s setting sun and that s the true beauty of this game it takes the idea of teamwork and support and makes a wondrous marriage of the two concepts playing rook a heavily armored operative who tromps along wearing frankenstein monster boots i can drop armor packs that award me points each time a team member plucks an armor kit and dons it rook has become my own personal favorite a true extension of the role i would play were this to be real like james davenport from pc gamer magazine said this game relies more on slow burn psychology than fast twitch reflexes this is a game even i can be good at this is by far the best multiplayer game i ve played in 2017 honestly as far as a group of five people generating cohesive plans and working constructively to a goal i d be hard pressed to not say this is one of the best multiplayer games i ve ever played period even the community isn t as acerbic as so many i ve encountered when that three minute action phase kicks in all of the vocal hijinks and stupidity by the 15 year olds acting like 9 year olds seems to dissipate winning a match is serious business after all and i ve never played a game in which after a successful match i get unsolicited friend requests from guys i just played the match with i generally get more satisfaction playing solo games but rainbow six siege has me completely rethinking that paradigm lately it s had me going to bed late and awakening early just to jump on and play again imagine playing tom clancy s rainbow six games the ones you played many moons ago only recrafted for this generational graphics sound design and optimization for current pc hardware teaming up with four other people you will have to plan communicate with and act with to see a goal to its end all within four minutes pc gaming doesn t get any better than this,228.6,184.0,19,Recommended,"November 27, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Billy_Brightside

53978,2017 disclaimer if you re a csgo addict like me but may get triggered by things that you don t agree with in terms of r6 siege s pros and cons feel free to ignore this review this game is gifted to me on my birthday by the one and only damien hooray after spending hours upon hours playing this game as a csgo addict i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed this game of course i will be explaining this review in a csgo addict standpoint mainly because i am but i will make sure that other people can understand this despite some cs references here and there rainbow six siege is a tactical team based fps game that manages to have some sliver of what i wanted from a tom clancy s game tom clancy s rainbow six games have always been games that emphasise on tactics rather than skill even though you still need to have some skill in order to ensure that you don t fall behind while the later tom clancy s games like future soldier and phantoms deviate away from what tom clancy s is all about siege manages to somewhat evoke that tactical gameplay that tom clancy s rainbow six was all about like the older rainbow six games the game is all about exposing yourself as little as possible to minimise risk as well as to ensure that your enemies die quickly before you do while siege isn t like the older rainbow six games where you die in one shot it doesn t take much bullets to kill you anyway and regardless of what weapon you re using enemies die in one hit to the head and so do you this is one of those games where headshot is king and you ll do your absolute damnest to ensure that your head isn t anywhere near their crosshairs lest the spray inevitably hits you in this game your environment and surroundings matter to you a lot any breachable walls is going to have holes which will give away your position if you aren t too careful players have a nasty habit of blasting holes in walls to provide greater dynamic in how they can execute their enemies rather than barricading them which seems to be the meta in this game heck walls are a facade for safety in siege as any wall can be blown up suddenly when you least expect them or be filled with holes by a hard hitting rifle or a shotgun or even a sledgehammer you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings to ensure that nothing is out of place that you aren t vulnerable to fire or explosions and that anything you do to the surroundings works to your favour any player can make any wall work in their favour with a little ingenuity and a few well placed shots the environment in siege is possibly the coolest because unlike battlefield where you can blow cover up gratuitiously or unlike csgo where it s actually impossible to do such things you can shape the environment to ensure your enemies die in the least expected way this also keep maps unique while staying the same siege has operators which have special abilities unlike the recruits that you would normally play if you can t afford an operator all of these operators have their pros and cons and ubisoft has done a great job balancing them although some operators do require a buff for example tachanka was an operator that had a deployable stationary mg when the meta game proved that tachanka would be far too easy to overcome due to how stationary tachanka would be in his mg ubisoft added a tacked on shield that covers the sides of the mg to provide cover in both sides except tachanka s head this ensures that anyone using tachanka s deployed mg would not be so vulnerable that he she would be a sitting duck while still giving enemies the incentive to go for headshots to deal with a deployed mg user the same can be said for blackbeard when he was released with a special ability of being able to equip a rifle mounted shield when it proved that he was a tad op due to how much the shield was able to absorb damage his shield was then nerfed and he was given two rifle mounts instead of just one resolving the issue needless to say ubisoft has done a satisfactory job of balancing each unique operators so they they re all somewhat equal the game modes are nothing to write about as far as i m concerned you have three game modes pve pvp casual and pvp matchmaking pve is basically you or a team of 5 against a swarm of enemies where the number of enemies depend on the game mode terrorist hunt defuse and hostage rescue pvp casual and pvp matchmaking are exactly the same only casual has fewer rounds at just 3 wins max while matchmaking plays in a span of 15 to me this is something csgo should ve been as casual is nothing like matchmaking when it comes to csgo otherwise the game modes are what you ve come to expect in a game like siege as for the community it s actually pretty clean i ve not met any salty or jerk players like you normally would in csgo probably because this game isn t as accessible or as appealing as csgo so most of the time servers are filled with fun going players who probably don t have qualms making silly mistakes as long as you re having fun yourself it s a fun community to be in and i love it though your mileage may vary i do have a few things regarding siege that i am not too fond of the new operators that have been added post release requires a hefty amount of renown to unlock you can unlock them instantly with r6 credits but r6 credits require real money and therefore isn t a thing if one plans to use the money for other more useful things although you can buy all the new operators in one bundle for a discounted price this is still unacceptable as people have already paid a good amount of money to acquire this game in the first place this wouldn t be a problem if you have played the game since day 1 as the amount of renown that players collected would be enough to purchase all of the new operators with renown alone another issue is the offline functionality as of right now there isn t any the reason why csgo is still ranked highly in my list is due to that you can still play it offline meaning i am still able to sharpen my skills with modded bots if i ever go anywhere that isn t the sanctuary of my fiber optics internet with siege though you always have to be online even if you re going lone wolf in pve which is quite a shame with offline functionality i would ve rated this game higher provided the offline functionality is reasonable enough as of now i keep a pirated copy just for that occasion that it might happen and it will happen if you travel a lot like i do oh and unstable servers sometimes i can t connect to servers or play with friends at all ubisoft fix this will ya overall there isn t much to complain about except for the cons i ve listed above like csgo you still feel the adrenaline rush when you score a kill and the nothingness and silence that occurs in the game can be unsettling and sometimes unnerving like you would in csgo however siege deviates that from csgo as it offers a unique experience unlike csgo it is inherently a better game than csgo i will admit i do find myself playing this game more often despite how much i don t want to admit it put it simply it s a game and it s a damn fun

53985,2018 simply a great game it is much more enjoyable than other competitive shooters in the market i stopped playing cs go because it got dull and was filled with cheaters i went to overwatch i stopped playing overwatch because it got dull and meta was extremely stale i went to siege i am pretty sure that i will stop playing siege at one point and go to another game however for now this game is awesome amazing pace not too fast not too slow gun fights can end in just a few seconds or be slow and methodical great variety of operators to play and choose from each with an own unique trait ability the list can go on but these are the two things i really enjoy about siege one of my main concerns is the netcode and how sometimes connection is just very subpar but i guess this is a norm for ubi games overall i recommend this game and i can t fault it as much as the other titles mentioned,920.9,130.0,8,Recommended,"January 18, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"daddy

54062,2021 ah rainbow six siege i hate it i love it i hate it agghhhhh it s siege one of the few games with an extremely toxic community but also a super wholesome community at the same time i ve played this game for years now on console and now pc help me i don t know why i keep coming back to this game it is incredibly fun and offers gameplay like none other altogether i love this game all the hilarious moments and clips from playing with friends make this game fantastic would definitely recommend for fun but this is totally detrimental to your health there are some annoying glitches at times such as the cursor glitch which prevents you from being able to look around with your mouse and requires restart would rate siege 10 oh and don t buy operators those are for sweats stick to recruit with lmg or shotgun and you ll be a platinum 69 like me edit i have a few things that i feel very fondly about that i would like to address here while siege can be a blast while playing with a full squad of friends solo queue ranked or even duo queue is miserable in low tiers towards the end of last season i began playing ranked to see where i stood i enjoyed ranked a lot on console because i like a challenge i ranked silver i forget the specifics but i want to say it was mid range kept playing ranked till the end of the season and really enjoyed it i met some really enjoyable people and only a couple who were toxic overall a good experience this season high calibre it has been the exact opposite i ranked in high bronze which at first i was fine with i could work with it now the problem begins once you start matchmaking with toxic players i ve noticed a trend of coming across players that i have previously matchmade with which was fun at first until i began seeing the same toxic players that griefed me and my teammates relentlessly without consequence this is extremely mentally draining you want to play the game you love but others are ruining it i have even seen players that i have reported and blocked return to my matchmaking after all of that the worst part is if you leave to escape the toxicity you are the one with the punishment not them some of you may be thinking that you can just mute them and move on but with the team kill aspect in the game they can still run around your operator all game until you accidentally team kill this is a massive problem and now i am stuck in a copper v limbo all players are toxic and it is impossible to improve my mmr to rank up and escape i have seen other players in my lobby feel the same way and it obviously should not be that way it would be easy to simply add an mmr reset button or mmr reset request option,459.5,85.0,10,Recommended,"November 21, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,CRTsuplex,False

54083,2018 tom clancy s rainbow six siege has become one of my favourite fps as of now also my most played as well when i first started playing this game i was a complete noob infact it took me a lot of time to actually get average in this game it was kinda frustrating at first but nevertheless i really enjoyed the game as there are like a million ways through which we can approach our objective and every kill victory feels rewarding it feels brilliant when you timed correctly throw detonate a c4 on the hatch upon which there is a fuze waiting to deploy his cluster charge and get killed himself the destructible environment in the game allows many ways possibilities through which we can approach our objective kill enemies etc adding more variety to the gameplay mechanics it s perhaps the best fps in my opinion here are some of it s pros and cons pros destructible environment cqc makes the player s approach more varied and interesting pretty good soundtracks though its main theme is okay but soundtracks from certain maps like clubhouse and the house feels damn electricfying to me b though it has no single player campaign but the operator s voice acting videos etc are very well made this adds more value and story elements to these characters now this might be personal but its graphics style and art reminds me of some old school games like igi 2 etc i feel relaxed and chilled while playing it cons dlc ops prices are a bit too high though i have the standard edition and have unlocked quite a lot of ops but it will be pretty cool if there can be some occasional discounts on the prices though it doesn t bother me very much but for starter edition users its actually a big cons considering you don t like grinding thus i ll like to conclude that it s perhaps one of the best fps currently on the market it offers a refreshing and intelligent gameplay with tons of fun and satisfaction as well as continued support of the devs publisher ubisoft montreal and ubisoft,382.2,90.0,8,Recommended,"February 14, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Skyvastern,True

54109,2015 never had my heart beat so fast while playing video games than this 8 10edit since my review came op as one of the most helpful i ve decided to expand it with some detailsrainbow six siege is mainly about two teams fighting agaisnt each other in a fps counter terrorism world one team as the defenders terrorists other team as attackers counter terrorits the special thing about this game is the strategi and the destruction of the maps every game can feel very different because both teams has a fair amount of characters to choose from who all has one special abililty the destruction is a very big factor why i think the game is great it gives it a lot of replayability there are so many different ways to defend a point or even to attack one the teamplay and strategi is also important your team will have a way higher chance of winning if you all communicate and plan your attacks the singleplayer isnt as great as the other rainbow games there are basically two ways of playing singleplayer one is to play lonewolf in terrorist hunt terrorist hunt is your team or your self agaisnt ai the other way is to play situations which are premade lonewolf maps with ai there is no campaign the design of the game is really mlg as i would call it all the characters doesnt really look like counter terrorist units which isnt a bad thing it just kinda takes the imersion away otherwise the map is just trying to simulate the real world which it does nicely the graphics runs well on my computer with the highest settings the gun play and gameplay is close to perfect if you ask me its nothing like arma 3 but it has a very good feel to it and sometimes even so much that i feel like i m a swat solider breaching into a building d there are sometimes where its kinda unrealistic but its nothing close to a problem the commuinity i have played with is nice they play toghter work togther and most importantly they communicate have had some games with people that didnt work togther at all but it doesnt ruin it nothing about the game it self i just want to add that ubisoft have made a lot of stuff like aac unity i m very happy how this turned out since it was one of my childhood games but that doesnt mean that ubisoft are the good guys they still use uplay and many of their games are overpriced if you ask me thats mainly why i would say you shouldnt buy the game but the game is still a ton of fun and if you want it i truely recommend it now go read the top rated review insted of mine,363.9,306.0,63,Recommended,"December 6, 2015",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"civil

54118,2017 i received the starter edition of r6 as a gift for my birthday last year and i never expected to end up with nearly 400 hours and climbing i ve never been too into more mainstream shooters so my obsession with this game came as a complete surprise make no mistake r6 still has an immense amount of bugs that can be frustrating to play through but when the game goes right it goes so right the highly destructible environments make for a constantly shifting and dynamic battleground and it s insanely satisfying to use it to your advantage on both attack and defense mira can cleverly neglect to reinforce specific walls and watch through her one way window gadget to go for surprise wallbangs on unsuspecting attackers ash can set a breaching charge on a random window barricade and then use her breaching round gadget to blow up another window and rush in while the defenders are still unsure of what approach the attackers are taking with the multiple disorienting explosions this brings us to the tactical shooter intel aspect of the game which is another big part of its appeal while sometimes iffy the sound in the game can often be just as valuable as the visuals you can hear the attackers running around on the roof or blowing up a wall or sending a drone in to gather intel and in turn plan your course of action whether it be rushing a busy attacker or simply feeding your teammates information so they can ready themselves for a push by the enemies on top of the incredibly fun and mostly skill based gameplay ubisoft does a surprisingly fantastic job of updating the game both for balance of existing content and addition of new content all non cosmetic additions operators and their weapon attachments can be unlocked pretty easily by just playing the game and earning renown to purchase them and all new maps are available to all players when they are added even most of the cosmetics with the exception of digital content bundles and some select headgears can be pretty easily unlocked with earned renown without ever forcing you to purchase the game s premium currency every few months there is a new season that adds two new unique operators a bunch of cosmetics and a brand new map in the middle of each season they push midseason reinforcements which are sets of balance changes and reworks based on operator usage statistics and community feedback tl dr the game really is despite its flaws an absolutely fantastic online shooter and i can t recommend enough that you pick it up and play it with a few friends rainbow six siege is easily a 9 10 game and the best online shooter to come out of the 2010s rivaling even the likes of cs go in its continued playability and competitive balance,680.4,94.0,7,Recommended,"August 6, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Gusher, the Humiliated",False

54128,2022 i used to love this game it united my friends and me for over 500 hours of gameplay as for gameplay the game has lost much of its original charm as a swat simulator careful planning and tactics have been replaced by what are ultimately now superpowers in its early beginnings most of the abilities and operators were somewhat grounded in reality now many of the characters feel more like knock off marvel cops as they litteraly kool aid man through walls and punch with robotic arms add to the loss of realism the unfortunate reality that the game has been taken captive by ubisoft s woke messaging the company has spent three years subtly reworking maps to eliminate the presence of suicide bombers drugs and sex trafficking so that the maps can be played in china and pass their censors add to that the increased pandering to diversity inclusion as they explore its operators sexuality and gender identity the game is now unrecognizable from when it launched so many years ago it is an unfortunate loss i recommend that players who are seeking a swat experience instead spend their time on ready or not,527.2,106.0,5,Not Recommended,"August 7, 2022",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Sentinel,False

54149,2021 i installed this game after my friend told me that it was really fun and enjoyable he said it was really tactical and those are the type of games i enjoy the most i can truly say that r6s is the best shooter game i have ever played in all my time if not the best game i have ever played collecting the first operators and discovering what they have in store is an exciting experience tactically winning games with your friends is a thrill that only this game can produce in such a way the only concern and annoyance in the game is that all the dlc operators will probably cost real life money to require unless you are willing to put in many days into the games because they are very expensive in game the game is really competitive and at time you may become frustrated but with time you will improve and rise in the ranks the casual game mode can be toxic at times but most of the time it is a great way of playing the game but in short periods when you don t have much time or want to play more relaxed every 3 months or so they introduce 2 new operators which refreshes the game and creates a hype it keeps the game flowing bringing in new dynamics with the new abilities the new operators may have overall everyone must buy this game and join the experience because otherwise your missing out on a whole new world in this game,243.7,78.0,6,Recommended,"April 7, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,X,True

54154,2016 this game is awesome really awesome but recently there has been a lot of problems with the comunity a lot of people on this review page say the comunity is nice and cool but here s the thing its changing for one thing the amount of teamkillers has increased dramatically especially if you play on casual one time i went into a match on bank on offensive and was imediatly killed by a guy i waited for someone to kill him cause well he was an as hole but nobody did and i realized they didn t because they were playing together like they knew eachother and aparrently they wanted to play alone people like this ruin the game and ubisoft needs to do something to properly punish players that do this also i have recently been encountering nice and friendly people less and less just more as holes there are three kinds of people i play with in this game mostly guys who dont have mics don t coordinate and don t comunicate with their team and get themselves killed first secondly there are asses who will coordinate with you but insult and criticize you for every mistake you make you ll encounter these guys mainly on ranked they don t like inexperienced players and lastly the friendly people who are rare now they will help you give the needed call outs and back you up in a match and those are the best people in this game and even with everything i said its still not enough to not recomend this game just if you are gonna buy it try to find a clan or just some friends to play it with if you can cause the randomes are wild cards now thank you for taking the time to read this review and i hoped it helped you make your decision because this is one of the most tactical and team based multiplayer fps s of this decade and its an amazing accomplishment by ubisoft and i hope they make changes to help make the comunity of players more apreciative,320.0,66.0,6,Recommended,"May 30, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Hayderaide

54167,2021 8 10 rainbow six siege is a damn fine shooter but that doesn t mean its perfect so im gonna explain whats good whats not whats good most of the time shooting in this game seems very fun and balanced unless its a relatively new operator that was just added more on that topic soon the game rewards map familiarity some maps can have destructible floors walls and ceilings which makes it highly rewarding to go into custom games and learn them on your own speaking of which custom games this is such a blessing to have if you really want to take your skills to the next level also it may help you study any new dlc maps so you can at least know what you re about to get yourself into this season free dlc finally a decent shooter that doesn t seem like all the devs want is money yes there is cosmetics in game but nothing like pay to win but most members of the siege community may disagree with me due in part with the events that happen usually half way through the season there are 4 season through the year so you get 8 new ops per year and usually a new map and possibly a new rework on older maps to make them better each event is different than the last one minute you are carebears shooting each other the next you are rootin tootin shootin cowboys at least from what the data miners have found but they have loot boxes that you must buy at least 50 dollars of if you want all the cosmetic for the event in question this game heavily requires communication and strategy every single operator on the rainbow six team differs from the others one places bear traps that downs enemies another has a infra red sniper scope that can pierce through thick smoke and highlights enemies making it much easier to get distance kills but with that there is weaknesses the bear traps can be shot to be destroyed and are fairly easy to spot due to how massive they are the sniper glaz is a powerhouse but when you take a slow sniper against smgs that can shoot faster than you can make a bowl of popcorn you need to make sure you keep a distance and use recoil against them but also make every shot count one miss could mean it all there is an operator for everyone you like being slow and able to take some damage we have that you can play as fuze who releases a cluster bomb of grenades in a small area that can pinch off the enemy team if placed right or as doc who heals your team with stimulant shots you like being faster than god itself play ash shes a fast operator that rewards the run and gun style plus her gadget is a grenade launcher that allows you to blow away any soft walls that lay in your wake or as bandit whos able to place car batteries on barbed wire making them electrocute anything that may cross as well as add electricity to any reinforced walls or how about a nice mix you have twitch who can take her drone around and remove enemy s gadgets cameras and can even inflict damage on the enemy team or you may play as frost the bear trap operator there is pve as well but its very lacking but it does exist the devs are also very quick to fix major bugs in game but my favorite thing about this game is the content creators they all are very fun loving guys and gals and they help support this amazing community whats bad there is moments when ranked play can just feel like udder crap toxicity is very common in this game most time its just bland dry sarcasm or humor that can be taken the wrong way new operators are kinda always broke when they first release but are usually fixed not too long later but other times its too long this game has a high learning curve headshots are instakills sometimes it will feel unfair because you will turn a corner and get domed seemingly out of nowhere so get that aim up dude this game has frequent updates to fix a bug or issue but sometimes that just creates more bugs i hope my review of rainbow six siege helped you out somehow if you would like to learn this game please add me on here i can tutor you to be a better player also as a last note here when playing r6 you need to be okay with dying like alot this game rewards those who learn from mistakes but you can also figure out your own personal preference in play,210.1,56.0,2,Recommended,"April 25, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"OxH

54188,2017 where to begin after 2 years playing csgo i decided to buy r6 seeing that everyone was saying it was kind of alike so i could only like it but in fact r6 is way better than csgo i was getting very tired of all the russians toxic players etc i was getting insulted in almost every game just because i m a girl the community on r6 isn t perfect but most of the time there s the minimum respect between humans being that we re asking for the gameplay is a little like csgo desamorcing a bomb saving a hostage but there s also others gamemodes like for example securing an area my favorite or terrorist hunt you gotta basically kill all the ia ennemies presents in the map it s also way more realistic and harder to aim etc and you gotta be very tactical the operators also are very balanced everyone has its own special gadget and is usefull for the team for me the only cons are clearly ubisoft there s a lot of problems with the servers these times after a game sometimes i don t have the renom i should gain some other times the game don t launch like the server is crashing or something and the players in the room are just stuck together in a loading page and i also think the operators and cosmetics are too expensive and i don t even talk about the 2nd year operators who are almost the double of the price of the 1st one and if you don t pay it will take a hell of a time to get them all but it s still okay cause it doesn t make the game pay to win there s no operator more op than another and i think for every operator there s one who can counter it but i don t think we should really pay attention to these kind of things cause which game never had bugs none especially in ubisoft haha d and never remember that the r6 team is one of the smallest team in ubisoft with the smallest servers so they do what they can if you hesitate to take this game just do it you will enjoy it so much especially if you like cs totally worth the price and i bought the 15 one who can be annoying at beggining cause you won t have many operators so if you have the money i suggest taking the normal one and not the starter edition,760.5,208.0,22,Recommended,"July 23, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Ephya

54208,2016 this is not counter strike this is counter strike in a house sober 2016 summary this is a short summary before i get to the actual part of the review for the game people often think that this game is the same as counter strike they couldn t be more wrong between counter strike and rainbow six siege the difference is that of between the sun and the moon the game is different on so many aspects this is more of a team based fps rather than a game where a single person can make a difference of course a single person can make a difference in this game as well but he has to do his duties first as a team member before he moves out to do his own thing so keep that in mind when you are buying this game counter strike and rainbow six siege may look like brothers but they are not each of them are fun and unique in their own way little about my experience i started playing this game first when it came out back in december 2015 of course back than i didn t buy it in steam i had the uplay version and i have logged in over 450 hours in the game here is the proof click postimg org and here are my stats click postimg org now i bought this game again to link to my steam account when it was on sale during the weekend so with over 500 hours of experience in this game at this point i would recommend it to anyone who loves a serious fun competitive fps final thoughts i would waste your time if i made this review any longer i mean i could but what i write here is already available over the internet you already have awesome guides in the steam community so if you want to know more about the gameplay and how it plays you can check it out in youtube and read about it in reddit or the wiki for queries you can visit reddit for tips and awesome gameplays check out these youtubers serenity17 macie jay score gameplay 9 keeps you coming back again and again sound 9 the ambient sound the background music everything is spot on game mechanics 10 unique game mechanics not comparable to any games fun 10 could be lower for you if you are playing alone if you are playing with friends this game is simply epic additional points 10 this game had a huge cheater base now with battleye the cheaters are non existent,550.8,147.0,22,Recommended,"November 25, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"E-Wolf

54219,2015 i normally don t write reviews for games but being an army infantry vet and an avid csgo player with 3k hours i can safely say this game is amazing it s such a new breath of fresh air within fpss it s got the graphics the gameplay is amazing learning to play from every agnle possible is part of the fun here hanging upside down in a window and shooting people is amazingly fun finding people in mm to breach and clear rooms it brought me back to my army days never have i felt such fun in a new game until now the guns have their limits but aren t exactly the focus there s not really a huge balance issue with this game either most of the time when you die you just get out played every gun has their play style like shotguns you actually have to play close to walls or windows and not try to shoot medium to far range like to be able to take out enemies who like to peak from afar pick up a riflelike to run and gun well too bad go back to cod those who complain about the game are normally the cod players or silvers out of csgo who can t actually aim and need to find something to complain about this is by far one of my new favorite games,422.2,89.0,13,Recommended,"December 2, 2015",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"-Sanguinius

54276,2017 review from a random casual gamerwhen they mentioned this game to me i was very skeptical since in the first months it received very negative reviews but after a good amount of hours 141 when this review was written i can say that this game is overall a good game here s why pros good anticheating compared to the initial months where the game was overall filled with hackers the introduction of battleye brought a complete revamp of the game now the game is almost completely free from any hacking threat although there still are like in every other game but luckily they re dealt pretty quickly highly strategical game but with a twist this game allows different kind of playstyle from the slow gameplay to the more fast paced one there are pros and cons for both playstyle but overall the amount of operators available allows for different styles keep in mind that operators are released continously gameplay well developed the game is good for what is meant to propose more precisely the game gives a short quarters first person shooter and that s what it exactly gives you will not find great sniper battles or epic battles in this game in addition to that the maps never get boring as all the maps give a complete freedom and alllow the game to have new twists even after a hundred hours like my case technical precision the game is well made in terms of precision of sound and environmental destruction the effort they put to create maps that allow a player to be completely free in his moves is something that is indeed very positive updates the game is continously updated to add new content and will be like these for some other years making the game still alive and active after 2 years cons highly frustrating although the game is good for casual gaming it might turn out to be very frustrating in some cases where you can be hit from a completely hidden place without even having the chance to see the enemy not to mention some operators being completely broken microtransactions yes the game has microtransactions in it and they also cost a lot in particular cases especially when buying new operators most of the microtransactions are needed for cosmetics which is fine but the problem is that they are also used to buy new operators in fact the game gives you around 20 free operators but all the others that come in other operations yes their dlcs are called operations cost a lot and basically you need an enormous amount of hours to buy them as a free to play player overall i highly recommend this game especially when played with friends the community is overall good 8 5 10 nerf glaz,542.6,44.0,3,Recommended,"April 18, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Dark Brandon

54305,2016 ubisoft made a step forward in tactical shooters with this game which easily could be called counter strike remastered and developers actually surprised me with how well the game is done from a technical standpoint the game is truly challenging which makes it not quite as fun as say cs go i d say that the closest to siege are hardcore modes of call of duty modern warfare 2 without team deathmatch obviously instant knife kills add to that impression the controls are clunky at times cheaters are quite common and the way uplay is standing between me and the game is unacceptable in single player you hunt dozens of terrorists which is not very exciting and ridiculously difficult even on easy but it s better than multi player only i like siege it offers a quite unique experience but it s definitely not for everyone,728.8,20.0,0,Recommended,"April 3, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"camXmile

54306,2015 well made fun polished and balanced game but if ur looking to play competitively in its current state u will be disappointed the only problem this game has are the horrible servers hit detection is way off and sometimes u die from the position u were 2seconds ago i also have 80hours in beta s and the servers felt better back then its very frustrating and happens very often wait for a netcode fix before u purchase this game update original post 6th of dec 2015 update post 6th of feb 2016 if u are looking to buy this game to mess around with youre friends in casual go ahead if ur looking to play a serious ranked game dont waste ur money on r6s hitbox s are still way off and the gunfights can only be taken seriously half of the time uncluding highest headshot rate of any game ive ever seen and im dmg on csgo match making is a joke and i still cant believe they allow players to bypass the level20 cap on ranked games if they duo with a friend continuous 4v5 s due to there not being a reconnect function the ranked system itself is also very off i win 7 games in a row no rank up to lose the next 2 games in a row and i got derank wich led me to this review update review summary go back to csgo,319.7,141.0,12,Recommended,"December 6, 2015",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"BadererThenYou

54321,2018 rainbow six siege i have to admit that it is a good game i love it very much but do you know the call of duty the holocaust of god the rockets alliance and the exile road when playing in steam high pings often occur but the joy of the game does not affect chinese players after being represented by tencent it did not promote and locked the country the reason is very simple a profit oriented company cares about the player s traffic to generate income as the previous stage of publicity is not enough the domestic environment is tepid tencent simply hides the game so much that it is now many people do not know these games tencent is a good company but it s not a good game company i like ubisoft very much so i don t want this move to lead to your future status in china where did you really make china s domestic independent game yes steam china has its own wegame but it can t be on the shelves because in tencent s eyes they can t bring benefits therefore i sincerely hope that ubisoft as well as some foreign game companies will not give tencent a good game actually there are many good agents in china such as perfect world etc i am a gamer and even a gamer i believe that every game lover hopes that the games he likes will last long not the end thank you i m an ordinary player from china chestnut,162.2,60.0,1,Not Recommended,"May 19, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"筷子夹的棉花糖

54332,2015 see end for summary i really love this game but i am very objective when i make my reviews there are both good and bad things here we go pros combat there is a good variety of weapons you can mod them with a few mods and each one of them has different advantages devs i like the way the game is going at this moment what i really care about is that the maps will be free i heard the operators will be available to buy with renown as well i bought the season pass anyway because i encourage that type of initiative from the devs i ve never been a fan of microtransactions but at least they did it only for aeshetic stuff so i m okay with that game modes you can play pve and pvp both have different modes while in pvp it doesn t make much of a difference because people end up killing each other anyway in pve it does operators they sound stupid at first but it s cool to have different operators that do different things just make sure you tell fuze not to use the cluster charge during an extract hostage replayability sure there is not a crazy number of maps but there are different modes and enemies and objectives spawn at different locations making each time you play it different servers i agree they were not perfect but i have seen games releasing much worse they also got better over time cons ai or au artificial unintelligence at times the ai is either incredibly smart headshots you through walls or incredibly stupid walks right into the line of fire could use some fixing also normal should be easier for casuals balancing there is some balancing to do it s not terrible but some operators don t have really good weapons shotguns need to be buffed just a little bit briefing screen the game mode should stay in the briefing screen where you select the operator and vote because i choose operators according to the game mode and often times i miss that 1 second screen disadvantages of having ssds kicking rules add a required field that asks why somebody is getting voted to kick apparently i got kicked for being too good 41 kills at least i could take a screenshot and show it to my friends for a good laugh mic seems like half or more of the players that talk in game do not realize they are lol make sure you put push to talk and treshold to 0 not sure why push to talk by itself does not work no host migration come on i don t like getting kicked to the main menu because the host died at the end and ragequits no offline cannot play without an internet connection you have to be connected to their servers even if you are playing solo unless you are doing the situations but no reward servers matchmaking while it is in the pros it is also in the cons because they can definitely be worked on i know there is something i am forgetting i will add it as it comes to my mind summarythe game is good i won t say worth it or not since 60 is worth one thing to me and another to you but you can find it for cheaper if you search well personally speaking yes it is absolutely worth it you can play pve or pvp whatever you like good graphics good gameplay lots of fun definitely a game to pick up especially if you like fps and coops games just be aware that it is slower than most shooters i wouldn t say it s tactical but it s not a run and shoot you should give it a shot if you can play it with friends it s even better even though i seem to play worse with them because i get distracted lel let me know what you think,163.1,30.0,1,Recommended,"December 13, 2015",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"RedCobra1246

54334,2017 let me start off by saying that i used to despise ubisoft incosistent launches inconsistent implementations uplay as you can see on my profile i dont own much ubisoft games because most of them were either refunded or i requested to be deleted on my steam acc with that being said rainbow six is different it gives me a string of hope for ubisoft and it got me hooked to expect more from them now lets start with the game six siege is amazing and well optimized it s a game any fps player enthusiast should get it s a breath of fresh air for those who have been playing competitive fps games in our current fps market i can say that siege is one of the best coming from a guy who has played alot of shooter games series in the past cod quake insurgency l4d ow tf2 unreal h1z1 and cs now lets get into the game there are alot characters to choose from under the calling of operators these operators have their own speciality but the feel of the character is not very different from one another so i wouldn t call it classes the gameplay doesn t get bland overtime unlike most fps games today you can take a different approaches everytime you join in a new game the game provides you with enough customization with the attachments and it has camos but if you don t like those its optional you can play some singleplayer missions that are interesting and challenging if you re the type of gamer who looks for challenges the game has enough maps to not keep you bored and this is one of the main reasons why i fell in love with the game the maps are very good and well designed with the options given to you maps don t get repetitive because alot of entry options are given to you the way the gameplay pans out is very unique and different from most fps games today it s like cs swat cod campaign get the picture looks awesome yeah another thing possibly the best thing in this game the community the community is not toxic the community is great possibly one of the best communities i ve been introduced to for a while ubisoft and six siege are heading towards the right direction with its community i would like to encourage others to also join us in that direction,111.8,90.0,9,Recommended,"August 1, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Nulzs

54354,2022 fubisoftsiege was fantastic and fun in its first 2 years despite an exclusive focus on multiplayer which then alienated existing fans of the r6 franchise then ubisoft let the smell of money go to their heads and gradually drove it to the ground in both gameplay and tone they took an existing franchise and rode its name to create a mainstream crowdpleaser with fortnite tier cosmetics and events which make a mockery of rainbow six r6 siege didn t start as a game for r6 fans but it could pass off as a worthy mp focused spinoff of the franchise it doesn t even hold that title anymore this is now a game made for clickbait streamers whales who would suffer through the ridiculous monetization and sweaty overly competitive kids who must maintain their kpd and verbally violate everyone s mother at least once per match in order to live through the day to further hammer home that ubisoft don t know and don t care what rainbow six fans want the next upcoming r6 game is confirmed to be based off an event siege had with aliens they could name it ayylmao s final retreat and it would get the same attention or lack of attention for that matter you did not need to use the r6 name for that crap but of course they did bother renaming it from r6 quarantine to r6 extraction because avoiding a silly misunderstanding and sensitive journalists stirring the pot with the game s name is something they do care about this is unworthy of the tom clancy and rainbow six names ubisoft is not worthy of these names nor ghost recon or splinter cell the moment tom clancy passed away ubisoft has opened the floodgates of cringe and just went to town on the licenses they own where the conversation isn t what would be the next logical step for this franchise but rather okay how do we apply our moneymaking cookie cutter template on these franchises reputation be damned,96.7,45.0,3,Not Recommended,"January 2, 2022",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Agent47,False

54377,2021 6 10 i recommend you buy this game at a deep sale an online shooter that can be very fun and different from your typical online shooters by giving the player different options and styles to play with you can have a lot of fun in this this game trying new operators and changing the way you play getting better by learning to do things differently most of the guns sound and feel really good which is really important in this kind of game game looks alright it s not the best looking game out there but it s good enough and after more than 500 hours playing it yes i will recommend you to try this game but there are some things you need to know first game runs fine performance wise but there are some issues like some graphical glitches that can only be fixed by restarting the game and some crashes here and there but nothing too major there are some things that are big issues at least for me like every time there is a new update i see more and more people having longer and longer load times before a match and the match cannot start until everyone s game is fully loaded this was not as much an issue a year ago yet it gets worse day by day you would think that they have a complete understanding of how the game works after so many years of development by now as someone who has played this game once or twice a week for a few years a lot of the times it feels like the developers are more interested in the new content then fixing the existing issues new content is always good and welcome but not when there are so many issues that makes the game less fun you can also get all of the new operators with in game money which is really cool now it might take you a thousand hours to farm enough money to get all of them but the option is there if you enjoy the game and don t want to pay more money why not when you play this game as the way it should be played in my opinion working with your team to defeat the enemy who is working with their team to win the game this game is really fun but at this point in almost 70 of the games i play there is one guy who tries to play solo and by that i mean they will try to kill the whole enemy team by themselves same goes for the enemy team as well and whether they succeed or not they will do one thing and that is ruining the game for everyone else who at least tries to play it the right way you as a player surely don t just want to win a game by doing nothing on the other hand you also don t want to do everything so that no one else can enjoy these little moments that makes the game fun maybe its like this for me at this point and at the higher levels people play like this i surely don t enjoy it but still if i had fun until this point hey i got 400 hours of fun out of it and if you can get at least a 100 hours enjoying it you get more than you paid for,609.4,59.0,8,Recommended,"February 8, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"T_Phenom

54398,2016 rainbow six siege brings the tactical shooter series back by offering a 5 on 5 attack and defend based multiplayer gameplay yes as opposed to the previous games in the series the game lacks the singleplayer department excluding the singleplayer training missions and mainly focuses on multiplayer gameplay unlike most of the casual run and gun type of shooters on the market today rainbow six siege forces you to think and act accordingly to achieve success in the game most of your time will be spent on strategizing with your teammates the game has two sides as attacker and defender each side having specific operators to play with when you play as a defender as the name tells you try to defend the given objective you can use barricades traps and character specific gadgets to do that on the other hand when you play as an attacker your goal is to secure the objective and again you can do it by using character specific gadgets blasting through floors and ceilings the game also features a terrorist hunt mode just like the previous games in the series if you are tired of mediocre contemporary shooters and want to experience a team centric and strategic gameplay rainbow six siege is worth to take a look at,439.9,57.0,6,Recommended,"July 13, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Kazuyoshi,True

54409,2016 rainbow six siege is what happens when you mix the brilliance of the intimate counter strike matches with battlefield bad company 2 s destructible environments it is excellent the most common and most played mode is a 5v5 match here you either start out scouting the whole building while playing as ct or setting up the defense as the terrorists some of the most tense moments i have ever had outside of horror games is when i wait for the counter terrorists to break in you hear thumping blasting footsteps and all you can do is wait as going out as a lone wolf out there won t be doing you much good as counter terrorists you are given drones in the start for scouting out the terrorists positions and it is actually tougher than it looks as you only know the last tagged position by the drones there are plenty of classes available in six siege all with different abilities you need in game currency called renowns to buy them the flow of them is good enough that it does not feel that the game is forcing you to buy them using real world money there are other modes like situations and terrorist hunt which help you get familiar with the various operators terrorist hunt in particular is excellent when played with friends against higher level of ai another thing i like is that you have to reach a specific level before you can enter ranked matches which makes you get ready for them rainbow six siege is one of the most brilliant fps i ve played till now and if you like methodical slow tactical shooters you can t go wrong with rainbow six siege,486.2,90.0,3,Recommended,"September 26, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Silas Abhi

54414,2018 first of all starter edition is a scam do not buy it it becomes a korean mmorpg level of grinding if you do the gameplay itself is fun and while it s usually a good thing to have continued support for a title the devs are cleary trying to milk their playerbase dry with recent changes it strongly suffers from powercreep with new characters being usually unbalanced compared to older ones and they are limited to people who paid for that year s season pass for a week in advance leaving the rest of the playerbase at their mercy balance patches take too long and recently they haven t been addressing real player issues but only statistical analysis of the matches like limiting operators gadget based on average number of uses instead of checking real ranked match data the recent addition of real money only loot boxes is also something that sounds fishy especially because it came with the price rise of every new cosmetic item for in game money on top of selling season passes every new year i cannot recommend this game or any ubisoft game really to a friend of mine i would strongly advise you against buying into this game because the corporate culture surrounding it sounds extremely negative and anti consumer,165.5,122.0,24,Not Recommended,"March 7, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"ϲopycat

54445,2022 if the game were to be released how it is today i think it would be a major success however after seeing how the game has progressed over the past 7 years its hard to appreciate this version seeing the dev team trying to relate to the playerbase has been utterly embarrassing also not a fan of politics or real world debated issues in video games and this dev team has started implementing that literally nobody cares thats not what this game is about the new ui compared to the old is horrendous cheating is still as prevalent as ever possibly worse it took over 3 years for a new map since then theyve been releasing 1 operator every season as opposed to 2 and have some very questionable gadgets that look straight ripped from games like valorant the game siege that was supposed to be realistic to real world technology has far left that in the past with operators like sens azami iana and melusi im also all for diversity in video games but compare the first operators in this game to the current ones and you can see where the devs mind is at it just adds the unrealisticness i used to watch a lot of r6 content creators since this game came out and all of them have quit except for a few because of how low the engagement is every healthy game out there has a strong viewerbase to it the only thing doing well is the esports section and even that has fallen off player counts are surprisingly high but i wouldn t be surprised if half of them were secondary accounts for cheating for the actual game itself it requires a massive amount of time to be put into it in order for you to start getting value in games map knowledge operator knowledge and practical mechanic sense is all just as important as actual aim expect to be utter trash until after putting in like 25 hours then you can enjoy the game conclusion id recommend this game for only new players who want to suffer sure it s different and unique but just know it had much greater potential to it gamebreaking bugs and poor dev decisions forced a large number of players to leave in the past so dont be surprised when it happens again,768.4,78.0,6,Not Recommended,"June 23, 2022",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Cardboarded,False

54454,2019 let start with the pros rainbow six siege is a strategic multiplayer shooter that flew under the radar at release despite it s initially low popularity the game has grown significantly over the last year siege offers a wide variety of player classes or operators that suit your play style the game devs intend to continue to expand the list of useable operators a nice feature the game provides is the ability to unlock dlc content with in game currency the gameplay is unique and slow paced and forces you to be more vocal with your team for the most part the game has a friendly supportive community the game s competitive scene is also on the rise now the cons the matchmaking and servers just spend 30 seconds on this sub and you ll notice all the complaints about the ubisoft servers these complaints are absolutely justified the servers are a mess they re down quite a lot being disconnected from a game is a frequent occurrence there s some ping issues sometimes just finding a match can be difficult and sometimes you get kicked in the with with the dreaded matchmaking error then there s the bugs and glitches some are just minor inconveniences and some are straight up game breaking it seems like every patch just spawns a new set of bugs the game no doubt has issues that really need to be resolved,514.4,35.0,4,Recommended,"April 15, 2019",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Helix

remastered hearts of iron 4 day of defeat source left 4 dead battlefield 4 and 1 again and having the fun of my life inside those games that s a moment i thought to myself how come i have this fun again this mysterious feeling of i up but i m still laughing about it this was the time it clicked inside my head you see all the games listed above encourage you to play casually and to have fun the games don t take themselves seriously yeah yeah csgo has a massive pro league behind it but we still play it casually or like your friend saying yo man if you one click this awp in mid with a deagle i ll spent ya a beer and you of course you go ahead and do it even if you die you all can laugh about it or you can just mess around in tdm conquest battlefield co op and i don t know what else rainbow six siege doesn t encourage casual play which it needs it even punishes you for it that is sad but also true think about quickmatch remember when it was called casual yeah we all miss those times right you can t play siege for fun or casually as the game doesn t allow it siege would need to make the in game events playable for any given time like sugar fright doctors curse and yes i know you can host event game modes in the near future but you would still need 9 other players for it and invite them also rainbow six siege could also add team death match where players just play for points respawning and killing the opfor opposing force for all of you who don t know what opfor stands for of course they would need to make maps for this specific game mode but wouldn t that be better then to search for an quickmatch where you die the moment you spawn because of spawnpeeks or an operator that your team didn t call out because there is no real communication going on and then wait 3 whole minutes to play again because this one teammate decides to stay on the roof on bank to save his k d quickmatch is also infuriating for many players as they play most of the time solo or with a buddy and then have to sweat for nothing just because the 9th million jaeger or ash main destroys you and treats it as ranked and even talks you in the chat it becomes tiresome and frustrating but hey atleast the devs put much effort into making events and event maps that we can only play for a limited time instead of adding fresh new game modes to a game that would really need it now as we are on the adding things the game is stale there is no need to lie as even a hardcore fan must admit that it is really boring as of right now flores didn t add much to the game and is almost forgotten as a maverick or zofia ash does the job much better than him in my opinion which can differ greatly to everyone to any region because they aren t handicaped because of mute and or mozzi which you see often in the game with the new season north star or however it is called the new healing operator thunderbird is also underwhelming as people tend to use doc because of the mp 5 giving her the ability for the spear 308 won t change to much about it even if it is an assault rifle that she gets doesn t mean that she will be strong and even will be nerfed before she even comes out like they did with flores the same applies to the jager nerf who in their right mind though it s a good idea to nerf his gun if you think about it the devs wanted to make roaming with him harder as he can t be as strong in firefights anymore as before but its his ability that makes him great and the gun as people love playing with it looks cool works smooth and is satisfying and removing 5 bullets and an increase of vertical recoil won t affect him to much as he is still a viable operator with a satisfying gun and the best gadget in the whole game we must wait now for almost a year for the nokk buff and melusi nerf nokk is not picked often and would be greatly improved with it while melusi is not only overpicked but is also a really strong operator and great intel giver as her banshees have these wobble sound effects when you come near them but oh yeah right melusi got nerfed by removing the t 5 and replacing it with the mp5 sake ubisoft whatever you smoked stop it or at least give me some of it too ban phases oh boy oh man how about you guys just delete this system and just implement one like csgo has where can you choose the maps you want to play on instead of having 3 different random maps chosen for you where you ban with the opposing team but you still end up banning bank together and now it chooses between theme park and oregon great thing right i mean yeah this whole map ban system is complete worthless as it still is random which map you play on in theory it works but practically it doesn t i guess i can give the at least you tried award to you guys for this one feature toxicity is something you guys are working actively against but still it shows no real impact even with your new system that will come with the trust factor won t be doing too much against it look at overwatch the whole community there is toxic as hell and yes i played overwatch back in 2016 as some friends forced me to it this is something that every heavy competitive game must go through as players become actively frustrated because of their teammates and the enemy being hardstuck gold i for the entire season and don t even rank up as they clearly show a higher skill level unlike their team and still play against diamond players but eh guess this is how things are now ubisoft you must do much more to the game then you imagine the way you handle it as a very serious tactical competitive shooter doesn t work don t forget the casual players and no don t tell me you didn t forget about them and that you try everything possible to make everyone happy as this is not the case don t listen to much what plat 1 champion players say and what the pro league says it s the same with zofias withstand mechanic for all the years it worked perfectly fine after this one match in pro league it got removed as it didn t fit into rainbow six siege and not because of this stream i call as it was a great mechanic and i never felt that it is unfair as only zofia could do it with only 5 hp and most of the time you still died but it defined her character in my opinion you guys miss the mark in what rainbow six siege wants to be you treat it as a very serious tactical shooter but the more serious it gets the more frustrated players will be they stop playing the game because they burn out and can t have fun in it and eventually leave new players can t get a foot in the door as they either get demolished by smurfs or good players and maybe play the game 5 hours and eventually leave when they meet with a very sweaty and toxic community the game is stale for long term players as you don t make new maps we can play on and create new tactics if you can call them tactics anymore no real interesting operator no new weapons that spice things up again i think there is even more to add to this review but it already is too long and i thank you all who have read this far i think that everyone who comes across this review should also add their own opinion to the current state of the game which i enc,186.5,129.0,10,Not Recommended,"May 23, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Reimalein,False
54486,2016 rainbow 6 siege reviewat first glance rainbow six siege appears to be an action packed shooter in which you clear out all them terrorists and then go home to be celebrated as a highest rank master shooter master after mowing down hundreds in fact however the opposite is true it is a game where you have to carefully locate the opponent and then take them out preferably before they see you and going in guns blazing is a great way to get yourself shot however don t think of it as a simulator or you will end up disappointed much of it looks like it may be but it is still undeniably a game and it plays like one and of course as it is a ubisoft title you will need uplay now that i am 35 hours into said game i think i know enough to write a review though i still suck at actually playing i don t think that will change any time soon but even then it is entertaining much of r6 siege is about understanding the maps and predicting your opponents after all if you can kill with just a single good shot then you want to take the shot before your opponents do that said there is a surprising amount of planning and tactics involved with almost every direction a possible way to assault an objective much of the level architecture is destructible walls floors and furniture are all things that may not actually protect you from bullets depending on what they are made of and the best players are able to pinpoint locations of their opponents purely on the sound they make by just moving around there are a lot of possibilities and i ve yet to find two rounds that played out the same even the ones where i was new and just hid in a corner in the objective room with my gun aimed at a doorway all turned out different of course this sounds very well designed but i don t believe it was intentionally done that way the reason for that are the noob traps in the game most notable of these being the tutorial telling you to breach a window with a charge and jump inside under the cover of that charge if you somehow aren t dead the second you place the charge thumping at the window you will be dead from the people who are now aiming their guns at the window you just very clearly blew open i mean i suppose you can breach a window and jump in yes that is very heroic looking and action filled but it s a very bad idea in practice the tutorials teach you the controls and that s about it attempting to use what it teaches you against players is a good way to die in loud but ultimately ineffective manner but then you can just ask someone to explain things from my time playing i can say that the majority of players are friendly and willing to help out many will understand if you don t know something or just suck though there are a few who will scream at you in heavily accented high pitched english giving you conflicting orders to go both left and right at the same time before calling a kickvote at you because you re not doing what they wanted of course this is a small minority in every online game and they are easy enough to ignore with the knowledge that they are worse than you are even if you re as bad as i am there is always someone worse and they tend to be very vocal games are 5v5 in pvp both ranked and casual modes 5 player team pve and solo pve i can t say much about the pve aspect terrorist hunt as the bots are essentially just target practice and mostly good for learning the map that said it isn t bad just not a challenge and very different from multiplayer there is plenty of variation with a fair amount of maps and lots of operators classes essentially you can pick and unlock with a customization system for your guns that seems to be mainly a preference thing and a cosmetics system to go with it that is mostly very bright and obvious skins that i personally don t really enjoy the look of even then there is a lot of choice a lot of options and only a few options that are flat out bad overall rainbow 6 siege is a bit expensive but if you can catch it on sale or have watched enough videos to know that you will like it then it is worth the buy with a high skill ceiling large amounts of variation and different mechanics from most other known fps games makes it a worthwhile investment of both your time and your money,204.2,38.0,2,Recommended,"December 20, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Xenus Icelon,False

54499,2018 been playing since year one appearantly ubisoft realized that they actually made an okay game that wasn t complete trash and decided to remedy that immediatly wouldn t want to ruin their perfect track record after all eh the game has gone from a nice tactical slow paced shooter to a mindless twich shooter with speed prioritized over all else and actual gadget usage replaced with hold f to gain advantage skills while less important you can visually see the degradation of the game as time progresses through lazy character and weapon design and a decreasing attention to detail ubisoft has also decided that they weren t milking the playerbase hard enough and have increased the ammount of microtransaction for cosmetics cosmetics that focus more on wacky zany headgear and cool emotes xd instead of the tactical realistic cosmetic options they keep promising are coming while this also ties into poor communication and community management ubisoft decided the solution to community complaints about the seemingly arbitrary costs of cosmetics is to harmonize the costs upwards so everything just costs more unless you want to shell out some money for some rainbowbucks despite making several promises to have better and more transparent communication with the community ubisoft continues to fail in this aspect making dumb decisions about the direction of the game and handwaving things away with cop out excuses like data limits technical limitations or stating one thing in official releases then editing it and pretending they never said those things in the first place lastly the community doesn t have a toxicity problem it has a moron problem the only toxic part of the communtiy is the drooling idiots who defend ubisoft s dumb decisions the degradation of the game and roll over on ubisoft s command like little lapdogs yipping we gotta support the game the devs aren t bad i went to the invitation and touched one praise lord chanka xd you had a good thing going ubisoft had edit a comment asked me to review the game not ubisoft i suppose that s a fair request i gave a very shallow summary of things in the original review so i suppose i ll go in more depth about the gameplay forewarning i m not a reviewer and some of this may be more ranty than i anticipated a big complaint i have is that we re now entering year three and ubisoft still hasn t figured out what to do about balancing speed versus armor in a game that prioritizes one shot headshots and guns with high rpms the bonus of being able to take one additional bullet or slip away with 1 hp for three armor operators is not worth being a slow and sluggish one speed like i mentioned in the original review there s becoming a bigger and bigger emphasis on speed and it s become more and more obvious that having more speed is flat out better than having more armor this can be observed by ubisoft balancing old operators like kapkan and blitz by making them faster blitz went from being a meme pick to death incarnate just by being faster it s also apparent in that out of the 18 dlc operators released after the game s launch only echo and mira are 3 armor still waiting on that echo rework change you said was in the works ubi while five have been three speeds with the rest being average 2 2 operators you can t even really make the argument that 3 armor is used as a bad thing to balance out ops like how fuze has good guns good gadgets and a good unique gadget in exchange for being 3 armor because it took half a year for ubisoft to nerf ela who had 3 speed a great gun good gadgets and a good unique gadget to simply having a good gun and okay gadgets there s also seemingly been a change in operator selection i ve seen over time back in red crow and velvet shell when i still thought the game was fun and enjoyable there were more people who played support tactical operators and wanted to coordinate a breach make our way to the site and either secure plant extract now operator selection seems to be prioritized on both attack and defense by what operator kills stuff deader now hardly anyone plays thermite over hibanna because even though thermite s gadget is better for breaching hibanna has better guns people pick twitch not because they want to gather intel and disable gadgets but because the famas is really good her drone nerf made this worse it was going on before that though iq despite having her gadget finally be more useful due to the increase of gadgets it can detect really only gets played because she s 3 speed has good guns grenades and is waifubait the list goes on and on was a lot of this going on back in the good ol days of red crow velvet shell yeah has it gotten worse more widespread since then yeah i ve got a myriad of other complaints reasons why i personally don t like the game anymore but those are more matters of personal preference hell i d wager that right now somebody is reading this and going uhhhhh acktually youtuber x and pro leaguer y said that anyone who complains about things is just bad mkay that s great good for you the average player however doesn t see or experience the same stuff as someone who only plays high level matches with premade squads and advanced coordination and shockingly has a different experience with the game,339.6,385.0,40,Not Recommended,"March 7, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow

54565,2020 game started off good but it kept getting worse and worse before i realised i just didn t enjoy it anymore first it was the removal of maps from the casual pool because they weren t balanced for a competitive environment in casual play say what you will but some of my most fun matches were on yacht old hereford favela hell even bartlett casual play is in the name it is casual play it is not a competitive environment that is why there is a separate ranked playlist and now an unranked version of said playlist for practice then it was the choice to rework old maps instead of creating new ones resulting in every map starting to look and feel the same way uninspired cold washed out and lacking details old house was unbalanced as hell but it had a charm that charm was being one of the only unaltered maps from launch and now the rework just makes it an uninspired boring unbalanced map i feel like every new reworked map feels the exact same way as outback does that same vibe then it was the addition of operators with abilities and aesthetics that just didn t belong in a game like rainbow six siege like alibi with her holographic clones nokk with her camera invisibility gridlock being way too overweight for a role in special forces combat what ever happened to the sas and the gsg9 operator styles tactical and stylish but with a focus on utility over style abilities that were useful but still grounded in reality then it was the gutting of the chat feature now being automatically disabled for new users blocking conversation between you and the enemy all in the name of fighting toxicity and in doing so this robbed siege of one of the funny parts of the experience the talking to the enemy team and being talked to when they beat you but then the worst part they added toxicity bans which could permanently lock you out of the game full ban no text ban no voice ban nope full shebang permanent bans for saying naughty words naughty words that mind you ubisoft decided for themselves i m am adult an immature one sure but nonetheless still an adult and i like to have control over what i read online i m fine being called all the names in the day i can cope with it but the fact that you are hanging the threat of a ban over this just makes it too much i can t support it anymore the game has taken a complete u turn on what made it unique and fun for me and now it is just a clone of overwatch but with real guns instead of fake ones it is a fun shooter and i imagine it ll go great for new players but i started in black ice and it has completely lost what made it fun for me personally even the guys i used to play with feel the same buy this on sale don t buy it full price,549.5,210.0,12,Not Recommended,"December 6, 2020",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Dozzle

54566,2016 are you ready to siege the day here s my short and honest review about this game good things 5 vs 5 very comptetive so take your chances to esl it has an esl tournament requires teamplay teamwork it s an optimized game since it was a ubisoft product i really didn t expect it to be this good and i have to say it wasn t this much optimized when it was released most of the problems and glitches were from amd users now the game is better and more enjoyable the graphics are good not awesome though we really don t need this much graphic quality in the fps games because the players should focus on getting more frame rate for some reasons instead of having everything on ultra like aa vsync etc tactical game you can actually have defense offense plans and train with your team clan for the gamers who do want to play a tactical game these are some unique features not for those who prefer run n gun if you have about a 10 operator you can actually choose what you want since every operator has its main wep and abilites to defend attack choosing your main and learning with him her whould be the best idea you can t jump yeah it s very good no more bunny sh t now you can vault from the desks and everything else it s comptetive so take your chance to esl this game have esl tournament bad things uplay ha please netcode hit registration they just said that they will try to fix it i hope they do you can t spectate your friends during the game the ranking system is not good now it will change with any matchmaking sometimes it takes years to find a game with 4 5 cheaters it s obvious you can see that in every fps game anti cheat system s normal it s was worse when the game was launched known fact you can see more cheaters in the games with high competitive potential the features which you can fell free to list as pros or cons it s not grind but micro transaction you know pay 50 40 for aaa game and you still gotta pay more for some other things skins it s neither good or bad season pass is kind of useless 5 renown booster 7 day early access to new operator and for 30 20 come on give me a break this part is good for those who want to know about the community in this game community ubisoft has a good kick ban system of teamkillers normally in casual games people don t use voice messages but in ranked people try to use that chat rage is normal in ranked is normal too rating 7 10 note it s very hard for me to recommend this game it s like playing on edge of a sharp blade but guys be paitent it will be fixed and become a very good game i m looking forward to the future of this game it ll be huge comptetive and cool end it s my first review since the deleted ones,310.4,24.0,1,Recommended,"March 3, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Maroof

54568,2015 below is my previous review that was written right after launch my view on the game has since changed my reccomendation has since changed i do recommend the game my biggest gripe at this point is the fact that the entire rainbow six franchise is based off a novel and this game has no story to speak of we miss you tom clancy it s fun and everything very fun but it s amazing how little content there actually is for the 60 dollar price tag in 2015 compared to it s predecessorsi can t recommend it at full price though i d recommend waiting for a price drop or getting it on sale though editi will delete any comment regarding a particular key reseller congratualations on missing the point,115.9,908.0,60,Not Recommended,"December 3, 2015",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Bastard Man,False

54585,2022 i only ever heard of this game and thought it was about lgbt awareness cause of the rainbow but then i realised it was an fps which i am also into and wanted to find an alternative to overw tch censored cause idk it might be triggering to some people to mention that game i find that r6 requires a lot more scheming and calculative action rather than just mindless shooting and i think it s what makes it more rewarding the learning curve is steep but it s very fun and makes me feel something when my adrenaline goes up so at least i know i m not really that dead inside and i have a little bit of brain cells ubisoft needs to fix their ui though other than that pretty good game i would give it a solid 1 2 7 4 9 8 2 10,149.5,43.0,10,Recommended,"March 21, 2022",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,yeul6falcie,True

54588,2016 notes after feb 11th 2016 2 1 patch below also updated on may 3rd 2016 i was an open beta player with the pre purchase of this game i have 178 hours played at this point in time and have achieved platinum rank in ranked play with a 6 0 win loss ratio i m also level 83 and have everything unlocked for each character with most top tier skins purchased with renown these are my credentials in this game just so you know i m not speaking out of my behind this game is an excellent game when it works key word when tactically there isn t anything that i know of out there that competes with this title it s fun can be high low paced and is always very intense the number of ways to defend and attack are almost limitless and it shows during game play when you mess up you re usually punished for it and quickly so one slip can make the tide of the game completely turn against for your favour however i did give this a negative review because of the following this game is terribly inconsistent and often favours the high latency player it also has a list horrible of bugs which people like to exploit often i have decided that i am uninstalling this game and will not play it until ubisoft steps up to the plate and actually starts fixing their game here s a list of frustrations i have with this title being killed by someone not on your screen they re 150 200 ping and have shot you but have not appeared yet though i have experienced this with lower ping players being unable to vault over a shield because the game doesn t show the vault on your screen aka the game forgets to make things vault able if that s a word being killed by players during drone phase in which they re not allowed to escape the building but manage to anyways they plant c4 on your spawn location so when you come to life they blow it up being blinded on a shield by random artifacts and patterns on the glass not just visible to the victim but other players being able to see the obstruction on the shield glass being killed by someone you ve just shot 3 4x in the head then notice their health is only down to 75 on the kill cam any character with any gun is a 1 shot head shot fixed feb 11th 2016 problem since sept 2015 launch being killed by the infamous kapkan no laser no spike trap hidden inside the wall glitch which ubi knows about and still has not fixed since beta being shot through your shield as montagne or blitz fuse recruit in the head with it on full extend facing the enemy being killed in a position that your character is not in because the animations do not match the location of the hit boxes being killed through a concrete wall by a c4 or grenade or other explosive the list goes on and on this is a wonderful game that is being ruined by netcode problems and low tickrate servers my final position on this game is this even if you re playing the perfect strategy that means nothing when the game itself is working against you rant off return feb 12th 2016 after the big 2 1 patchkapkan is fixed no more sideways hidden laser trap yay we ve got dedicated servers now oh wait they re not dedicated servers it s a spectator that hosts the match in game which means it s still p2p and the computer is still busy rendering playing the game not dedicated like an hlds or other real console dedicated servers facepalm it is not an openly joinable server that stays online 24 7 either because it requires 10 players to launch and will close in 10 minutes if the 10th player doesn t join if the host backs out the server closes double triple facepalm oh blitz s head is actually behind his shield now i wonder if they moved his point of view from his chin upto his actual eyes as well slow clap here s the bug fixes posted on ubi s forum which is a strange place to begin with i ll add my commentary after each point in s gameplay fixesheadshot hits do not register properly fixed we will keep looking for additional improvement opportunities which means it is not fixed it s actually only improved not fixed exploit players able to clip inside walls using deployable shields fixed wait for it collar collision on frost and buck make headshots register as upper body damage fixed actually it s a piece of clothing with no skin behind it shouldn t cause a hit imo player able to clip inside walls by using deployable shields fixed didn t you already say that nitro cells stick to the edges of tiny leaves on plants fixed but they still stick like glue to the large leaves it should go through the plant and sit inside of it hidden wouldnt you want to hide a c4 inside of a bush i would blitz s gadget blinds players who were not facing it fixed but still doesn t blind players who are facing it consistantly so it s still a broken mechanic that causes his pistol to be unshootable for like 2 seconds yacht when playing during daytime with montagne broken glass decals are completely dark tentative fix we will be tracking for it once patch 2 1 goes live currently cannot reproduce the bug anymore internally please reach out to customer support if you experience it after the patch is live thank you which means they are not sure what caused it and are attempting a live test on the public aka not fixed there s a huge list of fixes but match making is still broken as ever a lot of exploits were addressed but consistancy issues still exist with hit reg and sync many operators still have broken or strange mechanic issues and the game still doesn t feel consistant this is a joke ubisoft update may 3rd 2016so here we are months later this game s match making is still horrible i had to boot the game 3 times to get it to the front menu we had people with connection errors being dropped from games we had to disband and reform our party many times due to errors and other nonsense game glitches and yes we all have open nat with the proper port forwarding the hit reg is a joke still i had put two double taps into a guys head and watch him turn around and try to shoot me the third double tap dropped him there was two blood explosions on all 3 shots and the target was twitch not a tanky high armor character his friend right next to him dropped with 1 double tap in the same fashion the net code sync errors still exist i had an enemy laying on his back facing me and when i went to shoot get this he started shifting left and right by about 2 body widths at a time glitching left and right i got the jump on him and he popped me in the head i played for about 3 hours tonight and this madness ensued all evening stay far away from this game unless you want to end up frustrated with the trash listed above this game has been out for nearly 6 months or 9 months if you include the beta test it s still broken as ever and

54618,2017 simply amazing tactical shooter that takes a completely new approach to the genre attackers start by gathering intel you don t even know where the objective is to start so gathering intel on that the classes of your enemies so you can better prepare location of their traps etc meanwhile defenders start by laying traps and reinforcing walls since the environmental destruction is absolutely large scale while they already have default cameras set up there s also another class which can set up a few more cameras drones and cameras are able to be viewed by everyone on the team so intel for both sides is vitally important and the reason why you just died from a shot through the wall each operator is its own class with a completely separate set of things that it needs to do to attain victory also be very careful as friendly fire is a thing and killing the objective hostage results in insta lose and another thing is that even after death you still are vitally important to your team you re able to view all cameras and control their sight and call out enemies either through voice or with the in game pinger there s so much that sets this game apart from traditional tactical shooters but in all the right directions definitely give this game a shot it s absolutely amazing,87.3,27.0,2,Recommended,"April 7, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"mimizukari

54731,ubisoft once a beacon of innovation in the gaming industry has deteriorated into a cesspool of corporate incompetence and greed their blatant disregard for quality control and consumer satisfaction is nothing short of infuriating gamers who once revered ubisoft for iconic franchises like assassin s creed far cry and rainbow six siege now find themselves grappling with a company that seems more interested in milking its fanbase for every penny than in delivering a polished enjoyable experience the stark contrast between ubisoft s past and present is a testament to how far they ve fallen from grace and it s high time they faced the consequences of their reckless negligence the most glaring issue with ubisoft is their abhorrent track record of releasing unfinished and buggy games it s not unusual for titles to be riddled with game breaking glitches and performance issues that make them nearly unplayable the infamous launch of assassin s creed unity is a prime example where players were met with a host of technical problems ranging from character models disappearing to frame rate drops that made the game a frustrating mess instead of addressing these issues in a timely manner ubisoft often resorts to half baked patches and fixes that do little to rectify the myriad problems leaving players stranded with a subpar product adding insult to injury ubisoft has mastered the art of exploiting microtransactions and in game purchases to the detriment of the gaming experience what was once a realm of immersion and enjoyment has been sullied by predatory monetization practices that prioritize profit over player satisfaction titles like the division 2 and ghost recon breakpoint have been criticized for their excessive in game store items which often feel like blatant cash grabs rather than meaningful content the relentless push to extract additional money from players undermines the integrity of their games and reveals a disturbing lack of respect for their audience moreover ubisoft s infamous habit of rehashing the same formulaic gameplay across multiple titles is a direct insult to gamers intelligence the repetitive nature of their open world games where each new release feels like a clone of its predecessor with minimal innovation is infuriating rather than pushing the envelope or experimenting with fresh concepts ubisoft seems content to churn out cookie cutter experiences that capitalize on past successes without delivering anything genuinely new or exciting this creative stagnation is not only frustrating but also indicative of a company that has lost its passion for game development finally ubisoft s disregard for meaningful communication and transparency with its community only compounds their faults the company s consistent failure to address player concerns or acknowledge their mistakes fosters a sense of betrayal among their loyal fanbase this lack of accountability and open dialogue exacerbates the frustration felt by gamers who have invested time and money into ubisoft s products only to be met with indifference and empty promises in an industry where trust is paramount ubisoft s actions are a glaring reminder of their descent into a corporate abyss leaving a trail of disappointed fans and tarnished reputations in their wake,887.2,30.0,2,Not Recommended,July 31,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,C_HOG,False

54834,2017 i ve played this game since the beta and i love this game s conceptual design the reason this game only gets 50 000 peak players is because of the ridiculously bad netcode lag compensation and overall frustrating shooting mechanics operation health did nothing i think that was just a pr scam to make pleyers think they fixed the game it s really a shame as this game should have millions at peak but because of the devs total lack of understanding their own game people go away the game has actually gotten worse since launch most people with good connections can t stomach it for very long i play this game less and less and i m a die hard for this concept i keep thinking they will fix the shooting so it s not morons with 300 pings running around with 3 speeds eating 20 bullets and receiving only 5 damage the fact that it s advantageous to have a high ping in this game really says it all about how out of touch the devs are to this game until they realize this and understand how much money and success they could get by fixing these issues it ll remain in this limbo of an almost great game unitl then i can t recommend this game to any new player which kills me inside,847.6,134.0,8,Not Recommended,"October 16, 2017",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,DoubleBogey,False

54849,2016 alright i played enough of this game to make a decent review of it tldr get it dirt cheap and don t bother with their ranked system try to get friends to play it i m currently in queue for a ranked game and it s been 14 minutes it must also be the amount of time they spent coding it there s 3 way to play this game pvp casual pvp ranked and pve pve terrorist hunt is fun with friends but gets really boring after a while that s my opinion some people really dig it but i don t anymore i ll now talk about the pvpi played a total of 9 games today 3 of them were 3v5 2 of them were with trolls that killed us and got instakick by the game too bad ewplay doesn t give you substitute for them so i played 1v5 for 2 rounds the game then went for a 3v5 1 with 2 of my premades the other 3 went well edit the game i was in queue for was a 3v4 i used to play casual and lot and wanted to experience the ranked system turns out it s pure played my game through the unranked to bronze 2 1 with almost the same type of games as mentioned above i got demoted 5 times in those 10 games so the pros the graphics are nice the gameplay is fun strategy and communications are great too bad people won t use it the cons you have to farm the characters or buy them top value for the money you paid customization through in game shop with an excessive amount of farming or money once again used to have a lot of hackers ranked system sucks super hard you ll play with and against the same guys over and over and over again for instance right now i cancelled my queue a good 10 times just to be matched again with the same guys that trolled our team the previous game there s no afk kick the netcode will kill you and it must be the only game ever where lagging gives you an advantage you can see people through walls sometimes long queues no single player ewplay no point buying season pass it s a scam the casual mode is the same as ranked although i find ranked more challenging they also make no sense at all so i ll still play the game but i m glad overwatch is coming out later today rainbow six rogue spear used to be my favorite fps and one of my first one i d like to thank you ubisoft for destroying everything you touch,152.2,99.0,10,Not Recommended,"May 24, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"UNSKILLED TRASH

54902,2016 as of today i have just purchased the starter edition for around 15 i have just gave it a test run and let me just say the gameplay was amazing the two free operators randomly picked were dull in my eyes and i haven t even tried them however using the provided 600 rainbow six credits or something i bought thermite and that gs9 character with electrical charges forgot the name so i ll just call him sparky these two characters represented my play style so perfectly i chose to use them for the whole game the loading time to find players in casual tdm was quite minimal taking about 20 seconds the matchmaking paired me up with the nicest pair of guys who helped guide me through everything congratulating me upon my first kill and what came next this definitely left a amazing impression on me as i look forward to bring countless hours to this game to me the 15 was totally worth the price as i m not to impatient with the excessive grinding that is needed to unlock further operators to all those who are patient buy this game quickly for 15 when you have the chance i think it ends june 19th otherwise go for the 40 if you so desperately desire all operators so quickly i ve heard this game is dying so it might benefit to put only 15 in it because honestly a multiplayer game can only be worth 15 to me as a side to the main campaign so that being said rainbow six siege is worth that 15,364.2,25.0,3,Recommended,"June 10, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Sir.

54908,2016 this is a case of wasted potential alright i don t like putting up negative reviews since most of the time it just comes down to personal preference when i don t like a game but this is just hilarious first off the game itself is not bad at all in fact i really enjoy playing it the concept and gameplay elements are great and me and my friends already had a lot of fun playing this but i just can t deal with the bad things going on this game for starters the matchmaking is just plain bad in casual and rankeds alike it s probably the worst i ve ever seen since cs go competitives it s neither fun nor helping me improving my game always having to play against people who have hundreds of hours more gametime than me and while i may be able to overlook this in casuals the rankeds are almost impossible to win with the kind of players the matchmaking comes up with best example me and a friend both on like silver 3 had to play against a group with one gold guy and even two platinum guys which was probably because the other two silverguys in the enemyteam got boosted by these guys so my question is why is that even possible even cs go prevents boosting of that magnitude and in every other ranked we played we always got matched against people who were of higher rank than us not even one time were they lower than us also the matchmaking in rankeds takes really long i would understand that if it would match us with people of the same skilllevel but thats not what it does so why does it even take so long second this one has become really rare but it still happens there is a kind of gamebreaking bug where after you pick your operator and the time runs out there comes a short loading screen and then you get into the game the bug simply wont let the loading finish and you are mostly stuck there forever i think there was like one time where it finished loading after like 5 minutes but in all other cases it wouldnt start even after 30 minutes so this is a aaa game published by a pretty big company this bug existed since the beta and they still havent been able to fix that so i basically paid money for not being able to play the damn game because every 2 or 3 games that bug happens maybe it s just my bad luck but that doesnt change the fact that it exists for months and i haven t found any statement as to why this happens and if they are actually concerned about that or no third the anti cheat system aka fairfight edit so this one is kinda obsolete now they got a clientsided anticheat now as far as i know it consists of analyzing your keystrokes while playing to see if you push any button which is not binded in the controls a fair number of times for like hackmenus etc and of course checking kda with skilllevel blablabla so bascially its a math based algorithm what happens when you have a math based algorithm and the possibility to report people ingame after you get owned by a player yes you get banned wether you actually cheated or not which is actually what happened to a friend of mine after getting a few good flickshots on his enemies so he got suspended from the game for a few minutes even though he just played normally twice great stuff not like we don t have any experiences of bad completely automatic anti cheatsystems it usually results in more work for the support oooh wait the support doesn t care at least thats what i could see by seeing multiple threads regarding anti cheat and other topics like that little bug where the people basically got no answer even after weeks of waiting well best anti cheat system ever still that s not the worst problem since i m not affected because i m bad at shooter anyway anyway forth the netcode on console this might even work in favor of the players as they are playing with controllers so some delay will work in their favor as they need longer to aim at their target but we are playing this on a computer we don t have that problem but ubisoft didn t account for that just made a simple port and now it just feels like another call of duty edit soo this game has been here for over a year now the netcode has not been fixed at all yay another thing i wanted to add in addition to the bad netcode the game also suffers from bad hitbox detection also since release so you hit your enemy in the head too bad you get killed while he didn t even take damage while on other occasions you get hit in the torso but it counts as a headshot or let s say you are standing in front of him he kills you with a neckshot which does double damage i might be mistaken but the neck is the backside right oh what would i know of anatomy the last but least important thing the community judging from all those reviews on steam the community is the best of every game in existence okay maybe thats overestimating it but still there are alot of those reviews comparing it to like cs go yes the community is by far better but on the other hand cs gos community is one of the worst things i ve seen anyway any yes mostly the people who actually did talk were nice and easy to talk to but still there were more than enough people i played with or against who though they were the best in the world and being arrogant and all that stuff which was kinda annoying so i don t really get why people would go all over the good community like that when it s actually like any other game just a little tone better hey maybe thats just my experience again because of bad luck or whatever but still i can t help but think that the majority of these reviews are bought or just people who got caught in the hype train which is never a good thing also casuals communitybasically a bunch of tryhards hardcorecamping as defenders and attackers doing everything they can to win and not to have fun well thats really just my opinion and not influencing the review directly but it emphasizes the previous point these points results in me not being able to recommend this game even though it can be a lot of fun at least not at this point in time i really hope that at least that stupid bug as well as the anti cheat system will be adressed by its developers in the near future but until then save your money edit so it has been a year i still play the game i can still sometimes enjoy it but it s still not worth the money,333.3,73.0,5,Not Recommended,"May 5, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six®

54965,2016 this game had such potential leave it to ubisoft to f ck up a good thing while the multiplayer is pretty sound despite the bugs please for the love of jesus mary and joseph stay away from terrorist hunt it s absolute dog sh t the game literally cheats because the developers weren t talented enough to make intelligent challenging ai without giving the enemies aimbot and wall hacks i ve seen grenades go through solid walls bots throw flashbangs backwards like a pitcher throwing a baseball towards home plate but the ball goes the opposite direction you ll be shot through walls without the enemy ever having line of sight of you shielded enemies can hipfire headshot you from 30 feet away bots are impervious to smoke bombs as they ll still lock onto you even though there s a thick cloud of smoke with zero visibility i ve also seen them be impervious to flashbangs where one goes off right in front of them and they re unaffected etc they also know when you re controlling a drone as a bot will run up and shoot you in your dumb face while you re looking at the drone feed even though just prior to that you stood in the same spot for ten minutes without a bot ever coming close to your position it s truly disgusting there are for sure issues i m forgetting as a human couldn t possibly remember all the issues with this game off the top of their head as they re too plentiful an enemy will be slowly walking scanning left and right and then all of a sudden without ever seeing you he ll quickly turn 90 or 180 degrees and put his iron sights directly on you it s so insane the ai essentially have aimbot as their sights are literally stuck to your head following even your slightest movements as if the barrel of their gun is attached to your dome i also take issue with the bombers in terrorist hunt they re ridiculous and out of place while most of the game has a focus on realism the bombers are an embarrassing departure from that it s straight up some call of duty crap they literally fire their aug s one handed while running towards you yet they retain the accuracy as if they were firing it normally with both hands if you let a bomber kill you with his aug instead of his bomb and then watch the kill cam you ll see him holding his aug with both hands just like any other terrorist even though in third person the bomber is holding a detonator in one hand his aug in the other and he s sprinting towards you that s how lazy these devs are hip firing a bullpup rifle with one hand while running full speed and squeezing a detonator in the other hand ubisoft s idea of realism i don t understand what they were thinking putting those in the game also the fact that it takes multiple headshots to kill them even with glaz marksman rifle is another gross departure from the realism the game has focused on it s especially silly when you consider the operator tachanka has a steel ballistic helmet over his entire head yet he s still a one shot headshot but some f ck face in a white hazmat suit can eat several shots to the dome with even the most powerful weapon stop it ubi you re making me laugh now how about the time limit on the upper difficulties why is this a thing i understand a time limit on multiplayer but why is it in terrorist hunt more importantly why is it so short why give me only twelve minutes to go hunt and kill nearly thirty enemies by myself it goes against everything this game was trying to be a slow methodical shooter it s not a call of duty run and gun shooter but the time limit forces me to play like that they don t even make the time limit scale depending on how many players there are as a lone wolf it s kinda difficult to rush thirty enemies and kill them all in under twelve minutes especially when i m dealing with all the sh t i ve listed above in just the last year they have truly killed terrorist hunt it s a giant slap in the face to any of the players who enjoyed this game mode they ve turned it into practice for their pvp players they easily could of made both groups happy having the option to choice classic t hunt or practice mode the worst part is how they turned every map into an airsoft arena all the realism of the maps is completely gone they all just feel like paintball courses now at least before the maps felt like real places you actually felt like an elite law enforcement operator storming a terrorist strong hold that s why maps were based off real locations in the first place but every map is now a contrived e sports playground it s so sad what a joke this game has become what year of season pass are we on now year fifteen why make a new game when players will pay you half the cost of a new game every single year for 5 of the content a full game would have you don t even get new weapons anymore and people are still giving ubi money to keep this travesty of a game alive all these players are doing is enabling corporations like ubisoft to be a bunch of lazy greedy

54974,2021 reviewa very interesting alternative to counter strike the main advantage of the game is the ability to influence the environment which means that in this game it is not only aiming and reflexes that counts but also tactical sense this significantly increases the set of possible moves what s more thanks to such game mechanics it is much easier to deal with cheaters than in counter strike at the same time they are both a disadvantage and an advantage characters with individual skills it makes the game more colorful and increases the range of tactics at the same time make the risk of a lack of balance between the characters fortunately the developers deal with this problem amazingly well as a minus i consider walking away from realism and the move towards esports bright and garish skins colorful uniforms and weapons and some too sci fi skills in my opinion they spoil the atmosphere of the rainbow six saga summary advantages interactive environment destructible walls floors etc greate breachng mechanism characters with skills drone mechanics good friendly fire report and punishment system weapon accessories affecting the fire characteristics disdvantages character balance problem for new characters poor realism of the appearance of characters and weapons no possibility of punishing reporting people leaving the match toxic players,846.4,42.0,7,Recommended,"September 24, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"ZakapiOOr

55077,2016 first of all 150 hours 30 in the last two weeks but still a negative recommendation what gives it s simple this game is plagued by numerous game breaking technical flaws sloppy netcode serves are few and far apart client side calculationsif a competetive shooter had even one of these issues it would be a cause for concern r6 has all three these issues are so prevelant and impactful that you re forced to have them in the back of your mind while you re playing which constalty rips you out of your gaming experience i might have let some of this slide but these issues have gone unadressed since the games release to start off the majortiy of players have bad pings and i mean bad above 100ms on average and there s no server browser so you really have no control over it this could easily be fixed by just adding more servers but that would be too costly for ubi oft the tickrate of the game is 60hz which is alright but shootings ending in simultaneous deaths happens quite a lot my biggest issue with the game however is that the client is in charge of things that should be handled by the server bodies falling over smoke grenades and debris is all handled client side this sounds bad but it gets worse bodies and debris can fall in unpredictable ways and can look totally different from player to player a barricaded window can look as though it s whole on your screen but on someone elses screen it actually has a hole in it this for example inexcuseable gfycat com but it doesn t end there bodies and debris have hitboxes that can block your bullets but not theirs the technical issues continue the animations in the game are good when they work when they don t however it results in and wall punching induced rage getting shot through your shield happens so often it s become a meme in the community all of this combined makes the game only enjoyable when you re not playing competitively and it s a damn shame too because this is a great game but it s crippled and in dire need of help if ubisoft ever fixes these issues i will change my rating but i wouldn t hold my breath edit apparently the ping you see ingame is suppose to be divided by two so the average player ping some something like 50 which is alright but it sure doesn t feel like it is,209.3,116.0,11,Not Recommended,"December 26, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Ace,False
55078,2015 most reviews have given this game pretty good reviews with the same cons for almost every review they keep pushing the fact that there isnt enough depth as someone with over 900hrs on csgo and having played it since 1 6 i can say that depth is relevant people play dust 2 all day long year in year out without becoming bored becauseit is the human adversary that adds depth and continual change to approach every round this game has a multitude of option on operators that arent merely skins but offer different ways to achieve victory thatsuit your approach eg wanna bust through the front door then take a meat shield and let your team walk in behind you there are so many options on entry poitns that every match is significantly different this is a great game that deserves your attention if you enjoy team fps games that require a little bit of planning each round the graphics are not mind blowing but serve to allow a large diversity of gamers access which is only going to give the game a longer shelf life the sound is amazing with headphones and using sounds are paramount to victory it took a little bit of fiddling to get the game running the way i like in terms of fps and look etc but otherwise the servers have been great and as an aussie im getting 35ms and yet to have trouble getting a game under 20 secs i hope this helps you to make a decision but at the very worst you can get a refund using steam support if you dont like it cheers,75.4,19.0,3,Recommended,"December 6, 2015",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,TarzGG,False

55156,2019 playtime does not reflect my total bads most toxic people online period i joined a casual match one morning and the first thing i heard before i even loaded was i wish i was george zimmerman so that i could ve you get the idea don t you dare tell me that league of legends is worse don t tell me csgo is worse dude if you re in a game with spanish people they just say puta puta puta puta i could make a dance mix like the badger song i think rocket league has a higher percentage of people who are toxic in that game almost everyone ruins the game in a temper tantrum if it starts going bad but in r6 the toxic players are outright cruel in ways that the people on rocket league are not in one there are kids having fits in the other there are mature adults thinking carefully about exactly how to give you nightmares and kids imitating them it can be pretty upsetting at times the ranked system has all the flaws of current games of the era you ll never go pro it s the typical closed league system where unless you re rich or famous you re just plain not going to be recruited no matter your skill and good luck showing your skills i wrote something on reddit which got threadlocked instantly cranky much about how the current elo system is completely broken for games which only score you based on win loss in teams you re forcefully paired with but r6 doesn t even use elo which has mitigations in place to make it possible for people with an unfairly low rank to get higher it s just solely you win you got points you lose you lost points which sounds like it makes sense until you consider the edge cases and variables involved for example one problem with these systems is that they don t score based on activity in any way meaning that people who play infrequently but play in games they somehow know they re going to win have a higher rating than people who play every day there s an incentive with this kind of ranking system to hoard your rank like dragon s gold and what if you consistently perform better than everyone else on your team but your rank still goes down because you re not an actual god yet and they lose it for you nobody wants to talk about these issues not gamers not designers it s kind of pathetic how afraid everyone is of questioning tradition lastly the patches for the game come pretty slow ubisoft will have designed launched made dlc for and end of lifed several games by the time they finish making a system for r6 that simply makes pieces of cardboard break the same way on everyone s screens i can come up with the math for this in my head a gussied up adaptation of minecraft s brick breaking netcode would work fine for example so i don t know why they ve delayed it over and over again it s important because you need to have it guaranteed that everyone has the same viewholes and the same blocked views or people will be able to take advantage of stuff being different on their screen versus everyone else s right now the feature has been pushed back to we ll start thinking about how we want to try doing this in january as of the latest patch notes what yeah goods regardless of how accurate it is or isn t siege does a good job of making things feel like they could be real pick your favorite swat action movie where the team bursts into a room with the lasers on their guns pointing in all different directions you get to live that if you ever had any interest in knowing what it feels like r6 does that procedural action thriller feeling perfectly rescue hostages disarm the bomb secure the biohazard container i think the hostage rescue is the best and most exciting but most people don t because crazy leroy can kill the hostage by accident pout still you get to do all that stuff it s great the only thing it s lacking is mirrors to show you what s around the corner like in a stallone flick which you can sorta do with the camera drones anyway so it sort of has that fixes might come with all the slowness of water eroding the grand canyon but the actual content drops are fun interesting and come at blink and you ll miss it speed there s always new things to try like deployable shields with little bits of glass you can use to peek through them or the new pick ban mode where you and the other team collaborate compete on who you can play as in a match or the rainbow is magic event where all the operators are wearing pink clothes and fight with confetti as blood in an airplane designed to look like a baby nursery complete with voiceovers that sound like they re read out of a storybook new operators with new abilities every three months guaranteed are also a big plus don t like the current set of play options wait a little bit and you ll get to try something new don t feel like you can handle twitch shooting a recent new operator has laser cameras that let you camp out and track enemies safely from your little hidey hole and annoy them with laser barrages it s useful to everyone else to know where the enemies are especially if you can shave some of their hp off so it s not a second class choice by any measure another recent one lets you cover the floors in spikes that literally fill entire rooms changing the tactical dynamics completely wish the game was stealthier the current update brings an attacker who can barely be heard and jams cameras so they can t be seen choice choice and more choice back in the day games like bf3 and bf4 and even call of duty gave you a lot of guns very quickly and let you pick between all of them change what color they are change the way their scope looks change whether they had a grip or not and so on basically nothing lets you do this anymore it takes a lot longer to grind for attachments and weapons and there s an obvious linear progression of weapons in most games where you simply get a better weapon the longer you play i feel like some ceo s kid had trouble with all of those choices and cried and they said ok son no more weapon choices in games daddy loves you yeah well in r6 that kid is f ed there s a lot of variety some of it is hidden away in individual operators but you re likely to find a loadout you enjoy the community what you said the community was toxic yes but the people who aren t toxic are great the community is filled with geniuses who share their analyses on tactics that you might not have considered using before r6 s mechanics are very open ended for example you can shoot through floors or ceilings and excavate a giant view to the level of the building above or below you there s strategies on when and where to try stuff and people advise each other on near infinite amounts of situations spend a few hours looking at the siege academy subreddit and you ll probably learn a lot if you re new below lv100 or so conclusion all in all i think the people who love this game love options if you like being able to do anything choose anything r6 stands alone in 2019 as one of the only big name games that cares more about offering choices than whether or not it feels fair and it is mostly fair it just might seem unfair at first i got into a pretty long talk with a hacker a few days ago who said they hated the game because people could peek at them guess where they were based on foot noises and other cheats that are actually coded into the game intentionally whiny little snots who ve never experienced true freedom in a game will hate this i hope they stick with it and learn how everything used to be before the f ing idiocracy won and making things accessible and unthreatening became more important than making them interesting and educational r6 out of all the big aaa games is the least safe watered down and predictable i can think of just please forgive my

55228,2018 the game can be fun but not in its currrent state i picked this game up back in operation skull rain early october 2016 a friend recommended the game to me so i gave it a try and after a few rounds i was addicted to the game mostly the pvp game modes since the pve becomes quickly tiresome in my opinion i played a lot in parties of two till four players and sometimes solo i recommend to bring a friend or two along since its way more fun this way because this game surely requires some teamplay it really depends on how the enemy team is performing any player with some fps experience will quickly pick up how to play this game and probably end up in the higher end of the scoretable teamplay is recommended but not necessary to win the game pick a fast operator with a decent gun or one of the recently released operators since they are either unbalanced for example ela when she was added to the game or break up the till then existing meta which forces players to change their gameplay and exposes them more to mistakes in their gameplay and sometimes even both map awareness is key learn the maps seriously invest some time in memorizing at least some key points on the map every map has its own points where it is very easy for the attacker or defender team to get a few quick kills you can move as careful as you want you will probably die a lot by player made murderholes in walls or barricades or rappeling attackers who lurk around at some broken window learn and adapt to the most popular spots and try to guess where its most likely that some enemy could wait for you the same goes for all sorts of traps after some time you will see a pattern in how players usually place traps and might even be able to get some clues by how gadgets are placed and usually indicate that a trap is nearby e g a ballistic shield in a doorframe that would require to vault over it frost trap kapkan tarp and or lesion trap behind it the sound and graphics the game looks very good textures are sharp the lightning since they overhauled it back in operation health go check out the comparrisons of old and new lightning and the sounds are the best i heard so far at least when it comes to environmental sounds like footsteps and and distant gunshots the sound is very important in this game since its focused on close quarters combat which means that you only got little time to react the sound of footspets people crawling over the floor or just them shifting in leaning or reloading the gun can help you as a player to find out where your opponent is and get him before he is able to get you so for your own pleasure and fun and the one of your teammembers wear headphones and turn off any music porn videos or any other sources of sounds like children gf bf just turn them off but please in a legal way that might play in the background oh and use a mic for that short team interactions you might have teamplayshooter or not teamplayshooter rainbow six siege features operators that a player can pick from every time a new round starts those operators are divided into an attacker and defender pool which means that as a defender you cant pick an attacker operator every single operator has a gadget that gives him her an unique ability players are encouraged to use those abilities since the usually help out the team in a whole like traps barricades extra cams now here is where i would argue why this game isn t really a teamplayshooter and for that i must mention the community of the game there is the argument often made that you shouldn t review the community of a game because its not the games fault in my opinion this argument is pure bs but i will go into detail with that later most of the time the team interaction is limited to those gadget placements phases after that its often everybody for himself sure people might pick each other up if they are downed but where is the moving and clearing room after room with a buddy covering each others back discussing how to move into the building who goes for the hostage who stays behind to catch eventual roamers who brings the breaching charge who the emp shotgun or smg do we have a marksman or does everybody just goes with a shield dont get me wrong i dont expact this to happen in a casual game my only point is that this game has much more potential in this aspect than there currently is used by the community and it doesnt seem to be the focus of the community either just watch a pro league match even those players are often alone and all over the map seperated from each other players might be in a team but at the end everybody moves out to hunt on their own the community now with 80 less bad words now we are coming to my favorite part the community and yes i will review that and why recent changes from ubisoft side encouraged me to put down the game the community was never good to begin with but i didn t expect anything special everybody who ever played counter strike in his life probably knows what an unpleasant place the internet or more like the didicated server can be however in a competitive nature that these kinds of games bring along with them it totally normal to experience emotional outbursts eventually those subjects either quit calm down or even might pull themselves back to the top of the score board no harm done no hard feelings bad words where said mothers experienced sexual intercourse and racial assumptions were made now a small but vocal minority took a hard look at that behaviour and decided that this cant be allowed to happen and so we got the new glorious chat filter to make players behave eliminate the toxicity and cure cancer itself welp it just didnt work it would have been much easier to just give the player the ability to mute voice and text chat which was implemented along with the chat filter the textfilter doesnt censor the bad word it bans the author from playing the game online the time increases with every repeated incident the textfilter is supposed to stop racial homophobic slurs and so on in my opinion it just killed the chat since it was filled with quite entertaining now it usually is just quiet because people are afraid to say something people developed a sport where they try to trick others into saying words on a ban list those people end up banned quite confused since they didnt even know that they were writing something offensive happend to myself as well with the word it hits non native english speakers quite often since those people usually lack the socialisation process that provides you with the hidden meaning of that to you harmless word and thats were i draw the line for myself i wont have a product that was created for adults parent me and what i write in chat its their product they can do whatever they want with it but in my opinion it just hurts the game i dont care about people saying offensive stuff on the internet since they are just that people who never met me who i dont care about and neither care they about me or should do so we play a game we have fun some talk others dont the game ends and we move on with our lifes something offends you mute him mute the text chat but please dont begins to censor people since they will always find new ways to live out their toxic ways its not the games fault how the community behaves but certain games attract certain people and you cant have the game without the community or vise versa and since the community just got worse with the recent changes which isnt the commnuitys fault but more

55246,2020 r6 is a great game i can t recommend it enough if you just want to have fun the first person shooter puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and co operation between players such as your own friends or the funny random people you meet each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage defusing a bomb and taking control of an objective within a room although it may seem like there aren t many ways to play out each game i can say that every round has felt different to me r6 gives players a large selection of operators to play as on both defending and attacking each operator has their own guns skills and abilities to help them win the game with each season or operation comes new operators maps reworks and more r6 comes with a few different gamemodes including casual unranked ranked and sometimes arcade games and events that all come with different maps to compete on this game is one of the few that give you such heavy adrenaline rushes in game that make you feel so satisfied when you see that you ve won the match although this game has it s ups it has its fair share of bugs and glitches and hackers each season that sometimes makes you feel extremely low when playing it s developers and community are for the most part a big help to make the game better even looking at gameplay from when the game first came out you can see that the developers have seriously improved the whole game since getting the game i ve worked my way up to level 100 and looking back i can easily remember how large of a learning curve there was if you re willing to get past that you will have fun and it ll be worth the time and effort put in,509.6,19.0,2,Recommended,"July 24, 2020",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Red,False

55464,2023 rainbow six siege is one of my favourite multiplayer games it s atmosphere and action really shows how far we ve come in technology i own and have played both rainbow six vegas 1 2 and i feel that they implemented a different take onto the rainbow six series and made it into a multiplayer game i originally owned the game on xbox and spent near over 200 hours on the game only last year i had decided to come back to siege and play it again but now on pc which is what i now use to play all my games luckily for those like me who had a level 60 account and owned a lot of the operators can transfer it to pc by simply linking the same ubisoft account you used on your xbox it does take a day or two to fully link but it s all good one you have it i cannot recommend siege enough as it is still to this day argubly one of the most popular multiplayer shooters,160.3,26.0,2,Recommended,"March 30, 2023",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"liltrillix

55496,2021 i have a lot of experience playing fps games but no game has me returning to it quite like siege ngl a very steep learning curve at around 50 60 hours of game time you ll still be learning the basics but believe you me it s worth it cuz in the end you re investing your time in a game which i genuinely find worth playing yes it has its issues but which game doesn t the game is very well balanced i believe ubi has done a good enough job balancing out operators so a single operator doesn t get insta locked and overused i find this interesting cuz the roster keeps changing every round and everyone needs to improvise the amount of sheer skill and map knowledge one requires in siege is insane and after all that you ll still just be an average player good luck,669.9,18.0,5,Recommended,"June 28, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Master Baiter,False

55538,2018 they are currently discriminating against spanish speaking people german speaking people french speaking people and anyone who identifies as a person from pakistan because of their new chat banning system let me preface that their intentions were probably good as toxicity can ruin a game s community however they clearly didn t give enough of a to test the system or even build a simple system that has existed since runescape instead of finding a clear and concise way to censor slurs and bigotry they outright ban you for saying words that include the combination of letters that would be considered a slur words like racoon red dot weniger the spanish word for black and the french word for lag are all instaban words why they decided to use an automated easily weaponized system to deter toxicity is beyond me because it has done all to curb toxic behavior all they have done is ironically be ethnocentric bigots themselves by assuming people will know english slurs until this is fixed do not buy this game unless you want to be banned for a misspelling or speaking a language other than english,304.9,27.0,0,Not Recommended,"July 17, 2018",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Philbenson,False

55548,2021 with the hours i have 111 on pc and around 500 on console because my friends are on those platforms i can t recommend this game in the state its in even in the future and i ll list my reasons the game is far from what it was 2017 2019 to now what made siege great was that it was a tactical military shooter fighting terrorists and all that now we have operators that are completely sci fi it also has gotten really confusing with all these operators left right and centre its hard to keep track another thing that stings is the removal of maps or reworking of maps without keeping the original and just removing it from existence the ranked scene and even casual is even horrible with horrible teammates being completely toxic and never wanting to help anyone even new players team killing just because of a mistake don t get me wrong its funny as all in casual or when you re just messing around but when you want to chill and play or even concentrate to play ranked it gets frustrating and makes you want to quit you ll meet good people trust me i ve met friends and still talk to them to this day i m going to mention another problem specifically the console which isn t a problem here i ask ubisoft to at least contact microsoft and playstation of the mnk problem for consoles its gotten so horrendous that i can t even play casual anymore to just chill with my mates no word or anything has been said about the issue just oh we don t condone it please don t do it but what does that achieve nothing and it ll only get worse making console player base get smaller and smaller of the people who just don t want to cheat or they ll cave and spend horrendous amount of money on a xim just to get good when the thing doesn t even mimic mouse movement correctly i ll close out this review from a person who loved siege and played it religiously and got platnium twice i loved it for the fact it offered challenge where i was used to games like cod and overwatch where almost every move counted or you had to at least think of what you were doing instead of just roaming around shooting like a idiot this game told you you this isn t cod don t treat it like it and let me tell you when i first started out it was hard i died almost every round but i was still having fun i loved this games community with tachanka jokes and annual events that i got excited for i ve made amazing memories with this game with 1v5 and aces i don t write this review as a hater i write it as a person who loved siege and watched every singe trailer for new season i wish to see change though i doubt with how ubisoft treats its employees and the way they package their games as some lazy open world i doubt we ll see anything of that nature so for right now siege will be this hero sci fi shooter which has lost its identity edit siege got worse and ubisofts game design is worser,111.4,18.0,2,Not Recommended,"May 30, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Crytex

55609,2023 i have to say i m deeply disappointed with the direction rainbow six siege has taken especially since the release of ela the game used to rely on strategy communication and careful planning but with ela the delicate balance that made siege stand out among other shooters has been disturbed turning it into something more like a standard run and gun title but my biggest gripe the real knife to the heart is the mishandling of the character havoc havoc was teased in the game s e3 trailer portrayed as this intriguing menacing character who was supposed to bring an exciting twist to the game the trailer did an excellent job of building hype around havoc the character s design menacing aura and what appeared to be a unique gameplay mechanic the trailer painted a vivid picture of havoc as a new villain a ruthless operator who seemed to be bringing a new level of intensity and danger to siege it suggested that his arrival would significantly shake up the game s dynamics posing new challenges and creating fresh strategies for players to explore however this was all a pipe dream despite all the hype despite all the anticipation built up havoc is nowhere to be found in the actual game it s a classic case of false advertising and has left many fans including me feeling betrayed we were promised something exciting something groundbreaking but what we got was a no show and if the mishandling of havoc wasn t enough the writing has also gone down the drain exemplified by the addition of dokkaebi her bio intro is just cringeworthy her fingers dance across the keyboard the light of the lcd screen underscoring her smirk it s a cheesy line that feels out of place and makes her character feel shallow and uninspired it s not the level of writing one would expect from a game with the pedigree of rainbow six siege it s hard not to feel misled and deceived the absence of havoc in the game is like a promising movie trailer with no actual film to follow it s like being served a mouthwatering menu with no food to eat it s not just about one character it s about broken promises and shattered expectations the game has deviated from its roots focusing on quick action and flashy gimmicks rather than on deep tactical gameplay the introduction of ela the misleading portrayal of havoc and the cringe worthy writing for dokkaebi have made siege lose its identity and it s a real shame in conclusion if you loved rainbow six siege for its strategic depth teamwork and engaging characters you might want to give it a miss for now unless the developers make a u turn and steer the game back to its roots it s hard to see this title reclaiming its former glory so until then i can t recommend this game,279.4,19.0,1,Not Recommended,"May 27, 2023",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Zinc Drink

55617,2021 this game still has not added adequate balancing measures in terms of matchmaking what i mean by this is that it consistently matches you with people who can be way higher than your skill level in gamemodes like quickmatch and it s a pain in the ass to try and enjoy a slightly more peaceful game that doesn t involve the stress of the effort required to play ranked someone would then maybe ask why not play ranked then to have people of your skill level matched against you and that d be a good idea yet it becomes a problem when i am encountering people who are smurfing harder than raja gosnell and aren t even trying to hide it these sorts of imbalances make it a pain in the ass to enjoy the game most of the time and just a very unnecessary irritation for players new to the game you literally cannot learn to be better at the game if you are literally unable to because 8 10 of the time i get matched against people that are simply better than me and the game won t give me a chance to be better bare in mind ideas by ubisoft to fully do something effective about smurfing and balancing this game to a maximum extent have only just been brought up right as you read this review ideas and features to prevent this type of imbalance in the game should have been done at the start i get that the game has this get good motto when it comes to playing but there has to be a middle line when it comes to getting better at the game in it s current state,523.3,34.0,13,Not Recommended,"March 17, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Lima India Golf Mike Alpha

55768,2020 tl dr too many balancing issues toxicity and bad design choices i started playing this game during its third year after many people recommended it to me year 3 was different from the previous years because ubisoft had decided to add 2 operators to the attacking side instead of the usual attacker and defender year 3 season 1 also brought a new event called outbreak in season 2 ubisoft added 2 defending operators and went back to the usual attacker and defender and in season three everything started going downhill operation grim sky brought two new operators maverick and clash maverick has a blowtorch that can melt reinforced walls and clash has a riot shield with a taser no matter how hard ubisoft tried they couldn t make maverick balanced all the other operators who could destroy reinforced walls were loud and easily noticeable but maverick could silently create small holes through which he could kill opponents with ease clash introduced many new glitches and bugs and is disabled almost every season because her shield allows for players to make various exploits and ubisoft have done nothing to prevent this they just try to fix it after the damage has already been done season 4 brought the map palace which is much easier to defend than to attack and is simply too large for a game that focuses on close quarters combat in year 4 ubisoft decided that it would be a good idea to recycle weapons this was just one in a line of decisions that demonstrate laziness in the second season of year 4 ubisoft reworked the map kafe was this map a bit unbalanced yes did it need a rework no the problems of kafe could have been solved with a map buff like the one on consulate the rework of the map theme park that was horribly unbalanced arrived at the very end of year 4 2 step verification to prevent cheating was added 3 years after the game s initial release another proof of laziness is that bug fixes arrive only once or twice per season and balancing changes only arrive with a new season and now at the beginning of year 5 ubisoft have announced that starting from year 5 season 3 they will only be adding 1 new operator per season during year 5 there will be no new maps only reworks of old maps a rework of the map oregon has already been released a map that didn t need a rework yet we are only now getting a rework of the map house which the community has been asking for ever since ubisoft started reworking maps however the matchmaking is still bad and will have you play against people who have 4 times the skill you do ubisoft need to set their priorities straight i ve played this game for 399 hours the best feeling this game gave me was when i uninstalled it this game is not rainbow six this is a game with issues and developers who are unwilling to address these issues it s not worth your time it s not worth your money,416.4,32.0,4,Not Recommended,"April 23, 2020",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"Cigla

56459,2021 used to be better but now it s rife with obvious sjw influenced operators and even more absurd gadgets it slowly moved from a swat aesthetic game focused on realism into a colourful overwatch style pro league focused game where trendy unrealistic operators are put in every new release the overall shift wasn t so bad in year 2 or 3 but it s just become more and more tiresome competitive play is now limited to only bomb because the devs are lazy and inept at balancing maps having other game modes in comp wasn t a problem for years current devs are just worse at reasonably balancing maps compared to old devs especially with all the messy operator gadget bloat they have shoved in the game it was more fun and there was increased variety when comp had more game modes completely removing them was a lazy cop out that has lessened the experience this is what happens when devs only care and pander to pro league while ignoring most of their playerbase the overall experience has gotten worse it s just not the same game anymore,429.4,19.0,3,Not Recommended,"January 30, 2021",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,Janissary Jake,False
56497,2020 i have 615 hours at the time of writing this review siege has been out for five years now and i just played it for around 7 months straight i have a lot of memories of the first four or five months really enjoying the game learning the game was awesome and i never really got too aggravated but the more you play the more you realize how bad the game becomes it all starts after you unlock all the operators congratulations nothing is new anymore that s okay you can focus on mastering a few then you start to get good you climb ranks get out of bronze or silver and start playing against some decent players here things start to fall downhill you ll frag and do good a lot of games but then you reach a hard sweat point around platinum whether it s ranked or silent mmr you reach a point at which you have to dedicate every moment of your day to playing this game to be decent at it in comparison to the people you play against don t do that this game becomes incapable of being casual at that point the development team is too slow to introduce enough new content to continue making the game feel new fresh and fun the game in it s current state needs to be reworked so far it needs a new engine new mechanics and complete new revision in it s current state this game cannot be a ten year game like the developers want it to here is my advice play this game if you want a game to play for around 350 hours max while having fun play with friends the competitive scene here will die soon as players become increasingly disappointed with the quality of the game additionally cheating is a huge problem ubisoft overlooks my advice to the studio rework the damn game put some effort in if you actually want a ten year game the game has so much potential to be fun and ambitious and if the studio wants to start investing and dedicating to the game enough to take advantage of the potential this could easily become truly one of the greatest games in history until then a lot needs to change i really hope it does because i love this game,936.0,17.0,3,Not Recommended,"August 13, 2020",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,"dfragger13

57034,2016 lets start with the pro s of r6 s unique gameplay with a plethora of descructible surfaces unique operators with unique gadgets constantly shifting meta more or less decent variety of weaponry and operator nationalities proper level design besides for two spawn kill spots which are easy fixes and a growing playerbase now to the cons which i believe greatly outweigh the pro s no i m not making my claims out of rage and salt i ve gathered roughly 700 hours between both of my uplay accounts on this game i ve come to notice and condemn each and every problem to my knowledge 1 valk glitch with her camera still not patched seriously ubisoft 2 the absolutely horrific hitregistration don t discredit your community ubisoft 99 of us aren t idiots we know the clear difference between headshots and neckshots evidently you don t know basic human enatomy expanding on hitreg it s terrible it was initially terrible from release they started fixing it but it just took another plummit after skull rain whether it be body shots head shots shields through walls ect the hit registration fails a large portion of the time if you don t get consecutive headshots you may not be one to notice it but for those of us that do i m sure it s a huge problem for you us the fact that a ranked match can be decided by my headshot not registering is aboslutely cancerous and has infact happened 3 the massively large amounts of connectivity issues throughout the community i know not everyone will have the greatest internet connectivity and so on and i can say they have slightly improved their connectivity issues however it s still abissmal you can still get stupidly long wait times you can still randomly be removed from a match for xxx error not only that joining parties with people is a huge hassle especially if its a friend over in the uk or elsewhere i m glad they re taking steps to improve their connectivity but the game has almost been out for a year and connectivity a large portion of the game if you can t connect you can t play period 4 now i don t exactly know what to call it but we all will know what i m talking about you blow a wall to run outside and you rubber band back in heres another fantastic example i was streaming a few days back from this post date on plane i opened the door right outside of the bottom of cockpit staircase to peek a blackbeard sitting to the right low and behold i go out to peek and cannot go back in i keep getting rubber banded out i was essentially a uselss sitting duck for the rest of the game and this is not an isolated incident for me or anyone i play with this is a huge problem not being able to move through an area you breached a huge problem it could be the difference between winning and losing a match 5 for this next number i m just going to generalize the rest of the random bugs and issues that have been popping up on certain areas of certain maps shooting a drone will destroy every mute jammer on the map and give the person who shot the drone minus however many points for however many jammers were down on certain areas of certain maps shooting meleeing or breaking an object connected to the floor will destroy any and all ads systems which were attached to said floor at the same instance blitz s hitbox is still utterly broken they managed to somehow break grenade timers with the latest patch blowing up anywhere from instantly to the ususal 6 seconds later however ive heard this was patched already i cannot confirm it myself with every patch ubisoft makes they break something else instead of focusing souly on the problems they continue to push and push for skins and new operators and maps this is not okay this game used to be my go to game to play but as of skull rain i can hardly enjoy this game for its current state its more frustrating than not and i find myself treating it like the proper joke it is do i think this game could be much better yes do i strictly hate r6 s absolutely not i still hold this game close to my heart if these problems were fleshed out i d very much change my review and it d be an entirely different story if there wasn t a large abundance of problems with every patch or they broke a new thing with every patch i personally would not recommend paying the full 50 for this game until the biggest problems are fleshed out no game will be perfect i m 100 aware of that but siege is very very far below the acceptable threshold in my 700 hour opinion update red crow patch did not fix any of the important issues as promised,712.0,35.0,2,Not Recommended,"October 17, 2016",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege,T h e  S e c o n d F r a n c o,False
