58557,2020 while i generally love this game i have a few warnings to those who are interested in buying it the community can be toxic as hell there s three basic types of toxicity new players who are uninformed not your fault who do things the community considers bad manners experienced perfectionists people who enjoy other s suffering higher learning curve than some expect learning survivor and killer perks is important regardless of what you main common tactics to avoid getting downed or looped prioritization situational awareness where is everyone what are they doing what should you be doing community slang matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired inexperienced paired with experienced but in a one gets dunked on arrangement not teaching sometimes often seems to be under the influence when making lobbies wait times however there s some pretty nifty things dlc characters can be unlocked through gameplay it takes 9000 iridescent shards which are gained through leveling one s account up the shrine of secrets changes every week and potentially has perks from dlc characters available folks who can t afford dlc can still get the characters perks friends not required but make experience better no in game voice chat for survivors some use discord instead in game emotes used to communicate as well as crouching relatively easy to find new friends if you re nice most people who play survivor want full swf crews replayable wide variety of maps characters perks opportunity for a wide variety of play styles private or public matches for whatever your purpose including goofing off lots of shenanigans get waterboarded by puke throw a flashlight rave thiccness knows no morals or gender overall i d recommend probably about a 8 5 10 have not pooped my pants due to this game but have come close a time or two thanks ghost face update may 28 2021 new content is still being released more mechanics are being added to the game which changes how survivors play ex zombies being added in the r e chapter in player test build at the time of this update some cosmetics can be purchased with shards unlocked through game play or redeemed via codes released by bhvr periodic events currently there s an event to find gnome chompski once the exit gates are powered map and graphical updates the game generally looks a lot better now multiple variants of maps maps tend to be smaller now which can be both good and bad gens feel closer together but that also applies to hooks the rift a battle pass has been added to the game auric cells paid currency are part of the reward system if you complete the rift you actually get your money back players are rewarded with cosmetics lore the archives and various forms of in game currency challenges from the rift add an extra layer of fun or psychological distress and anguish to matches matchmaking again queue times are substantially faster for survivors in the morning than in the afternoon evening i m a filthy survivor main heathen so i can only assume that means killer queue times are better in the afternoon evening still occasionally end up in lobbies that are very unbalanced or entirely unfair but it s better than it used to be there s a lot more player consistency in terms of skill but also toxicity in higher ranks if you want to meme and enjoy the higher ranks tend to be very serious hit boxes make me cry this is just a game please self it s just a game sobbing intensifies in all seriousness though the hit boxes need some improvement lag frame perfect timing and other aspects all influence whether the hatchet hits your face or clips through your face i may be a survivor main but if a huntress nails me across the map i m impressed with the shot and outraged on the killer s behalf if it doesn t register what accessibility options changing the struggle phase on hook to a series of skill checks was a huge improvement in terms of accessibility for wider audiences an option to suppress screen flashing effects or toggle an alternate view for them would be helpful a fade in solid color then fade out screen aura might be a good option for this it would preserve visual information without giving an unfair advantage to players for the record players with disabilities just wanna grind for bloodpoints and cry like everyone else if your primary concern is giving players an unfair advantage please remember that accessibility options compensate for a set back so that people with disabilities have an even playing field i d say that the changes boost my rating to a 9 10 but the hit box issues can definitely make this game feel like a 2 10 to bhvr if they ever stumble their way into this review the new content is great but please look into hit registration and hit boxes accessibility options for a wide range of players would also be highly appreciated and it would increase audience reach and profitability keep up the good work update april 21 2022 some mentions boon totems were added aoe survivor buffs experimental wiggle mechanic skill checks instead of button mashing hit boxes are still whack the game is playable if you re in it for memeingful not meaningful gameplay most of my points from previous updates still stand cross play was added can be disabled matchmaking is now skill based leaving ranks obsolete there s still grades based on pips but these have no influence on a person s actual mmr content it doesn t feel like in game content has changed substantially new killers and survivors have been added but i rarely see them or their perks after a couple of weeks pass cosmetics are nice but ultimately they re just something to collect the stranger things chapter is gone i m out of characters so no more updates unless something drastic happens and i delete old points overall 7 10 fun but flawed,782.3,993.0,127,Recommended,"25 June, 2020",Dead by Daylight,Vivian Whittock,False

58604,2017 absolutely love the game but ofcourse there are flaws not gonna say its the community or op killers but a major glitch in the system the whole reason i decided to write this review is to warn new players of a game ruining glitch and how to fix it today my data 58 hours of gameplay was completely reset while playing i got a connection error then a message saying the season has ended when i went to check out my characters they were all level one now to save yourself from this utterly horrible and game ruining experience which i know will lead to you leaving a pretty bad review of the game here s a fix step 1 go to the location of your steam data then your dead by daylight save which in my case is os c program files x86 steam userdata 129389900 381210 remote profilesaves step 2 copy the file located within profilesaves to a safe location i leave it directly on my desktop optional step 3 make a shortcut to your profilesaves folder and place on desktop for easy access step 4 update your save copy save and replace everytime you close the game if you dont do this you could lose hours of progress like i did today i lost about 4 hours of progress good luck to you noobies and have fun because this game is amazing,363.8,261.0,13,Recommended,"October 11, 2017",Dead by Daylight,cat9412,False

58609,2020 dead by daylight is a very fun and sometimes toxic as hell 1 killer vs 4 survivor survival horror game with unique and interesting mechanics each killer has their own unique power and playstyle to it and each survivors and killer will have teachable perks that can be unlocked in their own individual progression bloodweb to teach the perks to other characters you own to let the players to be able to create their own build and perk combos game objective survivors the goal of the game for the survivors is to repair generators around the map to open the exit gates and escape the trial survivors can bring items that are beneficial to their survival like flashlight to blind the killer momentarily med kit to heal yourself other survivors and using the environment to escape from the killer s chase by dropping pallets to stun the killer and looping the killer to waste time so that other survivors can help complete other objectives in the meantime killer the killer will need to use their own power and scratch marks blood trails left by survivors to track and down the survivors and hooking them to sacrifice them to the entity and ultimately preventing the survivors from escaping the trials a hooked survivor will not be able to escape unless saved by a teammate or successfully unhooking themselves from the hook with a 4 chance or by using other perks pre conclusion mini rant sometimes some players are going to be pretty toxic when playing dbd there are some players who uses map exploits teaming up with the killer sandbagging bm ing or insulting others in the post game chat and as a newbie killer when matched against good survivors will be very frustrating as u will feel helpless against some god loops and tiles that u simply cant counter while you slowly see ur gens being rushed by other survivors and just feel like you cant do anything but theres no other way other than to git gud develop better mentality and gamesense to counter the gap between no matter how much ranting i did i still love and enjoy playing dbd 3conclusion dead by daylight is a very good game to play with friends or by urself and if u enjoy this type of survival horror game or being indecisive on whether or not you should get it i d say give it a try and make that decisive strike 8 10 recommended 2022 january edit i can t recommend this game anymore until bhvr put the effort in to fix dbd 6 year flaws 2022 december edit i hate this game yet i still play it demmit,394.5,221.0,20,Recommended,"June 13, 2020",Dead by Daylight,"Krnlgc

58624,2019 when you look at this game for the first time you may just see this as some odd looking asymmetrical horror game and wonder how deluded you d have to be to sink thousands of hours into this game like a surprising amount of people haveand even after you play your first few matches and get focused down or tunneled by some weird man setting bear traps everywhere that you seem to get caught in even though you triple checked only 5 seconds ago and you swore to yourself that there wasn t one there you just cant understand what it is about this game that draws such a community to its namebut then you notice all of those shiny red things you seem to be accumulating through your many fruitless deaths and so you decide to open up the bloodweb and you start to turn those useless shiny red things into items and perks that you use to better yourself and your odds of survival until you make that first sweet escapeall of a sudden you start to really see the way the progression works in this game you see it for what it is a long and hard grind but you think about how sweet that first escape was and how you could start levelling up many of your characters to make the ultimate build a build so powerful that the trap setting fool will regret ever coming near you you finally reach the summit you ve spent millions upon millions of those oh so craved bloodpoints you ve learnt the teachables and you ve made your builds and suddenly you realise just why so many people have dedicated such seemingly insane amounts of hours into this little asymmetrical horror gamei m currently on this journey myself with 174 hours i ve unlocked a decent amount of stuff for my killers and my survivors but i m still a long way off thoroughly completing everything there is to do in this game but as someone who is quickly finding new games and dropping old ones and not committing too much to anything this is one of the rare games i can see myself breaking the thousand hour milestone in the gameplay itself is fun with both roles offering a very unique experience with survivors relying on each other to complete their objectives which can also be played with up to 3 friends whereas the killer role is for the lone player who only wants to rely on their own skills to achieve victory killer is by far the more stressful role of the two despite what you may think and is typically more rewarding in terms of bloodpoints however both sides have their pros and cons and its really up to you whether you d prefer to play one role more than the other or whether you d rather just play them both depending on your mood or availability of friends or some other reason and if you re still not convinced that this game may be for you but you re still curious there are a plethora of youtubers and twitch streamers making content about this game all the time so you can always take a look for yourself and see if you think you d like itif you somehow managed to get to the end of this review i never write reviews and now you can probably see why p then thanks and i hope i ve managed to sway you one way or the other about buying this game if you do decide to take the leap into dbd then i hope you enjoy it,470.7,145.0,11,Recommended,"October 25, 2019",Dead by Daylight,"Jackd44

58629,2021 ok i think i ve enough play hours in this game to finally put down a review i ve played both sides killer survivor at high level and from i can tell its a great game given the fact the game style is asymmetric this game is very survivor sided only if the survivors are plying in a groups and with comms note for new players we call them swf survivor with friends as they can constantly exchange information about the killer s activity and turn the game pretty one sided but there are some killers in the game that can completely ignore the swf variable to a certain degree the killer roster is pretty versatile but the option is very limited after you reach high elo as only fewer killers are viable in high ranks these are the only viable killers in high level against good swfs spirit nurse pyramid head blight hag doctor freddy twins sometimes bubba and pig rest of the roster are pretty useless unless you have like 2k hours on killers so that can basically end every chase within 15 20 seconds and slug when needed note even the top killers i mentioned takes a lot of time to learn especially nurse even spirit is no joke to learn a lot of game senses and predictions are required to play spirit efficiently as well i don t like how every time the devs buffs a killer they also nerfs the killer in some other way as well there are a lots of perks in the game that are basically useless and a little buff could change them into playable perks hit boxes are terrible in this game when i play nurse huntress the community is mostly toxic and unwelcoming towards new players especially new killers my first trapper game i got bullied with ds s head on flashlights unnecessarily and endless t bags at the exit gates having no clue half the game what s going on and on top of that abusive texts and endless insults in post game chat this is very discouraging towards new players if this goes on people will stop playing killer and abuse the very killer when they play survivor next time this not only creates a bad cycle but also heavily impacts the match making as fewer people are interested in playing the killer still there are many nice people in this community that appreciate the other sides when they play and i hope more people could have that mindset to make the community better,754.5,227.0,11,Recommended,"May 10, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"MagnumSpydyrIN

58682,2016 is it perfect no is it fun bloody hell yes this game isn t going to be for everyone odds are you are going to be helpless as a suvivor that s the point survivors are suppose to be helpless against a killer as a suvivor you don t play to win games you play to survive them and as a killer you play to do one thing and only one thing kill if you don t like being helpless against an unstopable killer if he finds you then odds are you aren t going to like dead by daylight but if you are smart then either the survivors or killer can turn the odds in their favor to make fools out of the other pros playing as a slasher flick killer 3 of them with more in the works being a victim of a slasher flick escape death with skill maybe just dumb luck or die in soiled pants 4v1 gameplay that goes extra lengths to make each side stand apart from the other great use of sounds for information rng tile based maps 1 2 landmarks per map will aways be in the same places but everything else will change every game games last 10 minutes on average cons some model bugs like rarely seeing your own hair eyes as a killer or some janky movement with killers interacting with suvivors balance one killer is weaker than the other 2 windows close together can make near 100 safe zones for survivors depending on a few things some perks are rather annoying maybe a touch op games have no timers if someone wants to waste your time they can if they are good enough no communication it is impossible to talk to each other without 3rd party chats like steam teamspeak skype ect making a lobby as a killer can take up to 10 minutes to fill not from player counts mind you either another bug or a waiting list with strict first come first filled rules in short for 20 you are going to get one hell of a fun game just note that it might not be for everyone as not everyone can handle playing as victims who are by design made to be helpless more often than not,570.6,377.0,30,Recommended,"June 18, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"Chewy102

one of the 5 players takes the role of the bloodthirsty killer and the rest of the players do take the role of the survivors trying to fix engines in order to unlock the exit gate the game was developed and published by behaviour interactive release date 14th june 2016last known update 1st december 2020 small talk is the game even balanced smalltalknow many people do have questions about balance in asymmetrical games games like friday 13th had the problem of the killer being too strong while the newly released resident evil resistance is a cakewalk for the survivors dead by daylight on the other hand actually managed to become a truly balanced game back in 2016 and 2017 it was clearly a survivor focused experience but with many updates they managed to create a very pleasant and truly balanced experience gameplay after almost reaching 400 hours in dead by daylight and reaching rank 1 as a survivor and reaching red ranks as a killer i decided to review this game survivor gameplay the main idea is pretty simple you as the survivor will work and complete 5 engines that are scattered throughout the map after completing these engines you will have to find one of the 2 exit gates and pull the gate trigger until they open it sounds simple but you do have to realize that a killer will give you problems while trying to complete the engines now you may ask what can the survivor do in order to fight against the killer you do have multiple available game tactics while using perks and items there is a build that does allow you to run a killer for a lot longer other builds allow you to hide and make the killer lose time searching for you and lastly you got builds that do allow you to help your teammates obviously there are a lot more builds but these are the most common ones items have multiple uses honestly toolboxes and their add ons do assists you at either breaking hooks are working faster on engines medkits do allow you to heal up pretty fast and the flashlight has multiple uses against killers or blinding killers you can even save a survivor friend from the killer s grasp the map obviously offers interactive areas for the survivors you do have pallets that you can throw on the killer if you do happen to succeed in hitting the killer with a pallet you will successfully stun him for a couple of seconds youtube video dead by daylight survivor gameplay views 52 steam review setup amd ryzen 7 3700x 4 5ghz coolermaster masterliquid ml240l rgb 32gb 3200mhz corsair vengeance pro rgb gigabyte aorus killer gameplay now the killers goal is pretty straight forward you will have to kill all of the survivors simple right well not really as a killer you should know when to chase and when not to chase there are certain areas in each map that are basically built to make the killer lose time one good example is the killer shack and is basically build for the strengths of the survivor usually you should avoid this building just like the survivors you do get the options to run a variety of builds one difference is the fact that some perks do work exclusively with totems these totems are usually lit which means that survivors usually tend to break them killers cannot use any items other than their unique abilities but they can use offerings and add ons just like the survivors in order to completely kill a survivor you will have to hook him 3 times lastly if you have killed 3 of the 4 survivors you can try to find the hatch which works basically as a secondary exit for the survivors if you find it first you can simply close it after that the 2 exit gates will be powered youtube video dead by daylight killer gameplay views 53 steam review setup amd ryzen 7 3700x 4 5ghz coolermaster masterliquid ml240l rgb 32gb 3200mhz corsair vengeance pro rgb gigabyte aorus other aspects a mori is a very powerful offering that allows the killer to kill a survivor after his second hook the game offers custom modes as well basically playing with friends dead by daylight offers daily challenges as well as weekly ones the weekly ones usually tend to give insight and a small story for each character doesn t matter if it s a killer of a survivor story the survivors are pulled into the entity s constructed world when they wander too close to the places the killers were taken from disappearing from the real world without a trace they end up at a lonely campfire where they rest between trials until a killer pursues them again this basically is an endless cycle each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the entity of areas from where the killers were taken the survivors only hope of escape is to complete a series of generators scattered throughout each realm to power up large gates to escape if the killer has killed all but one survivor the entity will offer the latter a final means of escape in the form of a hatch escaping from the grounds always takes the survivors back to the campfire and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal for the entity s favor since the entity feeds off the hope of the survivors to escape it helps them just as much as the killers acting as an impartial observer of the hunt stepping in only to claim those hung on its hooks the entity is the essence of evil basically graphics audio the game makes use of unreal engine 4 which gives this game a unique and creepy look obviously not the best looking game but it does look decent enough graphics every killer has a unique kill animation after using a mori this is a licensed killer and the detail is truly magnificent a screenshot of dead by daylight by sermike audio soundtrack the audio is pretty basic yet extremely effective every time you re being chased by the killer the chase music starts playing basically adding the sense of danger to the game the more distance you build the more the chase music lessens in volume until there is no chase anymore the survivors do make grunting sounds while being injured and so do the killers after being hit with a pallet some killers do have licensed music as well and it truly is a very good addition the game is truly awesome when it comes to the audio part performance sadly the performance is terrible when it comes to some older devices or even mid range devices which is crazy when you consider that this game doesn t even look that amazing in game amd ryzen 5 3700x 4 5ghz 32gb ram 3200 mhz nvidia rtx 2070 super 8gb 500gb nvme western digital i was running the game on maxed out settings in 1080p with120fps some people with gtx

plethora of game breaking bugs and many many glitches luckily with the most recent updates the game has become a lot more stable even with low end devices conclusion dbd currently is the best asymmetrical multiplayer game available the depth of the mechanics and skill set is just amazing as well as the community sadly bad performance and bugs make this game a hit or miss for some people

58701,if you re overly competitive get genuinely angry or upset when you lose i don t recommend dbd it doesn t know whether or not it wants to be a casual or ranked competitive game and you will want to do questionable things when you inevitably die or not get a single kill it will happen and there s nothing you can do to change that the game has its faults but ultimately i enjoy it don t take it too seriously on either killer or survivor side i d say get it on sale if you can as 30 for something you re not 100 sure you ll enjoy might be a dealbreaker for some the main gripe i have with the game isn t the game itself it s the community i don t think i ve ever witnessed a playerbase hate literally everything killer mains hate survivors survivor mains hate killers both hate the devs nothing is ever balanced perfectly and positive changes are too little too late to matter apparently if you re easily swayed and tend to mirror the emotions of the spaces you re in consider not doing that or at least not engaging with those kinds of people and you will have a much better time lose is in quotes because there isn t a real win or loss condition just things that are encouraged by the game eg you a survivor dying is technically a loss but if you help the rest of your team out and all 3 of them escape that s a win to me and a good source of bloodpoints,814.7,122.0,1,Recommended,March 11,Dead by Daylight,"rainy

58713,2017 sigh this is the hardest review i ve had to write this game is interesting compelling and original the game mechanic is great the core game mechanic actually changes from movement to stealth in a way i ve never experienced even in metal gear games its exhillerating being chased and killed as the survivors and its fun to run around killing as the killer unfortunately the game is riddled with bugs this current update 2 13 2017 made the game unplayable and that s not me about minor changes in game play mechanics its literally broken and won t launch i ve held off my review in hopes that the developers would patch the game so i can rave about it up and down welp the cows have come to pasture and i feel that after playing 120 hours of the game posting on steam forums about bugs participating in test servers and emailing devs all to have a patch that renders the application completely useless i think i ve earned the right to about it hell i m a paying consumer so why not yesterday i played this game almost all day and night long in that day after hearing about the new patch i logged every game i was able to get into and play as well as every game that crashed due to errors my logs for yesterday are as follows 68 attempted games played51 games that did not load crashed errored out etc 17 games succesfully laucned with no errors and were playedthat means the application worked correctly only 25 of the time all i can say is to stay away from this game its not working anymore and even on its best days it only worked 1 out of 4 times if you happened to purchase this game and enjoyed it as much as i did when it decides to work put pressure on those devs thier game as fun as it may be is a defective product it needs to be fixed or we need to be reimbursed you pay thier salary not behavior not starbreeze you ps devs i will personally remove this post and give it an incredibly positive and equally lengthy review once the game starts working as it should it is not my intention to keep people from buying your games it is only to keep people from buying broken games pps devs after fixing this game how likely would it be to see another crossover monster survivor combo i really wanna see a ripley xenomorph or james sunderland pyrimid head update just play konami for the license you its dirt cheap right now,154.2,560.0,20,Not Recommended,"February 13, 2017",Dead by Daylight,BackStabberAssGrabber,False

58717,2016 product received for free note this game was gifted to me by someone affiliated with the developers what s even more fun than chopping people up with your homemade machete while they re stuck in your bear traps well chasing down your friends with a chainsaw while you re on teamspeak with them and screaming come here little piggy this game is heavily based on the old slasher movies there is one killer and four stupid teenage survivors the survivors goal is to fix all generators open one of the two exits or hidden trapdoor if you re last alive and escape the killer s goal is surprise killing all of these stupid kids and hanging them on hooks to offer them to his lord and savior satan aka the entity the kids can t defend themselves against the 7 foot tall maniac but they can use the environment to their advantage you can hide in lockers outlast throw piles of wood behind you to block the killer s path or stun him when he s right next to it when you throw it down and you can use the mist in combination with rocks trees etc to your advantage to hide behind aswell the only thing that s missing is a black guy because they are always supposed to die first in slasher flicks but oh well future dlc there is five different items that you can unlock as a survivor and these will help you win they are the med kit toolbox map flashlight and skeleton key the med kit lets you heal people faster while the toolbox makes you fix generators quicker or can let you destroy hooks to ruin the killer s day the flashlight can be used as a flashbang towards the killer by shining into his eyes for 1 or 2 seconds he will be temporarily blinded and anyone who he might be carrying on his shoulder will be dropped and then there s the map in my opinion the most useless item in the game because it shows you what generators have been previously used by highlighting them through the walls for a short amount of time if you have add ons for it i ll get to those in a bit then you could also see the killer s aura aswell as the exit locations and then finally there is the mysterious skeleton key not much is known about this yet i ve played for about 40 hours at the moment of writing but i haven t gotten one of these yet i have got add ons for it however apparently the skeleton key lets you unlock the hidden trapdoor on the map after only 2 generators have been fixed already while normally it will only open when you re last alive and then you and all your friends can just jump through it for an insta win don t take my word for that though besides items there is a lot more to leveling and progression all four survivors and all three killers have their own progression tree which can further developed with bloodpoint which are gained from finishing public games every survivor and every killer has his her own unique perks and progression tree you can keep progressing until you re level 50 and then you can go prestige which will reset you back to level 1 and gives you a random bloodied cosmetic item for that character all your perks and items get taken but you ll keep your 4 perk slots besides the leveling system there is also a ranking system for public games you start at rank 20 and you can work yourself up all the way to rank 1 survivors and killers each have their own online rank but unlike the levels which are tied to each different character your rank is only tied to a category either survivors or killers if you get enough points you will receive a crystal or even two if you manage to get the max amount of points as soon as you collect 3 of these crystals you will rank up at some point you ll need more than 3 and this amount keeps increasing the higher you get if you don t get enough points in a match you will lose a crystal and when you re back to 0 crystals you ll lose your rank again right now there s not really a purpose for these ranks besides showing others how brave and pro you are you don t get matched with the same ranks and there s no unlocks or whatsoever besides a colored number showing above your head also you cannot earn bloodpoints or rank up in private games all of this requires you to play with random people we already talked about items but there s a lot more to your loadout so let s talk some more about add ons perks and offerings shall we there is add ons which are additional smaller items which you can attach to your main item to make it better such as adding more charges to your med kit or being able to use the flashlight for a longer duration of time then there s offerings offerings can only be used once at the start of the match to get a one time advantage over the killer such as all four survivors starting together or receiving 50 more bloodpoints for the duration of that game and finally there s perks each character has its own unique perks that help them in the game linked to their personality and profession dwight is the leader and so if you stay close to him you will repair the generators quicker meg is the silent cat girl who is quicker and more silent than the others claudette is the botany trained healer who is better at healing others and jack is the traps expert who can easily take care of and destroy traps quickly now that we ve talked about the survivors let s talk about the killers there is three different killers each with their own unique weapon and skill the trapper can place down bear traps around the map that you can get stuck in and make you an easy pray for him the wraith can go nearly invisible as he pleases and suddenly pop up behind you to scare you like crazy and the hillbilly has a chainsaw that he can rev up to go into a crazed murdering state and come chasing after you while he holds his chainsaw above his head oh yeah and that also instantly downs you if it hits you i wonder what killer is going to be added next i can t wait to chase people with a big crazed evil clown with a sledgehammer also real slashers like jason voorhees or michael meyers might be cool to see in their respective areas but i m not sure if they can get the rights for that it also seems as if there has been made an area for each different killer there are 3 different areas each with 4 different maps there is the car junkyard linked to the trapper the abandoned coal factory with a broken bell tower linked to the wraith and the old farm full of the fantastic cornfields and more linked to the hillbilly all with all it s a really fun game both to play with strangers aswell as to play with friends which i recommend the most there is currently still some missing features however like being able to play with your friends in public games or some kind of chat for public games but it s a really unique game with a lot of potential the developers are promising a new update atleast once every week so can t wait to see what s in store for us i love unique games and i love horror movies so this game is just perfect for me it s both fun to play as a survivor aswell as the killer things that can be improved or should be added you cannot play in a public game with your friends and there s no bloodpoints to be earned in private games there is not a single kind of chat mechanic no text chat voice chat or even quick chat so you can t tell your fellow survivors that they can take you off the hook cause the killer is not camping you talking about that hookcamping really ruins the fun several bugs that break the game such as being stuck on the killer s shoulders until one of you leaves more rewards for the ranking system aswell as balancing it so that you can rank up more easily preventions for leaving the game early and you losing crystals for that a larger variety of maps abandoned carnival huge manor a village or snow mountains sound like cool ideas voice acting for the killers,253.0,324.0,61,Recommended,"June 29, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"Mr. Payday

58737,2021 the game is no longer ours it belongs to the community pushes update upon people that over 80 of the player base did not want ask for and actively spoke out against otzdarva and truetalent have serious debates about the state of the game and what would be the healthiest way for the game to go but behavior goes out of their way to belittle this by saying this is just a party game but then has competitive game modes and ranking systems in the game they have a microtransaction system that you d realistically only find in f2p games meaning you d be buying most of the cosmetics and buying individual characters and stuff but then want you to pay full price for the game and buy each and every little dlc invidually when doing so would net you well over 120 just noting it s over double the price of a normal aaa game just to unlock the full game to play and you wouldn t even get any cosmetics to show for it they have perk bloat issues 90 of the perks and in game things you can get are useless you also are not fully in control of the perks and stuff that you unlock for characters the bloodweb system is extremely dated and needs to be replaced with something that lets you pick and choose the perks you want and to upgrade and unlock those at your own leisure but devs don t care and just want to keep pushing out skins cosmetics microstransaction fodder if you re survivor you have to use certain perks and play styles in order to counter a meta that the killers are basically forced into or they ll lose playing for fun does not exist in public matches everyone is toxic you will be yelled at and told that you re a waste of space among other such things the devs do not care about this also they have awful anti cheat people get around it all the time in any given match you could easily be playing with a hacker who s keeping his hacks on the down low so that he doesn t get reported because reports is the only way that they catch hackers but they will straight up ban you if people decide to get all of their friends to report you for not playing how they like their bans are also non negotiable they do not undo them it s also more money for them if you have to rebuy their game and dlc and start over that s the reason for them having a strict system on it then don t even get me started with their bugs and glitches the game is literally held together by chewing gum and paper clips it feels like the idea of dead by daylight is a good one on paper it s just cursed with a company like behavior running it any other company could likely take this game and turn it into a gem tldr the game is plagued with toxicity has massive balance issues massive glitches the developers have fully shown that they don t care what the community thinks anymore and i can t recommend this game in its current state,636.6,847.0,35,Not Recommended,"March 9, 2021",Dead by Daylight,Archenemis,False

58777,2017 dead by daylight is a fun concept and starts out entertaining enough but the many bugs balancing issues toxic community and a seemingly oblivious incompetent development team keep me from recommending it to any new players the game s concept is fun enough play as one of four young adults desperately trying to repair five generators to open the gates and escape from a murderous stalker taken from slasher film tropes or play as the killer and hunt those kids foolish enough to stumble across your lair as you gain experience you can buy perks and gain access to items to help you escape or kill when you start the game it s a fun heady experience unfortunately like a piece of fruit striped gum the initial rush is quickly gone technical bugs abound from minor glitches like non working scoreboards and graphical glitches to moderate issues like broken perks to major issues like all of your game progress being eliminated the devs recommend you make your own manual save copies or infinite loading screens where the game locks up of course sometimes it just takes 2 5 minutes to load so you can waste a bit of time on nothing before determining if you re bugged or not even if you weren t bugged a team mate may be and they drop out leaving you down survivors before the game even starts other issues exist in development choices the matchmaking is simply terrible and often sticks your rank 20 newbie with rank 1 5 opponents leaving you hopelessly outclassed region matching is also terrible where the game can t find matches for you i am better off seeking a game in ontario rather than my home region of chicago because the game will just hang then there are numerous balances issues and exploits that go unresolved frustratingly through this the developers appear to be more interested in pushing out paid dlc than fixing bugs and for the different teams excuse camp if you have critical bugs but lots of dlc makers then it s time to allocate your hiring resources differently they also rely heavily on streamers to promote the game and shower their favorite people with gifts to get good press rather than taking care of their product as recent reviews show famously one developer recently said on twitter that exploiting streamers would not be punished because they rely on them for promotion when they do try to fix balance issues they frequently overshoot there s more survivors than killers so fixes tend to be heavy nerfs to killer perks or buffs to survivor abilities in order to quiet the loudest voices the game does have promise and is initially rewarding before all the other issues wear away at it if you can play with friends it helps a lot just because most things are more fun with friends but i couldn t in good conscience tell anyone to spend 15 20 on the game plus another 20 in dlc in its current state right now i m not sure if it ll ever get there,180.9,301.0,9,Not Recommended,"January 2, 2017",Dead by Daylight,"Syntax Error

58798,2016 play as survivor sneaky black woman get meat hooked killer stands directly in front of me slashing my limp noodle body over and over see two teammates sneaking nearby waiting for opporunity to save me they don t get the chance killer doesn t move from that spot until entity takes me see him do the same to two more survivors camping you guys are just bad play as killer spooky nurse hook survivor immediately leave to go check out some generators elsewhere check back on dirty hookered body every now and then wow camping how does it feel to be pure cancer i m salty the survivors are salty but i understand now salt tastes good this game is hella fun and succesful jukes can be pretty satisfying especially when you get those heat of the moment scenarios and the monster just completely loses you and runs off in the opposite direction while you cheekily crouch in the middle of a cornfield or those satisfying times when you see a sneaky survivor in the distance crouching behind a rock or climbing into a locker thinking they re safe only for you to round the corner and deliver the final blow before they even know what s happened though there are some bugs i ve encountered there s the basic falling through the ground bug but that happens in a lot of games and it s only happened to me once in dbd when i was playing as the trapper it didn t blink me back to the map after falling for a certain amount of time either just got stuck there in skybox oblivion forever free win for those four lucky souls oh god don t do it if you play as the nurse for the love of god don t try to blink up the basement stairs survivors try to jump over barricades or hide in cabinets but getting caught by the monster and picked up during these animations sometimes causes the survivors to glitch out and get stuck in the air they even orbit parralel to and around the monster like they re attached to a certain point of him as he spins around everyone is confused and visually it s hilarious the monster can just drop them on the ground and pick them up again which fixes the issue but it really breaks your immersion when you see this happen still funny though playing as a survivor occasionally any kind of interaction with a monster can cause your game to crash which is a pretty terrible bug considering the rules of the game i sometimes notice people disconnect after they get picked up or hooked by a monster i thought they might just be rage quitting and i m sure there s plenty of that out there but after my own game has crashed at exactly these points right after a monster s finished their animation of picking me up or placing me on a hook my game just ctd s and i can t help but wonder if it happened to those people as well this is pretty rare i ve got just under 150 ish hours and it s only happened to me three times but it s still pretty concerning when it does adding to that last bug if you re playing as a killer on the off chance that a disconnected players character magically remains in the game absolutely do not try to interact with them i know it looks like an easy kill as they just stand there complacently but that empty body is now actually a deadly trap for killers don t pick them up and don t try to hook them you will get stuck and freeze anywhere between 10 20 seconds in my experience for reasons i still haven t yet deciphered you can try and slash them and leave them on the ground to bleed out but that s as far as i would go in that regard also this happened to me only once whilst playing as the trapper regardless of all this there is still a pretty solid game hidden underneath you ll be enjoying yourself or stressing out about being hunted down like an animal more than dealing with any bugs and whatnot equipment add ons and offerings are all consumable so use em as you get em or hoard them all like some sort of digital kleptomaniac like me because you can only use them once but perks are good you get to keep those for the most part you ll lose your perks and have to earn them again if you choose to prestige but if you decide not to then you keep them forever make a bee line for perks as soon as they show up on the bloodweb or you ll regret it the hefty buggery brings the score down quite a bit and if you re looking for a perfect experience then you will probably be disappointed in that case i d strongly recommend waiting for those bugs to be fixed before making a purchase however 98 of the time i m still having great fun so at the very least i ll give it a 5 10 or a 6 if we re being generous pretty good i still recommend it overall now get out,779.2,117.0,32,Recommended,"November 7, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"Grand

58822,2018 long review incoming edit i decided to edit my review after getting to know the game a bit more the original review was after 70 hours of playing and this one is after 300 hours the comments below reflect the original review dead by daylight is a 4vs1 online multiplayer game one player plays the killer and the other three or four players are the survivors the survivors win by working together to repair the generators and then opening the door without being killed the killer has to find the survivors and hook them all to please the entity pros the perks each survivor and each killer have unique perks perks are basically equippable abilities that help you in some way some examples are claudette who can heal herself and meg who can sprint away quickly customizing your survivor or killer adds variety to your character and lets you create your own play style items the item system adds more tension to the game you have to level up to get items but you lose the one you brought into the game if you die thus resulting in a risk if you bring a really great item into the trial if you are a killer you already have your main item and you can then attach addons there is a nice variety of items that all have different levels of quality atmosphere the atmosphere in this game is superb there are several different sounds that add heavy ambiance but also serve as audio cues for both survivor and killer i recommend quality headphones to really get immersed the horror the sounds the heartbeat the rush to the generators while constantly watching your back it s a survival horror game and it does a great job at making you feel like you are being stalked meanwhile if you are playing the killer you have a feeling you keep seeing a survivor in the corner of your eye teamwork other then working together on the generators your team can help you in other ways other survivors can unhook you heal you and use flashlights to try to save you from the killers grasp if you with the right people working together can be a lot of fun killers i know i ve mentioned this before but there is a nice variety of killers that all feel and function differently they each have a power that sets them apart along with the unique perks for example the wraith can turn invisible the hag can teleport to her traps and the trapper can lay out bear traps for survivors to get stuck in they have different speeds audio cues etc it s a lot of fun to try them all first person third person perspective the killer can t be killed but he does have a weakness his vision survivors see in a third person perspective meaning they can see all around them in a wider angle meanwhile the killer can only see in a first person view which gives him tunnel like vision this makes it easier for survivors to hide when they have nowhere to go i think this was a really neat idea that really balances out that part of the game and let s you show off your stealth abilities the killer is faster and deadlier but the survivor can better scope out their surroundings cons not newbie friendly originally when i wrote this there was no tutorial they just added a tutorial which is really great the game still leaves out a lot of very important things that they only tell you on the tip screens i honestly think games like this should have a log in the options menu where they store their tips also the community isn t always welcoming to newbies and they can make it very hard to learn when you have no idea what you are doing dlc microtransactions most of the non liscensed killers used to be dlc along with a whole bunch of item packs they finally added an in game store where you can buy the non liscensed killers for shards currency earned by playing although a great improvement they also added in some seriously expensive microtransactions i m talking five dollars for a shirt expensive right now it s just ouftits but it feels like it could lead to worse things bugs this game is not as buggy for me as the reviews say i think they patched most of it i do get some bugs here and there though i think the servers are the worst part i get kicked a lot and sometimes it doesn t let me join a game it s not enough to ruin the experience but it does take patience on its bad days community i think this is the worst thing about dead by daylight all pvp games have trolls but dbd has an especially toxic community after most matches i m surprised when i don t get insulted especially playing the killer because people hate to lose and they make sure to blame it on any term they can such as camping tunneling even if it s not true this usually happens when you go up in rank so if you play casually you won t have as many issues my friend suggested unranked lobbies and honestly that idea would fix a lot of issues with the game i highly recommend playing with friends since you can guarantee more fun i still play online with strangers and although it has it s share of trolls it still doesn t ruin my love for the game verdict if you are interested in the trailer or description then you should grab the game it s exactly what it advertised and it delivers on most positive aspects there are issues with bugs and a toxic community which is why i recommend you buy it on discount if you plan on playing it with friends instead of online it would probably be even more fun,839.6,97.0,8,Recommended,"June 4, 2018",Dead by Daylight,"stef

58829,2018 tl dr game is fun but has moments when you are most decidedly not having fun ratio of fun vs not fun varies depending on experience temperament of yourself and those around you level of intoxication and number of f cks given ok so you re a beginner looking to pick up this game as a survivor i ll tell you right now you re going to hate it at first there s no tutorial and it s kind of like a rogue lite in the sense that it s nearly impossible to accomplish anything when you first start out but even though you die over and over again you still earn bloodpoints that you can spend on items and perks to make yourself just a little bit stronger pretty soon you ll start actually escaping or at least earn enough points to not de rank you can watch all the youtube videos you want but to get better at dbd you re just going to have to play i have no idea what to expect at the higher tiers of gameplay or if i ll even get there at this point but so far i m firmly in a love hate relationship with this game,251.6,75.0,19,Recommended,"January 22, 2018",Dead by Daylight,Mittens,False
58830,2018 i want to start by advising you to take the recent negative review burst with a pinch of salt the game has been rebalanced a bit and a vocal minority of the community feel less powerful this has ruined the game for them i would say the changes are amazing and expand the viable options available which makes for a more varied and interesting game this is a great asymmetrical pvp i ve had a lot of fun both surviving and hunting it s been a really unique experience for me if you like being startled and fancy a solid horror challenge this game is great don t get me wrong it won t be for everyone sometimes you ll lose and there s nothing you can do about it sometimes as killer you ll be up against four survivors who wreck you and rub it in your face the whole game sonetimes as survivor you ll be hooked in minutes with no chance to escape along with the asymmetry this can create vocal cliques of whiny survivor or killer mains if you will be upset about not feeling powerful this may not be your game if you like the premise and can lose with a bit of maturity i d bet you ll love it,631.0,71.0,7,Recommended,"July 27, 2018",Dead by Daylight,Anonymous Bosch,False
58831,2018 in dead by daylght each game consists of 4 survivors and one killer survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening the two doors killers must chase after the survivors and sacrifice them survivors and killers are able to use perks objects in the environment add ons and offerings that help to give advantage within the game dead by daylight is also quite similar to deathgarden from the same developer it features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate kill runners with over 300 hours in the game so far i can honestly say it s one of my favorites lets start off by saying that this game isn t going to be for everyone if you re the type of person to get salty then chances are this game will make you extremely mad at some point yes any game can make someone rage but in dead by daylight the salt is real almost like league of legends maybe even more if you re a killer survivors will body block pallet loop pallet stun you flashlight blind you hold you hostage hiding and never leaving and ragequit if you re a survivor killers will lag switch face camp not moving from you while you are hooked slug or focus you most call it tunneling both sides have op perks that the other side thinks is unfair and if you main killer you ll have to face groups of friends that are all communicating in discord which puts you at a big disadvantage also i wouldnt say its neccessary but it is very recomended to have headphones whether you are the killer or a survivor you will want to hear those footstepds crows survivors breathing heartbeats etc sound will play an important role in how you play unfortunetly if you are here for a true horror game you might want to look somewhere else the initial scariness wears off pretty fast the jump scares are still there though especially with myers and amanda might not be heartstoppingly scary but if you like being startled and fancy a solid challenge this game is great 10 10 would pay full price for this game and buy all the dlcs again,923.1,58.0,3,Recommended,"December 26, 2018",Dead by Daylight,Cruxly,False

58842,2018 any longtime dead by daylight player knows that this isn t a horror game if you re looking for scares i wouldn t consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time it doesn t have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer that said and set aside i enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer s line of sight and giving them the slip it can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock there have been times where i have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it s one of the aspects that drew me to dead by daylight it s a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught on the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting as with any game i feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it s possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun i give dead by daylight an 8 10 and i ve enjoyed my many hours playing and so i will recommend,539.3,55.0,2,Recommended,"September 22, 2018",Dead by Daylight,Captain Corey,True
58843,2022 this is a pretty long review i m gonna split it into three sets of twos two positives two neutrals and two negatives that said i don t think i can start a review on this game without saying that i love it to death there is a lot of fun to be had but there are a million asterisks to that statement so many ups and downs things to consider and red flags to be cautious of but without further adieu here s my take with almost 700 hours in the game licenses so many licenses dead by daylight is the biggest asymmetrical game on the market point blank period it s earned that title from years of constant active support from its developing company behaviour interactive commonly shortened to bhvr and an incredible number of horror ips that have joined the game there is straight up no other place to go that has the sheer number of licenses this game does featuring horror classics from halloween s michael myers texas chainsaw massacre s leatherface and half a dozen others you even have access to characters from beloved franchises silent hill and resident evil hell the most recent killer is albert f wesker himself and in between licensed killers like those bhvr cooks up another killer of the own every other chapter too based on everything from clowns to shady doctors to entities that are the embodiment of evil and a ton more too but having this many characters becomes a problem which we ll discuss when we reach the complaints section of this comment extremely active devs and a constant flow of content bhvr is always listening to its community even if it feels like that communication is lost in translation sometimes there are updates to the game every couple of weeks usually including new cosmetics and community bonuses and every three months comes the big chapter update involving a new killer and survivor s to play as new perks it s basically just a large content drop these are almost always paid dlc but they re usually not terribly expensive although buying all of them sure as hell is and often times are worth it if you enjoy a particular franchise except for a few infamous examples a community dividedsurvivors and killers are designed not to get along but that runs far far deeper than gameplay in some cases you get amazing people in the community who are absolute shining beacons and role models most players are happy to mind their own business and don t get too serious unless someone is actively trying to ruin their fun but some people in this community are the absolute worst thing the lowest of the low the dredges ha of society who will do anything to make themselves feel better even and especially at the cost of others enjoyment and even sanity it s one of the most mixed communities i have ever seen and i ve been playing games online since online gaming was a thing gameplay oh god gameplay i only have three words to put gameplay in this game into a nutshell random number generation the actual skill you have in the game only matters when the rng decides it should matter there will literally be times where you will outright lose a match because the game effectively decided the outcome with what map you re playing on and what objects spawn in that map and this goes both ways on balanced maps that get decently fair rng this game is absolutely wonderful and it requires you to actually outplay the other side using your wits above all else on unbalanced maps with bad rng this game is completely unplayable the disparity between these two situations is so incredibly wide that playing the same killer on shelter woods vs on fractured cowshed may as well be you playing two completely different games it s easily the most frustrating part of the game when it goes bad but thankfully it s good enough not to be unplayable every game except on cowshed cowshed balance this was what everyone who s played the game for a few hours was waiting for this game s balance is abysmal in a lot of regards maps are easily the biggest problem with balance again the difference between the best and worst maps for either side is unbelievable but perks and items don t help either playing against a team of solo players who aren t running strong meta loadouts will never be as difficult as running against a team of 4 super sweaty survivors who are all talking to each other on discord bringing the strongest perks the strongest items an offering to send you to a map that favors their team and on top of all that they have 10x your hours when you combine them all together balance in dead by daylight is a complete and utter joke as many of the memes will evidence pls nerf pig cheaters blatant and subtle this is a known issue but dbd is rife with cheaters as of late people with stolen or illegal accounts and illegal copies of dead by daylight who have no morals or code outside of winning the game by any means necessary bhvr has been working on a solution but easy anti cheat has proven itself to be worthless garbage over the last few years killers teleporting around the map and acting instantly to kill survivors in seconds survivors teleporting around the map instantly completing generators and escaping in under 3 seconds cheaters on both sides holding the game hostage by ruining everything for everyone it s absolutely atrocious you won t run into it often but when you do it s a real day ruiner and god help you if you re a mildly popular content creator at the end of the day i can t recommend dead by daylight it s like alcohol it s really bad for you and if you do it enough it ll probably kill you but once you start getting a taste for it you can t stop coming back to it a little bit here and there might be alright but you then have to ask if it s worth the cost of entry and right now i have to say that no it s not i love you dead by daylight but i can t do this anymore i m sure i ll be back next year i ll play for a month and then vanish again like i always do but that window gets

58848,2018 dead by daylight one of the games i really have a kind of love hate relationship to i like the concept and the game itself 4 survivors trying to activate repair 5 generators to activate the exit gates and 1 killer trying to prevent them from a successfull repair escape and kill by chasing catching and hooking them to ultimately sacrifice the survivor to the entity sounds fun and it definetly is if you play with friends but be aware when you play with random players this game can get really frustrating due to a quite often toxic selfish communityin my opinion as a survivor you re not supposed to have a 100 chance getting out of the game alive you re supposed to try and reach the exit by teamwork using any tool you ve got with you or find on the map in case a killer is camping well who cares team up to free the survivor on the hook instead of teamwork loads of times you ll end up in a match having selfish team mates not caring if you got hooked or downed by the killer minding their own business or after a very tense match feeling good about the game you return to the lobby to find either survivors killers or both having a go at each other for whatever random reason killers ranting in the lobby when the last survivor tries finding using the hatch instead of just surrender and let them kill you however if you are lucky enough getting a nice group in a public match you ll have loads of fun tension within a game environment offering a great athmosphere as well as a levelling system so you can obtain items and special perks for your survivors killers,115.4,90.0,2,Recommended,"July 19, 2018",Dead by Daylight,"☜✪Critney✪☞

58854,2021 product received for free frankly at times this game feels like one of the best games ever made with a killer concept and a gameplay loop that s managed to remain fun and still scary at times however the more i play this game the more i come to realise that this game has some serious flaws which seriously affect my enjoyment though let s start with what this game does well first and perhaps the best part of the game is its lore from the tomes to the deep backstories or overall the way it s able to subtly immerse you into the twisted trials and that allows for every experience or any franchise to exist in it then there are the aesthetics the art department definitely deserves a raise from the classic slasher tropes it was built on to the new chapters that go further to sci fi they ve been able to build an ultimate horror game now to add onto this the monetization of this game while still inherently bad is actually done surprisingly well with most things killers survivors skins being able to be unlocked through progression and while you do have to pay for licensed content you at least aren t restricted from playing on maps you don t own nor potentially perks through the shrine although prices can be on the more expensive side in this industry it s surprising that they aren t charging for more or squeezing every dollar out of this game especially for a game with frequent updates additionally for the people like me who have a fear of missing out this game does make older timed content rewards available again through yearly events or through the in game shop or through allowing one to revisit older tomes however there are some huge negatives that i ve had with this game which leaves a sour taste in my mouth foremost while i do praise the gameplay loop it can quickly become stale and repetitive especially as survivor besides glyphs which are spawned through the tome challenges there is no variation in objectives and in my opinion is a big reason the game itself can feel like a major grind i would say this gets fixed with custom matches against friends but those can be limiting the developers did say they are addressing this though next and the biggest the toxicity in the community as a killer main the survivor entitlement can be real i have had death threats for not allowing the other side to win though i can see how it can be difficult on both sides as discussion can quickly become an us vs them screaming match this is made worse through the game incentivizing toxic behaviour tunnelling slugging or through the devs choosing to nerf things rather than rework in the hope it will balance the experience which it usually doesn t lastly the game isn t that new player friendly and while there is a set of tutorials it definitely has a steep learning curve a seemingly scary amount of paid content and a store description that showcases an outdated player experience i e the game now is more fast paced rather than more stealth oriented now while i see that behaviour has shown their intention to solve issues with their game they can be very slow to respond and seem generally out of touch with the community focusing more on the raw data rather than the player experience example ptb 6 3 0 like many dev teams it s usually one step forward and two steps back then there s the push for competitive the old ntf situation and more stuff that should be discussed though i can only go on for so long despite all this however i would still recommend this game as it does remain a relatively enjoyable experience if you know how to navigate its many pitfalls edits 27 10 2021 added ending for details about nfts 16 06 2023 reworked review,575.2,104.0,7,Recommended,"July 22, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"Kiarch

58887,2019 in less than a day i ve spent about seven hours on this game love the game love the idea of companionship and working together i can always pair up a group of friends or just have me and my boyfriend play together a lot of people complained about toxicity i believe to me i don t really understand how a game like this could be toxic if you can t even communicate throughout the game the only sort of communication you get is before the game you get a minute to ready up when there s a whole squad of survivors and after the game if you stay i haven t played as a killer yet because i m scared of the result but i think i m going to go for the tutorial and try playing as a killer after this review honestly for the price i got it for 10 bucks for the sale it s totally worth it once it goes back up i recommend really thinking before you purchase considering some factors some people may disconnect the game some people may have no idea how to play some people may intentionally have you get killed could be considered still as toxic frustrating but could easily be flipped over if you got some cool buddies to play with all in all i recommend the game because it is fun to play with friends or other people i m more of a person who enjoys to play with other people if you like deceit i recommend this game p s don t complain about a game being toxic when you can t even communicate throughout the game and your biggest threat is another player disconnecting and what game doesn t have any toxicity update playing as a killer in this game is pretty rough you do get a lot more currency though to upgrade characters i can see the toxicity towards the killers because of the perks if the killers chose to unlock their perks i did realize in my first game i wasn t able to kill anybody with one character so i tried another in my second game i did kill and sacrifice three individuals at the end of the game a few told me that camping isn t the right way to win a game ironically i ran across the whole map multiple times like an idiot after explaining to them that this indeed was my second match as a killer and my first time using this killer they apologized and laughed about it with me communication is key during the game at the beginning and most certainly at the end i could of got reported or worse but luckily i didn t i also realized that the game does crash on you so you will disconnect it s not like people intentionally disconnect anyways thanks for reading my review,867.6,59.0,5,Recommended,"May 27, 2019",Dead by Daylight,"scaryangrykaren

58909,2020 dead by daylight is a game you will love to hate and hate to love the game has come a long way since 2016 but still requires a considerable amount of time and effort to improve if you enjoy co op games with a lot of potential room for mindgames and improvement then this will be a great title for you to at least try out with a group of friends during free weekend or sales perhaps the game will stick with you during this time if you expect every game to be smooth sailing without the occassional camper or dodgy matchmaking then this might not be a game for you as is with every game that has online matchmaking the game s price is pretty ok for what you get although a lot of perks characters and cosmetics are behind dlc paywalls however said perks etc are for a large part obtainable with currency that can be earned in game by playing matches without spending a single euro at least it is clear that the developers want to sculpt the game into something better and continue to do so for the forseeable future i d say they did a pretty good job so far,534.9,65.0,7,Recommended,"February 9, 2020",Dead by Daylight,Devi,False

58918,2022 with nearly 300 hours on this game here s what i can say the best way to play this game as either side is to stay at low rank anything below bronze everyone around that area is mostly balanced for skill level some games you ll steamroll and others you ll get stomped if you win be humble about it once you get to bronze everyone is fully adapted to the meta not giving you any room to have fun if you play killer prepare to be bullied by survivors who are trying to have fun at your expense as a killer you will be screwed over by about 1 3 of all maps in the game and the survivors will exploit fair game mechanics to anger you everytime they constantly slip through your fingers even by a little they will rub it in survivors want you to feel bad about yourself like you re a real pos who s terrible at this game and it will work you ll get pissed off you ll play sloppy and you ll look for the strongest killers and the best perks in the hope that you can smash them into the ground for their bullying and if survivors open up the exit gates they will wait for you to get close teabag at you click their little flashlights point or just stand right at the exit so you can pointlessly hit them survivors are the best example of what makes a toxic playerbase as a survivor you will run into killers who have suffered at the hands of these toxic survivors and they ll take it out on you due to dbd not having any sort of targeted matchmaking they can t simply take on the same survivors again for revenge they need a win because they ve been abused and bullied by survivors you ll get stuck with clueless selfish and potentially troll teammates that will purposefully get you killed and it ll piss you off it won t seem fair that you got singled out or that your teammate body blocked you so the killer could hit you or that they hide in a bush all game while you try and do all the objectives then escape while you distract the killer and die in dead by daylight you re either the bully or you re the one being bullied it s a game of mental abuse of high blood pressure and it s by design so if you re a level headed individual who isn t easily affected by obvious troll tactics and mockery please come and play dbd the community needs more people like you if you re humble and don t need to rub in every victory you have over others come play dbd if you re a good sport come play dbd if your idea of fun is playing a game of tag with someone then turning around to flip them off everytime they lunge for you and miss we don t want you you re a bully and everyone would be better off without your company,537.4,402.0,51,Not Recommended,"June 25, 2022",Dead by Daylight,Blaidd's Blade,False
58919,2018 i have over 500 hours in this game so obviously i enjoyed it at one point this used to be my favorite game and i would play it for several hours every day but now it s a honestly such a terrible game and is only getting worse and let me tell you why the game is centered around the idea of a killer and 4 survivors with the killer in the dominant role there are various killers to choose from that all have cool unique abilities but the problem is that the killer is no longer the dominant role making the survivors both the group and the dominant role it started out correctly it was buggy but it was done right with the killers actually being scary as of now there have been so many survivor buffs and killer nerfs that playing killer is a joke and isn t fun anymore being a killer main i have personally experienced this gradual degression into nothingness that the developers of the game have enforced the other main problem is that the developers are the most disconnected people that i have ever seen completely ingoring the blatently obvious problems that there game has they focus gameplay around lower level survivors which means more experienced players are almost impossible to kill the killer nerfs have gotten so bad that even the survivor side of the community is complaining and that s saying something usually the survivors are pretty toxic so for them to recognize a problem on the killer end of things should have been a wake up call to the developers but to no avail to end this i would like to quote one of the developers who was asked the question do you have any ideas on how you are going to impove the killer experience this was responded to with maybe try survivor for a bit or play something else for like a week try civilization or something this was literally a developer saying that they aren t going to fix the obvious balance issues that there game has i hope that in the future this game will be fixed and will once again be a magnificent and unique horror game but for now please avoid it for your own sake,659.4,210.0,9,Not Recommended,"March 13, 2018",Dead by Daylight,Zinthos23,False

58945,2021 mmr ruined everything before rank only meant hours played in a rather roundabout way this didn t mean skill nor it was an indicator of how serious a player were just experience therefore you could find a very rich variety of players on high ranks people trying builds that could play just fine even if the build wasn t great sweaty players with ultra rares intent on winning no matter what people that are not that great but still put the time in and so on this meant matches on high ranks were still fun with players of all walks of life forming the teams or killing the teams now with mmr in place you ll always be put against the best people for your rank this means all matches are now serious sweatfests that force you to play in the most optimal way possible to ensure you ll get your goals noed brand new parts dh ds bt all the time etc means that you can no longer play for fun there is no longer grounds to test builds without losing rank that will just make it unfair for other players mmr doesn t take into account items so newbies can be carried by strong items and then find themselves losing continuously because they no longer have them killers that are less than meta are not worth playing mmr is killer dependant so why play unoptimal killers if it s not gonna earn you wins but you know what s worse the game adopted mmr to be more balanced balanced means there s a pretense of competitive and the problem with this game in particular is that you can t make a game competitive when it hasn t been clearly established what it means to win or to lose case in point i played a doctor match all survivors but one escaped but i maxed bp in every category except survival no pip i played a legion match just one survivor escaped 15 hooks no pip i played a plague match killed everyone two gens done maxed bp except one category no pip on survivor side i escaped after doing three gens i pipped then i ran the killer for three gens didn t get hooked and opened the exit no pips so what gives the game won t even show you if you ranked up or not on the mmr the leagues and bronze silver gold iridiscent leagues don t have anything to do with mmr it s just a medal system we don t know what counts for mmr developers have said it s more than just winning without saying what winning actually is we only know items and addons don t count for mmr which is already terrible this makes the gaming experience extremely unsatisfactory you feel like you re left in the dark after each match with the disappointing sensation that you never win you only don t lose and even then you can still very clearly lose what a sham,638.5,72.0,2,Not Recommended,"September 11, 2021",Dead by Daylight,Artistical,False

58951,2016 the game is very well made and it s a nice and unique concept i really love it but i need to give it a thumbs down as for now because of how much time it takes to play as a killer you need to create a lobby wait for people to join and apparently there is a bug where your lobby disappears from the system or something like this and you just keep waiting and pepole don t come i ve been waiting 10 mins 20 mins and people come and go but i still cannot manage to get a full lobby of 4 people and it amazes me because there are like 8k people online playing and it s impossible that atleast 4 people don t get in your lobbyif you really want to play as a survivor then you can buy it you join lobbies pretty fast but as a killer it s another storythey might fix this issue in the future but for now it s a thumbs down from me,143.7,86.0,6,Not Recommended,"June 14, 2016",Dead by Daylight,iRaphahell,False
58952,2017 i ve played since the beta and had a lot of fun with it it s amazing value for money and has almost limitless replayability the game was incredibly buggy and still stuffers from issues today although the devs keep dropping patches fixes and small gameplay tweaks to help improve things and its come a long way with many positive improvements sadly i have to say that the game seems to have drifted into a very bad place and needs to serious work to put it back on track ultimately the premise of the game is based around hide and seek where the seeker is a killer hunting for his her prey the survivors these survivors are in constant fear for their lives and must try to repair generators as quickly as they can in order to power the exit gates so they can flee the killer and reach safety this is the problem the contant fear just isn t there any longer survivors simply taunt and run rings around killers often armed with a vast array of tools and perks readily at their disposal addiitonally teams of friends can communicate over voice chat giving a monoumenal tactical advantage against the killer major work is needed on the game in order to bring about some balance at the moment killers are often too powerful against newer or less skilled players whilst at the same time survivors become far too powerful in the late game changes need to be included that keep the same level of fear new players experience and make escaping the killer actually challenging at all skill levels this keep things fun for everyone its more rewarding to know you escaped when the odds were stacked against you and keeps killers engaged in the game moving on to dlci ve purchased all dlc so far and been quite happy with the chapters some good some average until the most recent one freddy krueger aka the nightmare there was a lot of excitement around this new licenced killer and when it was released i found it to have quite a learning curve although it was very easy to track and down a single survivor it was quite tricky to manage all 4 of them and resulted in a lot of running about in chases ultimatley i found him a little weak but with the right perks and techniques i could see him being a fun killer just one week after release a tsunami of hatred fell upon freddy from the survivor community calling for nerfs and complaint about him being too strong many of them being very new to the game as i mentioned earlier inexperienced players will struggle early on and shouldnt be a judge of game balance from one side the nerf hit a few weeks after release with freddy suffering badly in all areas whilst the devs didn t go ahead with 100 of their initial planned nerfs the ones that they brough in were completely uneccessary and went too far destroying a paid dlc killer based on the loudest cries from the community freddy now stands a shadow of his former self and has become the weakest killer in the game which is a shame as im sure he was play tested and balanced internally before all of that was just thrown away behavior digital have seen the last of my money and i will no longer purchase any future dlc i ll continue to enjoy the game playing as surivor and killer but have been burned by this recent decisions and will stick to consuming the free content thats offered with the hope that they learn lessons and attempt to put the game back on course to where it should be in summary pros game is amazing value for money especially in the sales procedurally generated maps make for high replayability active development new patches and changes open and engaging with community on development new free content included not just paid dlc very active player basecons still major bugs in game even so long after release including save game loses high levels of toxicity im looking at you post game chat game promotes bad play styles infinite pallet looping hook camping poor balance between killer and survivor playing killer as killer at rank 1 is not fun and swf can be a joke a round can be ruined for others when a player purposefully disconnects which happens far too often i reach rank 1 killer and rank 1 survivor after each reset and have played serveral hundred hours as both sides hopefully that gives me a little weight behind my experiences so far in reviewing this,619.5,307.0,15,Not Recommended,"November 15, 2017",Dead by Daylight,Darkstriker,False

58971,2018 i ve spent about 300 hours on ps4 and roughly half of that on steam typically each season i have been high tier survivor and mid to high killer i can t recomend this game to anyone there s obviously a love hate to the game but this final straw is this emblem system the community is unbearably toxic the devs consistantly take the game in the wrong direction people ruin your game be it selfish clueless teammates or cheap killers watching the dev stream shows how out of touch they are as there are serious issues with mechanics and balance and they ignore them constantly insidous killers hiding in the basement face camping and op killers ruin it for survivors trolling survivors who run 1 perk because they think they re great and consistant pallet looping and purple flashlights ruin it for average killers honestly this game was much better shortly after launch than it is now high tier players are intentionally de ranking just to find games because it s impossible for casual players to rank up now these devs are clueless and the community just adds insult to injury the frustration just isn t worth the time que the thinks this is funny nerdsedit they ve updated the emblem system much more balanced and easier to rank up edit 2 it s 2k19 and this game somehow got worse the new killer is actually broken the perk reworking has made the game less enjoyable for both survivor and killer the community is just as brain dead as ever i just had a game with a teammate from germany and also one from mexico in the same lobby doing a pretty good job so far i d say,382.3,379.0,121,Not Recommended,"May 4, 2018",Dead by Daylight,Garbage Plate,False

58976,2017 i appreciate the free weekend for day by deadlight since i was very interested in playing the game and now that i put some hours into it i can say for sure that this is a very addictive survival horror game i want to explain why to me this is a love letter to fans of the classic slasher horror movies like halloween friday the 13th the texas chainsaw massacre it really does a fantastic job by creating this foreboding atmosphere where you can actually simulate those terrifying moments that you watched on tv now instead of being the one sitting comfortably on your sofa shouting at the protagonists for making the wrong decisions you can now be the protagonist and try to overcome the situation yourself or if you want to see the annoying teens of the movie bite the dust you can now be the murdering psycho that finishes them off at its core dead by deadlight is a cat and mouse game where four survivors are up against one killer in one of many scary locations the group must work together repair five generators in order to activate and open the exit door all while avoiding the killer of course it sounds simple enough however the key to success is to cooperate with the other survivors you will quickly learn just how important it is to keep everyone alive the fever you are the easier it will be for the killer to track you down what i love about this is that you are not given any in game chat the only means of communication are hand gestures the survivors are at a serious disadvantage because of this and adds serious tension during every round each killer has its own means of attack and abilities to which they can use now something that is important to mention is the camera view while the survivors have a third person view the killer has a first person view this brings balance to the game although it does not make things easier two hits from the killer and you are down they can either leave you to crawl in agony or pick you up and hang you from a meat hook the other survivors can rescue and heal you at the risk of being caught themselves while many might hate the fact you cannot harm the killer i think it s a cool aspect since survivors must use their wits and plan a strategy to survive there is clearly lots of grinding to do in this game just to level up each character that you play not only to unlock items that you can use but also perks which are quintessential i don t mind it though there is such a rich experience to have every single round lots of thrilling chases lots of new stuff to discover and learn there is a lot of fun content here to keep you engaged there are many flaws here as well many glitches many network problems lack of tutorials lack of pc options had to disable vsync from ini files and the matchmaking can be awful at times i also strongly believe that this game is not for everyone i suggest giving it a try while it is still free to play before purchasing overall i ll say dead by daylight is a very nice multiplayer game with decent challenges good co op and with an immersive atmosphere for any horror fan to enjoy,139.5,66.0,6,Recommended,"September 14, 2017",Dead by Daylight,ᐲᒥᑕᕼ,False

58997,2021 i wasn t really planning on making this since there s not much i can say that hasn t already been said yes i have over 300 hours as of now and will likely keep playing those looking to buy might ask why did you play that much then but avid players might say wow those are baby hours lmao so there s essentially no winning for me here this game suffers greatly from lazy and or incompetent developers due to having virtually zero competition they thrive off what is an extremely unique and fun style of game by doing the bear minimum patchs are barren and scarce new characters are a roll of the dice if they ll be good fun broken or bring an unhealthy change to the meta people largely get into this game because they see a character they recognize and it makes them clap so they ll overlook the glaring problems the game has many of which could be helped with small number changes i m talking changing a single number for a perk but the devs don t care to even try survivor players will say it s fair and balanced yet only use the same pool of 5 8 perks out of 50 and then wonder why killers play super boring and lame killers will use the scarce few perks that are any good for them or even use the same unfun to play against killers like spirit hag clown etc and wonder why survivors bring tons of items and ds every game it s not the players fault at the end of the day it s because the game encourages boring play styles so it s up to the players to put limitations on themselves to find fun if you can do that and tell yourself that there really is no win or lose state simply just do your best than you can enjoy this game a fair bit but if you re looking for any sort of serious competitive play don t bother a 4k for the killer isn t a win same for an escape as a survivor they re simply just how things rolled out many times due to little or no input of your own the community is largely unhelpful too i ve run into many very nice people while playing even hopped into a few streamers chats who i was playing against and they ve been nice but for every one of those you re going to get 50 jerk offs who think too much of themselves check my profile comments for examples you get just as many sore winners as you do sore losers and it s the easiest way to make even a victory an annoyance to be fair bantering back at these people is very easy to do and quite fun then they delete their comments in embarrassment this game needs competition to kick the developers into doing more than the minimum here s hoping monstrum 2 will do good check that out by the way pre orders are up and it s out this month january of 2021 monstrum 2 has come out in an extremely rough state probably not a lot of hope there in the mean time i ll probably keep playing every now and then it s extremely comfy and easy for me to stream and offers a great grind if you re like me and enjoy a good grind edit check these videos for a good idea of what i mean by incompetent lazy devs they re also a great laugh youtube video almo the game designer of dbd views 94 613 this video is not intended to throw shade or offend almo this is purely a video to have a good laugh at some misplays and funny moments courtesy of the game designer of dbd youtube video according to the statistics almo the game designer dead by daylight views 63 005 once again this video is not to offend or to throw shade at almo he is a wonderful person and doesn t deserve any mean comments towards him,421.7,165.0,8,Not Recommended,"January 14, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"SnapKick

58998,2017 instead of telling you all the pros and cons of dead by daylight i ll first make a list of all the bugs glitches and other flaws that still happen to me and my friends regularly over 6 month after the game was fully released the game freezes or crashes while searching for a game entering a game or playing a game it often takes literal hours to get into a lobby matchmaking is terrible you as middle rank survivor can end up with three low rank survs against a rank 1 killer or you play against 4 rank 1 survs as rank 20 lowest possible rank killer there are no limits for this idiocy there is a feature to play survive with friends together with your steamfriends however you often end up alone in the public lobby while you friends get disconnected if you actually made it into a game you might be the only survivor left it can happen that your teammates get disconnected during the loading screen especially when the killer has a bad internet connection the game works with a so called p2p connection that means that it depends on the lobby host the killer if there is lag or not of course there is lag in many games no it s not my connection the lag doesn t only affect your movement but also the skill checks the indicator will tremble which makes it really hard to succeed the skill check skill checks often pop up after you went away from the generator but then you can t even do them successfully anymore there are skill checks that can t physically be done successfully when the skill check area is in the first third of the circle you only have 0 3 seconds time to react the shortest reaction time of a human is between 0 2 and 0 3 seconds this is the time your brain needs to realize what s happening then add a few tenth of seconds for your muscular response clicking space and boom skill check failed one killer the nurse can hit you even if he doesn t aim at you there is an autoaim mechanic that basically let s her hit survivors automatically if she roughly aims in their direction the worst abomination of that mechanic is when you run past the killer quickly but the killer hits you anyways at an 180 angle the killer s hit range is under special circumstances ridiculously high there is a perk that allows you to run faster for a short period of time sprint burst if it activates while the killer starts performing a hit you will run away from him but get hit anyway at distances of over five meters my high score was when a nurse got me even though i was already so far away that the heartbeat rate went down one of the killers has a chainsaw that kann down you immediately this chainsaw can saw around corners through walls and at rare occasions even at an 180 angle it s magic some perks don t always or hardly ever work decisive strike premonition selfheal crows from the shadows if decisive strike does work you can end up stuck in the ground unable to move in some occasions the normal sprinting doesn t work after you ve been hit you sometimes get locked in the crouching position until you get hit by the killer pallet vault doesn t always work especially when the killer is standing in the space where the pallet should drop this is extra awesome since there is a game mechanic that should allow you to rescue a survivor that is carried on the killer s shoulder by stunning him when you drop a pallet it happens many times that the game suddenly teleports you to the side of the pallet you were coming from directly into the killer s arms while being carried by the killer you should be able to wiggle free but the wiggle bar doesn t always show up same goes for the recover bar when two interact able objects are close together e g a closet and a window and you press space to get through it you might get sucked sideways into or through the other object the button layout generally needs improvement since too many actions are on the same buttons from time to time you get stuck in stones or in between trees the progress bar doesn t display exactly how far you have progressed it fails in its entire existence the exit gate doesn t open the generator doesn t finish the survivor doesn t unhook and the hook doesn t get destroyed when the bar is already entirely full this means that the killer can still grab you when you already should have finished when you get grabbed by the killer he can hang you on a hook then another survivor has to unhook you however you might die randomly before they even get the chance to rescue you you can also die while being unhooked before the time runs out or unhook generally doesn t work and you are doomed one of the killers can lay bear traps if one of them is close to a hook but not directly under it you can get sucked into the trap while unhooking in certain locations the traps sink into the ground and become invisible the survivor and killer models are solid objects you can t just run through them usually but there is also a glitch were you can players can use this to block others in narrow passages and killers can prevent survs from unhooking by just standing in front of the hook body blocking to prevent players from hiding afk in a closet the devs have added crows that will fly above a still standing survivor after a while to give out their position the problem is the crows come way too early if a killer searches the area where you are more thoroughly than usually you can t move that much the crows will appear and basically get you killed as killer grabbing survivors while they unhook or escape through the hatch sometimes doesn t work you don t always get your bloodpoints and pips after a game there are a maximum of three daily rituals challenges where you get bonus points at a time usually you should be able to replace unfinished ones with a new one every day it often doesn t work for days a friend of mine lost all his items addons and offerings that were on the second pages of the loadout screen and last but not least there is a bug that resets your entire game progress and you can t do anything about it thus if you have really bad luck you lose hundreds of hours of playtime well that just have been the bugs there are more reasons to not buy dead by daylight the devs randomly ban people without specifying any reason to stop people from using infinites running circles through badly placed obstacles so that the killer can t catch you they boarded up most of the windows in the houses as a result you now often run into a dead end and end up dead in addition if you jump through a window three times in a short period of time they get blocked by some magic fence the stupidity of the pallet placement is hard to comprehend there are pallets right between to two trees guess what that doesn t stop the killer since he can walk around trees shocking isn t it the ranking system is weird you get points for getting chased but not for staying hidden and thus alive you can escape and still lose a rank pip there are also games where the killer doesn t murder a single survivor and still gets twice the points he needs to rank up get a pip the game allows players to destroy the fun of all other players i m talking about camping body blocking and infinites i know this sadly had become normal in online games but that doesn t stop me from pointing it out the developers rather focus on pay2 win or overpriced cloathing dlcs instead of finally fixing all these bugs don t get me wrong dbd can be fun at the beginning especially with friends but you ll often end up upset after playing and the fun you had can t eradicate your anger don t do this to you it s not worth it,749.6,176.0,14,Not Recommended,"February 14, 2017",Dead by Daylight,"Wobedy

58999,i used to play this game on xbox and accumulated a lot of hours on it so with that my review is coming from experience of this game i want to start this off by saying i m neutral about this game but slightly leaning towards the positive side because when the game is good it s wonderful you can make memories have laughs meet lovely people and just overall enjoy your experience playing dbd but when the game is bad it s truly a terrible experience once that bad starts to show it just ruins your entire play session whether it s playing as a killer and going against self entitled survivors that want you to play the game a certain way and if you don t you receive really disgusting and unsettling messages over literal pixels as a survivor it s the same style of concept just partially different you can receive cruel messages for simply playing the game how you re supposed to toxicity from your fellow survivors for not doing a certain thing for them example taking a hit for them when you re death hook when they haven t been hooked once or not sacrificing yourself on hook so they can get hatch when they hid all game for zero reason lmao i genuinely adore this game with its funny moments like getting jump scared by nemesis zombies killer using tinkerer going against bubbas i love bubba players they are so silly and cute hehe meeting wholesome survivors killers playing perk roulette with my friends slug races ily with all my heart if you participate host them and overall just playing the game for fun and not taking it so seriously thank you so much for taking the time to read everything and stay safe in the fog,134.8,43.0,5,Recommended,February 25,Dead by Daylight,౨ৎ sleepy princess .ᐟ 🌸,False

59015,2017 great and fun game but oh my god so many issues and bugs it s mind blowing pros new and innovative play style a competitive multiplayer horror game very addictive and re playable many different characters and perks very fun to play with friendscons horrible peer2peer system disconnections and empty lobby spots are sadly all to regular camping and or griefing killers griefing survivors i just got blocked by 2 players who were camping in the basement op dlc characters cough pay to win cough only competitive playmode not any casual mode without the ranking system the ranking system seems flawed as well not matching people with similar skill experience character level it feels more like it s just throwing 5 people together without considering any of their merits in game communication in form of using microphones or a chat is not available graphical and other general bugs which are still in the game for example where some you can get literally stuck inside a pallet and can t get out except if the killer hits you the community is pure aids,331.2,23.0,1,Recommended,"September 21, 2017",Dead by Daylight,"Mr kitty skritty aka tedssoN

59019,2019 i cannot recommend this game i want to like it hell i ve got almost 100 hours in i did enjoy it but i just can t any more the community is highly toxic expect someone to do something rude or toxic in every match how is this possible you ask the game employs a ranking system the bottom rank is rank 20 new player the top rank is 1 makes sense right a game with a ranking system then should be expected to have players of similar skill levels and abilities playing against each other good players play against other good players experienced players should be higher ranks except it s incredibly easy to circumvent the system it s a known problem of high ranking players de ranking on purpose to troll or abuse newer players it s even easier to just group up with your high ranking friend and play against players who are similar in rank to the lowest rank person not the highest rank this would be like having an nfl team recruiting a high school kid and then playing against high schools because the least experienced person on their team is in high school overall i want to recommend the game i do i really enjoyed it but after all the chat abuse stupid tea bagging and other behaviors in game meant to belittle you and people who shouldn t be playing against new players i m done i m not playing anymore and i regret spending money on this game if you like to be made to feel stupid and helpless by people who are far superior to you in ability and game knowledge play dead by daylight if you prefer to actually enjoy a competitive game i suggest you look elsewhere,97.1,299.0,69,Not Recommended,"August 25, 2019",Dead by Daylight,"Communal Toast

59022,2023 the only reason people like this game is because it has no competitor in the industry dbd is an extremely flawed and unfun game once you get past the initial phase when you re a beginner learning the game and just trying to have fun the game has no separate ranked and casual queues which means every match you play will be a sweat fest which will make it extremely unenjoyable unless you re constantly tryharding every single game during which people from both sides will utilize underhanded tactics to either ruin your enjoyment or to secure a win faster now obviously people are free to play how they want however it s the game it s self that facilitates and encourages these things which is where the problem lies oh yea also the matchmaking for this game sucks which means you ll likely get curb stomped by people with 1000s of hours of game time who are infinitely more knowledgeable than you which is super frustrating i would also go so far as to call this game p2w you see despite the fact that this game costs 20 euros on base every few months the developers release paid expansions with new characters now these characters also have global perks you can put on any other character the licensed characters such as pyramid head nemesis pig etc cannot be earned ingame at all and often these paid characters have great meta perks without which you re simply not playing on an even playing field so unless you re constantly buying new expansions you ll seriously struggle to keep up with the meta and compete with more experienced players running sweaty builds also this game treats you like you might as well be a free to play player this game is seriously grindy you see when you play any character you need to unlock perks which seems fair enough however you need to farm a currency called blood points and then randomly roll and hope that you get the perk you want out of all the other perks you currently own globally which may seem fine until you realize there s over 200 perks in the game and you need to do this for every single character you own which means you ll be spending anywhere from 2 3 days to maybe build up the character you want to play and then doing this on repeat for other characters there s also another in game earnable currency you can farm called iridescent shards which lets you unlock non licensed dlc characters which is great however the rate at which you get these shards is abysmal which means you ll be playing for months without unlocking all the characters for a game that costs you twenty euros at base and this is without considering the fact that you unlock cosmetics with the same currency as well which are super expensive would i recommend this game casually no i believe this game becomes repetitive and unfun after about 8 10 hours even with friends just go play deep rock or phasmophobia instead would i recommend this game if you re a competitive player who wants to sweat also no this game has no real ranking system where you can check a regional or global leader board so you ll never really have a competitive ladder to climb and compare yourself to and the tournament scene of this game isn t exactly popping either all in all i believe dbd is simply just not a game worth your time or your money there are other games which are significantly more fun with friends which won t be as frustrating to play 4 10 stay away from this game,410.7,152.0,14,Not Recommended,"July 9, 2023",Dead by Daylight,"Hoka

59036,disclaimer i have 2 5k hours in this game i previously played on epicasymmetryimagine that you are paired up with 3 other people in order to repair 5 generators so that you can open one of the two gates available to escape the area while doing this there is a killer lurking in the shadows and patrolling the surrounding area looking for you as they are getting closer there is music you hear a musical theme that is getting ever louder as the killer is getting closer since you are in their so called terror radius the most exciting part is the final layer of this music which plays during the chase sequence you can stun the killer with pallets or flashlights but can never really defeat them if a chase ensues you need to make sure it lasts the longest possible time so that your team mates have time to finish the reparation when hit you gain adrenaline to run faster for a while but you leave pools of blood and also make a noise due to the wounds you have you are an easier target now but you still need to press on as the second hit comes crashing down you find yourself on the ground and the killer can pick you up and hook you your team mates now need to decide who will get to you and become a lifesaver risking to become the next victim every person must be hooked 3 times to perish a creature with tentacles descends from the sky to take you elsewhere once and for all when this happens a license haventhis is even more exciting if you love horror and are familiar with the many horror franchises out there with perhaps particular emphasis on the slasher genre the killer can be myers from halloween or ghostface from the scream franchise you can try to outrun the xeno from the alien or play hide and seek with bubba from texas chainsaw massacre you can try to avoid amanda from saw to put beartraps on your head or reject the offer from cenobite who has such sights to show you you can seek out alarm clocks to wake up from freddy krueger s nightmares or avoid chucky because you don t want to be friends til the end but there s more we have gaming licenses here too you can avoid the tentacles of nemesis or wesker s dashes both of them set out to infect you during the match survivors can also be familiar to you from these licenses it s fun hunting down ripley with the xeno or cheryl with pyramid head the game is not short of original licenses the creators came up with there is a robot that can use pods to track you and teleport to start a chase and there is even a knight who sends out ghosts patrolling the area more info on the gameplaythere are several maps out there and some are tied in with the licenses such as the racoon city pd or the nostromo wreckage items can be taken to matches to help us with the speed of reparation or healing fellow survivors characters can be upgraded with the blood points we get consider it the xp in this game and each one can be prestiged after level 50 both survivors and killers come with 3 unique abilities perks that can be unlocked for others if we do at least one prestiging but you also have general perks available not tied to characters and it should be noted that everyone has 4 slots so you can create a lot of interesting builds since there are more than 70 characters more than 30 on each side now the fun part is how you play from the 3rd person as survivor but the killer has a 1st person perspective for killers the add ons 2 slots are not for items but modifiers that can enhance or change their powers each side can also take an offering to the match this can be a request to play on a specific level or just something that gives a boost percentage to the bp earned some killers are fast others can teleport through walls some can move stealthily and many require you to do other things during the match you can disarm traps use clocks to wake yourself up cleanse yourself from infection or use either a vaccine or a spray to cure yourself from a virus there is no built in voice chat but you can only use a few gestures to give others orders you have to pay attention to the left hand side of the screen that shows what your fellow survivors are doing you can see who is in a chase and you can always see the auras of those on a hook what if i m a new player prepare for a lot to learn the game was released more than 7 years ago and a lot of content has been added a small amount of characters are available but the rest must be purchased for original characters a special currency shards can be earned so by playing a lot you can purchase a lot of characters and even many outfits now this is a game that uses the game as a service model approach in every season we get new characters there is a new chapter and rifts open up for purchase which essentially means for a small fee we can receive a lot of cosmetics but only for specific characters there is a lot of terminology for you to learn you need to know what status effects there are and their meaning and many more toxicitythis is why i m downvoting this game the playerbase is awful after a match regardless of the outcome people say hurtful things to you they consider you a cheater if you have won as a killer or your survivor friends look down on you if you did not play well and it was your gameplay that doomed the entire team you can crouch repeatedly during a match to tea bag the killer the killers in return can camp tunnel slug that are all nasty but efficient tactics to win a match some offences you come across are simply not punishable if you decide to report someone you need to 1 make a report in game 2 submit a ticket on the developer s website and 3 upload video evidence as proof of the cheat harassment or unsportsmanlike attitude you have come across the reporting system is very time consuming and due to privacy reasons you only get confirmation on when your ticket was actioned some players even upload a screenshot on their temporary bans as they consider it funny forums here on the steam can be just as toxic the official forum on the developer s website is much better but moderation is done regularly as it is a must the game s matchmaking system is broken it is very easy to be paired with players that are thousands of hours ahead of you with survivors climbing ranks it is especially difficult since you alone cannot win a match you need the others but with lack of experience the so called soloq experience can be painful killers can find matches difficult and sweaty just the same friends can team up and use voice communication e g discord and have a coordinated match against the killer some of these swf survive with friends groups tend to remain after the match and bully the 5th individual in the chat the killer then will resort to slugging camping etc in the following match it generates an unstoppable avalanche swearwords are common in the chat and rep or rep messages will quickly fill up your wall if your profile is public summarydbd is an amazing game running from killers as nicolas cage or ash from evil dead can be pure fun opening the gate but heading back with 2 others to save the 4th individual who s struggling for their life on the hook can be one of the most memorable experiences in this game there are some expert players out there many also stream regularly and the learning curve is there and it is very steep but the game has a lot of issues new characters with their new perks always shake up the meta the developers also make decisions that slightly alter the game mechanics and there are killers such as freddy in the roster that haven t been upgraded for years i downvote dbd due to its community this game requires a lot and i mean a lot of patience to deal with toxicity who knows you may get hooked pun

59085,2020 dead by daylight is about to approach its 4th anniversary which is quite impressive you would think that after 4 years the game would have improved a lot and in some ways it did but in other ways it has not the devs seem far more interested in pushing out new cosmetics and dlcs instead of fixing this buggy mess of a game or improving the new player experience it s frankly ridiculous to see the amount of issues the game still has to this date with the devs progressing at a snails pace bugsthis game is super buggy some bugs have existed for years if not months and some of them straight up makes it impossible to play the game some prevents you from ranking up some makes you dc at the match loading screen some just makes it super annoying to play with friends and these bugs have existed for at least over a year but that s not the worst part of it with each update there is a good chance a major obvious bug somehow slips through and you just have to wonder if these devs even bother playtesting their own damn game at times it s ridiculous how many noteworthy bugs gets introduced with each patch and it s ridiculous how many of them remain unsolved even months after release friend of mine can t even play the game because he has been plagued by several bugs for months now and whenever he seems to find a fix for one bug another somehow pops up completely unrelated to the first one this is inexcuseable and i have to question what sort of spaghetti code this game runs on at this point balancethe balance of the game has improved drastically since the beginning there are lots of blatantly unfair things that has been nerfed or reworked and it s pretty good but the devs are super slow when it comes to balancing in general freddy was left as one of the killers for like 2 years before getting a rework clown has been garbage against any remotely competent survivors since his release 2 years ago you want to win against good survivors you better learn nurse freddy billy or spirit most other killers can do decent against survivors but many of them still rely on the survivors making mistakes rather than you outplaying them several perks are also straight up useless leading to a super stale meta where both killers and survivors will be using the same perks for the most part with a few variations and new killers and survivors release with terrible perks all the time too most killers and survivors released in the last couple of years had like 1 ok to great perk 2 niche to garbage perks some of which are literally just straight up inferior or sometimes superior versions of already existing perks the devs are clearly running out of ideas when it comes to perks and it s showing in the latest designs at least the latest released killers have been pretty good matchmaking and rankingthe matchmaking in this game is an absolute joke i have never seen a more unbalanced matchmaking system in any other mp game i have played purple rank killers can get completely new players in their games new killers can face 4 red rank survivors green rank killers can get a mix of grey and red survivors now you might be wondering what these colors mean the ranking system is divided into 5 colors grey yellow green purple and red rank going from the lowest rank to the highest rank but for whatever reason people of all kinds of ranks can just be thrown into a match together even if they aren t premade there are way too many rainbow matches in this game and it makes for a frustrating experience both for the experienced players but also the new players additionally the rank system in this game is an absolute joke the amount of god awful survivors i have seen in purple red rank is shocking many of them lack understanding of even the most basic game mechanics but they somehow climb the rank because it s super easy to rank up as survivor this leads to a mix of good and mediocre survivors in what should be the highest level of play in this game on the other hand killers has a hard time ranking up not because they re unskilled but because ranking up in the high rank is too dependant on the skill of the survivors if you as the killer stomp the survivors and kill all of them in 3 minutes too bad you get a de pip basically a loss because how dare you actually be good at this game or how dare you punish survivors playing poorly the same goes for survivors if the killer is bad they might not be able to pip at red ranks either the devs has done nothing to address this besides minor changes that should ve been in there from the beginning the matchmaking and rank system is a meme in this community at this point the grindthe game is not remotely new player friendly not just because of the terrible excuse for a matchmaking but also because of the grind unlocking all the good perks for all characters require a lot of grinding all characters got 3 perks unique to them which can be made available for all other characters by getting the teachable versions showing up at 30 35 and 40 respectively for them once the teachable is unlocked those perks has a chance of showing up in other characters blood webs it s entirely rng if you ll get some of the few good perks or all the garbage perks this game is full of unlocking all the good perks on just one characters takes a lot of playtime you may very well be looking at 30 50hrs of grinding just to unlock all good perks on one character depending on your luck getting bloodpoints the currency for unlocking perks and add ons is extremely slow unless a double bp event is going on but those events are very rare if you don t use any of the perks that increase bp gain we re gonna live forever for survivor barbeque chilli for killer it s a pain and even with those perks it s still a ridiculous grind to unlock all good perks on just one killer forget about playing any other game if you want all the good perks in this game you better be prepared to spend weeks dedicated to this game and nothing else the devs are barely doing anything to help with this they stubbornly refuse to increase the bp gain they stubbornly refuse to just make the double bp event gain the norm they stubbornly refuse to do anything that ll actually help deal with this terrible grind all the while giving idiotic excuses like think about the bloodpoint economy you can earn some killers for free but you also have to grind a lot for them communitythe community just plain and simply suck people get offended over the most mundane things and people are toxic for no good reason you dare loop a killer some will facecamp you you dare down a survivor some of the survivors will dc on you you dare flashlight save a teammate some killers will tunnel you no joke there is a bunch of unwritten rule for this game according to a decent amount of people on both sides and it kills any fun you can have the devs also don t care about how terrible this community is the report system is a joke and people who sandbag even their own teammates rarely if ever gets punished as of late there has also been an increase of hackers in this game some youtubers already got videos regarding them and there is nothing suggesting bhvr is gonna deal with it any time soon just like every other damn issue in this game it s frankly a miracle that this game still does so well despite all these issues i have given bhvr the benefit of doubt many times before but their sheer incompetence and stubborness to make good changes is mindblowing this is not a game i would ever recommend to anyone you would be much better off playing any other mp games with friends odds are they might have devs who are way more competent and actually test their damn patches and balance things at a reasonable pace instead

59096,2016 positivesgreat game really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play there are unlockables like perks offerings clothes items addons etc you can level up your characters as well as your rank for both survivor and killer you can also play private matches with your friends and you won t lose anything if you do die as a survivor the ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now you collect these crystals at least they look like crystals called pips according to the official dead by daylight manual and when you collect a certain amount in a row you get promoted the lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1 to get from rank 20 19 you must collect 3 pips from rank 12 and onwards you must collect 5 pips each rank down meaning rank 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to rank 1 for both survivor and killer so the game seems cool right well most games aren t that perfect tldr great game fun lost of unlockables makes you want to continue playing private matches ranking system collect pips to rank up rank 20 lowest rank rank 1 highest rank negativesthe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently cannot invite your friends to public matches only private matches and some players just boost each other for example one person plays as the killer hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor and they troll you there are many disadvantages in the game too such as the host of every game is the killer this is bad because almost every killer in the game has a isp everybody is searching for their friends and sometimes it can take a while to find a game the longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason you will lag in almost every game you will rage you will die in stupid ways you will get stuck in objects there are hackers in this game too now it s time to elaborate on these points the killer being the host of every game really annoys me just because it gives them a huge advantage think of it like this the host controls everything and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff but the host has internet and because he controls everything it affects you and your friends way more than it does for him as a matter of fact it doesn t affect him at all lag will ruin you and make you rage i ve lost many games just because of lag but how does the lag affect you in game well when you attempt to vault over something like a wall or object and you re lagging you are going to die especially if the killer s chasing you because what happens is that rather than vaulting your character freezes lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed this is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways you will also get stuck in objects one time i spawned into a game the developers call these trials and i was repairing a generator then the killer was coming towards me and i was thinking oh no problem i will just hide behind this tree so i go behind this tree and crouch and he walks past me yeh i m all good i think to myself then i go to walk away from the tree and then just like that i was stuck i literally couldn t move and the murderer was coming back he walked past me again and didn t see me although he didn t see me i was still very angry because i wasn t going to be able to survive unless i get him to kill me so i just quit and also got demoted and lost my item this is why the killer has such a huge advantage in the game this also isn t the only object i ve gotten stuck into i have recorded games i ve played where my connection with the killer was very bad and i will perhaps upload them soon to my steam profile youtube channel link on profile so be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what i m talking about last but not least hackers yes there are hackers already and the game was only recently released even with an anti cheat this just really confuses me as to why their anti cheat software hasn t even banned these players yet i saw a player who had prestiged his claudette morel to level 1000 which at this stage is an impossible stage to even be on most players almost all haven t even prestiged including myself tldr game has more negatives than positives conclusionso to conclude my review this game needs more development the game is great and fun but when you take the negatives into account dead by daylight isn t really the best game to buy at this time i believe the developers didn t give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date but the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games so to say they should be adding more patches as well but in the meantime i recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through thank you for reading my

59108,2019 i have more hours in the game now and want to add my new and current impressions i feel like players you encounter are not as toxic anymore i barely saw insults or too ez comments after the matches thrown at new players or someone who was having a hard time mostly you just get a some gg s and thats it thats much more pleasant how much fun the killer game is kinda depends on the matchmaking not to be paired with way better survivors how much fun the survivor game is highly depends on the killers gameplay and on your teammates not being quitters one quitter already can highly imbalances your chances and is annyoing for everyone the killer can mess up the game by tunneling attacking always the same already hurt survivor and taking them out of the game early or worse by just facecamp them while they are on the hook while this might not work on a team of experiences survivors it messes up the experience in random groups or to new players it doesnt even make sense as you get more points if you hook several people for several times one advice i d give players is to keep your goals in check like make up some ammount of bloodpoints you want to reach and not necersarily to escape or to kill all the survivors if you play with friends only it is always a fun experience and in public matches if the survivor team has no quitters the killer plays decent which unfortunatelly only happens in maybe every second game and you keep your goals in check you can have good times with the game edit it appears they try to get rid of their ingame issues by deleting any mention of them after some really bad rounds i posted my recent experience in their discussions looking for a conversation on how they could be adressed my topic was deleted within minutes and i got a warning for witch hunt when i asked why such a topic gets deleted because it seems like important issues and does not violate any steam rules or guidelines nor any custom discussion rules i got immediatally banned for discussing disciplinary action too bad problems do not disappear just because you try to ignore them just like me and this review,573.3,377.0,52,Not Recommended,"August 11, 2019",Dead by Daylight,ThaFreaK,False

59112,2019 purchased jul 22 2016 7 40ampoints i have been a devoted player for well over 3 years have been following since before the release and have 586 hours as of writing this review if i decide to play more or if i revise the review andi want to articulate this review as best as i can being a veteran of dbd has had it s challenges seeing the changes balances new content hype generating releases on different consoles and the consumer response i ve attended the official discord watched many streamers and have streamed it myself when i say i get frustrated it goes well beyond that not talking keyboard or monitor breaking but just the unwillingness to play any game after a session of dbd it mentally drains me now i ve been happy with some things mad at others pros relatively fun gameplay once you get a hang of the mechanics and what to do the ranking system feels fair the points and how they re earned push me to be a more well rounded dbd player surviving with friends is fun kyf though i don t play it much is enjoyable as well a plethora of characters to choose from an even larger variety of perks to customize your character into any play style you can think of consistent patches and detailed descriptions of what has changed cons bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs the fact that the plethora of characters and cosmetics to choose from is over 100 usd in total dlc the feel that when things are going bad they release content to satiate the masses the feel that they pump out so much content in a short span of time to specifically generate interest and make sales instead of fixing glaring issues the community if you can even call it that has devolved into toxic camping tunneling t bagging sandbagging harassing jerkwads that take advantage of mechanics that while in other games are frowned upon and usually reportable are totally allowed in the reporting system of dbd correct me if i m wrong the devs taking input from large streamers and not smaller bits of the community the events are uneventful as another reviewer put themv finally dbd just gets stale it s the same game mode repeatedly events are nothing special and don t add much of anything double bp moonrise summer bbq it s all the same thing just with some nice d cor and one extra meaningless objective like grab a lantern on your way out or do this special generator in particular it s just boring and uninspired the community alone has been the set off for me to finally write a review after 3 years in the beginning the community in the game wasn t that bad the rise of jerks in the game however has scared off many players including me where i ve had to take weeks off just to feel a want to play again and even then it was small the gameplay can t even be enjoyed when killers and survivors alike belittle you post game after playing like a bunch of toxic a holes teammates will work with the killer draw attention to you on purpose to kill you off farm you for points afk or dc on you i get about a dc every 2 3 matches or so or just be a general pain in the ass killers will camp you for the entire 2 minutes you re on a hook and allow no opportunity for rescue hyper focus on one person at a time to kill them off or slug down people to the ground from the get go both ends of the game s spectrum face challenges and toxicity but the reporting system doesn t allow for it the amount of times i ve been told by members of the dbd community it s not a bannable reportable offense is ridiculous why isn t it why is this considered toxic and unjust in any other game you may happen to play but with dbd everyone just throws up their hands and says whatever are the devs doing anything to remedy the issue after 3 years i don t think so i don t want to give this game a bad review despite all of the game s issues i still enjoy playing it i enjoy introducing people to it teaching them having fun with friends or streamers the community however it s absolutely horrendous has only gotten worse with time and proceeds to get even more unbearable i preemptively sympathize to any person that buys or gets gifted the game faces the doodoo community and doesn t want to play anymore i think this is where i uninstall i d say it was a good run but it was okay at best i feel like the metacritic and gamespot reviews for the game say it for me but metacritic pc 71 100ps4 64 100xone 58 100gamespot pc 6 10 i d give it a hearty 6 10sorry to do you dirty after so long dbd but it s about that time,661.1,224.0,31,Not Recommended,"November 8, 2019",Dead by Daylight,"Mawnie

59135,2016 game was absolutely fun the first months of release devs it up through the year by not fixing bug abuses for months and instead adding bullsht survivor updates followed by bullsht killer updates for no reason at all except for catering to new players who enjoy easy and imbalanced games biased killers and biased survivors period players saying camping shouldn t matter as they can finish generators and escape while the killer is camping when that is not the point i don t know why you want to play a game where you hold left click on a generator and spacebar for 5 minutes and then leave there s a reason why altruism and boldness is in the game it s not about escaping it s about gameplay,257.3,369.0,9,Not Recommended,"December 10, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"len

59139,2022 after 600 hours into this game the sad truth is i can not recommend this game to absolutely anyone anymore it took me a minute to understand why am i feeling like this and how to put all of it into words but i will try my best to do so i ve watched streamers and youtubers play this game since pretty much from the day it came out and dreamed of buying it one day that day came last year when i got to try the game on epic for free and decided hell it really is a fun game and bought it on steam and even got all the dlc s i played both sides killers and survivors and maybe a bit more of the last one because i genuinely had fun bloodpoint system was rewarding and maybe just maybe a bit grindy having to get all those perks on every character but i really really enjoyed that because i knew what i was going for and that made me feel like i was playing for a reason then the so called new game improving patch 6 1 2 or whatever hit and ooohhhhh boy did it improve the game nope i ve been around the block once or twice and seen how badly companies mess things up this patch it s bad they changed so many perks it s hard to keep up both killer and survivor side to change the meta they said yet it actually feels the only meta that got changed was that the killers are camping tunneling and slugging players more than ever and oh god the disconnects and letting go on the hooks on the survivor side i ve tried again and again to enjoy either side after the patch but whatever the spark this game had pre patch it doesn t have it anymore i have 600 hours in the game and i can tell you from the bottom of my heart i m maybe mediocre at best or was atleast but i was learning and improving all the time sadly currently only survivors that win are either hardcore dbd fanatics or the killer is probably a bit newbie after the patch solo survivors have a hard time i ve found myself losing around 80 of the matches on the survivors side whilst on the killer side it s maybe 1 every 10 game where all 4 survivors get out why do they get out because they are either full out sweat mode friends talking on discord or i m literally focused on getting one specific guy down and don t want to stop the chase xd i ve had matches where i ve really wanted to camp and tunnel players down but always forgiven and left the hook because it s just not me only reason why i have ever stayed near a hook is because all the survivors are messing around next to it now after the patch even the killer side has gotten really boring i get 4k s without breaking a sweat without bringing any addons to the matches that s how bad it is going through some of the steam reviews you will see players crying how hard it is for killers after the patch honestly they are either trolls or are really bad at playing this game currently killers are stronger than ever before some more some less killers will get atleast 1 survivor if not more down 90 of the time and that 10 they don t can be because the map is really bad for the killer or the survivors are literally living and breathing dbd now let s talk about prestige there is absolutely no point in prestiging a character these days instead of 4x50 levels you had to go through per character before the patch to have max prestige and feeling like yay i was rewarded with atleast a bloodspraid cloth that shows i ve played the game a bit and maybe have earned it then now you have a 100 levels per character together with the killer side you have around 50 if not more playable characters oh and don t forget those are 100x50 levels to get 1 prestige level you got to go through 50 pages of crap oh but surely they increased the bloodpoint amount so it would be faster oh no they didn t you still earn 20k per match maybe a bit more on some matches if you bring a booster but most likely you won t be earning that because if you get a tunneler or a camper or some other deuschei kind of a player you will most likely get less than 10k points and get to waste a booster so if before you wanted to max out all the characters like me then after the patch you will have to spend not thousands of hours but half your life to actually get max levels on everyone currently i ve only seen 1 player in my matches with a 100 prestige level character and i am 80 sure that person was hacking on the community side it s a so so i ve met a lot of amazing people in this game that i am happy to call my new friends and i ve met complete and utter boot lickers you never know who you are going to meet these days i keep meeting less potatoheads in the games mostly noone talks in the chats after the game but when i started playing i really did have to block a few people because they were toxic as hell but to call all the community toxic is a bit far reached i have also seen a lot of people saying there are insane amount of hackers in the game if so then most likely ive been quite lucky not having to had any run ins with them with 600 hours in the game i ve maybe max seen 5 and that number is pretty damn good for an online game now if the game is so bad then how come it has so many positive reviews on steam let s go a bit deeper into that as well let s look for recent reviews with each passing day there s more and more negative reviews that actually try to point out issues with the game and the reasons why players don t like the game anymore whilst the positive reviews 70 seem to be coming from bot accounts that maybe have one sentence in it just to keep the rating up can t be that silly or blind to think that s normal now let s talk about the company bhvr i remember a time when they did things with a heart but these days it feels like an empty shell honestly they are on the same latter with ea and activision they don t give a damn about you as a player and even less so you as a survivor all the dlc s and in game battlepasses have probably costed me around 200 euros or so and today i felt like the only thing it got me was spit it the face with the current state of the game if it would be possible i would instantly ask for a refund and i got a feeling a lot of other players are feeling the same i ve started to notice that in the game as well depending on the time of the day and the side you are playing on you will be sitting in a queue it didn t feel so bad before but now after the patch has been live for almost a month i have started to notice it more what does that mean it means a lot of people have started to quit the game as of date i uninstalled the game myself and won t be reinstalling until they fix what they broke bhvr needs to find the spark again but they don t care they just care about shooting out more promoted killers and survivors to get a few more dollars in from a company doing things with heart and soul to a complete sellout who doesn t give a bit fat f about it s community or playerbase sadly there are still players who think they care and that s really heartbreaking to see conclusion in the current state i will not be recommending this game to anyone the patch removed whatever spark this game had and just isn t fun for neither side the prestige grind is completly pointless currently not enough bloodpoints to too many levels for nothing to gain killers are camping tunneling and slugging more than ever survivors are dcing or fast killing themselves on hooks more than ever and flat out you can see a lot of players quiting dbd completely this game was amazing but got ruined with the latest patch by yet another creedy company,657.2,140.0,17,Not Recommended,"August 21,

59147,2021 very enjoyable both alone and with friends this game was well over worth the money i spent my friends and i have been grinding this game recently and having fun in survivor mode the killer mode is also nice because when they get off i can play a killer game because the queue for it is solo overall great game i think it is also pretty balanced positive 1 anti camp camping is incredibly hard and costs you the game thanks to perks you can run this is great because it deters killers from camping and killing one person at a time the perks are great but since the objective is to fix generators and open the exits and escape being camped is the same thing as looping the killer for that amount of time you are hooked this allows teammates to fix generators quickly and efficiently allowing the exits to open faster i love this part of the game where it denies campers and makes the game fun for everyone for these reasons campers are very rare since they lose a lot in rank and bloodpoints 2 satisfaction of clutch plays this one is from personal experience so it probably differs from person to person but my friends and i get really hype over clutch plays there are plays like cleansing a totem with noed one hit kill perk that can be cleansed aka destroyed to remove it from the killer and unhooking my friend who was getting face camped by a spirit and got the four man escape another would be blocking taking the hit for my friends injured to help them buy time to get to the exit gate simple plays like these are just so satisfying and hype that it keeps you playing over and over 3 the hatch i think that this is one of the more unique and thoughtful addition to the game when you are the last one alive a hatch will open allowing you to escape without opening the exit gates these give the last survivor a chance at escaping without taking their sweet time to open the exits 4 teachables at level 30 on a character you can have perks that can be taught to other characters who originally do not have that perk this allows you to play the character you want to play without having to worry about the perks they have 5 unique perks and characters everyone in the game is unique all survivors and killers have their own perks that you can have this makes the game more interesting and find the character that fits your play style the most for example for killer i like to play the huntress because she has a ranged attack where she throws hatchets i feel that she is someone that i enjoy playing and fits my play style for survivor i like to unhook people which is why i run the perks that help other survivors out like borrowed time anti camp perk we ll make it super fast heal after unhook and botany knowledge also heal fast 6 tutorial bloodpoints are needed to upgrade characters so behaviour interactive adding in 50 000 bloodpoints per tutorial clear was very kind and thoughtful of them for beginning players this helps them upgrade the character before entering a match with one level one perk 7 custom games the mode i have the most fun in are custom games they are the best addition to the game in my opinion i have so much fun with my friends in this game mode although we get no bloodpoints it does not matter because all the perks items add ons and offerings are unlocked you can lock them though in custom game settings it is also nice that you can choose the map that you want to play negative i would say that the bad things are toxic killers who camp or tunnel people out of the game to get an advantage other cons about this game is if the killer goes afk it will give u 0 points in 2 categories leading to 0 rank progress this issue can probably be fixed if survivors get a bonus for escaping in a certain time limit and load times are often really long however these issues do not ruin the game at all as they are not common and are not significantly frustrating another issue might also be how grindy it is bloodwebs have lots of items which will make you take a while to upgrade that character bloodpoints are therefore needed in high quantity aka play many many matches most of the bad parts in this game can be seen in the community not the game s fault people would camp or tunnel leading to a 2 min game and not having any fun especially with the killer cannibal there is a common cannibal basement camp where they go insidious to chainsaw one shot the person rescuing and cutting through borrowed time in conclusion some people in the community will be extremely toxic and u will need to expect some bad games where u get camped tunneled and spectate your friends for the rest of the match other cons camping bubba and midwichother aspects of the game i enjoy are the collaboration dead by daylight had with resident evil leon jill and the nemesis are great additions to the game and i hope to see more collaborations with different games the game anniversary items are also a nice addition to the game the sacrificial cakes anniversary offering that gives 105 more bloodpoints give a significant amount of bloodpoints game currency to upgrade characters this really helps with people who just got the game like me and my friends we are able to level up our characters really fast and progress in the game a lot easier the game is super fun and i totally recommend this to people who are looking for a game to play with friends competitively casually or even both i also think that the dlc is worth it although get it when it goes on sale or your friend has it on library share all the characters are really fun to play all characters are needed to complete all achievements,682.9,43.0,1,Recommended,"July 18, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"Nakinami 泣涙

59176,2022 mostly toxic community unfriendly and bming the game can really be fun at times but most of the times matchmaking is a gamble between having fun and no fun at all meta perks in the top ranks although matchmaking is pretty random i still like the game but i just couldnt recommend this for any beginner,315.3,60.0,8,Not Recommended,"June 6, 2022",Dead by Daylight,"Zwup

59185,2018 patience is a virtue with this game let me start off by saying this is an excellent game but if you are an impatient person or don t like a medium queue time you won t ever play as the killer especially not when events are around or a new killer comes out as we see legion there soon will that said i do really enjoy the game it s the only one i get semi competitive with because it is challenging at times but onto the pros and cons pros unique killers their idle animations attacks etc are tailored to them unique survivors same principle perks a good perk build can make or break your win there s plenty to choose from they re easy to get even the ones unique to killers you really don t have to spend a dime on this game or dlc s the iridescent shards you get for progressing your overall account level stack pretty fast if you hop queues like a madman and well get good at the game lol you can buy the killers or survivors and even their perks unique to them separately granted i m lazy so i still bought the ones i wanted regardless of this lmao i dig the whole level system i really do and the universal sharing of perks once you reach a certain character level it s very useful for customization of your build instead of making due with what you have the maps are pretty decent i don t really mind their layouts i love the fog and spook factor typically very friendly in regards to the community be you farming with the killer or killers like moi being generous and giving you the hatch escape not to mention your fellow survivors rarely do i ever find myself left for dead in the game people take great risks to aid strangers in their lobby it s actually super fun in all honest aesthetics yes i said aesthetics costumes recolors the stuff that the game didn t really need but was given anyways and i am beyond happy with how most of them look i see a lot of criticisms regarding the lack of chat or voice for survivors to communicate with one another but to be frank i feel it s not only aiding the immersion your sense of helplessness and fear but it also keeps it fair for the killer whom is soloing 5 people on a potentially massive map if you re all communicating like champs i for one can attest that it makes it that much more difficult for the killer to get one hit off let alone snag one of you it s balanced don t complain if you want to talk in game utilize discord play with friends but don t take away a critical element of the game to sate your want for an easy win you suffer for tunneling you focus on one person too long or chase just one person you re going to suffer progression wise because they will loop you around and around next thing you know 3 5 gens are done and you re just barely hooking some poor soul with sprint burst the sense of fear and helplessness derived from the sheer thought of being found in the middle of a generator repair or hiding painfully close to the killer is amazing i love it it s scary in the sense of if you re found you re in trouble if you re found 3 times it s more than likely over assuming you are not a palette looping master cons i hate hook campers i m looking at you wraith and pig two killers who can turn off their terror radius with their skills i don t even play survivors that often but when i do and i have to sit through this i can feel my brain deteriorating one cell at a time don t hook camp there is unfortunately no con to this as they still get the kill slightly less bloodpoints at worst completed gens at worst too but you know they still do it anyways granted it s not just those two but admittedly they are the best ones for it the maps as stated are not bad i do enjoy them but be that as it may they all kinda look the same maybe i just don t pay good enough attention but in my humble opinion 5 of them just look like reworks of each other with maybe a couple structures sprinkled in can i please get a pig costume everyone but the characters from actual series franchises has a costume or several and while i understand maybe it s a copyright thing i need a different look please gen rushing this actually tilts the out of me essentially this can consist of several people on one generator or one or several bringing in a brand new part which if you don t know the game makes it go by a lot faster either or end me hex ruin is a good counter for this but without it you re hit or miss for a team like that as a killer skillcheck glitches yeah we ve all had them we all hate them frame rate drops makes the game seriously hard for killers and survivors both hahahahaha good luck getting to rank 1 buddy scratch marks useless they glitch out too much hit the survivor follow the blood trail well assuming you can see it again perks fix this if you want to find them or hell just turn up your volume but still annoying i could do well without the survivor taunts when i don t taunt tunnel or camp them respect your killer while having your fun sucking the fun out of the game defeats the whole purpose of us being there to begin with this goes back to killers too don t face camp don t hook camp don t tunnel just one survivor or wait nearby for them to get unhooked and farm them spread your focus or lose your generators kid dedicated servers should be implemented no offense but i get kinda tired of potato connection from killers and admittedly even mine can be a bit unbearable to be around rubber banding across the map or running in place makes me wanna kill myself thnx overall it s a solid game with a few bugs and issues as most do i enjoy playing it with friends or solo the majority of the time if your complaints revolve around getting palette looped or stunnedmaybe you should uh get good no seriously palette looped play huntress throw axes nurse teleport through walls palettes etc jukes are easy to spot or counter juke if you play long enough flashlight stuns are easily avoided your only bane is dead hard and decisive strike these aren t legitimate complaints and imo even if they aremildly annoying maintain the fairness of the game for the survivors but yes good game 10 10 would recommend happy hunting may the best man

59209,2023 camping and tunneling killers ruined this game beyond everything devs keeps buffing killers and nerfing survs i really regret ever buying anything to this crap of a game this game can sincerely sod off update new anti camp mechanic is in the game so it must be better now right haha no f ing chance new anti camp mechanic is damn joke killer simply walks just a bit further from you and bar is not filling at all or is filling with a speed of snail hit by a car and smashed by f ing meteor and i m not even mentioning how bhvr destroyed one of the best survivor map in the game the decimated borgo is now absolutely atrocious for survs it s way smaller and even slow ass killer like nurse can without blink cross the map in matter of seconds and good luck against legion or other fast killers my friend hated rpd from bottom of his soul and now he rather play that then borgo if that doesn t mean something i don t know that does bhvr keeps on buffing killers and letting the pooshower rain on survs and then there are the glorious hitboxes where killer can still hit you 10 meters away from a window pallet after you vaulted,330.7,18.0,3,Not Recommended,"September 24, 2023",Dead by Daylight,𝕿𝖗𝖎𝖇𝖆𝖑 𝕮𝖍𝖎𝖊𝖋,False

59213,2018 disclaimer this review is innaccurate and 4 years oldalthough i enjoy this game a lot i can not reccomend this to new players for multiple reasons which will be covered in this review however let me first cover how this game worksas a survivor you team up with 3 others either randoms or as a premade team of friends named swf once in a game aka match survivors will have to do five generators shortened to gens then open the exit gates to escape and live another day in the nightmare of the entity s realmas a killer you host a lobby and have 4 survivors join to start a match once in a match you will have to kill all 4 survivors by crippling them aka downing with your weapon picking them up and putting them on a sacrificial hook you must make sure no survivors escape to please your literal god master the entity 1 toxcicitythis fanbase is extremely toxic securing a kill as a killer referred to as camping and tunneling will get some tasty rep s and comments on your profile just check out mine people are very toxic in endgame chat especially if you are the killer this is one of the main reasons that if you aren t thick skinned you shouldn t buy this game looking back at this in 12 31 2020 funny how nothing has changed though this has reduced greatly over time no more death threats at least 2 killer gameplayyou d think that killers would be the powerful and have control in the game but that s far from true to sum it up the time it takes to complete a generator is very short when compared to how long a chase takes furtherly it takes very long for many killers to move around the map meaning that you often come to a generator and it gets finished in front of your face many weaker killers do not have enough time to catch and kill survivors this all combined makes playing any killer except the hillbilly nurse and hag the three best killers in the game a chore and even as the two best killers you need to spend hundreds of hours mastering them unless you want to be bullied by the survivors the worst thing here is the swf i mentioned before combining the amount of time pallets can waste along with perfectly communicating where you are what perks you are using and what killer you are it s very painful edit this list has now been updated hillbilly got nerfed somewhat hard and nurse as well if i remember correctly nurse hag and spirit are now the best 3 killers and most killer are at least somewhat viable just don t play the very bad ones if you wann have fun 3 survivor gameplayplaying survivor however without swf or the perks i mentioned earlier perks are things you can equip on your character which give you special abilities like 150 faster movement speed for 3 seconds playing survivor is a chore too since the killer has perks which makes finding you easier and since stealth is very hard to pull of because of how maps are designed you have to pallet loop going pallet to pallet to waste as much time as possible while your teammates hopefully do gens if you re not being chased you have to hold down m1 for 80 seconds to complete a generator boring if the killer doesn t give up on you downs you and the exit gates are open then you re basically dead unless you re teammates decide to come for you and have the perk borrowed time until you level up all your survivors to get the perks or play with swf and communication devices like discord the game will not be the most fun edit you now start with your characters perks and finishing the tutorial gives you enough bloodpoints to level up a bit furtherly your teammates will often have 3 braincells unhooking you infront of the killer reffered to as farming is quite common if your teammates can t loop you might have to take the agression yourself so you don t have a 1v1 on your hands or do two gens and hope for hatch game 5 the devsit feels like they don t listen they just nerfed a balanced perk named bbq and chilli which was often used on killers this perk incentivized leaving the hook after you hook a survivor meaning that less people camped so that the game was more fun on both side it feels like they don t play their own game as they ve released multiple trash killers clown legion along with their perks being horrible 6 the legionwowie a new killer the legion guess what he s trash he has a lower base movement speed and his ability forces him to hit a survivor 4 times to down them he has nearly no chase even clown without addons would be better than him his design is generic his special perks are trash it feels like he was extremely rush and instead of buffing him by making a currently meta very good perk work better on him they opted to nerf another weak killer doctor instead by making said meta perk no longer work on him 7 the hatchi ve forgotten to include this in my original review but i might as well add it now after two gens have been done and three survivors have been killed the hatch will spawn and open a survivor can jump into the hatch to escape but while jumping he or she can be grabbed and put onto the killer s shoulder if both sides come to the hatch at the same time or the killer finds it first the killer and survivor will be forced to stare at eachother if they want to win as acting hitting the survivor or jumping in will result in the loss for the side acting this can lead to hatch stand offs lasting between 5 minutes to an hour it s boring and has been a problem since the game started and it still hasn t been fixed this has been fixed in a satisfactory manor and this is no longer an issue8 to sum it upthis game can be very fun if you are playing with friends especially in kyf kill your friends however playing killer without the strongest perks and the best killers is a chore and really unfun unless you re playing with brain dead survivors playing survivor without the strongest perks is okay ish but nothing special due to the ease in survival don t buy it for now but keep a close eye for the next few updates i said this like 6 months ago lmao edit 9 finally re updated the review again removed and added a few points revised others i recommend this game if you have friends to play it

59234,2018 what is dead by daylight most similar to dead by daylight is most similar to friday 13th with some differences such as that dead by daylights maps are all procedurally generated for each match there s more survivors in one match in friday 13th and friday 13th only have one killer but with different weapons dead by daylight is also quite similar to deathgarden from the same developer it features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate kill runners dead by daylight is however the best game in the genre right now gameplaya simplistic way to describe dead by daylight would be to say that it s a cat mouse game you either play as the killer and try to stop the victims from escaping or you play as one out of 4 survivors trying to escape when playing a survivor you need to repair a certain amount of generators in order to power up the mechanism that unlocks the exit once all the generators are powered up you need to flip the switch that opens the exit escape apart from activating the generators there s also the obvious goal of surviving and trying to save the other survivors if they ve been caught on a hook your chances of winning are greatly enhanced while all of you are alive when playing as the killer you try to incapacitate the victims so that you can lift them up and put them on a hook the goal is to sacrifice them to feed to the entity the entity is some sort of demonic force in the game while one victim is on the hook the remaining victims still run around trying to repair the generators so your best course of action is to try and chase them down and hook them as well when the match is over your performance is graded and you re handed a certain amount of bloodpoints that you can spend on new gadgets offerings and abilities for a killer or survivor of your choice killers survivors itemsyou have a lot of options when it comes to selecting your killer or survivor there s currently 13 killers and 14 suvivors each one with its own unique set of skills and abilities on top of that there are a lot of gadgets offerings gadgets help you in some way as a tool and often has a limited amount of uses offerings change how things will be played in the match they could add thicker fog seperate survivor players or enable the killer to insta kill survivors rather than having to hook them for example in combination with the map system it really mixes things up and makes matches feel fresh rather than the same thing repeating over and over again difficulty imbalancethe matchmaking is generally pretty good and the difficulty obviously varies depending on the skill of your opponents relative to your personal skill it is however my firm belief that this game was never meant to be played with friends over voip as the killer there is a huge difference in difficulty when you compare playing against a pre made group of 4 victims with playing against a group of 4 randomly matched victims in dead by daylight there is no in game chat or voip so whenever you play solo survivor you will not be able to communicate with the other survivors if you play as a group you can communicate with the other survivors in a 3rd party voip software this obviously gives the survivor team a huge buff since they can tell eachother where the killer is or what he s up to it really feels imbalanced when i run into pre made groups as the killer it makes me wonder why the developers did not adress it by giving randomly matched survivors a way of communicating buffing the killers to balance it out i ve seen many other players that main killer say that they evade pre made groups because of this aside from that some killers feel a lot weaker than others but it s hard to say for sure since it could all come down to playstyle you never know what the new meta could be mapsthe map theme is randomly chosen then the map itself is procedurally generated at the start of the match and each map is more or less advantagious depending on what survivor or killer you re playing there s plenty of themes it works well and keeps the game fresh no complaints at all serversthe servers are p2p that is an issue that cause several problems the killer is always the host of the session and since it s a p2p architecture that means that his machine holds all the information about the ongoing match it means that the game is suseptible to lagswitches cheats and even simple things such as the killer disconnecting if the killer disconnects using alt f4 all of the survivors lose their gadgets and offerings because the p2p server is no longer available to tell the main server what items they retrieved or used in the match behaviour gave their new ip deathgarden dedicated servers and i hope they do the same thing for dead by daylight sooner rather than later with that said it s rare to run into cheating killers or laggy matches it works well for the most part toxicitytoxicity is arguably one of the greatest problems with dead by daylight the post lobby chat that pops up only serves as a punching bag for the frustrated players that feel like they ve been wronged in one way or another if you do not engage in the chat you will often recieve messages on your steam profile from angry players who feel like you did something cheesy this happens very often no matter how you play the game i dont really know how they could solve the issue but the chat should be removed completely from the post lobby it serves no purpose but to give other players abuse some way of encouraging other players would be a step in the right direction as well perhaps a tip button of some sort i dont know but they really need to do something to lighten the mood enforce punishments on players that take it too far verdictit s the best game you can get if you re looking for

59238,2020 great asymmetrical game fun cat and mouse game built upon character based perks worst problem with the game which ruins the experience is the community as you get into the higher ranks which is basically synonymous with the more you play the more the players become toxic gameplay and attitude wise i highly suggest this game for an occasional play but the more you play the more you ll come to be dissatisfied with your experience best bet is to grab 4 other friends and have a good hide and seek game with them to avoid all the toxicity,434.4,70.0,8,Not Recommended,"May 12, 2020",Dead by Daylight,RavenFry,False

59247,2019 two survivours sacrificed already one dying on the hook and one wounded just another evening on yamoka estate classic japanese mansion in the middle of overgrown garden i just lost the wounded survivor i was chasing but that was okay i knew exactly he was going to rescue the hooked one i threw a hatchet just right juicy splash sound and scream told me i just got another four kills round just pick up the downed survivor hook him and prepare for post game chat dead by daylight follows a scheme of typical horror group of friends try to escape a killer here we have four survivors and trying to fix 5 generators to power up gates that allow them to escape killer on the other had does what killers do damages generators hunts survivors and places them on sacrificial hooks while it sounds simple maybe even kinda boring sometimes i catch myself wondering why i have fun watching progress bar of the generator couple of thousand players every day gotta mean something currently there are 15 killers available in game from wraith with his invisibility through hatchet throwing huntress to ever stalking shape killers differ between themselves by their powers in addition to perks later and as such it requires different playstyle when playing as chainsaw running hillbilly and different when playing as blinking nurse killers also have power addons they can use up to two of them each trail with different effects depending on rarity for example huntress can use addons that increase her speed when preparing to throw a hatchet carry more hatchers inflict various status effects on hit survivors or simply down them upon successful throw although this decreases amount of carried hatchets by 4 where default is 5 survivors have to outsmart or outrun later the killer fix generators and finally open exit gates to survive the trial they don t differ that much between themselves other than looks or names they are defined by three personal perks that with progression can be unlocked for other survivors therefore i kinda see survivor selection as purely cosmetic to some degree additionally they can bring to the trial or find them in chests scattered around the map items that can help them win such as medkits to heal themselves or the others survivors have 3 health states healthy wounded and dying toolboxes to speed up generator fixes or temporalily destroying hooks flashlights to blind killers for a few seconds and so on just like killers powers those items can have addons attached which increase their effectiveness or duration of use every action provides players with bloodpoints which are later used for character or characters bloodpoints are collected per account not per character progression this takes place on the bloodweb where each character is offered a few randomly generated nodes containing items item power addons perks or offerings each completed bloodweb on given character increases their level unlocks perk slots at 5th 10th and 15th level and gradually increases the bloodweb size up to level 50th which allows to increase perstiege level on that character in return for prestiege cosmetic set element perks give character special active or passive abilities which make some game aspects easier or harder for opponent both killers and survivors have their own shared pool of perks and each character has 3 unique to them perks that is until levels 30 35 and 40 of bloodweb where they can unlock them to be found by other killers survivors each character can have up to 4 perks active at the same time and i have to say it s kinda fun to think of builds to use even though there are some meta perks for both sides last type of unlockables the offerings offer bonuses to the players for example you can get 50 75 100 more bloodpoints in given category objective survival altruism and boldness for survivors hunting deviousness brutality and sacrifice for killers increase your or every survivors luck by few percent increase bloodpoints gained in all categories by 25 or 100 for either you or all players in the game some of them influence map layouts or visibility by for example increasing decreasing amount of chests with items spawning on the map increasing decreasing distance between hooks or thickening or lessening the mist killers can also get mori offerings that allow them to either kill the last survivor by their hand kill one survivor that was hooked at least once or kill any survivor that was hooked at least once if you are wondering what to start learning first nurses blinks distracting killers ect i d say develop thick skin first because the community can be the worst part of the game there are plenty of ways players can be asses to each other t bagging survivors killers standing next to hooked player to prevent his teammates from rescuing him ect truth is both sides have their own made up sets of rules and as such survivors can blame killer for camping even if it was another survivor trying to loop killer near the hook killers are slightly faster than survivors so any straight chase in the open has only one ending survivors on the other hand have map elements to help negate killers speed such as vaulting through the windows dropping pallets ect this is called looping using map to distract or escape killer or by simply checking area around the hook before leaving to find others another common rule is tunnelling if the killer finds freshly off the hook survivor and his rescuer survivors are mad when killer goes after already wounded player common sense really enemy you have to hit once to down him vs enemy you have to hit twice or calling killers off for using overpowered perks such as earlier mentioned noed or hex ruin which slows generator fixing process like come on there are just 5 totems spawning on each map and these are in game for a reason killers are no better they tend to get mad for gen rushing survivors focusing on quickly completing generators usually when one of the survivors is a distraction for the killer i did mention that generators are the only thing survivors have to do yeah i did blame survivors for doing their jobs they also get mad for looping overpowered survivor perks or for bringing flashlights but the most common reason for killers going toxic on survivors are swf groups players grouping up with their friends usually with some communication app apart from 2 hand gestures there is no in game communication which gives them some coordination advantage i ll just add that it s a good idea to play as both killers and survivors learning strengths of the enemy can definitely help i havent really ran into any major bugs so far 130hrs there is a ranking system kinda broken as it requires tremendous amount of work to progress and i m kinda reaching the limit here i had fun for over 100 hours there is still plenty to unlock microtransaction system deserves commendation you can unlock most dlc characters can be unlocked with in game currency iridescent shards for profile leveling or just their perks on weekly changing shrine of secrets 4 random perks per week 2 for survivors 2 for killers premium currency only for

59257,2021 they made it so pinhead can t come anymore please change back thanks edit they gave him his voice back but took bubbas black face away still bad game this game is a bully simulator for adults and probably kids who got bullied in school so they play survivor and at any chance of outplay will try and put you down it s one of the most horribly balanced games i have ever played topped with the most toxic community of people to ever come together i play dota 2 regularly and would only get a few hate comments on my profile from time to time if you want to play dbd you have to make it so non friends can t comment or every entitled man child will leave as much graffiti on your profile as a school bathroom this game at its core at the top of meta perks and killers is incredibly un fun and boring and the devs don t care because they balance the game around fresh installs to reel them in in hopes of getting them to spend their lunch money on cosmetics only for them to find their hard work time and effort in learning the game has turned it into a stressful micromanaging rat race to see who cries in the end game chat first about something someone did trying to win if this game didn t have a population of people with the mentality of teenagers who cry any time someone doesn t play by their rules that don t exist in the game it would just be a hard grindy game where you get a worse experience the longer you play it as killer at higher mmr you just don t get to play the game unless you camp and tunnel people out of the game or you are nurse or blight as survivor you will only end up going against those two and both sides will run the same handful of perks out of the dozens of useless ones,783.5,42.0,13,Not Recommended,"October 2, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"RedNeckMatt

59289,2021 i try really hard to enjoy this game i genuinely want to like it because of the unique 4v1 gameplay and horror theming but every single time i finish playing the game does nothing but leave me in a terrible mood the gameplay loop is very repetitive but it works out for a few hundred hours dedicated players could easily sink thousands of hours into the game with advanced playstyles and fancy techs but that s about the only positive thing i can say about the game every other aspect of the gameplay falls completely flat the grind is absolutely horrendous to the point you re going to be wishing for gamebreaking bugs just so the devs give you free bloodpoints the game s currency as compensation it s so abysmally tedious to even just level up one single character with the perks you want to the point it took me 20 hours just to get 2 of the perks i wanted to use many gameplay mechanics are never explained and extremely unintuitive the game makes almost no effort in teaching new players how to play well and instead often encourages bad gameplay habits if you want to learn the game you will have to rely on external resources just to cover all the basics the game is insanely unintuitive for new players the learning curve is extremely steep not only do you need to learn the basics of playing as a survivor which the game s tutorial barely covers but you need to learn about every single killer their perks their add ons and their mechanics on top of trying to figure out how your own perks work with 26 different killers each having 3 perks of their own alongside a dozen add ons each you are going to be overwhelmed and confused for most of your first games and since most killers are locked behind paywalls you won t be able to play them yourself to get a better understanding unless you pay more money while there are a lot of community made resources to help learn the game faster you re going to spend more time trying to read those guides and watching those videos than actually playing the game if you go with that route combine all of this with the complete lack of a training mode the aforementioned lackluster tutorial and the only gamemode being online pvp with an mmr system that doesn t even work and you ve got a recipe for a game that is extremely unfriendly for beginners an frustrating to learn speaking of the mmr system it doesn t even work what is supposed to create balanced lobbies instead looks more like completely random pickings you could get paired up with survivors who have thousands of hours against a killer who just started or you might end up with teammates who have barely started playing going up against a killer with thousands of hours of experience the matchmaking might as well be completely random because it has no semblance of balance whatsoever and it results in most rounds being a completely one sided stomp the game s performance is also pretty terrible being extremely poorly optimized and even having performance issues such as severe fps drops and stutters for something as minimal as mouse interpolation being set to a high value the game only seems to support 500 and lower the default fps cap is also only a measly 60fps this can be raised to 120 with some file changes but most of the time you ll be struggling to reach that even with a decent pc all of this doesn t even touch on the community yet while a handful of players are laid back and just trying to have fun a lot of people in this game seem to make it their sole purpose in life to be as condescending and toxic as possible all while maintaining an inflated ego bigger than the burj khalifa if you thought lol or cs go were bad dbd is going to give you a terminal disease with it s levels of toxicity everything bad that happens is always the opponent s fault and everyone always knows better than anyone else what changes the game needs survivors are constantly whining about killers and killers are constantly whining about survivors the incessant crying over the most menial things is all you will hear in the community hubs along with perpetual trash talking of the dev studio on top of that trolls and griefers are abundant and they will find a way to screw over you and your team at any given opportunity all in all the game might look cool and fun with lots of content and i did enjoy playing it when i was queued up with friends but i cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone who s looking to have a fun time on their own because dbd does everything in it s might to ruin your experience at every turn unless you have 3 4 friends to consistently play with dead by daylight is not worth your money,241.3,53.0,6,Not Recommended,"December 27, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"JAiZ

59302,2022 dead by daylight is an asymmetrical 4v1 pvp game based on classic horror movie tropes it is also an absolute time consuming grind survivors must complete generators and escape killers must prevent them killers vary widely with their abilities and perks survivors are solely reliant on their perks and items they play much the same as each other there are no other game modes than this there are three in game currencies bloodpoints character survivors and killers progression iridescent shards player progression auric cells purchased with real money as well as purchasable dlc the base game includes 5 killers and 5 survivors with 30 survivors and 27 killers total as of march 2022 additional characters must be purchased via dlc or the in game store with auric cells 500 iridescent shards 9000 or if you re feeling a bit devious family share unlocks dlc three perks per character are locked behind their respective dlc also bloodpoints are the gameplay currency which are used in the bloodweb every character has their own bloodweb it is used to unlock and level up perks unlock items and add ons level each character max 50 option to prestige three times resetting the characters level and items for a chance at supposedly better items and perks perks must be levelled three times to have maximum effectiveness and they also have to be unlocked on their original character before you can potentially find it in another character s bloodweb at approximately 150 hours i have roughly eight characters max level and 30 000 iridescent shards or enough to purchase three more characters much like the rest of the game the season pass the rift is also extremely grindy and split into two parts the free part with sparse rewards and the part you pay for with 1000 auric cells you do get those cells back if provided you complete the pass but it still requires you to have a lot of time and dedication tomes alleviate some of that grind they also encourage different game styles and provide challenges but some of the tasks are still grindy matchmaking is broken and the game will reward selfish play over skilled play toxicity and saltiness is very high within the player base also the developers are extremely out of touch and do not listen to the community nor criticism so be prepared for that if you still genuinely want to give this game a try i want people to understand that i do shockingly enjoy this game it s fun a little bit addictive intense and at times genuinely terrifying playing with friends in custom matches is hilarious i cannot however recommend something with so much content locked behind a grind and paywalls let alone the other issues with the game final notes i wish there was more map variety you cannot acquire content from stranger things anymore but the perks are available in base game now other ips will likely disappear too there are items in the bloodweb that are almost literally useless it runs on spaghetti code and has the strangest bugs the seasonal events are great,483.8,19.0,0,Not Recommended,"March 22, 2022",Dead by Daylight,"Ghostie

59316,2016 let me start off this review with stating that i love the game this game is absolutely bananas it s so much fun and the gameplay gets your adrenaline pumping but most of the fun it could be offering is being taken away from us more on that later the gameplay as the killer as you re stalking your prey and looking out for the survivors knowing they re not able to defend themselves is like childs play after finally spotting your prey and chasing them as the survivor helplessly tries to get away from you makes you feel like a real psychopath after catching your prey you can either grab your prey over your shoulder and take the survivor to your dungeon and hang him up on a meathook or leave him suffering there on the ground and use him as bait taunt and scare your prey if you re playing as the hillybilly by revving up your chainsaw to help your prey get rid of constipation spook your enemies to the death whilst playing as the wraith by uncloaking yourself and gong your bell lay traps near objectives as the trapper so you can wait in the bushes for them to step on them and then either waiting for others to help the helpless pray you ve just caught or just hang him on a meathook it s your choice after either killing all of your prey or letting some of them escape you re rewarded with points to upgrade your power and investing points into your skilltree gives you the feeling of accomplishment as a survivor you re trying to work on the objectives at the same time as you re trying to keep one eye open for the killer getting spotted by the killer and being chased through the scary and atmospheric environments is just nothing but scary helping your friends out of trouble whilst risking your own life at the same time makes you feel like a hero and scavenging for anything to help you survive is breathtaking whilst completed the required objectives to get the go ahead and open up the gates to escape the horrors and running out of the playground of the killer feels rewarding investing points you ve gained throughout your adventures of either misfortune or success to your skilltree makes you feel accomplished the problems too bad you can t get the satisfaction this game offers to you of the last points that i mentioned from neither from the killer s perspective or the survivor s because you can only play this game with friends in a private game which doesn t offer you any experience points or the chance to progress your characters which is the only reason i dislike this game the developers must include a party option to this game so you can make a lobby for your friends to queue up for a ranked game as survivors not one being the killer and the rest as survivors that d be cheating if the devs consider queing up with your friends in the same team cheating they ve got to be joking the only logical reason this wasn t implemented to the game must ve been because they could inform their friends where the killer is via 3 party program there are no any other ways to communicate with other survivors in the game they need to add a proximity voice chat so anyone can hear your voice if they re in your proximity the killer included great alternative for this would a voiceline wheel with restrictions e g not being able to use voiceline wheel when stuck in a meathook having the killer also hear these voicelines if he s close enough to the survivors making this option very fair the conclusion the only reason keeping me from recommending this game for you your friends is the reason stated above if they decide to update the game and allow us to queue up with friends as survivors into a same game where you could make progress with your character then i would recommend this game for you missing on an important game mechanic of improving your character being taken away from and punishing you for playing the game with your friends is absurd and very bad game design i only recommend this game to you if you re planning on playing alone with randoms to get the most out of the game if played with friends is to wait for the devs to release the party queue,264.2,410.0,18,Not Recommended,"June 15, 2016",Dead by Daylight,Tindels,False

59357,2018 introductioni am a total slasher movie nut my favourite character from the genre jason voorhes the protagonist of friday the 13th got an awful game to my great sadness i wanted to like it i really did but no luck so i picked my dignity up from the floors of the playstation store and went back to good ole dead by daylight it is a game i ve always been delighted to play albeit it getting quite repetitive after some time if you play survivor or after you master your playable killers if you main said role i have to admit there have been periods of time when it was just gathering dust in my library but once i bought my first dlc there was no going back the entity had pulled me in the elephant in the roombefore i start judging the actual gameplay i need to adress the thing that most of you might be looking at when opening the game s store page the dlc why so much does it even help isn t it overpriced to be very brief this game is amazing even without any dlc first of all you can do great in the game without spending a single dime on the so called chapters since atm of writing this the strongest killer is the nurse which is integrated in the vanilla character pool and any survivor can do well in any tier so a chapter gives you a new killer and a new survivor 1 each survivor comes with 3 specific starting perks see the gameplay section which can be taught to other survivors by leveling them up until the perk becomes teachable and will appear in the bloodweb of others or you can purchase the perk directly with iridescent shards the currency you earn for leveling up your account if it appears in the shrine of secrets a part of the store with 4 perks which refreshes every week killer perks also available cool right reason nr 1 you don t have to buy any dlc 2 each killer and survivor that isn t licensed from a movie e g leatherface freddy etc can be purchased from the in game store for iridescent shards you can basically earn any content in the game that isn t licensed without spending real money that also means the you can get the licensed characters perks but once you put enough hours in the game you will want by yourself to purchase some dlc after all supporting devs is great gameplaythe premise is simple 5 players 1 killer 4 survivors either escape as a survivor or kill all the survivors as a killer a killer has a basic attack a lunge holding down the attack button will result in a longer range but proportionally higher exhaust time and a special ability if you miss the attack you get an exhaustion time in which you look down for a bit and become slower giving the survivor a very brief escape window the exhaustion applies on landed attacks as well but that time it s bigger the special ability is different from killer to killer and can manifest itself in a variety of ways such as placing bear traps teleporting throwing hatchets and much much more survivors are all the same gameplay wise having no special ability thus only being affected by the various perks in game and by the item they go into the trial match with perks buff certain actions see the killer s outline on the map for a certain amount of time when they break a pallet or can act as a double edged sword buffing a certain aspect but also having some sort of side effect a sprint at 150 of your speed for a certain amount of time but leaving you exhausted for a time items are common things such as toolboxes medkits or flashlights which break over time with usage and which are lost if you are killed in a match but fret not you ll get more than your fair share of items each item and perk has a rarity grade indicating their efectiveness survivors have to repair 5 generators repair speed which can be increased by using a toolbox and open the exit gates of the killer s hunting grounds to win the game the killer has to use sacrificial hooks to get survivors out of the game for good one hit injures the survivor making them grunt and leave trails of blood and 2 puts them in a dying state at which point they can be picked up and carried to an aforementioned hook during this time survivors can wiggle in a last attemp to escape the killer s grasp if they are put on a hook they can be released by a fellow teammate or if their time expires they die you can also attemp to escape on your own at the price of shortening the sacrifice time each time a survivor is put on the hook again the sacrifice advances to a point in which they will be instantly killed if it is their 3rd time on a hook at maximum the survivor can also evade a killer by stunning them with a pallet if dropped straight on them placed very conveniently all across the map for your convenience you can vault over the pallet but the killer needs to either consume precious time by breaking it or choosing an alternate route the maps also offer a variety of windows you can vault over and ledges you can drop from of course there are millions of strategies like tunneling rushing the generators stealth pallet looping and so on some of which are considered toxic see the community section but you will discover everything on your own once you get playing the systemsremember when i said that you ll get plenty of items well that is all thanks to the bloodweb the character progression system after a match you will get a certain amount of blood points based on your actions regardless of the match result the blood points are universal and you can spend them for any character be it a killer or survivor which makes playing with your main in order to level up another character a good pasttime the bloodweb offers various items item add ons you can start the trial with max 2 add ons on the item of your choice which buff the item s effects or could as well have side effects just like perks and perks because there are also a good amount of universal perks which you can capture in the bloodweb and level up a max 3 times depending on how many times you invested blood points in them killers and survivors also have ranks which are shared among all killers survivors you are ranked from 20 to 1 1 being the best rank depending on how well you do in games finally there is the general player level which rewards you with the iridescent shards i mentioned above for every level earned this might sound a bit complicated but believe me once you see it in game it all becomes clear as day i apologize for my poor explanation skills but i hope i managed to make you curious at least about the game now onto a more subjective matter communityeach game has toxic tryhards but at least the lower ranks provide a safe haven from them in dbd to make a long story short killer mains accuse survivors of being toxic because of them using valid strategies for winning and vice versa some survivors are indeed toxic teabagging at the exit just as some killers are camping a hook this is why some players derank on purpose to taste the good side of the game again the matchmaking can also be a bit dumb regarding this matter since every now and then you will get matched with someone 5 ranks lower or higher than you that s just how life is i guess but as long as you remember that you play for fun you should be all good conclusiondead by daylight is the best assymetrical multiplayer game the market has to offer right now it has a great slasher theme combined with supernatural elements at times you need not spend anything on dlc but you will once you see that the game deserves it with an easy to learn hard to master curve dbd proves to be great fun wether with friends or alone,253.0,17.0,1,Recommended,"October 21, 2018",Dead by Daylight,"TrapGod

59365,2021 the game itself is very fun and addictive for some reason though the player base is 60 mentally ill people there is going to be times where the killer is going to get you down and just wait for you to die in that way and they do it so professionally it s crazy how many times they did that there are going to be times where the killer is going to camp there are going to be times where your team doesn t save you from hooks and there are so many bad things in the player base but still the game is so fun and i love it update oh boy how innocent was i while typing this review i thought the survivors were pure human beings trying to survive the death trying to live but i was wrong the real devils are the survivors in this game you have no idea how evil these pure looking creatures are in the story they are the ones being haunted you would think that this is true until you play killer for a while you are not hunting them they are hunting you these disgusting devils will taunt the out of you at every second they possibly can they will wait minutes in the exit gate just to press ctrl and taunt you they will use lag hacks just to annoy the out of you in my 20 hours killer experience i have understood that the killers are more innocent than the survivors,303.8,27.0,15,Recommended,"March 22, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"gangsta825

59384,2016 product received for free the atmosphere of the game is really good i easily get thrilled when i m alone fixing the generator because i don t have other teammate to be a bait xd also the killer can see all the generators you are repairing when you explode it so you should becareful on the meter it will notify the killer also repair meter will decrease it s hard to survive when you are the last survivor left but there is a chance you can survive if you are using a good perk so you can juke the killer except for the professional killers who knows your moves and also uses a good perk you can also escape in the hidden hatchet even thou you didn t finish fixing all the generator but you need atleast to fix 2 generator so it will open i never tried being a killer in this game because no one joins my lobby due to internet sucks so i usually play as a survivor even thou you play as a survivor you get lag because you enter a random lobby sometimes the game is lag sometimes it s smooth it would be better if you play with your friends creating your own lobby since in alpha version there are still same bugs i still encounter in game hope they fixs the problems in this game,287.3,17.0,3,Recommended,"July 16, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"「Desu Desu」

59394,2017 i dont have enough words to explain my feeling about this game having owned dbd since launch and have played it religiously for about the first year of its release and having stopped playing it a few months ago i have only just decided to write my final opinion on the game i love and hate the game got to the point where it was more of a chore to play it rather than pleasure and i ll tell you why my experience at the game having acheived rank 1 every season rank reset on killer during the time a played this game i have seen what the game is like at all levels of play having gotten my first rank 1 placement less than a month after release initial release when the game first released and having mained the killer since i can honestly say that was the most fun i have every gotten out of a game in a long time chasing down your first survivor was absolutly thrilling hooking them and thenm ultimately sacrificing them back when the game did have the many bugs killers being trapped in walls having them magicly tp out of the map and unable to re enter and it extreamly dumb features inifinutes if i had a chance to play during that time again i would with out hesitation first dlc at this point i was still in love with the game but looking back at it now this was the starting point of a very steep hill that the game is about to go down the nurse most survivor will say the nurse was op and she was during her initial release and i do agree with the reduced amount of blinks what i really want to talk about though is what was to come of the game after survivor perks this was the starting point of the well known debate about survivor perks and how broken they are and yes they are completly broken d strike was the start of it me personaly i didnt have any problem with this perk i thought it was fine giving them a one time only ability to jump of the killer s shoulder i dont know what the devs where thinking but from the point of bill being released and his perks up untill now they have given the survivor so many invunrability dead hard borrowed time insta heals and combo that with the amount of speed boosts sprint burst lithe balanced landing not to forget about the much loved flashlights in the game it makes hooking someone virtualy imposible if you have someone with a flashlight and knows how even if you managed to get though all of the perks they have to offer you still get cucked by someone with a flashlight killer nerfs this was the nail in the coffin for me not only do they release all these broken perks for the survivor they pour salt on the wound by nerfing the majority of the killers such as the increase trap setting time and wider spawn locations for them and not forget the fact that you can no longer place traps and hooked survivor s feet billy got reduduced travel speed during his chainsaw aswell and the extreamly poor hit box with it that is thinner than a peice of of paper the ability to crouch walk over the hag s traps to aviod triggering them aswell as the game breaking killer that was the doctor pre rework who was just all out useless speaking of uselss killers lets remind out selves of the worst killer of them all and the killer i mained the wraith this poor fella has been shown absolutly no love what so ever it took the devs over a year to finaly change him note i am aware of the community poll where the doc was voted to have the next rework and wraith came second not only did u can to work around all the during the chase such as perks and a stupid amount of pallets and pallet looping you had to work with an absolutly useless ability which hindered you in most cases where the slow during the entire animation of his unclocking quite literaly gave the survivor enought reaction time as if a killer had just walked into the killer terror radious current version i still have hope for this game after all this we killers have been given i still have hope and what the devs are doing recently with killer reworks i am happy to say that they are moving in the right direction they finaly have stopped listening to the survivor s only and realise that the killers need some love to the community one of the worst communities i have ever been part of and play league of legends that says something who would when given the chance slaughter each other without hesitation who constatly and whine about the game with every survivor main constantly tea bagging you when ever they put a pallet down in front of you they just have to let the killer know that they are better than them by running to a pallet and putting it down overall i know at the start this held a review format but soon led to a bit of a rant but its beacsue i still have a pasion for the game and i am sad to have to let it go as i stated at the start its become a chore for me to play this game now its nothing to how it was if i was to compile all my experiences and opinions about dbd im afraid i would say i do not recommend

59395,2018 tl dr this game is not perfect very far from it however i ve had too much fun not to recommend it so much needs fixing such as the emblem system and broken animations but this game is good and the devs keep it fresh with updates and dlc main review deep down there is a part of me that wants to downvote this due to many reasons such as a poor ranking system that does not reward you well for how you play it rewards you for the way the devs want you to play you must be chased and escape you must heal and unhook and you must do generators and escape the trial i like the concept of being a team player and i tend to do all of the above but some games you can t some games you get chased the whole time and never do generators but you ve been a great distraction or someone else unhooks and heals before you can get there because you were doing the objective yet you will never rank up because you did not play the perfect game you did not check all of the boxes playing as killer is a chore as you get flashed teabagged and looped as a new player and its just not fun however this is all i ve known as i came after the new emblem system update and i ve had fun i don t really play killer so survivor is my main lol i ve had some awesome surivivors that have played well and played as a team i ve had awesome killers and everyone played the game the way the game should be played i ve had some funny moments despite it being bugged when i think of this game i think of those moments where 4 people have disconnected and the killer took me to hatches etc sure thats not the way it should be but its moments like that i remember i rememeber this over the game default selecting dwight so i had to play a level 1 dwight with no perks or where i get a pig mask but the boxes were bugged out of the map so i died honestly its one of those games where i turn a blind eye at the faults and laugh at how simply fun this game really is from the mostly greatly designed maps to the well thought out killers deep leveling system with amazing perks and add ons the sounds that make you shiver and the fun you have with almost all of the games i can recommend it just purely for these reasons sure i don t have many hours compared to most yes i joined the game late and yes i still don t know everything to know about this game yet i m enjoying it and will put way more hours into this good game again its not great or near perfect but i keep coming back to it,525.8,61.0,5,Recommended,"May 21, 2018",Dead by Daylight,SleepyNosku,False

59413,2017 i m at the point where i am doubting i ll ever open this piece of game again i ve played for 145 hours i really enjoyed the game at some point but it s just insanely cancer here s why the ranking systemthere is literally no way for you to play a new character that you haven t tried before without ruining your rank that you ve slowly built up with the killer survivor you re used to that s because the game uses the same rank for all the killers you play and for all the survivors as well there isn t a single game mode where you play against strangers and you re not ranked there s no casual mode or anything like that if you dare to try a new character when you re anywhere below level 20 you re gonna throw your mouse against the wall the survivors will troll the out of you will use insanely strong items trinkets or will just be in favor because you don t have any perks to begin with which probably has something to do with the amazing matchmaking as well that leads me to the next point it is possible to play the game for the first time and get matched up with at least one counterplayer that has a major level advantage over you there is no machmaking whatsoever it seems to me that the game just matches people randomly and hopes for the best also the game doesn t have any penalty or limitations when it comes to premades you can play the killer and end up with 4 premades 2 of them with items that allow them to fix generatores in less than 1 minute each and the 2 others with flashlights which emit stronger lights than the sun itself and make you drop the survivors you manage to catch or health packs which let them heal themselves easily but there s so much more body blocking pallet looping etc long story short there s absolutely no penalty for premades even though they have an insane advantage over you they don t even get less points for winning like that and if despite of all of that you manage to catch a survivor for 3 devastating times implying that you don t camp the hook those amazing pros that have flashlights pallet loop to infinity and body block and or bm you don t give you the pleasure of actually killing them and make some points for once instead they decide to disconnect again with no immediate penalty whatsoever they don t get any points from that round and may decline in rank but they get to keep their insanely good items that made it so hard for you in the first place and they can just start another match right after sabotaging yours witout any delay without any extra q time nothing and the best thing is you as a killer get less points as well if someone that you wanted to kill just disconnects if you don t manage to kill a single person as a killer you de rank no matter how many times you hit all of them no matter how many times they were on the hook or on the ground the game needs a sacrifice to reward you and that s what so many survivors love to abuse i know i m speaking mostly from the killer s point of view but this is where it s most apparent now if you actually go survivor and try to have a good time the problem starts with finding a lobby my girlfriend who has quite a good rank has to wait a mininum of 4 or 5 minutes for finding a game as a solo player and if she s especially lucky she ll hit a lobby where the killer will just disconnect as a consequence of seeing the survivors in the lobby having flashlights or repairing tools equiped the fact that it s so hard to start a game as a survivor premade or not just shows how tired most killers are of chasing a survivor around in a circle for 3 minutes only to be flashlighted and lose the game later on another consequence is the insane camping it can happen that you as a survivor get hooked by the killer and he will literally stand in front of you not leaving you out of his sight for a second they camp the hell out of the hooks because they know how easy it is for your teammates to save you thanks to various perks and that you can get away even if they manage to hit you yet again when you re already wounded if the survivor that unhooks you has the perk called borrow time i m only mentioning this because yet again perks can be stacked 4 times not just items so if multiple survivors have that perk it will be harder to bring them down on the ground than a eagle on crack it seems to me that because the devs have no clue how to intervene there s a cycle of each other off and ruining the fun for everyone it s insanely hard to find a lobby as a survivor because killers dodge lobbieskillers dodge lobbies because survivors play like cancer and use the worst itemssurvivors that are hooked get camped a lotkillers that leave survivors alone for a second to actually search the map get trolled the out of them for playing fairetc there s no balance no fairplay no punishment for the ones that ruin the fun and after many many hours of ignoring this i ve reached a point where i need to drink bleach and leave this world forever

59420,dead by daylight is the most static and formulaic asymmetrical horror game on the market it s not a great game this is in part due to both the game itself not being very well put together and also the overarching community that works tirelessly to make this game a miserable experience the poor structure of dead by daylight can be seen in the common strategies that the community is forced to utilize in order to win seriously most of my experience in dbd has involved a killer that either 3 gens tunnels or slugs if they somehow aren t doing any of those 3 things they lose pretty quickly to make matters worse behaviour goes out of their way to make the problem worse and specifically makes killers that thrive in these strategies for example skull merchant was made to 3 gen needless to say the receiving end of these limited strategies is almost never fun but is it really the killers fault the game was designed in such a way that these players are forced to play like this if they want any chance of success simply put the game was designed horribly at a base level that s not to say that the community is completely innocent though unfortunately this game somehow fell into the hands of the hyper competitive crowd it should not be controversial for me to say that dead by daylight was obviously made to be a casual experience it is not a very competitive game at heart and it doesn t take much playtime to realize that for some incomprehensible reason the people that play this game treat it like a esport game you d find on the riot client and know the ins and outs of literally everything the ramifications of this can be seen in a casual player s attempt to play the game the mmr system is broken and you will never fully separate from this crowd these are individuals that have thousands of hours in this game and commit to everything in the most optimal manner due to their sheer abundance of knowledge to put it bluntly your entire experience in dead by daylight is going to be getting punished by knowledge checks unless you truly plan to sit down and learn every single thing about every little detail because these people sure as hell do whether intentionally or not they have forced a casual co op game one that doesn t even have a proper ranking system to gain the atmosphere of a f2p esport game aside from the forced competitiveness that this game certainly doesn t benefit from the community itself is just toxic i m not going to go into much depth because there isn t much to say survivors will form bully squads to xd troll the killer because they re so funny and awesome and are definitely loved irl killers will ruthlessly tunnel players because like i said before there s a minute set of ways to play this game they may even slug not even to utilize it as a strategy but just for the sake of holding everyone hostage additionally you will frequently run into streaks of afk killers that are literally deranking their accounts in an effort to dominate worse players it s a horrible group of people to play with what do you expect from a crowd that s basically only here to feed their ego going back to the game itself balancing seems to be a huge obstacle for the devs either everyone is using x perk killer whatever or noone is wanna know why this is it s a ramification of making this game competitive for no reason by having even a fraction of the playerbase play in the most optimal manner things become formulaic people don t play for fun anymore they re playing efficiently to grind that sweet artificial ranking system a system that isn t even based on skill and more so on playtime so wtf is the point every match is the same handful of killers everyone is using the same exact perks playing in the same exact way it feels corporate soulless and boring dead hard is the best perk nerf it into the ground now it s useless everyone moves on to the next big perk that gains a 60 pickrate and the process never ends you can really look at this both ways either you must play this way because the devs have balanced the game horribly and there s no other way to survive or because the community normalizes such a system and you are forced to adapt to survive it s probably both fun is foreign to a community that would rather seek self fulfillment from a largely noncompetitive co op game viewing this game in a broader sense the cosmetics suck i feel like there are only a few good skin drops in dozens that take place over the year this game is obsessed with making conventionally unattractive cosmetics and characters around the clock i have no idea who benefits from this or what the motives are to be fair this isn t always the case and especially recently this has been largely untrue the ui has continuously degraded itself over the years and idk who tf they let cook it s really unintuitive now the game s technical side progresses at a very slow pace and for the longest time this game was locked at 60fps which is embarrassing the graphics are beginning to age poorly imo visually this game is starting to become outdated these are the least of its problems though essentially dead by daylight is an awful experience due to an incompetent dev that makes horrible changes a nonfunctional matchmaking system and a base structure that lacks the substance to make itself versatile enough this is all while being topped off with a community that craves self fulfillment in their life by forcing a fun co op game with friends to turn into a competitive esport simultaneously lashing out at the players around them will i keep playing this game probably it s fun with friends albeit that isn t a genuine positive in my eyes everything is fun with friends it doesn t change the fact that this is a game where those who feel insecure about their lives and desperately need reaffirmation that they re good at something come to spend thousands of hours and knowledge check everyone around them for fake accomplishment this game was never intended to be as competitive as people make it out to be and it s led to the degradation of a game that had a lot more potential,153.0,42.0,8,Not Recommended,July

59423,2019 it s fun sometimes but typically very aggravating the dev team does an extremely bad job balancing the killers survivors which is going to be difficult in the first place but they don t listen to their community they end up buffing all the wrong things and nerfing the already nerfed you will be farmed by teammates you will be tunneled by killers and occassionally you will be camped and there s no real penalty to doing any of the listed toxicity in certain situations it s understandable to do one of the stated actions but it shouldn t be shined on the game itself still feels like it s in early access fps issues on specific maps loads of bugs that can make your game experience horrible matchmaking works most of the time but not all the time matchmaking however is probably the only feature in the game that s not that bad this game has yet to implement dedicated servers so if you re an uswest player prepare to play against people with 200 ping and get hit after vaulting when the killer was nowhere near you yay fun it s worth 5 99 but not 19 99,265.4,114.0,10,Not Recommended,"January 31, 2019",Dead by Daylight,"-|Ғқﻛ|- Domukaru

59426,2022 as is the case with a lot of long tail online games me having 50 hours of gametime 10 on gamepass before buying on steam isn t really enough for a full opinion dead by daylight is a game that by what i see from experienced players is fun up until you actually get good at it i m only now at a point where i m knocking on having multiple killers in level thirty and ranking gold in the monthly scoring system and even now i m starting to see the cracks in the system matchmaking occasionally throws me in with experienced players for whom dbd is a pure numbers game now more eve online than a horror survival game on its face it s a fun game it has some of that sea of thieves charm to how the developers seem like nice people doing their damndest to keep their broken game running as well as possible as of this writing nurse isn t playable purely because a small update made it so she d get stuck in the floor and be unable to move a problem that came up with the twins at launch it s fun the lore for killers can be a little goofy at times in a good way the problems arise from the player base being toxic for the sake of doing something new after logging too many hours they want to have fun again but the only way they can think to do that is pub stomp newer players and taunt them i just got a match where three survivors did literally no objectives and just stood in a corner because they d done the math and figured out my character couldn t carry all three of them to a hook so if they used the right perks they could maximize the game s currency earnings without playing at all and when called on it they said they were making the game fun again dbd is fun but it demands you know when to log off,286.4,36.0,1,Recommended,"February 16, 2022",Dead by Daylight,GavinGWhiz,False

59447,2016 as cliche and lame as it may sound it is with a heavy heart that i have to say i do not recommend this game as much as i d like to the community is toxic the developers seem to be largely incompetent as every patch they release further breaks the game both mechanically and balance wise the survivors have become overpowered and the killer will have a very frustrating time killing all of them yes you can kill up to two survivors and still rank up but the amount of frustrating work you re expected to do to accomplish this is far from fun and satisfying and is more of a chore most survivors abuse infinites and exploits and swarm the hook once a person has been thrown on and then when you try to keep your survivor on the hook you re called a camper if you fail to catch all of them you re teabagged and laughed at when i first got this game i mostly played killer my pc was having issues and the lag on killer was more manageable once my pc was fixed i went over to survivor for awhile and made it to rank 9 before the ranking season reset in the past week before writing this i ventured back over to the side of the killer at first it was fun and i was having reasonable games sometimes i got all of the survivors sometimes i only got 1 or two but everyone played fairly and all was fine but once i hit rank 15 it all went downhill survivors started abusing infinites they started teabagging they started swarming the hook every time i put someone on they would be abuse infinites and then accuse me of hook camping in the after game chat clearly the survivors have no fear of the killer and the gameplay for them has suffered drastically the developers do not care about that however they have stated that their statistics show that the killer is winning rounds just as well as ever that may be the case but those statistics say nothing about how the experience was for the player you can still reasonably win but the experience you will have will be fraught with frustration and trolling for me presently the only saving grace for me is that i have enough friends to play private matches where i can play with people who i can trust to play without abusing exploits or teabagging or any of the garbage that you experience in online games but that s hardly worth the twenty dollars for this game the experience for the killer needs to change i am not saying they need to be buffed but something needs to change because right now the killer side of the game is way to frustrating to be enjoyable and the game depends on the killers needs the killers they are essentially the main focus of the game it is a 4v1 horror game the killer needs to be overpowered to a degree for this game to work i hate to be that guy but friday the 13th is coming out soon and this game will have serious competition regardless of your thoughts of the game it will be competition i predict a fair amount of players will migrate to that game and when that happens the developers will have to make a decision the killers need to be the focus of the game not the survivors the survivors are supposed to be lambs trying to escape the slaughter the game needs to feel like that not like a broken game of hide and seek,676.8,37.0,1,Not Recommended,"September 25, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"ABCBABCBABC

59458,2022 i enjoyed this game for a while things changed the game did not get better there are several issues that players with many more hours than i have will address and likely already have in videos on youtube the developer q a in late january left much to be desired from the developers they have more of an attitude to ignore existing concerns they are well aware of and instead seem to verbalize their lack the understanding of what makes their own game fun rather than accept the criticism internalize it and make the game better they resort to petty retaliation at the players who voice their criticism revoking the cosmetic items from the account of one of these voices under the lie of harassing a member of the development team is nothing shy of blatant pettiness without criticism these developers have no idea of what changes will keep this game alive or push the rest of the dwindling playerbase to vhs and alternatives yet to come frankly the developers lack of understanding of their own game is a big concern for the future of this game notably their attitude towards their latest mmr system and not knowing what is actually skillful in their own game and thus deserving of an increase in ranking within the skill based match making system high rank means nothing the high rank is full of sweaty competitive teams cheaters new players who manage to survive every game by avoiding the killer entirely but couldn t help the team to save their life and the best players but chances are you get matched with cheaters and or new players against a killer with 6000 hours there is no real incentive to climb the ranks yet you do anyways because you never lose ranking only gain with enough games everyone reaches high ranking only to have more difficult games that absorb your entire focus yet provide less fun a lot of changes need to happen to the game and the developers attitude sadly it just feels like this game i once enjoyed has fallen due to some complacency and cockiness ignoring the repeated concerns voiced by the community and waving it away with lies or some goofy explanation that reflects a glaring misunderstanding of the game is not the way for this game to evolve or even maintain the playerbase i for one am uninstalling not because i dislike the game or don t enjoy it not because i side with one influencer or another not because i hate bhvr or any of the independent developers that staff it simply because i do not like the direction this game is heading i played to have fun and i m not having fun with this game in its current state ignoring important changes that would make this game fun again is unfortunately a common occurrence a massive concern for me is the developers paper thin skin getting defensive and hostile towards its players rather than internalizing the criticisms that could make this game great if i ever wanted to stream dbd on my own channel the hostility against criticism has convinced me i m better off steering clear lest i attract their wrath and they delete all of my dlcs and cosmetics from my account,201.3,23.0,0,Not Recommended,"January 26, 2022",Dead by Daylight,"Banished

59488,2019 product received for free dead by daylighta game blighted by the ugliness of its community which can at times overwhelm the experience rating 5 10purchased cost freedead by daylight is a difficult game to review if you were to review dead by daylight at its best it is a thrilling cat and mouse between the killer and the survivors at its worst it is a nasty experience filled with people who are all too willing to create the most toxic environment they can whilst the developers haven t promoted this toxicity they also have done very little to counteract it which has allowed it to fester within the community the entire game was crafted around the concept that survivors are unable to communicate outside of the two silent gestures included in the game and various other ingenious ways that people find to communicate to include anything else would fundamentally break the game in a way that can t easily be fixed which makes it even more baffling as to why the developers then allowed the inclusion of survive with friends swf which allows you to play as a team using third party communication to completely flip the tables on the killer and experience the game in a way that it was never designed for i can understand they wanted to sell more copies of the game and needed a way for people to play together but the way they have implemented it is perhaps the second biggest issue the game faces and also one of the principal reasons behind the main issue of toxicity dead by daylight a screenshot of dead by daylight by harv then comes the stale gameplay there have been numerous patches and dlc packs released yet most games at the higher ranks as survivor you ll be facing the same killers using the same meta perks whilst the killers will face the same looping and generator rushing gameplay that has always existed along with the new survivor meta you ll rarely come across anything different and if you want to experience different gameplay you need to drop into the lower ranks which also brings its own problems this then brings us onto the overpriced cosmetics and the vast array of expensive dlc which also plagues the game there is an argument that most of the dlc is available for free if you are willing to grind however the time required and rewards so pitiful you are better spent buying them and you will need to buy them if you want to run the current meta for both killer and survivor require you to own certain dlc or be lucky enough that they appear on the shrine for free whilst you have enough shards to pick them up dead by daylight a screenshot of dead by daylight by harv it feels as though serious work needs to be taken to fix the big issues the game is currently facing but looking at the way things have progressed i can t see anything changing in the immediate future one change the game needs is fairly straightforward and easy to implement to start with they need to disable the end game chat people are willing to sit in a full game after they ve been killed for twenty minutes just to abuse the killer player i would go as far to say that they should implement an anonymous system where you can t see who you are playing against but that brings forward potential problems about reporting players for cheats and exploits they also need to start running more events that change the game for a short period of time we ve seen two killers in games with the most recent exploit they should run a one month summer event where they mix things up these are things the community are finding a way to do that the developers could utilise something completely different but a timed event that enables them to revert back to the original gameplay afterwards there s so much potential in dead by daylight sadly potential i can t see the developers ever quite realising,728.4,149.0,13,Not Recommended,"April 24, 2019",Dead by Daylight,harv,False

59501,2021 i am in a weird relationship with this game it is unique it is fun and it has a good basic gameplay formula so why am i recommending against getting this game it is the developers they have proven time and again how disconnected they are from the issues plaguing the game between rushed updates that lead to several gamebreaking bugs very poor optimization on the maps and the blatant ignorance that they have displayed towards the balance of the game and the content creators who are willing to criticize them getting banned from any of their forums or streams more often than not make the game not fun and makes me not willing to support them the devs also don t put in effort to understand why something might be a problem they only look at the statistics which isn t always accurate as an example there is currently a survivor perk skills you can load on your character to assist in your or your teams survival or objective completion that lets the survivor see the killer s position and in a strong survive with friends group that can completely shut down killers and their potential mindgames at loops the devs only look at the survival rates of the survivor running this perk and say it s balanced because the statistics say the survivor only has a 50 survival rate the other major issue i have with the game is the microtransactions at the time of writing this if you were to buy only the base game and nothing else you have a selection of 3 killers to play and 4 survivors if you were to unlock other survivors killers by buying their dlcs directly from steam you are looking at spending something around 145 just to unlock the game s full gameplay this does not include the cosmetics which cost anywhere from 5 to 15 for a single item you do have the option of unlocking most killers and survivors licensed killers and survivors like demogorgon and michael myers can t be earned for free for free by earning a special currency by playing the game the major issue with this is that to earn enough currency to buy a single killer or survivor it takes somewhere around 65 70 hours of nonstop playing to earn enough currency i really want to recommend this game and if the developers pull their heads out of their a es and actually try to understand what is wrong with the game rather than just looking at flat statistics and proceed to fix it instead of trying to pump out as many cosmetics and new dlcs as possible to milk as much money as they can i would change my recommendation as it is i would say to wait or find a different game i am also writing this after having not played to see if i would come back to it and ultimately no i have no desire to return to this game in it s current state,446.0,17.0,2,Not Recommended,"January 22, 2021",Dead by Daylight,MegaNerd,False
59504,2021 product received for free when i first started playing this game in 2018 like any new player i was terrified and didn t know wth i was doing even after doing the tutorial which covers the basic controls and objectives of the game it does not train you enough to encounter pro killers disorganized survivors or the bad luck of being the 1st survivor the killer finds lol fast forward 2 years later and i ve learned to love this game with friends and even solo i enjoy the thrill and suspense in the survivor aspect where you can choose and build your characters skills based on their perks and bloodweb all characters have different perks and ways to benefit the team with some being cannon from other video games i e bill from l4d2 or filmography same applies to the killers too i e demogorgon dlc from stranger things i anticipated for a jason voorhees killer but sadly that won t be happening due to copyrights the killer gives you the solo experience of finding the survivors and negating their progress in generators from a first person pov i like how easy it is to build the killers i preferred playing as it has a similar construct with there being a bloodweb and set of perks to choose from i cannot give any advice on how to win as a killer or a survivor nor can i say which side is better because there are too many factors to consider the most organized team can get wiped out by a ghost face or the most experienced pyramid head can still be outsmarted by lower rank survivors because of sheer luck and dead hard the visuals and effects top notch because it takes into account of various details regardless of how minor from dripping blood of injured players to the scratch marks visible to killers from sprinting survivors i just learned about how crows are an indicator of players locations too that was a surprise audio is just as vital for survivors to hear the killers who has a heartbeat and for killers to locate injured players there s the option to adjust the sound and graphics quality too which helps for me to run it on my slightly old gaming laptop it s nearly impossible to pinpoint what the game is missing for visuals and sounds because it s already wholesome as is for both departments as for the developer itself they are indeed adding new dlc killer survivor to the game optimizing map layouts and adjusting the killer stats to make the overall balance as smooth as possible kudos to an active team that s working endlessly on dbd as well as adding events like more exp once in awhile overall it s going to take me awhile before i burn out on this game i enjoy it and recommend it to anyone else who loves horror co op games with the opportunity to play on both sides of the team big thanks to the friend who gifted me this 2 3 years ago edit still enjoy the shenanigans in this game after 5 years and play it from time to time,567.5,47.0,3,Recommended,"January 21, 2021",Dead by Daylight,Reinhardt,True
59505,2020 while i ve put quite a few hours in to this game and will still probably continue playing i can t say i recommend it to someone looking in to an asymmetric multiplayer game on the bright side of things provided you have a full host of friends to play with the game is a blast having friends that are patient and more concerned with having fun than winning make this a rather pleasant game to play the developers are constantly releasing new content to include new killers and survivors on the down side the game is buggy very buggy much more then you would expect from such a small game with little variation in interactions getting stuck on terrain getting locked in animations being struck through walls or seemingly from random all of this is relatively normal and sadly kind of accepted the game has a competitive mechanic if you re into that sort of thing but seemingly doesn t utilize it s matchmaking data to keep the game engaging or competitive when i first started playing i played against very high ranking and ruthless killers that were much more skilled than i was now that i have ranked up it s rather common i play against brand new killers or low ranked killers who by the end of the match you can t help but feel bad for a lot of the community wanted dedicated servers because host advantage was significant and often provided extremely unfair match ups dedicated servers solved this but brought on a whole new slew of issues from lousy hit detection to varying degrees of teleporting from killers and survivors both at some points killers can hit you from what seems like up to 15 feet away at other times they would miss point blank strikes the community while mostly pleasant and easy to deal with suffers from an issue i ve affectionately called who can cry the loudest a lot of the feedback the developers consider basically boil down to who they see the most complaints from because the community is completely divided about gameplay balancing survivors want games they don t have to put effort into and killers want to be able to kill all four people every time while i understand asymmetric multiplayer games are notorious for being difficult to balance it just starts to feel like the developers cater to full circle who cries the loudest the game is riddled with painstakingly artificial difficulty the only skill that will ever be put to the test is a survivors ability to run around a piece of terrain until the killer loses interest or a killers ability to guess a survivors route location both groups have perks that feel like they were implemented to annoy or irritate the other with some exceptions queue times for finding a game are often ridiculous and it s not abnormal to spend more time finding a match than being in one if you happen to queue with a high ranking person don t be surprised to be ridiculed for your lack of experience survivors have tedious and exhaustive tasks and killers have the sometimes impossible task of outwitting a four person team with voice comms the leveling system the bloodweb seems reasonable at first glance then you start to realize that in order to get perks or abilities that make you last longer or give you more of fighting chance you have to level up characters you may have no intention of playing you re expected to play the character that you want to play in order to save up bloodpoints the in game currency to level up characters just to have a chance that you ll find the perk s that you want on the available item choices once you cross that threshold you then need to level up the character you wanted to play in order to receive the aforementioned perk on their bloodweb maybe i m just hypercritical because i m not a competitive game enthusiast but many friends and past teammates share my views on some of the points listed above some having more than triple my game time,196.9,52.0,2,Not Recommended,"September 12, 2020",Dead by Daylight,"Chance

59524,2022 survivor based game with perk reliant killers if you aren t using the top 5 killers there is such a huge difference and divide between good and bad perks in this game which just encourages players to perform and play in the most scummy way possible bhvr seems to have a horrible time in balancing anything because they only listen to survivors opinions why do maps like cowshed and mothers dwelling exist why do they balancing every perk around the top 3 killers why do all the killer mains leave the game it s because they only listen to survivors opinions most maps are ridiculously survivor friendly and when you finally outplay a survivor they will just use dh oh the game is going south so the killer makes a strategic decision to kill someone quickly bt into dh into ds into pallet stun don t wanna eat the ds oh don t worry just slug them and they will use unb anytime the killer wins it s just a hurl of insults towards the killer from slurs to death threats survivors always cry about how they didn t have a fun time if when they lose while saying some of the most obscene and stupid things through a very poorly made censorship system they will never consider a killers fun and feelings so why should a killer consider survivors fun survivors will 4 man stack swf while all bring bnp nothing wrong with this play style and get annoyed when the killer rushes their objective to kill them it s constant irony honestly maybe if the toxicity wasn t so high the game would be much more tolerable not fun tolerable due to the fact that killers are leaving the survivor solo queues are overwhelmingly long once you ve finally entered a match to then be immediately tunnelled camped and killed it ruins the entire experience and leaves a bad taste in your mouth there s nothing wrong with this play style but when the games are shorter than the queues survivors never get a chance to learn play and as a result become toxic and short tempered i can t imagine the experience of a poor 40 year old father that comes home and finally has 40 minutes to spare and decides to boot up dbd to be welcomed with 20 minute queue times 5 minute matches same 3 killers and stagnant meta builds on everyone,528.5,172.0,34,Not Recommended,"June 18, 2022",Dead by Daylight,"Wonder

59548,2020 a really fun and engaging game with some great tie ins and licensed killers and survivors and an overall fairly rewarding gameplay loop when it works the problem being that bhvr are some of the least competent devs in the industry they make some of the most baffling balance decisions i ve ever seen a dev team make like nerfing the only generator slowdown perk that worked immediately from the start of the match into borderline uselessness hyperbole it s a niche perk now but you need to essentially dedicate a build and playstyle around it instead of being able to use it to stem the tide of the earlygame generator rush when repair times were already too fast for majority of killers without map presence nerfing killers to the point of uselessness instead of making tiny tweaks ignoring killers who need buffs clown ignoring underpowered or overdesigned perks for both sides babysitter dark sense buckle up monstrous shrine etc or ignoring overpowered perks for survivors like decisive strike object of obsession and adrenaline that are must haves because of how swing y they are the toolbox nerf was a nice change at the very least but it didn t really do much to stop coordinated survive with friends swf teams from absolutely curbstomping most killers because of the unbalanced matchmaking that doesn t even really attempt to balance skill levels this combined with the seemingly willfull ignorance of bhvr interactive to add meaningful settings like brightness resolution etc to their game or accessibility settings like colorblindness settings which are a huge issue for a part of the community despite being asked about it constantly for nearly 4 years and their seeming incompetency at their own game by making baffling design and balance decisions that only benefit players of low skill while punishing the players who are committed to their game and want to play at the highest level makes me have little faith in them as developers the community is another touching point it s one of the worst communities i ve ever been a part of i can t go more than three matches without being told to kill myself or how i am and should uninstall because baby survivor timmy couldn t dodge a hatchet to save his life the toxicity goes both ways as well because both sides have broken options available to them to make the session living hell for the other side though i d argue that survivor tools are slightly more powerful than killer ones but only slightly keys moris adrenaline hex noed unbreakable decisive strike etc it really feels like a clown show of who can ruin the other sides day the most and yet i find myself coming back to the game again and again because the base game and concept are actually fairly solid but everything else makes me hesitant to recommend this game to anyone who is serious about it if i could give a middle thumb i would but steam has a binary yes no system and i m going to have to go with no in this case take that with a grain of salt however the underlying game itself is fun and engaging but the incompetency of the developers and the general of the community make it hard to recommend to anyone looking for a solo experience edit june 2021 so somehow the balance and buggy state of the game has gotten even worse i don t know how bhvr managed this but holy hell the game doesn t even work on most platforms anymore the game crashes constantly half the maps don t work the last three killers released have been fairly weak on launch with one of them being the actual weakest killer in the game by a significant margin perks are overtuned to the point of uselessness forget the middle thumb rating comment i gave before it s a hard thumbs down now bhvr are greedy devs who focus on fixing cosmetic issues and pumping out more dlc than fixing their pile of spaghetti they call code deadbyboycott,755.7,28.0,1,Not Recommended,"August 1, 2020",Dead by Daylight,Walking Wake,False

59567,2022 i used to love dbd i really truly did from 2016 until now when unemployed from covid for the entirety of 2020 and most of 2021 i played it almost exclusively with my gf and it was wonderful but mostly because of her this game used to be something special but bhvr has always done the absolute bare minimum and now they aren t even doing that the game is rampant with cheaters hackers that can ddos you you basically have to play the game through a vpn to be safe it s been a buggy barely functional mess for the entirety of the game s life and after 5 years that s just not excusable anymore the devs now actively block people that speak negatively of them for their actions and lack thereof and in the past they d deny the coveted fog whisperer status to people that supported and loved the game if they dared to speak negatively or criticize the game bhvr now they ve gotten so petty as to remove cosmetics from the account of a well known and liked streamer of this game all because he made a joke about them on twitter this game will never be worth playing again until bhvr straightens up and acts right and they won t because this game has no competition they found an exploitable niche concept that other games can t challenge because dbd s been building up a base of famous well known characters to play as and against i honestly wish i could get all the money back i ve spent on this game i regret having spent it even though i did so when i loved the game and tolerated the bs that bhvr is so good at if you want a recommendation on something good to play with good devs that actually give half a damn about their players and the functionality of the game check out project zomboid or barotrauma they re nothing like dbd and the indie stone undertow games are nothing like behavior that is honestly one of the highest compliments i can give to those two games and devs,915.2,29.0,0,Not Recommended,"January 25, 2022",Dead by Daylight,"Peaceful Treasure

59569,2016 product received for free version 1 1 0 update the game continues it s trainwreck of being a design failure with cheaters growing more and more prominent than ever in this game with the most common ones being people who go and edit their game files in order to unlock all the highest level perks in the game along with the most rarest consumable items in infinite qualities of course this has been a very well known abuse exploit for months on end now dating back to people doing it in the beta and it has still not been fixed alongside the plethora of bugs but what about the free dlc then surely it must give the game some merits nope they went ahead and added more imbalance to the game in the form of the nurse a killer that can blink teleport vast distances instantly and immediately hit kill you after doing said teleporting with the only downside to doing this is a nausea inducing screen shake won 5 5 games effortlessly even against a few hackers game modders playing as her before i had to quit as i was on the verge of throwing up all over my keyboard what of the promised option settings then they ve added a few rudamentory simple keybindings that should have been in before release but besides that there s little to nothing to adjust be it fov music volume or even the most basic sh t in the world mouse sensitivity the developers have now also taken an extra step towards guaranteeing you having an even worse time playing by disabling the killer s ability to see the level rank of survivors before starting a game why would this be a negative thing you ask because now the killer has no option to try and get a more fair game as the developers still have not gotten around to making an even remotely functional matchmaking see for what matchmaking in 1 1 0 looks like you ve all been warned this was a decent game in beta however said beta was extremely restrictive with people only being able to play 1 map and 1 killer which has resulted in there being massive balance technical issues that could all have been identified solved before release if the developers did not stubbornly limit it since then things have only gotten worse and there are just so much broken rubbish in this game right now i m gonna have to list all of it to even have hopes of giving you an idea of what you re getting into 1 the developers promised weekly updates for the game they have as of june 24 2016 failed to deliver on this promise 2 the developers promised a system to play with friends to be coming very soon as of right now you cannot play with any friends unless you have a full premade game of 5 people it was a massively requested feature in the very beginning of beta possibly even earlier testing and today over 2 weeks after release they still don t have a release date for this function or even any details to give about it 3 any kind of feedback or data the developers are receiving from the community in regards to balance be it killers items perks or survivors their one and only response to all of it has been get gud 4 it is very likely for you as of right now to not be able to play the killer at all the system for hosting a lobby as a killer has since the introduction of easy anti cheat after the beta been completely broken for certain people in the form of having absolutely noone join your lobby if you decide to create one as a killer even if you wait for 5 hours and i personally know the pain of this as i m currently suffering from it no this is in no shape way or form an issue with my network my computer or anything that has to do with me or even other people for that matter i ve hosted hundreds of games as a killer in the beta just for it to suddenly break at release topic of what i ve tried to do to fix it here along with others having same issue here a massive amount of people are reporting having their progress profiles be indiscriminately randomly deleted corrupted lost by the game if you re gonna play this game as of right now you need to backup all of your local data or forever be stuck with nothing 6 as of right now if you play as a survivor and the killer you re facing decides to ragequit the game for whatever reason you will be punished by having your rank items be lost 7 even with the introduction of easy anti cheat cheaters are still prominent in the game 8 as of right now it s possible to infinitely kite any killer in the game endlessly with the use of a single window frame you can repeatedly vault over it back and forth faster than the killer can vault through it run around and catch you with it this has not been properly fixed in 1 0 2 as survivors even without perks can vastly out kite anything the killer does at a gross amount of different window vaulting spots on all the maps unless the killer lag switches and makes his location be horrendously delayed disguised to see just how much of a problem this is even in the latest patch that have adjusted it view this video youtube video dead by daylight engaging innovative gameplay views 226 behaviour digital inc has outdone themselves in this 1 0 2 patch to truly have adjusted the vaulting mechanics in this game sufficiently 9 the developers stated that there would be matchmaking in release this ended up not being the case this has continued to be a non existant feature now into patch 1 0 2 meaning that with over 3 patches the developers have still failed to create an even remotely functional matchmaking system 10 the bug report section on the forum on steam alone right now has over 1 500 topics 11 the head developers ran off to not only e3 the moment their game released and stayed there for several days but also pax essentially guaranteeing that there would be as much delay as possible for getting the game fixed 12 a big percentage of people who ordered the deluxe edition of the game has still not gotten their promised content weeks after release 13 the developers are always being incredibly close lipped even admtting to wanting to censor their artbook because of and i quote now forces higher than us 14 having someone with even small amounts of lag can have and will consistently severely break the game be it being grabbed through walls being hit 45 feet away being completely incapable of picking up a survivor that s spinning around on the ground with high ping as a killer disallowing the animations to synch up to properly pick people up and it has not even been adressed i could go on trust me but at the end of the day the thing that scares me the most is the attitude of the developers and how they are setting their priorities a gross majority of people reporting that the wraith is op get gud even though you can currently and consistently bug abuse with him to get no cool down on melee swings

59639,2023 this game has done a great job of bringing horror to the mainstream and i love that a simple premise one killer attempts to find and kill sacrifice 4 survivors whose job it is to fix some generators in order to power the exit gates through which they can escape i still remember my first match sneakily running around the killer in giddy excitement as i made my escape the experience is made even better by all the classic horror characters in the game such as ghostface michael myers freddy krueger leatherface pinhead it goes on chases where the survivor attempts to get away from the killer are great fun as it rewards mind games and map knowledge it never felt unfair to get beaten by a better player who outplayed me with skill and technique it is also very rewarding trying to save your downed teammates from the killer as it really plays into the mouse vs cat idea that the game is built on unfortunately it is weighed down by so much that i just can t recommend it in good faith some are fairly simple issues to correct others would basically require the game to be completely overhauled they are as follows and they are very numerous playing survivor sucks at a core level for the survivors where they must escape a bloodthirsty killer one killer oni literally gets his power from spilt blood you d be surprised to learn that the core gameplay consists of gen repair simulator and just holding down mouse 1 m1 to win you must repair 5 generators and then an exit gate to escape to repair a generator your character sits still and just idly repairs it with m1 with a basetime of 90 seconds then you need to unhook heal your team which also consists of holding m1 idly occasionally you ll find a hex totem which needs to be cleansed by holding m1 trying to open the exit gate to escape interact with certain killer items open chest for items you guessed it idly hold m1 not only is the core gameplay extremely boring and noninteractive it gets even worse when you realise that the time taken to do all that can increase dramatically with certain killer perks unfortunately this gameplan of regressing progress of all those aforementioned actions is considered meta so as a survivor you can expect to idly hold m1 for more than half your game time some times the game can be stretched out for up to 40 minutes despite all core objectives taking less than 8 minutes in total that is assuming you don t get camped tunnelled out of the game in the first two minutes now obviously you do get the chance to be in chase with the killer and this is where the real and only fun lies the problem is that the amount of enjoyment you get from this lies largely with the killer you can attempt to bait the killer to chase you but they have the simple opportunity of just ignoring you and thus in a 4v1 game by only trying to get chases you are essentially a man down which means that those 3 other survivors will spend even longer doing all those boring tasks now there certainly are games where you spend the entire time in chase and those are the best matches but the simple reality is that they are the exception not the rule when you think of survivor don t think exciting blood pumping chases instead think chore simulator because that is what the majority of the gameplay and by extension playing effectively is gameplay that fundamentally rewards unfun playstyles for killer tunnelling and camping playstyles that are considered by virtually all to be terrible and bad for the health of the game are very effective for the killer it s a 1v4 game you ask any person how to deal with a 1v4 they would say get rid of one or more as soon as possible that is achieved by focusing on killing one survivor as quickly as possible for the killer it works but it really does suck to be on the receiving end as a survivor another toxic thing that is rewarded is gen slow down the only real fun part of the game lies in chases yet the meta is centred around regressing generator progress and drawing out the game for as long as possible personally i think it would be better if the game tried to focus more on improving the chase experience but there exists an arm race mentality in the community where one side picks gens perks items and the other responds in kind all in all the chases for killer are the most fun but the way things are set up means at times you aren t optimized for it by design toxic and bad survivor teammates a lack of basic team communication means that more often than not you will have some teammates doing everything and others doing nothing i have had a plethora of experiences where i can be looping the killer for minutes on end and yet no generators will be complete get hooked and die only for the worst teammates to escape this is made even worse when you realise just how bad of the killer vs survivor mindset is both sides are constantly trying to one up the other by waiting around at the end of the game to t bag in safety and killers camping and tunnelling resulting in some players not getting to play the game at all this becomes even more of an issue when you realise just how bad the matchmaking in this game is i remember vividly how my first match ever was against a killer who had 700 hours and in my last games as a high tier killer i would consistently get brand new survivors who have just installed the game obviously there are good survivor teammates and killers who are nice people but i think that you will notice the toxic side first this game has really bad balancing some killers remain ridiculously strong and with limited counterplay e g nurse blight and others remain ridiculously weak e g clown and trapper add ons are also a big problem for some they are borderline overpowered and can completely change the game e g nurse s range clown s pinkie finger for other killers most of them are all low tier and barely worth using e g executioner and nemesis some killers like hag still don t have counterplay when it comes to her camping traps you need to bring flashlights crackers in the pre game lobby before you even know who you are up against and some others are just extremely annoying to play against such as thanatophobia legion yet killers such as hillbilly still have artificial restraints placed on them such as an overheating chainsaw do not expect good balancing from this game brightness and the colour palette is a major problem you can t change brightness in game the claim is that it would provide an unfair advantage however you can do it on your monitor which personally messes with my eyes so why not just add it in to the game there are so many maps that are unnecessarily dark and in some instances are all but impossible to see at times maps such as midwich elementary school garden of joy s main house and some autohaven maps this is made even worse by some killers and their powers trapper and hag s traps are at times impossible to see and dredge can greatly darken the screen multiple times in a match to the point where you can barely see anything front of you the end result is that some maps are so visually bad that when loading into them i instantly disconnect because it is just that bad there are a number of other issues that i could go on such as poor accessibility lacks features other games take for granted bad bloodweb design and a very consumer unfriendly monetary practice i would have included them all but steam has a limit on how much you can put in a review lol all in all the times where the game worked for me was less than when it didn t so i just can t recommend it please go play something else and don t waste your money and time here,482.3,18.0,5,Not Recommended,"January 5, 2023",Dead by Daylight,"Sergeant Poultry

59657,2018 being a software engineer i can t recommend this game because their code is bad their coders must be using beginner tutorials from youtube some reasons why when i patch comes out fixing one thing something that should not be related to that at all gets broken their code is what we call spaghetti code their map objects are not sized right running to go between two tree s that you can easily fit through survivor and killer only to get stuck on them that s just being lazy if someone leaves the match 10 seconds before it starts the match will still start up now creating a very unfun unfair game lobbies constantly fail loading into game constantly fails in which you also lose your offering in the process the game allows me to be put into lobbies where the killer has a ping of 1000 killers can hit the survivor through the pallets because the code delay lag and a ton of other code related issues fix all of that and the game would be amazing but i cringe when i see the bugs that they have that have been there since launch two years ago and still haven t been fixed but let me tell you they have no problem releasing more dlc,259.8,341.0,65,Not Recommended,"May 11, 2018",Dead by Daylight,"Snobbysteven

59677,2017 alright so lets dive into a good review of this game for both killers and survivors ill start by talking about a few of the must knows about this game for survivors because this will likey be your frist choice when playing the game a few of the things we will talk about here is the things i love about the game vs the things i dont like about the game starting with what i like about the game great variety for survivor choiceslevel system is very fluidgame play is auxiliaratinggreat variety so to explain what i mean about the variety of survivors you can pick from is without dlc you have a choice of seven different characters each having its own skill set which actually makes a difference to elaborate a little more about the skills each of the characters have three skills that are unique to the survivor some of them make a difference as far as escaping the killer to healing team mates and so far and so forth level system is very fluid omg i cant tell you how happy i am about the leveling system over time you gain blood points for doing actions in the game from either repairing generators to helping team mates off the hook basically the things you do in game matter i cant tell you how happy that makes me i see games that reward a base xp on just the groups ability instead of individual ability but back on topic the blood points you can spend in the bloodweb that has different items like flashlights toolkits medkits keys maps and attachments for each of those items which can help you in the fog which is where the game is played game play is auxilirating the game keeps you on your toes with killer perks that make you constantly be watching your back the killer is a different story although i can say i have never played a game where it keeps me wondering where the inpending doom is coming from what are my escape routes where are my team mates being chased makes you actually fear being hit from maps that have corn fields classic hollywood feel and the unique killers make it even better although some of the cool ones like michel myers and freddy are dlc locked but there are still some cool free ones now for what i dont like and dont worry ill try and be fair but keep this short enough so lets go face camping killersteam mates not working togetherkiller perks make it harder sometimesnow notice this list is short because for a survivor the only thing you have to worry about is the generators and the killer although killer perks and team mates not working together can sometimes make for an interesting game that can either lead to you escaping by the skin of your teeth or being killed off because team mates didnt work together there are many videos out there that help new players and ill leave a link to a channel that i watched to gain new insight that would other wise take a new player tons of hours to learn face camping killers what i mean by this is when you get downed by the killer he she has to take you to the hook where the entity will try to steal your soul and all that good stuff well you have three times to be hooked first one you dangel there until you reach phase two or get freed if you hit phase two you have to struggle to stay alive as the entity tries to kill you phase three you die instantly so you can see the problem some killers will camp survivors who have been hooked until they reach phase two making the next down a guaranteed kill against a survivor team mates not working together and killer perks making it harder this is a great challange for any player experienced or not when team mates refuse to work on generators and waste time it makes the game harder plus the killer perks which make generator repair speed slower or even some other ones that will be mentioned in videos on the channel i linked make the game near impossible sometimes to win yet ive managed to escape through the hatch which spawns as the last person in the game when all team mates are dead a second escape is optional killers tend to go to the hatch and camp it to keep you from leaving this way and then you have to decide to risk the escape or repair generators to open the gates killers have there own issues like being pallet looped and flashlight stunned and that can lead to face camping and other things and i could go on and on about how great this game is and the flaws i can find in it but overall i cant think of a game that has me egar to play and scared for my life at the same time channel link my personal favorite youtuber for helpful tips and guides niva1a niva1a s channel link although if i had to rate this game on any sort of scale it would look like this on a point scale of 1 10 1 being bad 10 being great aspect points survivor killer gameplay 8 5 rewarding feeling 9 overall fun level 9 5,110.8,18.0,1,Recommended,"December 24, 2017",Dead by Daylight,Cody,False

59714,2023 dead by daylight has a great concept a great line of killers and survivors to choose from and an interesting and engaging gameplay loop there are issues of balance as with any game and some stick out more than others call of brine dead hard ruin double exhaustion etc these issues will come and go however and many games can be well balanced and it can be a fun time however this is almost never the case the matchmaking is non existent killers or survivors who have fresh installed are put up against players of hundreds and even thousands of hours if you are playing with minimal perk setups on a new character to unlock their perks for other characters you are matched versus players with a full roster of rank 3 perks at times games tend to lean very one sidedly for killer or survivor you either win by a landslide or get curb stomped all of this could be overlooked for me if it wasn t for the community it s just so toxic the survivor playerbase and the killer playerbase don t see eye to eye on anything and both sides violently disagree on unspoken rules which items and perks are op and will insult each other at the drop of a hat honestly dbd makes league of legends look like a daycare new killers trying strategies get insulted and bullied by survivor parties of items and perks meant to remove control of your character for the most amount of time killers will tunnel and camp players effectively removing them from the game and making them unable to play if you don t get a well behaved lobby it ll be an unbalanced one whether i win or lose i tend to be more upset or frustrated than when i started playing playing killer is stressful and running into bully squads makes you want to disconnect but that s exactly what they want playing survivor you could do something that will make them target and tunnel you and again make you want to play anything else no other game have i seen a playerbase so driven into making it as unenjoyable as possible for the opposing side if you can push the toxicity and almost non existent balancing aside it can be a great game and i know many people that do enjoy it but i ve heard of and know people who are more relieved than anything when they uninstall it personally i play games to have fun i don t wish to get frustrated overly invested in personal ego competitions or unsportsmanlike conduct this game and its community are rampant with it all i gave it a fair shot and i couldn t recommend it less based on this community alone,221.2,23.0,1,Not Recommended,"March 12, 2023",Dead by Daylight,Makairo,False

59726,2018 people are toxic but let s be honest who s not toxic in a pvp game like this on the plus side the dev s do their best to keep everything balanced they re continuously working on the game to try and make it more fair for everyone to play from any angle and when something gets out of balance they do their best to redo it to fix the issue prevent cheating etc gamewise i d definitely suggest if you like spoopy games that base more around skill and technique than jump scares everyone has a different technique with a vast amount of skills you can use a list that they just keep adding to which makes it all the better you learn how to play against different styles without knowing what exactly they re using beforehand until it s dun dun duuun too late lol,338.1,28.0,4,Recommended,"November 20, 2018",Dead by Daylight,atomicwarkitten,False

59741,2021 i ve been a player of this game since 2018 and have had an enjoyable experience playing it but with recent updates and new added killers such as the trickster that feel out of place the experience just get worse there are significant flaws in the game that have not been patched or fixed no instead the developers implement a battle pass system and more micro transactions that brings more money to the developers pockets yet none of this is used to actually fix the game the devs find several ways to nerf the killers that makes the game such a boring disaster for killer mains good luck attempting to win against gen rushing survivor squads before you know it the survivors will have fixed all gens and you will get queued up for the same experience next game for killers ebony mori s are nerfed which are one of the rarest items to acquire yet survivor keys that let them leave the game prematurely are still just as op it s so one sided it s not even fun it s not even fun for survivors either everyone is playing on the same meta there s a bunch of perks yet half of them are so useless unless you re just in it to throw the game troll look forward to equipping the same stale loadouts for both killer and survivor for your games if you actually want to win and i applaud you if you don t get bored by it oh and i was talking about micro transactions wasn t i it would have been fine if it was solely aesthetic but this game is actually p2w certain killers and survivors have good perks that can only be acquired if it appears in the shrine of secrets or if you actually buy the killer survivor to get the perk if you want to go the shrine of secrets route you have to wait weekly and there is no guarantee it will appear there either it s 2021 and yet games are still relying on scummy p2w mechanics just to get a few extra bucks if dead by daylight had any sort of competition then i m sure they d actually start taking the game s health seriously but for now they don t care and they haven t cared for the past 4 years but for sure when there is a game similar to dbd made by a different company i m dropping this game and i would not recommend anyone else to get into this game unless you re looking forward to a ride of patch notes that will leave you scratching your head by developers who don t even understand what they are doing,731.7,18.0,0,Not Recommended,"May 10, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"Derank Booster #Road To Silver 1

59743,2022 dead by daylight itself is a great game sometimes even exceptional it has its issues like any multiplayer title but overall it is more than worth playing however behaviour interactive are a company clearly more concerned with appearing politically correct than genuinely improving their game and the experience of those who play it bar the vocal minority who complain over such matters as offensive content for example this is what prompted my original review back in 2022 the developers decided to remove leatherface s claudette mask due to it supposedly acting as a tool for racism even going so far as to claim it is akin to blackface behaviour has a very clear political and social agenda which they make absolutely no effort to hide and it does not represent their playerbase time finances and resources put into their social pandering could be much better spent improving upon the variety of issues still present within the game overall rating dead by daylight 88 100 behaviour interactive 13 100,254.8,26.0,0,Not Recommended,"January 11, 2022",Dead by Daylight,"WOUBZY

59768,2022 look the premise is interesting and so are the characters the game play loop itself is very fun but the ultimate failing of this game is the god awful balancing i have primarily spent my time playing killer and i can confidently say after 126 hours that you will only encounter about 5 fun games out of 100 i like the games where i feel like i am being challenged but i still have a chance if i play it well unfortunately this is not the case most of the time the matchmaking in this game is so terrible sometimes it will match you with people who have very clearly just bought the game and have no idea what they re doing this is not fun not for me as the killer stomping them to the ground and i can t imagine it being fun for the survivors either on the other end of the spectrum you will very often get matched with people who have dedicated their lives to this game i ve been matched with people who have played over 10k hours in this game and boy let me tell you it s not fun being stomped by good survivors either this leads me to another point toxicity this game has a massive issue with toxic players who will constantly t bag and emote at you to taunt you and then proceed to write ez in the end game chat sometimes they will even flame you for being bad completely disregarding that you have a fraction of the hours they have played i really wish i could recommend this game because the core fun is definitely there the developers just need to open their eyes and ears and finally listen to their community i am far from the only one who has these gripes with the game it s wide spread i don t know if i will be playing this going forward my life is too short for frustrating and unfun experiences i will listen in on the announcements coming on the 16th in hopes that the developers have finally decided to listen to their community from what i have heard from the community though i should not get my expectations up edit after 73 more hours so i got pretty good at killer too good it seems now all fun has been drained from the game entirely now i face people with meta perks bringing in toolboxes with brand new parts to just rush down the gens leaving me time to do absolutely nothing i haven t grinded out any of the gen regression perks so there is just straight up nothing i can do i decided today that i will quit this game for my own mental health it makes me more angry than it is worth i sincerely hope this review will help the game get better or at the very least help some people not try out this game if they re expecting a balanced experience,242.6,17.0,2,Not Recommended,"May 13, 2022",Dead by Daylight,Jerry Beans,False

59816,2018 the game is extremely addicting but you will end up hating it and or hating yourself for the time you ve invested into it let me clarify below you ll have a massive amount of fun when first playing you ll probably experience the horror and adrenaline that this game was supposed to be filled with this releases those feel good endorphines and you queue up for another round this might go on for a couple weeks before you slowly start slipping unknowingly deeper and deeper into a game where the main theme is trying to interact with a killer who is actually a 6 year old with an incredibly fragile ego whose feelings are protected by their own ability to control every aspect of your enjoyment trust me when i say this killers do not want you to have fun their goal the entire time is to ensure you don t get to have any cool interactions in order to not feel their ego being threatened you ran from the killer and it took him over 30 seconds to finally catch up and down you he will consider this as toxic behavior and will camp tunnel you to ensure that you do not get to play or earn points for the rest of the game knowing you re desperately holding onto life by breaking your spacebar to prevent death as a hook is piercing through your helpless chest that bearded man with the ego of an orphaned child behind the keyboad is the one who controls whether you get to actually play the game or not do you know why this is because the game is designed to force killers to behave in this way if there are 4 good survivors against 1 bad killer or just 4 survivors who are abusing strong items perks it will seem disgustingly one sided and almost hopeless so the killer just resorts to being toxic themselves though this can be said for both sides huntress with one shot hatchets add on who ll probably get flamed by survivors for just playing the game the way the developers made it the game is just terribly balanced and people are forced to do things through the game s own toxic and asymetrical design no matter how good you are you will end up feeling defeated this is not horror this is cancer,762.1,26.0,7,Not Recommended,"May 12, 2018",Dead by Daylight,Con,False
59817,2023 i m a survivor main with over 800 hours so i think it s safe for me to say that this game is very addicting and very fun at times however tunneling and camping has been an issue since the game started the reason people started tunneling is because the game was for a while survivor sided between swfs and coms killers were having a very difficult time winning so they resolved to tunneling and camping this has been an issue for quite a long time and bhvr started to fix it nothing bhvr does ever fixes it because they dont listen to what their community wants to fix tunneling they gave survivors bt but it only lasts for 8 seconds and is only good for one hit and obviously if a killer wants to tunnel you then one hit isn t going to deter them after that update this just started going downhill bhvr had many killers complaining that the game was too survivor sided even though we are faced with constant nerfing over the last few months behavior has nerfed self care boon circle of healing dead hard iron will off the record and countless other survivor perks why because killers wont stop complaining the game is barely fun anymore bhvr is just a selfish company that only fixes the game just enough to be played bhvr released killers that are practically made for tunneling and camping the knight the skull merchant the dredge the artist the twins etc all of these killers since the beginning of game have the ability to tunnel but bhvr only makes it easier i ddont mind killers like the wraith because they were original dbd killers and weren t mainly used for camping but all the even relatively new killers are basically just mad for tunneling whether that be camping in lockers camping with guards camping with drones camping with a deformed younger brother camping with birds or any other form dont even get me started on killers like the clown he is op but nobody will admit it the only way to run him or escape him is to just w key but not even that works because he can just throw a bottle at you and its over bc you are significantly slower and can no longer see i have never met a clown main that wasnt toxic because they know they can get away with it this game is trash now tbh bhvr is catering to whining killers because the game is survivor sided no its not and they know it isnt they just want an easy win self care got nerfed even more because survivors were healing too fast with self care you could already only heal at 35 normal healing speed but i guess that s too hard on the killers because now it at the least takes as long as a generator without anything else in fact you can complete a generator before you finish healing boon circle of healing got nerfed because we were healing to fast again now we can only see each other s auras when we are in the boon radius dead hard got nerfed because it gave us more of a chance of surviving the chase now we have to unhook somebody to use it when the only one getting hooked will be the dead hard users because they cant use their main perk iron will got nerfed because killers couldnt find us off the record got nerfed because it was too op but do you know what bhvr hasnt nerfed killer perks the only perks that got nerfed from them are gens regression perks noed is still here what about that what about the perks and add ons that practically give the killers an easy win what about light born it literally makes a flashlight and flashbang useless why can killers even see us in a lobby even though killers cant switch between killers they can still switch perks they can still switch add ons they can see our items which means they can completely counter that with their perks and add ons they can see our ranks which means they can dodge lobbies if they dont like what we re carrying or if they don t want to face a survivor over a rank of 2 they can see our profiles they can see all of it what about us we cant do that we cant switch a perk to completely counter what the killer has we cant dodge lobbies if we dont like the killer we cant dodge lobbies if we dont like their rank this game is trash at this point bhvr is making tunneling easy and it s ruining every ounce of fun that s still left in the game but you know gotta make that money they are only catering to the killers they are treating them like they re made of glass bhvr is honestly just a selfish company that doesnt care about their community they just dont want to lose killers and that will be their downfall they are gonna lose millions of dollars because survivors aren t going to put up with it i m not sure how many more updates i ll stick around for if they keep this up then im leaving the community and im sure many more will follow,992.1,17.0,3,Not Recommended,"April 24, 2023",Dead by Daylight,"Cat_Nipping

59828,2017 short version are you a troll you will love this game do you dislike being trolled don t waste your time long version i will say this the sound effects and atmosphere are really well done beyond that the graphics are only adequate and the controls are somewhat clunky much of your controls are intentionally gimmicked in a vague attempt at presenting limitations to one side or the other what kind of spoils the game is the lopsided nature of the matches one side or the other generally steam rolls you either have a killer that is far over powered and just trashes the 4 victims or you have 4 highly experienced victims in voice chat coordinating their way past a killer who can t keep up rarely will you see a balanced match and the game isn t designed to be fair 4 v 1 with all of the power ups from leveling designed to give even more advantage to one or the other it certainly hits a certain niche that isn t seen in other games and i really enjoyed the atmosphere it creates where it kind of falls apart is the toxic nature of the community you can t even win a game without being hated on for simply doing what the game wants you to do as the killer you are supposed to dominate and wipe out the other team done correctly you often can just wipe the floor with them literally dragging them around and plopping them on hooks to struggle a highly skilled killer against 4 uncoordinated victims and the victims are simply not going to enjoy themselves and they are going to feel trolled and in turn swear and cry and moan in the chat afterwards apparantly you are supposed to just let them win so they can level up on the flip side 4 coordinated victims especially if they grouped and use voice chat can run circles around the slow plodding killer and leave the killer with almost nothing to do in those games its lopsided the other direction the killer ends up like a bot just patrolling from one place to another and being avoided entirely played this way the killer is just a walking simulator and quite frankly the victims spend the majority of their time just sitting and staring at an engine waiting for it to be fixed oh look i get to hit space bar again again again anyway i can t praise the sound effects and atmosphere enough unforunately those are the only stand out features to the game the majority of it is a lot of walking around either trolling or watching engines be repaired it never really feels competitive to me every match feels lopsided you either dominate or just get walked all over and you can expect to be treated to a tirade of toxic nonsense afterwards i ll play some more when i m in the mood to troll little kids and stick them on hooks but beyond that it s really repetitive and unless you come into it with friends the community has been pretty dam rude so far side note my girlfriend also plays this game with her circle of friends my opinions here are based on watching them play as well as my own experiencesit s an ok game and if steam let you give a more detailed rating i d probably be more in the middle than i am negative unfortunately steam only allows thumbs up or thumbs down and this game needs a few more thumbs down to get the point accross this is a very niche game be aware of what you are getting into there are certainly some who will enjoy it for me it s going to be infrequent but i will keep it installed for an occasional laugh,788.9,28.0,2,Not Recommended,"December 31, 2017",Dead by Daylight,"Kunovega

59835,2021 hahahaha imagine they release a broken update which 80 of the community hates release half assed animations break the game s mechanics by giving the killer telepathic powers and then to cover their asses they buy a bunch of bots to give positive reviews on the release day of the update just to counteract the hate they ve received from releasing said broken updateyou can t even properly dodge the killer anymore you can vault through the window walk 3 steps and he ll still hit you from the other side because of his telepathic weapon honestly in this state just save yourself the hassle and skip this don t put trash like this in your shopping cart this comes from someone who used to love this game before this update update game is a bit more enjoyable now but the devs decided to release a new chapter then proceeded to lock us out of playing pub matches on the new map for like 2 3 weeks now due to cosmetic glitches they decided to enforce some word censorship system in the post game chat without an option to turn it off so that spanish people can t even type dead hard in their language because some wanker decided to censor dumb words like facecamp or sit new killer feels inconsistent as where his power can sometimes hit you through a tall wall but miss you when he s aiming right for you why do they force themselves to release new killers every 3 months take a break take longer inbetween chapters to actually fix the game and work on your killers so you dont release buggy messes like twins who i love playing as but i ve seen them glitch out like absolute and it s been 7 months after their release or this inconsistent nemesis wankeri would still advise you to skip this game even on sale it might be fun when you re playing it with your friends but that fun runs out once you reach green ranks once there it slowly starts turning into a sweat fest if you somehow manage to end up in purple red ranks then i seriously wish you luck bring a group of similar skilled friends at least because the game will suck more and more with each match update2 the game was in a somewhat and by somewhat i mean very playable state and somehow they it up even more with the cenobite the game outright dc s you and or crashes to desktop when you face the new killer many killers have their core mechanics bugged and broken i e nightmare getting stunned by a fake pallet that is not meant to do that people reporting that their frames even on lowest setting dipped by a lot the pallet texture being replaced by an ugly thing that belongs in the first half life era not to mention the fact they changed the rank system to some grades and decided to give out rewards for em except the rewards are so absolutely it s not even worth to grind for em still as i ve said before skip on this unless you re very high on ketamine morphine metamphetamine cocaine or any other illegal drug,464.1,28.0,2,Not Recommended,"February 10, 2021",Dead by Daylight,Vaykor,False

59859,2021 at the moment with the new update unleashing an entire world of bugs that render this game almost unplayable at times eg survivors movement speed being noticeably slower than previous versions which makes juking and looping near impossible getting randomly stuck on nothing and not being able to move as killer and survivor glitchy animations a ui hud that is not massively user friendly frequent game crashes and freezing constantly being kicked out of groups and de pipping despite gaining or safety pipping after a match coupled with the quickly growing toxicity of the community that the devs seem to not care about and i would not currently recommend this game it can be fun don t get me wrong and i do still play it but as it stands i don t think i d be telling people to rush to buy this hopefully the devs address the issues and i can change this review to reflect that,692.8,18.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 13, 2021",Dead by Daylight,SapphiresStarlight,False
59867,2023 at first this game is quite fun but then more and more toxic people join the game the moderator does not accept criticism instead they will ban you for being vocal about the unfairness of the game the killers always get extreme advantage over the survivors there are no strategy to this game it s just plain and simple when you re the killer just do camping or tunneling then you ll always win the game camping means that you stay with the hooked survivor until he dies tunneling means that you ll always chase and focus on 1 survivor until he dies most chinese killers do this and they don t care if it become no fun they only care about winning the game they don t feel the excitement they just don t care about the game their only focus is just win by any means possible including cheating or ruining the fun factor of the game when you re a survivor and you play with strangers then no hope of winning the only way you can easily win against a killer is if you re in a survive with friends swf you ll need full coordination on who will play around with the killer who will focus on generators and who will help the hooked survivor so basically it s no fun at all playing as survivor if you encounter them and if you tried to leave the game early it will ban you for a long time they think that by doing so survivors will not leave the game often but for me by doing so they reduce the player base significantly previously i m able to play with a wide variety of survivors and killers but lately i keep getting the same killer for several game in a row exactly the same killer choice and the same playing style of course same username or alias in the game as well it can only mean that people are abandoning the game as time goes by and the developers don t care about this condition as if they love being the killer and torture other survivors for as long as they like my advise to you is don t buy this game because it is no longer fun due to toxic community and toxic developer,240.5,27.0,0,Not Recommended,"April 30, 2023",Dead by Daylight,"Jade

59868,2020 i have been playing dead by daylight casually for almost four years i enjoyed the game immensely over that time even during the so called dark times the premise is sound the gameplay was at one point solid but the game has devolved and i can no longer support the developers for the following reasons 1 the developers are slow to act bugs stay in the game for months or years after being widely acknowledge currently there is an add on bug that affects the nurse killer that if even accidentally used can cause the player to be permanently banned from the game instead of removing the add on from play in a hotfix the developers have chosen to do nothing this is one example 2 the developers don t listen to the community if the community praises the developers or reinforces their chose path then the developers will acknowledge the praise and interact with those players if the community is critical of certain design decisions they are either told this is what we re doing or they re ignored outright no justification is given for certain decisions and some decisions are met with the reason because this is what we re doing 3 the community is incredibly toxic it isn t to rust levels of toxic chat logs can be submitted via reports after all however as the state of the game become more and more unstable the community is turning more against one another while the developers remain apathetic 4 survivor gameplay is stagnant for survivors the gameplay consists of either holding w or holding m1 despite what you may have seen from streamers or content creators the majority of games are an exercise in tedium 5 killer gamplay is frustrating without a proper fix for the underlying issues plaguing matches killers either spend matches mitigating the effects of survivors second chance abilities negating a killer s efforts completely or they completely dominate within minutes the back and forth that used to exist in the game no longer does to any satisfactory conclusion 6 there are alternatives last year exists resident evil resistance will soon be available with more options in the asymmetrical horror genre dead by daylight as bugged and imbalanced as it currently stands is primed to quickly lose its player base and die out in summary i cannot recommend this game the developers do not work for the community and often dismiss feedback it has seen its best years and it s on the decline there are other better options on the horizon and beginning to play now is a wasted investment of time and money,958.2,17.0,1,Not Recommended,"March 18, 2020",Dead by Daylight,DuctTapeJedi,False

59876,i ve never seen such a bad developer team to make so many bad decisions and don t care about the feedback of its community there are too many things that make the game really horrible to play they don t know or don t care how to balance perks and killers of this game i don t count how much perks that give killer a wall hack ability on a game that should be a hide and seek which doesn t reward at all the survivor for trying to hide from the killer each new killer they release is even more stupid and strong compare to other killers the system of anti face camp is useless af it doesn t stop like nurse huntress or other killer who can dash teleport speed boost to camp on the hook they nerf the size of the map that the killer can easily found you and camp on the generators i guess they prefer to make only skins to sell and put all the lgbtq charms instead of fixing the game oh yeah this community is also the most toxic i ve ever seen when a killer is doing game hostage camping on the hook focus only one survivor the 4 squad survivors bullying the killer etc league of legend community is better than this one i don t recommend this game except if you like suffering for nothing and when this studio is doing nothing to fix the game and prefer to do what they want instead of listening the feedback,536.1,88.0,21,Not Recommended,February 9,Dead by Daylight,"Blu Erikson

59878,2016 a horror multiplayer only game of 1v4 on the concept of cat and mouse whereas the mouse don t exactly fight back the game is really fun to play however suffers from issues and problems that needs to be sorted out for the value of what you get it is a very enjoyable game for those who are into it and will need more in order to retain its audience in the future video review youtube video dead by daylight review views 2 052 whew spent so many hours on this great fun game though needs some bug squash fixes some tweaks and more the concept is still fun twitch pros the atmosphere of the game and immersion whether you play the killer and get pumped to search out your prey or prepare to get scared silly as a survivor great selection of perks and itemization and the unlocking web choice behind it once you get higher level it starts blacking out certain parts sof the tree so you ll have to make choices items and mods will carry with you if you escape with whatever is left of it gameplay mechanic and rules are fun and rather well implemented great sounds effects and music to keep you on your toe the amount of hours you ll invest for the fun you ll get if you enjoy these type of games cons rebindable keys are missing multiplayer lobby bugs friend party system not working collision problems thesea re being sorted out in a patch will remove when it is done no graphic options tweaking proximity chat would be nice one where the killer can hear your characters and sort you out but without it the survivors are all completely muted it is quite dumb to tell someone to heal you by constantly crouching down in front of them and they balance tweaks needs to be done especially a bit more on wraith which defeats the purpose of the heartbeat meterthe wraith is way too easy to master and use even against a moderate to skillful teams of survivor you will lose one person or even everyone unless the wraith is really bad hook camping is a mechanic being used 95 of the games and needs to be tweaked out a good killer will always camp one person and there will be almost no chance to save them without being hurt or grabbed in which case it makes it almost impossible for a survivor to save that person unless he risks it this causes a domino effect where people will completely ignore other survivor 98 of the game with no incentive to save them even if you do give them the signals window cheesing still exist in the game some buildings has 3 windows and there is no way you can catch a fast survivor no matter how you try to outsmart them and also outmanuever them they can go through windows faster than you can even catch up to them survivors can disconnect games disconnecting survivors get win killers spoils the points for survivors need a cheat implementation as i am hearing talks that it has started although i haven t encountered any steam vac would be great last but not least the godamn flashlights are so useless even with addons and pointing directly in a killer s eyes i ve only accomplished this twice if the killer doesn t angle his camera a bit but it is so easily avoidable also as killer even the maps are more useful these are all the issues i really have with the game so far which weighs outthe pros a bit in my review to be honest and things that can be or will be fixed in the future but i have spent hours and hours on this game and actually enjoy it for the concept and the sheer weight of being pumped as a survivor when the heartbeat meters go off or when i am after them that i am doing it for the mighty blood god looking forward to more killers maps abilities and variety of game modes but for the price of 16 bucks i am not complaining too much,578.7,17.0,1,Recommended,"June 16, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"Kenuty

59887,2021 after playing a few hundred hours of dead by daylight and having this game for a year or so the game seems to excel in one particular area manufacturing discontent part 1 aesthetic from the seasonal skins in which you can view the paid versions provide much more aesthetic than the free as much of the free items as of lately have just been colored blocks with a simple symbol on them called charms the characters all seem to walk the same way now as their individuality that was originally intended as story elements has now been stripped for more of what i assume ease of programming however the characters have a real strangeness to them they all walk the same way and are designed to only be aesthetic changes but the game is built around stealth so an aesthetic change can wildly change your survivability and thus we have reached an odd crux of an issue how do you make a fair game when aesthetic is a stat either you have a pay to play or you have no such thing as variability between players certain characters cheryl and ace are less loud in their injuries than others making a main perk of the game called iron will basically built into those players those players are either obtained through grinding or payment the new killer wildly breaks the aesthetic of grimy killers which the game was known for and has mechanics similar to that of one of the already established killers the huntress as such the incorporation of such a killer can only be thought of to be some new aesthetic an aesthetic that breaks the game as every map in the game is known for its dull colors dead by daylight largely has a color of mud which is alright as it provides a spooky atmosphere the killers borrow this muddy aesthetic such as ghostface oni leatherface having dull color palettes the problem with the new killer the trickster is that he clearly does not fit into a swamp or an abandoned farm and the color palette and aesthetic that was chosen for him doesn t mesh it is clear he isn t intended for the maps or the game that was built but thrown into it to increase sales as such the horror associated with him is more of how awkwardly this man is forced to live in this game it is clear that the developers of the game are willing to bend whatever law they can make to build a profit from incorporating any horror theme that they can to introduce more new revenue this can be seen from the awkward transition of a city night life into the aesthetic of a rural campfire part 2 gameplay their seems to be a lack of new maps being added as the developers have found that retouching a map can make the game seem fresh enough to entice a player base back however this includes patching issues that should have never stayed for as long as they have such as but not limited to maps that have had rocks that lock your character in place if you hug a rock and seeing as a main portion of this game is stealth survival you will likely be hugging rocks lockers that you cannot pull a survivor out of which is a main mechanic of capturing them if you are a killer odd hitboxes that do not match up with character models in order to make the game even the rewards system hinges around survivability which often creates a strange passive aggressive nature to the game if the killer chooses to only chase you you will die and you will lose progress on your ranking as the killer is stronger than any one survivor that is if the killer only chases one person if you play alone the lack of communication between your teammates is bound to make this happen this is because the lack of coordination often means that the killer will not be punished for this play style as the main mechanic to punish this is to make sure that your teammates are progressing objectives if they do not know where the killer is or what the killer is up to other than they can occasionally know the killer is near them it is a lot more likely that they will be very inefficient at doing to the objectives now if the survivors are good then there are only a few times that you can save other survivors from the hook which is one of the fastest ways to get benevolent points and rank up you might not ever get into a chase due to the sunk cost of the killer having to tunnel one injured survivor when playing as the killer the survivors have lots of mechanics to be annoying stunning you in various manners and running away and it is in the manner of getting chased by being annoying that you gain points playing as a killer the only relief you get is knowing that the annoying survivors are dead due to the first person viewpoint of the killer almost all killers maneuver their attack ability in a straight line huntress trickster demigorgon lunge twins baby lunge deathslinger hillbilly nurse blink this means that as a survivor any ability the killer uses can be dodged by just veering from the straight line that the ability is used on while this can be compensated for as a killer in predicting the movements of a survivor this generally means that all survivor killer mechanics work essentially the same and as more killers come out the overlap will only get larger playing as a survivor your goal is to sabotage your teammates in order to gain more ranking which is built off of the premise that a good killer should be stronger than any one survivor and a good survivor should be in chases saving people and doing objectives such as gens putting those together someone from your group is naturally dying to further your game they have also reworked many of the abilities slightly for the same cause however that opens a new problem this game only has about 10 15 viable perks or abilities your character can choose between entering they have recently reworked a few perks to carry the same mechanics of other perks because the game is out of ideas but knows it needs to change something in order to make people come back part 3 itemsitems have a weird place in whether they are considered essential gameplay elements or not most killer sided items can change the game dramatically keys and previously mori s shortcut large portions of the game medkits and flashlights can prevent killer kills somewhat easily there are perks that make more survivor items and perks that killers can use to get rid of items however if items are essential then players should not have to grind to get certain items if they are not essential then the incorporation of them like toolboxes currently is pointless part 4 tldr conclusiondead by daylight was innovative when it came out but it s strive to consume all markets it has lost a identity and in that loss it has become an ever increasing empty husk of its former self continuously promising to improve and promote in hopes to keep the former market that believed in it it was never meant to be this big and the design limits that are inherent in its premise will only be magnified by the addition of future content while map tweaks and hitboxes can improve the game a somehow fair balance between survivor which and killer perks which are inherently lopsided due to the fact the player base has to be largely survivors for matches to be found 4 survivors to 1 killer and balancing matchmaking between survive with friends who communicate and someone who queues up solo is a nightmare can theoretically make the game better it is built to not be fun but around competing and competing against something that is stronger than any one of the survivors means that your gameplay is not based on much skill but the skill of killing off your allies before you which you will likely escape so if you are killer it is largely built off of not being able to accomplish killing all of the team either way it is not satisfying,667.7,18.0,1,Not

60028,2020 firstly i would just like to say that i am not an amazing dbd player my rank usually stays between 5 and 7 so there are much more experienced people who can give a more comprehensive and accurate review of this game than i can however as someone who has played over 600 hours of this game of both killer and survivor i think i know at least a little starting off the developer team is very out of touch with how it s game is played and it s playerbase and is shown whenever they only listen to one side or the other when considering balance changes if you want to play killer get ready for an uphill battle as you will be verbally berated at the end of maybe half of your matches by survivors for simple things like going back to check on a hooked survivor who hasn t been saved for awhile playing a killer that you enjoy to play but survivors find annoying or overpowered using perks that they deem annoying not farming for points with survivors when they want to or even making a few simple mistakes during a match even when you re new to the game if you want to play survivor it s very simple and easy to get away with a pip rank progression most matches because the game is much more rigged in your favor you have 3 other teammates that the killer can chase to give you time to complete objectives other than being chased for pipping however killers can feel pressured to continuously chase survivors off of generators and never be able to commit to a fun or exciting chase or pressured to ignore the generators and just go for one good chase since how hopeless it feels to keep people off of generators my review is definitely killer biased but that is because while it is becoming easier and more fun as survivor killer matches only feel stressful and frustrating i do still love the idea of playing killer but it is definitely not the power role anymore as you feel like you are the one being dragged through hoops most of the match i do not recommend this game because the whole thing just feels like a joke and has become too tiring for me to care enough anymore to stick with it,725.7,16.0,1,Not Recommended,"January 25, 2020",Dead by Daylight,Trash Goblin,False

60051,2020 with dbd s new release of the silent hill dlc i had to put out a review that i ve been sitting on for awhile now if i could give this game an eh rating with a maybe if it s on sale buy it if you feel like a few good games i would now i don t have hundreds of hours on dbd like others do but i have a fair amount that i feel like i should say something the game is a mess at times pushing cosmetic items that you pay real money for instead of in game currency to releasing dlc s for killers that sometimes are good sometimes are bad this game has always had issues or grinding how ever many hours just to unlock a killer with in game currency or a singular cosmetic item the game is buggy preventing you from ranking up sometimes it s the hit boxes sometimes it s you dcing unintentionally and losing your rank that easily it s annoying and disappointing at the same time considering how fun the game is when there isn t bugs preventing you from being downed or even getting into the game the matchmaking is beyond annoying when it comes to the ranking being put in with greys to purples and reds when you aren t anywhere close to that rank then those people diss you at the end of the match or choose to not help you if you accidently stab them after missing a skill check to heal them because you re clearly a grey rank and just getting the hang of things with that being said don t get me started on the community that s one reason why i haven t played it as much as i had prior you do such a small thing like loop a killer or manage to get out of their sight and youre suddenly the bad guy for playing your part as the survivor some will camp you on the hook some will dc on you some will tunnel you i m a survivor main and at this point it s just plain frustrating to be completely honest it kills the game for me not to mention how much crap people give you if you play with friends despite the game having the option it s looked down upon to other players for whatever reason claiming it s an unfair advantage but the game offers it expect people to use it learn from the experience and move on don t diss them after the match is over if you lose or win it s honestly that simple the devs don t care and i ve honestly been waiting to see if this game turns out like deathgarden although with the game going into the 4th year part of me doubts it but the toxic community is going to kill it at least for me anyways that being said there are some cool factors to the game the whole horror idea is great the classic horror icons is fun the whole idea of the game is great i loved it had a lot of fun with it in the past but recently the bad out weigh the good for me and i launch the game to immediately close it after one match because i m reminded of how annoying the game is to play i know the community is a bit hard to fix in a game but i ve had the conversation many times with friends of how they could stop the hook camping or tunneling etc and it just seems that the devs don t care in that sense they make the money they release killers survivors and don t fix many bugs just a few to get everyone to shut up and carry on it just kinda sucks from how fun the game used to be turning out like this and a lot of camping and dcing because people get frustrated with it part of me just wishes the devs would sit down and realize if they hadn t already the flaws of the game and community and attempt to put into play how to fix certain things instead of just being focused on dlc s and cosmetic items because i m sorry but that might bring new players but it won t keep them for long once they realize how faulty the game actually is,283.6,48.0,17,Not Recommended,"June 18, 2020",Dead by Daylight,Crimmy,False

60085,2017 let me start of by saying that i ve never been rank 1 and have only experienced playing against or with rank 1 players a handfull of times also i mainly play killer so this review will be mostly from that perspective that being said this is a really good game it has great atmosphere and sound lovely maps and a competitive feeling whilst staying casual enough to mess around in with friends no matter what you play be it killer or survivor expect a few losses in the first game because there is a small learning curve at the moment of writing this review the game is relatively balanced and in a very playable state you ll have a lot of fun playing as either killer or survivor if you are lower rank however there are also some glaring problems with the game namely the connection because the killer is always the host if your killer has a bad connection everyone has a bad connection there is also the issue of survivors ragequitting when being hooked to keep their items which makes it harder for killers to rank up at the moment of writing this review there is absolutly no reason except for a little derank to quit to keep your items but my biggest problem with the game is that balancing issues stay in game for way too long and it can take up to months for a single unbalanced issue to be resolved still in it s current state i d say this game is worth picking up especially if you got some friends who play it,221.9,18.0,2,Recommended,"July 31, 2017",Dead by Daylight,"ricebal

60107,2019 ignore anyone s review with anything less than 500 hours they most likely don t know how to play survivor or killer correctly this game has an extremely high skill cap and not being skilled at it will yield an annoying experience as you ll go down a lot as survivor or not get kills often as killer with that said here it goes first i ve met one of my best friends through this game as well as countless other good friends i still talk to and i wouldn t trade that for anything this game has yielded great experiences from when i first played survivor crouching around the map to recent days of running from and messing with the killer i should say i play killer survivor with a 50 50 split i ve achieved rank 1 with killer and survivor multiple times but you re most memorable times will probably come from playing survivor anyways this game has been a blast a truly fun experience learning how to run from the killer or learning how to mind game survivors as the killer with a decent twitch community behind it there s always something new to watch or learn about the game but i can t in good faith recommend this game and it really hurts to say that the main problem with this game is you aren t rewarded for ranking up there are no rewards for your work you re actually penalized as you rank up this game becomes much more toxic survivors and killers both because of their high rank will feel entitled to the win survivors will t bag and troll you and make sure you know in post game chat their opinion of whether you should be toaster bathing yourself or not and if you become a good survivor it makes a lot of killers mad oh you ran me for 3 gens that s an automatic facecamp facecamp is when the killer hooks the survivor and doesn t leave them to make sure they die and yes that s an actual quote said to me which makes you de pip partial de rank which is another thing the ranks every game is ranked whether you like it or not and if ranking up is your main goal prepare to be disappointed if the killer disconnects you de pip load in the game and one of the survivors didn t load in and its a 1v3 probably a de pip made the killer mad somehow and now he s facecamping you de pip double pip is extremely hard nowadays you have to do pretty much everything to do so so most games will be just a normal pip but that game where you pipped that took 20 minutes well next game you got found first and hooked and as soon as you were unhooked the killer tunnels you immediately and downs and hooks you again so back down your rank goes rinse and repeat i guess what i m trying to say each game is a coin flip of it ll be a toxic waste of time or an actual enjoyable game the main problem in this game is one you won t face unless you get to rank 1 which is that at the core of the game survivors control the game and are much stronger than the killer the time it takes to down one good survivor 3 or 4 gens will be done and extend that time depending on if they have decisive strike or not which essentially is a get out of jail free card but like i said that s only with good optimal playing survivors so now that i ve talked about the game play let s talk about the stability of the game and it s developers bad real bad constant survivor dc s when game starts loading screens getting stuck you name it and every time the game fails to load you lose your offering that s right even if you don t actually load in the game your offering still gets used up sucks for you i guess also i don t exaggerate when i say with every patch or dlc release a slew of bugs come with it i don t know whats up with this game s code but every time they tweak something it opens the flood gates to bugs the devs hardly seem to listen as well people have been asking to buff freddy since he was released still nothing people have been complaining about decisive strike being too strong nothing they said those 2 things are both in the works but does it really take over a year to hear your loyal players out i guess they have their development road map is top dog and well thought out criticism can take a back seat one time when the game s lead designer was asked in a qna about what to do when killer gets too frustrating because it s so stacked against the killer at times making it literally impossible to win he said to go play civ 5 i m not kidding the devs just see us as crying kids not happy that the game isn t perfect but we don t want it perfect we ve played the hell out of it we love it we want it to be better and it could be and it s a shame it isn t because i love this game but it s a buggy unbalanced unrewarding grind which is another topic by itself i m talking 300 hours or so to get all the perks on everyone without prestiging and it s just not worth it i don t regret the time i put into this game but it s not something i can recommend i know the market is a bit short of multiplayer horror games but this is less horror and more a game of toxic bug ridden tag it hurts to say but don t waste your time,890.5,57.0,12,Not Recommended,"February 6, 2019",Dead by Daylight,lessthan3,False

60444,2017 do i love this game yes i really do can i recommend it to new players no to put it in a rather crass way killers are in a toxic abusive relationship with the devs time after time we re treated like clowns by the development team given something cool to play with only for it to be nerf hammered into oblivion for every crutch we get the survivors get 10 we get a neat perk survivors get voi survive with friends and skype hangouts discord gives the survivors a psychic link which demonstrably breaks the game we get an edge the survivors cry and cry and the devs listen to them the survivor community has been babied and spoiled for months and at this point killers are just tired many have uninstalled i play less and less with every update since it feels like the devs don t care main issues swf breaks the game the devs know this but fear a backlash or drop in sales or popularity if the devs let us choose wether we face survive with friends or not then i ll remove this killer perks have been nerfed repeatedly because anything half decent is labelled as a game breaking op power devs nerfect iron grasp because it was so overused instead they should have asked why does every killer feel like they need iron grasp killers are repeatedly nerfed since survivors refuse to adapt to them and learn this is unfair and makes us feel unwanted survivors can block killers they don t like on mlga and this is toxic third party software is being allowed ban it i love this game for so many reasons and it hurts me that i have to leave a negative review i hope that someday i can update this to reflect what the game should be and give it a positive score,532.1,117.0,2,Not Recommended,"November 8, 2017",Dead by Daylight,vwig,False

60667,2021 edit this review was made for an old version of the game problems were partially solved still game s toxic af i recommend against it if you appreciate your mental health just a bit the feeble mind of the community can t understand the gargantuan sized brain of bhvr i mean they seem to know what the community wants even though they cry out loud against it also here is a list of problems that were reported and passed the ptb survivors now look like they are preparing for a picnic instead of running from a killer previous ui elements are now dispersed along the screen with the previous ui you would collect information from one quick glance over the bottom left now you need to scan the entire screen to get the same information hitbox s size are now inversely proportional to community approval roll a d20 to see if it hits advantage applied progressing in the rank system actually makes you regress in the rank system i e gaining a pip makes you actually lose the pip if you are hooked game will play dance music won t decide to play a fade in or a fade out for current soundtrack so it will play both effects at random intervals as a spectator if a survivor is hooked music will decide to die until you close the game perk dead hard is now triggered 1 2 seconds after the player actually wants to use it in loading match screen players could make the server angry and get disconnected in tandem spectating a survivor that is escaping makes the game enter into a tantrum and freeze your screen this does not produce a crash but you have to close the game as it will not let you play anymore analyzing it more reflexively this may be intentional to be the stress factor in the horror tag survivors may phase into a wall and become stuck there survivor won t be able to move and can t be hit by the killer making the game take itself hostage until the survivor or the killer decides to uninstall the game as a survivor if you don t escape you will not progress in the ranking system and guess what you will not escape too often making higher ranks of survivors more sweaty and scummy timer progression is now displayed as a shade of bright red over bright red,184.2,17.0,2,Not Recommended,"February 10, 2021",Dead by Daylight,"Frigionman

60714,2022 behavior isn t a video game developer they re a video game company whether you buy the game and play for 2 hours or buy it and play for 500 you bought the game once and that s all that matters to them they ll keep you around and confused with absurd balance changes while they slap a new licensed killer into the game for new players to oggle at the game has no anti cheat easy anti cheat is as much of an anti cheat system as a single square of thin gas station toilet paper is toilet paper you know it s there but you don t feel like it is and it s a situation that you re gonna have to wash your hands of eventually the game has no internal checks for cheaters they can do the most obvious that a single if then line of code could detect basic goo goo ga ga baby that a 12 year old with a functioning pair of eyes could see as wrong like survivors flying around the map and clipping through walls pretty sure the game is supposed to depict the slasher genre slightly more than cosmic horror basic things that any games company could implement in a matter of hours like a simple colorblind filter are an impossible task for the developers and don t think you can get a sensible response from them outside of the devs putting their fingers in their ears and shouting until you leave there are so many things in this game that need an update trapper the main icon of the game is ironically one of the weakest and most outdated killers in the roster he s such a product of his time that you d think he was designed without survivor perks in mind wasting so much time just setting up a power that barely provides any payoff unless you re extremely skilled with it newer killers get these fancy kill animations where the older ones just slap the survivor with their blade a few times half of the perks in the game are just plain bad or should get combined a few of them are even a straight detriment to the player i think the worst part for me is just the amount of time it takes to get any decent builds in this game assuming you only want to get to level 40 with each killer in order to get their respective perks you d need about 1 3 million bloodpoints for each killer there are 27 killers in the game that s 35 million bloodpoints just to get every perk unlocked let alone getting all the perks for one killer let s assume you get 26k bloodpoints every game pretty decent and assuming you don t use anything that boosts your gain that s 1350 games that you need to get every perk if each game is 20 minutes long that s 450 hours of nonstop gameplay just to unlock every killer s perk now you re ready to start dumping even more bp into each killer just to get them to prestige 3 and then get them every perk in the game if you want to be able to slap any 4 perks together on whatever killer you feel like playing you ll have to wait until you re so burned out from playing the game that you can tell what color underwear a player is wearing just by watching them play yes i know that players are gonna be running bbq chili and whatever other stuff to boost their bp gain but the amount of time it takes to get to a point where players have the freedom to choose to play with what they want is ridiculous by the time you get to where the game can start being really fun it stops being fun wake up you re in a coma this is the only way we can communicate this to you nothing you see is real it s all in your head please wake up anyway in conclusion the game is dumb and i m not playing it anymore until i do but don t think i ll enjoy it which i will sometimes but most of the time i definitely wont,350.3,22.0,3,Not Recommended,"March 1, 2022",Dead by Daylight,"Saugan

60737,2019 honestly i really wish i could recommend this i enjoyed this game at first but it s steadily been getting worse i have witnessed myself going from enjoying this game constantly to almost always hating it there are two big problems with this game 1 every time the game is updated new bugs get introduced that are used to exploit the survivors and make it killer sided the game devs are also continuously making the game more killer sided to the point that it makes you feel like you should play killer to have fun new killers are getting more and more broken and the culmination of the killer perks makes it too easy to create a broken killer build survivor actions are always becoming harder to perform as of lately pallet dropping has felt unresponsive and breaks the game you or the killer will be teleported on some end of the pallet and you ll be hit half the time that is assuming you re lucky enough to actually perform the pallet drop when they get close sometimes you ll be the in middle of the animation and it will just be canceled out by the killer hitting you somehow 2 this community is one of the most toxic online communities i have ever been apart of it honestly sickens me how much hate is thrown around and how everyone wants to play this game in a toxic manner if you re not professional at this game and make a mistake instantly hated by your teammates if you re killer and make a mistake they call you out on it and beat your head into the ground almost every killer that i run into now tunnels people and or face camps them your chance of surviving is pretty zero if the killer finds you because they will hunt you down to the ends of the earth i ve even bare witnessed cases where my friends threw themselves in front of the killer and the killer still chased me down to make sure they could kill me the game devs have implemented systems to discourage tunneling and face camping but it seems like more and more killers are doing it survivors also love to play in toxic ways survivors are always ready to teabag in front of you and spam flashlights if you re not great at the game then be prepared to be pallet looped because people love exploiting this game both sides also love to use add ons add ons honestly break this game and make it even more unbalanced which is baffling if a killer brings the highest level of add on you might as well disconnect because you ll just be killed within a minute or two because the killer is now broken i really don t recommend playing this game unless you have friends who own and it goes on sale playing it solo is asking to be paired up with someone who will mess up a skill check and get you killed prestige doesn t mean a thing in this game prestige killers and survivors will still play like brand new players this game also uses system where the killer will host a lobby and everyone connects to them if the killer has bad internet then you re going to have a tough time the anti cheat system in this game is also non existent if you know someone is cheating then it s not even worth it to report them because they won t get banned the game devs have also recently decided that saving other survivors was too easy now your ability to save other survivors using pallets and flashlights doesn t exist i never see it work anymore supposedly you are still able to do it but i never see it work i hope you find this review helpful and that if you buy the game then you run into as little toxicity as possible good luck out there because you re going to need it,195.8,28.0,5,Not Recommended,"April 19, 2019",Dead by Daylight,"T.L.S.

60765,summary probably one of the worst games ive ever played horribly imbalanced and hardly any of the players adhere to the unwritten rules why even have unwritten rules just balance the game yeah the developers do not know how to balance a game and only make it worse with each update i swear every time i come back to the game it has gotten worselet me list out the reasons why this game sucks because why not this game needs serious help imbalanced for most players who havent played for 1000 hours skill based matchmaking does not exist like seriously i have less than 200 hours and i often get put against people with over 1k playing as survivor is a death wish if you aren t full stacking the players are horribly toxic especially killers which is laughable since they already have the upper hand instead of balancing the game the devs expect you to follow the unwritten rules which i ve noticed less and less people doing the fact that unwritten rules exist at all public matches are the most unfun experiences you will ever have as a survivor unless you like the feeling of panicking every 15 seconds in which case go for it there s probably a lot more but these are the ones that come to mind firstand heres the reason why i even come back to this game cool characters collabs but there is a catch to that positive comment the devs are just too greedy collab after collab i m sure they re raking in the cash keep in mind this is already a paid game and yet still cant manage to balance their game besides like 5 survivors and killers the rest of them all require you to pay that or grind for hours upon hours to make enough shards to buy just one here s hoping you haven t lost your sanity by then listen i m all for devs getting paid well i m one myself so i get it but i dont think you deserve to be paid well if you re just squeezing the game for every penny i know it costs to do collabs and all but at this point the game s too far gone to justify putting any more development cash into collabs and characters the love that should be put into a game like this just doesnt exist i mean if you really loved your game you d be able to find out how to balance it at least enough for it to not be noticeable every game for everyone not just the players with 1k hours i got this game to play with my friends and even then i just can t find it fun at this point every game we get into now is just a cycle of tunneling camping and slugging by killers with multiple times more hours than us im guessing a fair share of the positive recommendations are coming from people who play killer like that so just ignore thempersonally i refuse to support this game any more i used to and i regret it and that s why i wrote this review i rarely write reviews unless a game is especially good or bad and unfortunately this game falls into the especially bad side,180.3,19.0,3,Not Recommended,April 26,Dead by Daylight,"Kitteholic

61008,2016 great concept horrendous execution basically same story from when i participated in the beta and did not buy the game then was hoping it would be better than beta this time it s not disclaimer before all the fanbois say git gud i have a win rate going of about 80 by the time the beta ended i was winning almost literally every game i usually only lose if things are completely bonkers like the things listed below fun things all the bugs from when i did the beta are still there i ve been jammed in geometry twice now with half my legs sticking into the ground if the killer has bad internet your whole game is you teleporting into walls since he acts as server because he acts as server he controls the game basically his computer recieves and syncs all data from all survivors so his computer knows everything going on in game draw what conclusions from that you wish if the killer has really bad internet you might lose connection and that counts as you losing and him winning even though it was his internet that caused it matchmaking is non existent it just shoves you into the first available game so if you re new you could be going up against a ridiculously equipped killer or vice versa you re a killer up against pro survivors if you want to vault over two objects in a row to escape after vaulting over the first object the game will disregard the direction you are running completely and make you back flip back over the first object and straight into the killer s arms this is actually pretty funny since sometimes your arms bend in impossible ways did i mention desync if the killer has bad internet if he sees that he hit you on his screen but you re 20 feet away on your screen guess what you re still hit sometimes the game doesn t render objects so you ll slam right into an invisible wall or rock and tons of other riduclous things the steam s rules and guidelines won t let me mention without this getting deleted this is beta at best wait a year and for a deep deep sale i m thinking i ll buy during summer 2017 steam sale if it s 5 dollars or less friday the 13th the game that will be out soon and is same idea but will hopefully be far more polished this game was clearly rushed out the door possibly to capture the market before friday the 13th,149.3,56.0,6,Not Recommended,"August 20, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"Fox Reinhold

61011,2018 the game itself is a easy to understand easy to get into ideal the killer and survivors are fun the maps are good minus a fewthe commuinty can be toxic but overall really love and enjoy the game and we have supported it through many a error sadly these errors have stack up for me and i can not in good faith give this game a thumbs up for the below reasons1 balance there is so little balance the ideal is to be like a scary hide and go seek but instead it feels like a game of tag your out but witha kid who wont leave and claim you never tagged him the killers feel like scooby doo killers who always miss and cant catch the survivors and the survivors feel like pro track running jocks even though some of them are supposed have a limp 2 bugs the devs are constantly making new and newer bugs for both killers and survivors i even remember when they were banning people for a bug they made themselfs3 lack of dedicated servers this is a personal complain but if they could make servers so we could have a minimum latancy like 50 70 every game that be so good however you can get anywhere from 50 300 ping from game to game there is also a trick where killers can make the game lag and killers never lag4 characteristics this is another personal one all survivors feel and act like the same person they have no unique stats or skills nor perks as the devs thought it be a good ideal to be able make perks teachable thus ending uniqueness and is one the major reasons this game is inbalancedi will rewrite this review if they ever fix this damn game,129.8,18.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 16, 2018",Dead by Daylight,"Schrödinger

61144,2017 tl dr the game is fun and awesome when you can successfully get into a fair game key phrases being successfully get into and fair game full review dead by daylight is a fantastic idea 4 unwitting victims from many different walks of life each with their own unique abilities and skills trying to survive as 1 killer who can be many different monsters from michael myers to a swamp witch tries to hunt you down you frantically try to start the generators to power the exit to escape the killers without being killed did i mention that at full build the game is actually well balanced i m not going to delve into all the mechanics of the game just see some gameplay footage for that but it s fun and feels like it could be anybody s game you re probably wondering why i m not recommending the game the problem is those sorts of games are about 1 in 10 let s start with the first big problem multiplayer netcode the multiplayer feels like an origin game in closed alpha our match ratio of lobbies formed to games played was nearly 6 1 because we averaged about 4 5 lobby crashes before we got a game and about 1 in 3 games either the killer dced before the game started i assume this was a server error rather than actually dc had a lagfest of a game to the point of teleportation all 4 in our party not on the same internet or once the game disconnected 2 of us and the killer and other player still alive stayed in no idea what kind of error that is the current system depipped me twice over killer dcs and also allows for teleport hacks by way of terrible internet even if the host is causing upward of 1000ms ping you can t disconnect without depipping also the game crashes too i witnessed it many many times last night furthermore the lost connection error in lobby screen also should not close the whole game rather exit to title let me repeat if you get a certain sever error you have to exit the game and restart it the multiplayer feels like an early access game or even a closed alpha the multiplayer is worse than titanfall 2 a game that was lauded by critics and almost everyone who played it but ultimately failed due to atrocius multiplayer and release window timing onto the second big problem matchmaking the current system allows for anyone waiting for more than 2 minutes to completely circumvent matchmaking and there is only ranked mode starting from your first game in a game that s been released for a year there is no quickplay and in ranked mode you can easily be placed against people much much better let me show you imgur com a game i played last night one of my first 10 games ever for context rank 20 is the worst possible rank and 1 is the very best i am a rank 20 it s like bronze vs challenger grandmaster to compare to more popular multiplayer titles this also leads us to a side note the grind in dead by daylight each character has their own unique bloodweb to sum it up you deposit in game currency and it spits out an assortment of random one use items offerings which are one use items that affect the whole game rather than your character and perks basically your extra skills unfortunately for you each character has a unique bloodweb and each one is ridiculously expensive to even unlock all 4 perks the fact that you can t even equip 4 perks until ridiculously high level nonwithstanding did i mention perks come in three tiers that are increasingly rare and therefore require even more grind basically the grind is league of legends tier in a game you pay for that s completely unacceptable let alone players with all level 3 perks and super rare items against players with one level 1 perk in a ranked game let alone the skill gap of the highest possible rank vs a team average of rank 17 these problems lead to even more problems like pushing away new players from a dying game a game where you get stomped over and and over again for hundreds of games if you even manage to load in will cause a lot of refunds and 2 1 hour playtime accounts oh yeah the graphics are mediocre at best even on ultra settings i could go on but for the sake of keeping this review sub novel length i ll just conclude with this this game is an alpha that the devs are treating as if it was finished don t buy it the good concept balance the bad grind graphicsthe fugly netcode matchmakingedit coming to you live from a new error the infinite loading screen a pip is a ranked point you need 3 to rank up depipping is the confiscation of a pip at full buildedit 2 hey guys it s been a wild ride since i bought the game and wrote this review tl dr they have dratically changed the game balance through a series of new stronger killers and a rework of an old killer making him significantly stronger along with other changes furthermore the devs don t think griefing defined as ruining the game for another player even if it disadvantages you is a problem i would not recommend this game more strongly now,299.0,25.0,2,Not Recommended,"July 7,

61164,2017 you gotta love how most negative reviews are from people with less than 150 hours and most positivites are from people with 500 hours this speaks for itself for me personally dead by daylight is the best game in this kind it s unique have good game mechanics it s rewarding and have high replay value with procedurally generated progression and maps i think this all togethers creates a good game which can be enjoyed by boths sides survivors and killers while game totally have a lot of balancing issues the core gameplay aspect is satisfaying enough to ignore them and simply enjoy hiding from killer or blasting survivors on hooks the devs are doing livestreams every week to keep in contact with the community and inform of the upcoming changes or playerbase concerns so i do really believe the balance issues and bugs are going to be fixed sooner or later the upcoming patch 1 5 seems to be turn in good direction for example now that i talked about good things lets go to the bad ones that i will try to explain thoroughly swf is broken so is normal matchmaking for killers sometimes i feel like i m spending a lot of time in lobby as killer finding game as survivor is easy though i would love this game to receive dedicated servers but it s not gonna happen most likely which is sad perk balance could be better currently the survivors meta which i don t follow personally i find it boring bases around saving yourself not your team it s all about self care sprint burst or decesive strike boring boring boring buff the perks that benefit the team to encourage teamplay and more altruistic gameplay killers meta is actually more varied than survivors one since every killer is unique on it s own with it s own power the movement speed the killer size and lunges all these things actually affect the perks you would want to use on a said killer so while meta for killers definately exist for example machinegun or mirror builds are very popular it s still in much better place than survivors pallet looping and camping i have my own personal opinion on that and most would disagree with me i think both of those things actually hurts the one using it so it s not a huge issue that anyone should be angry about both are just a bad strategy that does not benefit you in any way pallet looping generally is going to waste more killer time sure but is also going to make any map pallet less in 5 10 minutes which in effect is going to make it harder for your other 3 teammates to escape the killer in a long run if you want to survive as entire team you should start actually breaking line of sight hiding from the killer behind trees or obstacles not abuse the pallet looping and make it harder for your team camping you camp hook other survivors do gens you lose the match with one kill if you are satisfied with that well good for you but survivors won nothing more to say bloodlust in 1 5 is totally going to reduce survivors abusing the pallet looping and infinites while killers would be more encouraged to actually leave the hook since the speed boost to chases both sides win toxic community if you could ever call them a community most of the people complaining flaming baiting and trolling are the ones that play the game the least but sit on steam forum the most once again bad reviews from less than 150 hours the real community is busy playing the actual game if i could ever suggest something to devs it would be to balance the f all survivor perks and encourage improve stealth aspect of the game in some way whenever it would be new game mechanic stealth points new stealth perks or new ways to hide from killer this would encourage players to actually hide and use pallets less overall i think the game is worth the try been enjoying it since i bought it and i can see myself mastering every aspect of it and finding suitable perk builds ones that does not contain self care and sprintburst for sure from killers i mostly enjoyed wraith love the invisibility power and strategizing when and where to strike but i can see myself playing trapper after 1 5 comes out since he received buff to the trap placement speed taking all what i wrote into consideration i would give this game 8 10 1 for perk balance and boring meta respect to those who actually uses perks that benefit the team 1 for devs taking so slow to fix the issues since release if devs want to make the game more stealthy and less runny runny it shouldn t take them 10 months to get to the conclusion how to accomplish that i hope my review helped anyone to decide whenever to buy this game or not cheers,216.4,74.0,4,Recommended,"April 16, 2017",Dead by Daylight,"EFG.Wenex ヽ(´ー｀)ノ

61198,2016 highly recommend this game not only can most machines these days run it minimum is a gtx 460 but it runs very well too dead by daylight is a really nice take on the killer in a horror movie type of games right now it offers 3 killers and 12 maps in 4 styled areas each map is randomly generated so it s never the same you cant learn the layout as it s impossible the developers have stated that they plan to hand out alot of free dlc as well as paid dlc but here is the best part if you don t have the dlc do not worry as long as someone in your lobby has it then you can play it they arent seperating the playerbase this is what we want in games these days nobody likes being seperated from the others because they arent willing to pay up each killer has their own special perks and traits 1st the trapper brandishing a meat clever the trapper has the ability to place down rusty bear traps over the map if someone steps in it then they must get help from a friend or try to take it off themselves while in this state the trapper can pick them up and put them on a hook to sacrifice them they can also be downed by being hit twice with the weapon then we have the 2nd the hillbilly the hillbilly is based off the chainsaw massacre he has a hammer similar to the trapper s clever but he also has something else his special ability is a chainsaw the chainsaw is an instant down and when activated the hillbilly can only charge straight ahead but is lightning fast it s truly terrifying in game 3rd is my all time favorite the wraith the wraith is a very up being not only can the wraith go invisible but it does not trigger the action music when he is nearby so unless you manage to see him then you wont know but to counter this survivors can listen for creepy bells to know when he is nearby also his weapon is badass now the survivors i can t go into too much detail as i havent played them all but there are 4 survivors and each has a special ability abilities aswell but you only gain access to as you level up some are good at running helping others distracting and more which is awesome the game takes quite a while to get boring as you never know what you are against as survivors but you can also be the killer too and the randomly generated maps are a nice touch and it s very easy to get lost it s filled with tense moments should you go save your friend or run for the exit found a flashlight a flashlight is an item ingame you can find which if shined in the kilelrs face can blind and stun them maybe you can distract the killer and have someone else unhook your friend theres alot of choices and things to loom out for i only briefed you on half of the things as i want to get back to playing the game but i hope i gave you a general idea of what the game is about pros randomly generated maps teamwork very fun and forces you to use your brain not graphically intensive but still looks great free content in the future and dlc that doesnt seperate the playerbase and more cons there have been reports of crashing but i personally haven t seen any with my experience in the beta or the full game no friend play against randoms only against other friends but they will add this feature soon,200.4,20.0,0,Recommended,"June 14, 2016",Dead by Daylight,"Trans Goat Girl

61297,2018 i love this game i truly do however i have to leave a negative rating just simply because of how horrible the matchmaking can be and how it mostly is if you play survivor you will probably get matched up against a killer who is incredibly amazing and kills everyone without breaking a sweat on the other hand when you play as a killer you will have to deal with survivors who pallet loop use flashlights 360 you and teabag every time you have to break a pallet or when they re at the exit and they just stand there taunting you because they know you can t do anything and they want to make your experience as horrible as possible that s the issue with this game is the terribly toxic people who play it whether it is a killer who is face camping you or a survivor who is pallet looping using a flashlight or 360ing you you can t win this will be the downfall of this game if behaviour doesn t do something to fix this as i previously stated i love this game but god most of the people who play it completely ruin it,113.3,24.0,4,Not Recommended,"June 13, 2018",Dead by Daylight,"Nekularr

61322,2017 don t play this game with your wife gf etc it s toxic for relationships this is a tough one i love this game but i also hate it the game can be so much fun yet it can also get so frustrating progression in ranks resets every month so you get new players and prestiged ones all in the same pool for matchmaking it is so imbalanced that it can put people with 10 hours and 2000 hours in the same game then there are people that de rank themselves on purpose so that they can play with easy inexperienced players to feed their egos the victory cube update totally screwed the game up yet the devs won t admit it before the update ranking up was easier for killers they just had to make points and it didn t matter how they made them they would take more chances play smarter risk a hook for the thrill of a chase and overall it was just more fun for both sides killers are just camping hooks now even after setting traps and hexes or they just stay in blink chainsaw hatchet distance with insidious perk can t blame them completely since the update kind of forces them to secure kills in order to progress in ranks but it has totally taken the fun out of the game killers can see survivors profiles and characters they can equip perks and addons depending on what the survivors are bringing to the match flashlights immune to burn toolboxes hex ruin etc they can decide to dodge lobbies when they come up against experienced survivors however survivors can t see sh t what is even worse is the killers host the game and they don t even have a ping indicator in the game you go in blind and start running into walls and trees if you disconnect you are kind of betraying your teammates gifting the killer a secure kill and losing 3 pips from your progression there are 3rd party addons to show latency mlga but they really need to build one into the game also the feature to block face camping killers so you don t have to play with them again it s not an aaatitle it s not really expensive but it has 27000 people playing right now it s probably too much to handle for a small studio so things take a while to get fixed it has so much potential and it s different than other survival games of it s kind but i wouldn t recommend the game in it s current state,706.1,100.0,16,Not Recommended,"August 6, 2017",Dead by Daylight,NCblast,False

61659,2022 tldr you got my hours and you got my 20 but if it weren t for spending time with my friends ruining a killers day irl you wouldn t have over the years i ve seen a lot from dead by daylight from staff being blatantly rude to fellow staff on livestream to the universally extreme toxicity of the player base but sadly very little of has been innovative gameplay changes from the times of only 4 killers to today s 29 the game has managed to become convoluted in all the wrong ways and survive exclusively on marketing itself as hard as it can to new people via licensed killers i do love seeing my hollywood favorites make their rare appearances but the clear reliance on featured killers for funding is becoming more apparent as time goes on 7 of the last 11 releases are licensed killers for example with one of these killers being a k pop star and another having been removed from the game due to an expiration of its license stranger things demogorgon it appears hard hitters are running out and original content is wearing thin no matter how you slice it 29 killers 33 survivors is admittedly an impressive cast assuming you re willing to spend up to 5 for each additional un owned killer survivor on top of the base game price if you don t you will not have access to their perks which are made to counter other existing perks in a rock paper scissors style battle royale of over 100 different perks in combinations of 4 this puts you at a disadvantage immediately upon purchase stopping here wouldn t be underachieving as there is a number of copy pasted ways to play the one single game mode they offer as a killer however this is also somewhat misleading as the game is only marginally affected by the killer survivors have a clear and extreme advantage due to the nature of the game s development balancing for an ever increasing cast of characters is absolutely not an easy thing to do however one thing has remained consistent throughout the years development has moved forward under the assumption that players will not have any way of communicating with each other irl there is no in game chat system outside of the lobby however everyone obviously circumvents this by using discord or the like dbd is absolutely an intense and fun game without voice chat it s the equivalent of a cheat code yet it s rampant in every game at every level and there s no way to stop it smurfs and friends alike will not willingly play the game silent with each other as survivors and for that reason with few exceptions hordes of survivor teams make playing the game as a killer at anything other than an extremely high level unbearably frustrating as someone who has spent probably 685 of my 785 hours as a survivor i can tell you that extremely minor coordination between only 2 out of 4 people can guarantee your success even at the highest level it s not even remotely close how much easier it is to play as a survivor than a killer this sadly encourages that extreme toxicity i mentioned early poor management of rank increase points referred to as pips in this game leads to the promotion of bad mannered gameplay in an effort to get ahead constant resets of the ranks in game reaffirms it doesn t matter in the first place and also further messes up the matchmaking as professionals will team up with brand new players it only takes a little time in between playing the game and having a life outside of steam aside from the additional monetization for licensed and original killers they also have a battle pass where they offer extremely pathetic cosmetics in favor of hoarding the especially nice ones for the in game store which they also offer i do not generally dislike battle passes or stores for entirely cosmetic items but when you sell one with the intent of holding back so you can fill the other with the more desired and expensive items in order to cash out on both it s scummy skins can be pretty sick tho for a game with an incredibly fun premise a sizable cast years of history and an impressive number of concurrent players it s sad that a worthless rank system extreme imbalance between coordinated survivors and the lone killer greedy business practices general human shi iness and only 1 single constantly updating game mode is holding this back from being a juggernaut game edit it was pointed out to me the stranger things perks are not lost to the shrine of secrets but instead are now standard bloodweb perks i suppose that s 6 out of 128 not to worry about but not really the point also you still can t use the characters,820.3,16.0,2,Not Recommended,"September 16, 2022",Dead by Daylight,Detour,False

61749,2020 game is supposed to be asymmetrical giving more power to the killer as opposed to the weaker survivors problem is there is an option to play with friends which allows for teamspeak and coordination among survivors which negates the power level a well organized team cannot be beat this can be seen by the tournaments that are held where they are scored by points and not kills the second isnt as big of a problem because it seems to be the norm in any game but i ll mention it anyway the toxicity in the game is rampant there are so many games where if you run a perk no ed you get harassed for it end game if you don t run it then the survivors coordinated just mock you with teabagging all the way out the exit gates they always wait out the clock too to rub it in there is no option for a casual game when playing survivor many games the killer just camps the hook because he most likely had the toxic vibes previous game had more terrible games than fun ones i d say the ratio is 1 good game for every 5,531.6,26.0,8,Not Recommended,"April 28, 2020",Dead by Daylight,CoupD'etected,False

61893,2016 since i m writing this review 6 min after the release i m going to be original and say what i think about the beta my expectations for this game and after playing the reality aka release tldr a very fun but buggy online multiplayer focused horror game with a very good progression system just buy it beta very buggy some times even made me want to punch the monitor cheaters i really liked the bloodweb system i didn t like the fact that the hunter could grab you if you try to save your friends on the hook even at full health which makes so that it s very very risky to unhook a friend when playing a hunter that placed a trap in the middle so you cant save without getting trapped and that is camping the hooked survivor i like that vaulting is a high risk high reward thing since you can get grabbed from doing it but if you master vaulting to juke the killer it becomes kinda abusable i hated that i couldn t invite friends to ranked matches so that i could master survivor with them it would take forever to find each other in a lobby the juke shacks were only abusable for the bad hunters who didn t trap the windows liked the flashlight at first but then never used due to the fact that there s no indicator that the killer was blind and he could move so sometimes you can t tell the map was only decent with perks but overall one of the worst items the toolbox was in someways overpowered if you mannaged to take all the hooks but good killers mannage to get you on the basement anyway the medkit is great for someone whos very good at juking and want to either focus on saving survivors or distracting the killer while others get the generators i liked the hatch it s an interesting feature but the key item is overpowered on the right hands if it doesn t glitch on the map and spawns if wasn t for the beta the game would die because streamers and youtubers gave that much exposure overall a good but buggy beta it actually made me buy the game because i almost clocked 30 hours in the beta expecations killers way better than the others the different maps like cornfield will be gamechangers for each killer overpowered perks add ons and offerings for both killers and survivors the key will be abusable with add ons that prevent it from losing the item the cornfield map will either be very good or very bad to the survivors the invite friend system won t be there on release releasing only 1 week after which sucks based on what the devs said the bloodweb system is what will keep this game alive with the infinite ways to get new perks items and add ons reality so after 2 hours of playing heres what i think of the release it still has a lot a bugs but some of them were fixed the lobby bugs haven t been fixed tho which is what pissed me off the most there are gamebreaking glitches tho like being stuck in a closet and slowly dying without being able to be saved or grabbed so that you could otherwise being able to wiggle away which means u gotta wait the longest way to lose without a chance to get away the maps are pretty great i definitely prefer them over the beta ones maps are gamechanging to killers like hillbilly where he gets advantage on maps with a big area without objects to interrupt his charge like the cornfield map the wraith feels weaker than the other killers you can see his outline of invisibility clearly and from far away which makes his ability not amazing haven t died yet to him and he s the most played killer atm the hillbilly is great on the right hands but can be easly countered by objects the trapper is still good to camp on the hook if he places his trap on the proper spot so that the other survivors will step on it if trying unhook their teammate it will be very hard to get your friend unhooked unless with 2 survivors trying to unhook one to distract the killer the other to disarm and unhook unless the killer gets away there s still no invite to ranked system which is problably only releasing next week cmon guys how am i supposed to find one of my friends on a lobby with 17k people playing the juke shacks as expected were nerfed which tbh i understand why because it would be a very hard time to wraith and hillbilly the toolbox was properly nerfed now you can only disarm about 2 hooks and that s it no more cheesing strats the medkit was nerfed aswell allowing you to only be able to heal yourself once unless you have addons that let you do it more than once tho it s still one of the best items the flashlight i haven t used it yet but from what i see from streams it appears to still not have an indicator of when the killer is blinded which means i won t use it the hatchet has new spawn locations problably because it kept glitching on the beta version and not spawning the rank system is still 20 ranks which i expected to be increased due to the significant level cap increase vaulting seems a little bit slower which i can understand why but it s still very abusable infinite bloodweb system hell yeah will write more when i play more i can see how the game improved and that the developers are actually listening to the community hoping to see what they come up with in the future even if i didn t play a single hour after the release i would consider the time i spent in the beta playing worth the price i paid for if you re looking for a unique game where you can play as a killer like in the horror movies and chasing down your friends and watch them die then this game is for you if you re looking for a competitive game where you want to be the best killer ever existed or the best survivor then this game is for you aswell the infinite bloodweb reward system will simply make you keep playing this for a long long time recommended ofc,356.9,40.0,2,Recommended,"June 14,

62122,2016 i wanna love this game i really do after over 100 hours of gameplay in two months since it s release when this game was so full of bugs it was almost hilarious i can t actually play this game anymore other than maybe a ritual every now and again i prefer to play survivor personally i have tried killer and i find it not the most fun experience because i find the killer has no loss for the game other than a pip or a rank as a survivor i feel the punishment for losing is so much harsher i get it though people who main killer have a different viewpoint which is all fine but at the end of the day i still want to have fun playing a game which this game got old after the couple updates came out and absolutely showed me how one sided this game truly is yeah they got rid of infintiy jukes but didn t touch killers minor debuffs but really it was hardly noticeable they have awesome concepts for killers and mediocre survivors ones the nurse was awesome and terrifying and nea crouches faster woop de doo might as well spend those points i was saving for meg or claudette the killers camp over 98 of the games it s breaks the total immersion after a while of how terrifying the killer is and you start to realize their just exploiting an old strategy from halo don t even bring up the topic to any discussions or you ll get git gud as a response seriously though when you re answer to a strat is to do gens faster as an answer it really isn t a fun concept especially for a game that pushes teamwork down your i will wait to see the storm the devs puts this game through wait for another sad survivor concept to be released after the let down from nea tldr you wanna buy this game to camp troll the discussions contemplate why you are doing this to yourself then buy all means give your money to a game that has raised over a million dollars in two months for an at best short quick play of struggling and dying at the face of your killer,192.2,100.0,6,Not Recommended,"September 2, 2016",Dead by Daylight,I'm Stuck,False
