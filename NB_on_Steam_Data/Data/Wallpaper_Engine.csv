97407,2021 1 for the price it s excellent due to the following 2 has very high quality wallpapers to use 3 there s a diverse amount of wallpapers to pick from 4 let s you download and store wallpapers that can be switched seen in one spot for quick accessibility 5 you can have the wallpapers running without having the app open 6 doesn t decrease fps uses tiny amount of memory which has a unnoticeable impact for this to be true do the following start up app click settings top right select pause for first three keep running and stop for last two quality settings are up to you click general top of settings screen have first two checked scroll down to video settings enable video hardware acceleration click ok once done summary of what those things do makes it so everything is paused when you re using a program whenever you re looking at the wallpaper if it s animated having audio from minimized program on won t pause it unless you have the program popped up on your screen for the quality i recommend using max for everything unless your pc can t run it it won t affect performance so it s worth having the maximized if possible for the fps i don t see a difference when using 25 or higher but i still keep mine at 60 the options checked in the general section make it so your pc starts up the program in the background and applies the wallpaper whenever you turn your device on so you don t need manually open the app to set the wallpaper for video hardware acceleration i ve heard it makes the program run better and is used a bunch side note to get wallpapers either go to discover or workshop and look around use search for more specific wallpapers double click on the wallpaper or click subscribe to download it which applies it if you want to change it go to installed and click on the one you want to apply it either close out of the program by clicking the x at the top right or just click ok using stop for the 2nd and 3rd option in the performance section of settings makes it so the wallpaper isn t applied at all when in another program and so whenever you go back to see your wallpaper the app gets opened again so the wallpaper takes 0 5 2 seconds or so to show up basically everyone uses pause for those still because the wallpaper will always be there and you don t have to see wallpapers switch out of no where whenever you exit out of a program,698.8,209.0,2,Recommended,"May 24, 2021",Wallpaper Engine,Willed,False

97556,2020 depending on what background you set wallpaper engine only uses like 3 of your gpu when viewing the background and pretty much 0 1 when it s not in focus like when running a game cpu ram usage also depends on the chosen background and also surprisingly low the only thing you ll start feeling with any reasonably decent pc for games is storage space some wallpapers are simply video files on repeat some of these video s are easily 300mb you ll quickly have a big library of wallpaper you ve tried and they ll start eating gigabytes animated images are just 1 5mb generally though so it won t be much of a problem but something to keep in mind when you re running low pro tip always reserve at least 10 of free storage for all your devices low storage space makes devices noticebly slower community made wallpapers there s a load of them many are simple but your favorite game will probably be there and it s fairly easy to create your own now even better with the recent asset sharing update well worth the price there s simply no better alternative for fancy backgrounds don t underestimate the usage too backgrounds can be fully interactable games clocks and much more although there aren t that many games on there 10 10,191.4,76.0,3,Recommended,"May 17, 2020",Wallpaper Engine,"LolindirLink

97605,2023 wallpaper engine is an awesome piece of software that allows you to customize your desktop like never before as someone who spends a lot of time in front of the computer having a cool and dynamic wallpaper really makes a difference in my day to day experience the software offers a vast library of wallpapers to choose from and you can easily search for specific themes or styles that match your preferences additionally the community of users who contribute their own wallpapers is vibrant and creative meaning you can always find something new and exciting what i love most about wallpaper engine is how easy it is to use the software is intuitive and user friendly so even if you re not a tech savvy person you can still enjoy customizing your desktop with ease another great feature of wallpaper engine is the ability to create your own wallpapers if you have some knowledge of coding or graphic design you can use the software to create your own dynamic wallpapers which is really cool it s worth noting that wallpaper engine does have a significant amount of anime themed wallpapers available in its library but they have added the option to opt out of anime themed wallpapers but it s not perfect as you will still see many overall i would highly recommend wallpaper engine to anyone who wants to spruce up their desktop and make their computer experience more enjoyable the software is affordable user friendly and offers an endless amount of customization options it s a must have for any computer enthusiast,248.5,99.0,15,Recommended,"March 29, 2023",Wallpaper Engine,"Somalian Booty Bandit

97645,2018 early access review i got this as a gift from a friend more than a year ago i ve been using it ever since both on my desktop and on my laptop it s purely brilliant and well optimized it barely uses any resources of course that also depends on which wallpaper you re using and what settings it ll give your desktop a great feel it will bring it to life wallpapers are easy to make or you can make some in after effects or you can just download them from the workshop there are thousands of them although i d recommend to use the discovery tab in app otherwise you d be riddled with anime wallpapers if you just browse the workshop on steam there are also web wallpapers game wallpapers with little games you can play whenever your desktop sees the light of the day if you ever minimize your windows which rarely happens in my case it can also stay hidden so you won t appear in game while using it and you also can play or do whatever you want on steam at the same time i was worried i won t be able to do that at first it would ve been a very big design flaw it s very worth the price you ll enjoy it and you ll have an awesome desktop,206.0,50.0,1,Recommended,"June 20, 2018",Wallpaper Engine,"sfarog [m0rph]
