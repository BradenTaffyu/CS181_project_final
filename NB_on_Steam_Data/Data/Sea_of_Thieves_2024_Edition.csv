79810,2021 edit 12 2 it s been a while since i first wrote this so adding an update section at the bottom original review sea of thieves is the distilled essence of adventure you start the game up grab some supplies with your friends load up your ship and set sail to see what fate awaits you i offer this game an easy recommend under a couple of conditions the first is that you like the chaos of unknown adventure and the second is that you don t mind when it all goes pear shaped sea of thieves has you being a pirate on the ocean with other players sailing from island to island fighting skeletons ghost ships digging up treasure solving riddles delivering cargo and fighting sea monsters and you never quite know what s going to happen next on your adventure there s plenty of things to chase and you ll never be without a task for long if you care to pick one up from one of the vendors one important design choice that you should be aware of before jumping into this game is that every session is a fresh start you spawn in with your ship and bare bone supplies there s no progression between sessions aside from cosmetics you unlock which is also the only thing you unlock more on that below while this can be a bit of a bummer it s actually quite freeing every time you launch the game you re given a new ship new supplies and an ocean full of treasure to explore truly you have nothing to lose until you find treasure that is then you have something to lose the game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sail solo or with friends and it s shockingly easy to play solo if you desire the smallest ship the sloop is very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirate the only progression in this game is cosmetics anything else you get exists solely to get you you guessed it more cosmetics this makes the cash shop a little weird but hey the upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better sword ship or guns the game recently started a battle pass system with season one the pass for season one is frankly a little underwhelming i m willing to give it a pass since the game is quite enjoyable without but you re not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the pass update since it s been a fair while and four full seasons since i first wrote this review i felt it was time for an update overall i still stand by the original review with the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game it certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the ship you have to let it roll off you like water if you let the bad moments cling to you like barnacles then you ll be just as scuttled as your ships season five just launched and after a middling season 2 content packed seasons 3 and 4 season 5 could be called the quality of life season there s a decent chunk of new content though nothing like the previous seasons which is a reasonably high bar 5 story missions in season 3 and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season 4 the biggest quality of life change in s5 is being able to quickly and easily transfer resources from barrels and storage crates without having to open the interface this along probably would have given me another 100 hours in the game but they also decided to add a buried treasure system indeed you can bury your treasure to create a treasure map then you can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost other pirates can take this and if they successfully sell your treasue boom you get rewarded too how fantastic is that it s even better than that though you can take up to five treasure pers per in game day from the board this amount is pretty reasonable i feel the days go quickly in the sea of thieves and these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own of course quality of treasure may vary as it could be anything though there are commendations to encourage big fruitful treasure maps really it s a box of chocolates you never know what you re gonna get the best part of the whole treasure map system though they re saved on your quests table as an item called a map bundle what s that mean it means if you sink you lose your maps and need to recover the bundle or that other people could steal your maps or you could steal their maps i guess if you re a jerk while the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunate it s lovely design because it means they re transferable you could gift the map bundle or simply leave it at an outpost when you re done for someone else to find it adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure it adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter over and it means that should things go bad for all involves the treasue may be lost to all the game has been at it s best when it balances the thrill of gain with the risk of lose even though the sting of loss can be quite painful it s something we must learn to accept remember the whole ocean is open to you so long as you go in with the attitude that what happens happens,391.4,340.0,6,Recommended,"January 29, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"64bitrobot

79829,2020 ah man where to begin the art design playful whimsical charming paired with the fantastic water effects and the day night cycle the world feels uplifting from minute 1 you can practically smell the crisp salty air the learning curve reasonable you can master the basics within the first hour and then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey life the play style interestingly enough you don t level up your weapons skills or ship s abilities the changes are purely cosmetic and i love it while i ve enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock moves this style feels much more comfortable you get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item a cool ship s livery a flashy new hat but you aren t penalized for being a newcomer yes the fancy canons look nice but they are just as powerful as the default canons you build your reputation with different factions aka companies which leads to unlocking better paying gigs aka voyages and cool looking items this works to the benefit of everyone in your crew a sailor who has a higher rank with a specific company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a better paying voyage and then everyone in their crew can participate i love this if you happen to outrank your friends crewmates you can offer to buy that voyage some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page ie tall tales but that s ok means you can have a positive experience doing one off voyages some times and other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcs my experience so far i played the beta but only recently bought the game even though i missed a massive gap of updates i don t feel left behind i love going on adventures with my friends or winding down the evening with some solo slooping i live in a different timezone than my crew which has meant i have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the pre adventure prepwork gathering supplies for the ship fishing and cooking said fish so we ll have extra stamina it s fun and is surprisingly soothing pvp has been interesting when i solo i try to avoid conflict when i m with my crew we meet it head on both dynamics are enjoyable being stealthy hiding behind mountains darting around the map versus gearing up and letting the cannons fly so good why i especially like this game and why you might like it too i m a fan of all things nautical and i come from a wow background for me this feels like the best parts of wow you can tackle massive monsters with your friends you can choose to grind for random achievements and you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration plus the outfits livery options since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmetic you can mix and match to your heart s content i imagine you would not like this game if you only have 10 minutes of spare time to play games you hate everything to do with water i imagine you would like this game if you have always wanted to be a pirate you have at least one person to adventure with some of the time you like to blow things up you like to sneak away from danger when playing other games you find yourself getting lost and spending hours not doing the mission objectives but have a better time for it tl dr i highly recommend this game for the buccaneer in all of us,663.9,284.0,8,Recommended,"October 19, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Skyros,False

79833,2020 well i was about to say that this game is totally undeserving the hype and is a bad game but it has these burps of greatness which changes everything let me explain it is really atmospheric and open to imagination rather than grind first night i was playing sot we were four friends and two were actual seamen it was understandably epic to act like pirate crew while using all the lingo of actual sailors trying to get into battle however it was the second night i played the game which actually hooked me me and two others had this mid tier ship and i decided that we should be pirate hunters instead of pirates since everybody is complaining about pvp in forums and wanting pve i thought hey i guess we can make friends and it would be great to experience the other side for a change we ve traveled around for a while with random quests and found this riddle message in a bottle eventually leading to this avian themed island with bird like statues it took us so long to get the riddle right one of our crew members passed out from drinking in real life so we put his character in brig holding cell in our ship after we solved the riddle as the remaining crew members we ve decided to get the goodies to an island with merchants and on our way we had an encounter which went friendly after announcing ourselves as such we were now sure that we can sail friendly and only engage if necessary or to hunt more notorious pirates after all notorious ones are easier to identify heavily modified ships are more likely to be owned by experienced players which in turn more likely to be hostile on spot due to being more confident with the game couple of minutes later we left the port again we were chasing around another ship to ask whether they saw any pirates hoping they would say yes us so we could start a fight and end the night in high note with all the shenanigans and found one lone ship anchored near a field of debris much to our disappointment this group turned out to be friendly as well and pointed us further north for pirates we in disbelief and sure they were lying sailed north anyways to maintain character but also keeping an eye out for this one ship on our back then suddenly loud noise of cannonshots two ships one manned by undead came out of nowhere and guns started blazing the last thing i saw before leaving the ship with a keg of cannon powder was kraken s arms raising up i lit the barrel threw the keg at this huge tentacle and swam as fast as i can to get away shouting help towards the crew we just had a chat my ship went down but i survived the ordeal with heavy injuries yet the undead ship followed me to battle with these guys as well i immediately jumped to this unknown ship s guns shouting friendly friendly and started bombarding while good captain tried to rout away from both ships and a storm i must add at this point that we were not sharing a common language either i landed enough shots on the other ships or captain was good with his trim but we got away sound of sea and the wind went back to normal checking the ship i saw only the captain was alive the other crew member i don t know what happened after a minute of silently emoting respect i saw something shining on the sea a bit behind us closer to the battle zone you see i had to check it shouting one last farewell i jumped off the ship ofcourse i was trusting the friendly mermaids for a ride back home among some barrels floating i found this peculiar blue stone most likely from another ship sunk by the undead crew or the second ship which attacked us at the start of the fight i wanted to take the stone back home with me but the damned mermaid refused to take me back with the stone in my hand so i decided to make my way to the nearest island swimming angrily to the stupid mermaids everything was well until i saw a fin on the surface of the water got attacked by the shark almost immediately after i saw it raising my pistol i spent my last shot on the predator and immediately started slicing it with my new sabre to my suprise it didn t take too long for this shark to be mortally wounded and somehow i survived yet again i made my way to this rock formation which i initially thought was an island and climbed a bit to use my spyglass there were no sign of life for miles the damned mermaid below me i was checking for other ships to get a ride hopefully not giving up on this blue stone sapphire of the mermaid or something it was one really long day for papenbard the privateer that is where i left off an amazing adventure for me what is even better when i get in the game next time it will start in a tavern with a mysterious stranger commenting something like aha another new face that was quite the celebration when you arrived i am not surprised you don t remember it it is atmospheric edited for typos clarifications,60.9,751.0,137,Recommended,"June 6, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Maksim,False

79840,2020 its a great game with a lot of good stuff to do although i recommend having friends and not playing solobut this comes with a warning as well you will have hours of progress taken from you from other people people will hunt you down and bully you for literally no reason the community mostly isn t toxic but it is highly encouraged to hunt other people instead of working on your own profit even making an alliance is flawed as you only get half value on things other members sell speaking from experience you simply have to put up with the fact someone can come along and ruin your day at any time it s quite unfortunate some of the best parts of this game are with other crews but you have to treat others with so much caution that fun interactions are few and far between if these things are a dealbreaker then i don t even blame you and i recommend you either find some friends preferably skilled ones or avoid solo at all costs also you can have public ships but i wouldn t trust those with my life outside of arenaedit because people seem to be misunderstanding i have no problem with people focusing more on the pvp than the pve and targeting other players for profit what i do have a problem with however if often people will just outright assault you even if its clear you don t have any loot on you and sink everyone they see for the sake of sinking people it drives new players away and just makes it even harder to get people to trust you the fact that i have to warn new players that you can and will get bullied for literally no reason should be enough of a point but the fact people still use the its sea of thieves not sea of friends excuse for them not robbing just murdering for no reason really drives home how some of the playerbase are and how badly they want to feel in the right for attacking people for no reason because they aren t in it for the loot they re in it to be the worst people they can and feel in the right because the game doesn t have any kind of punishment for being a,571.9,299.0,19,Recommended,"November 6, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"RileyInc

79846,2021 you wake in a tavern replenish your ship s supplies food wood cannon balls and customize it s cosmetics you talk with an npc who gives you a quest you receive a map of an island with red crosses on it you go to your ship and search for that island on the world map you find it and figure out which way to sail you unfurl your sails and turn the helm towards the destination a few minutes pass while you re in the middle of the ocean trying to navigate around a storm the water suddenly turns black combat music kicks in as a pair of tentacles emerge from the depths a wild kraken appears and it thinks that your ship is tasty you grab a handful of cannonballs from storage and man the cannons with a few well placed shots and a couple shredded tentacles the kraken leaves you alone you repair the damage to your ship and jump in the water to pick up the kraken s meat looking at the map a short detour towards a trading post is possible you place the meat on a skillet to cook while you turn your ship towards the merchants after selling the kraken meat you set sail towards your quest the rest of the voyage is uneventful and you reach the island and drop the anchor with map in one hand and a shovel in another you set foot on the tropical island before you with no minimap you need to read the map and orient yourself based on landmarks you see eventually you find one of the places where the treasure should be enthusiastically you swing your shovel in to the sand and hit wood you ve found a wooden chest that is one of the treasures on the island however you also found a pack of animated skeletons who would rather you not take the treasure you draw your sword and fight the bones you notice a lone skeleton carry a big red barrel of gunpowder toward you without skipping a beat you run a few paces away and draw your pistol with a single shot you hit the barrel which promptly explodes obliterating the nearby skeletons one of which drops a piece of parchment on the parchment there is a quest sea of thieves is a well polished multiplayer only title about adventure there s plenty of stuff to do and the game always finds more activities to offer you the only downside is that it requires a crew to be viable in pvp which can t be turned off and to be effective the crew needs to communicate well it can be hard to find such crew so it s best played with friends you know in advance,202.9,507.0,27,Recommended,"May 28, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Climax708

79847,2020 sea of thieves is a game with a long history of ups and downs that have shaped what has now become one of my favorite games of all time it s hard to pinpoint what exactly went wrong during the 4 years before the closed beta started but to say that what would eventually be released to the public at a full price would shape the reputation of the game for years to come is an understatement despite all efforts rare has been continually fighting the sour preconceived notionfrom consumers that have grown cynical from years of being burned by corporate business not unlike the initial release of sot i d say that mindset is more than justified i believe this game is a massive outlier when it comes to genuine ethical backtracking in terms of ongoing work retroactively fixing the game over the past 2 years sot has recieved close to the most free updates and hard labor of love i ve ever seen put into a game that never needed it to bring the money in many would say that sort of description already fits games like no man s sky but its approach to it and the design decisions are what makes sea of thieves stand out unlike nms progression in sot isn t vertical but horizontal meaning all of its mechanics can be experienced in the first hour of play and will not differ from someone like me who has played it for over 1000 hours on the m store version while this means overall incentive is that not unlike your high score in an arcade game if you actually view the game as what is essentially an open world per session arcade experience the genius behind this design starts making sense every single update the game has received doesn t suffer from the growing pains of any service game that relies on conventional progression systems if rare decides to add a literal grappling hook mechanic to the game that lets you hook onto rocks and pull off drift maneuvers you will get to experience that mechanic the moment you log in this is where that approach really shines new mechanics aren t just one and done features every single one of these now gets to be designed to enrich the gameplay loop itself meaning the developers have full freedom to find all kinds of secondary and primary uses for just a single mechanic for example the rowboat was advertised alongside the volcano region in the game but it s not just a tool to savely park your ship away from erupting volcanos rowboats can be used as a stealth item that lets you hide your ship and silently sneak up to another crew to steal all their belongings if an island holds many treasures a rowboat is usually the fastest way to gather it all up and bring it back to your ship if you re in a hurry which you will be if your ship sinks your rowboat remains and you get a second chance to secure your efforts rowboats also include their own storage space and as of recently are a very reliable source of supplies if you find them on islands effectively cutting supply gathering time in half this doesn t even touch on how new features retroactively add to previous mechanics as well for example the aforementioned harpoon can be found on certain rowboats as well which if you have it docked on your ship allows for an entirely new grappling angle so yes sea of thieves is a service game as such it has benefited from new content stacked on top of the already existing structure thankfully that structure is incredibly flat and wide meaning climbing that structure to reach said features is non existent this unfortunately means what was already there could hardly be fixed without entirely redesigning the whole structure which has not happened it s still the same game but with most of its holes and gaps being closed up by genuinely great mechanics and content yes if you played sea of thieves on release and disliked the go from point a to point b back to a then repeat experience that has largely been unchanged and the occasional dead air while now being shorter than ever will probably still bore you as much as before however when that dead air is gone you will experience many many more interesting and funscenarios with an incredible amount of tools and ways in how you deal with those situations the point of this review isn t to just list all the positives and negatives after all you will find plenty of those already but to explain why people who have stuck with the game all this time consider the new additions it has received to be much more valuable than they might look to someone who s never played it sea of thieves has proven to not only be one of the most unique and fun coop experiences i ve ever played it reminds me of a time when rare took a formula injected as much of their own personality and charm as they couldand also manage to introduce an incredibly polished and innovative title that stands on its own merit it just took as long as a steam release to make that happen,643.7,380.0,13,Recommended,"June 4, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Applegreen92

79859,2020 this game is very enjoyable though for those that are solo players be prepared for frustration and anger as a new player i ve had nothing but bad experiences meeting other players though they re far and few in between i m constantly being shot to pieces the dynamic events will jump on you at the worst possible times surviving a kraken straight out of a respawn is not possible i don t have irl friends to play with and i think that s 90 of the experience in this game i don t know how i feel about playing with strangers but we ll see i might try signing up for a crew soon enough don t know yet i ve been shot in outposts safezones had my boat sat on fire and you name it it s not a solo friendly game know that when you buy it if you hate pvp well take a guess i ve only played 28hrs as of this review and it s been solo i hope you get to enjoy the game if you buy it edit on 07 06 2020to clarify on whiterabbit s comment i m not saying people shouldn t shoot each other but that i used the first hours of me playing this game trying to learn the mechanics and it was overwhelming i ve been attacked straight after spawning in on new ship while docking for my first voyage while in town the pirate code is just that a code not a rule and i think pve minded players need to be aware of that there s no safe place you can be shot killed and sunk anywhere at any time even as a new player who just opened the game i ve also tried turning my back on my ship to turn in my treasure for like 20seconds i came back and a galleon had docked and sat my sloop on fire they apologized and repaired my sloop and when i was out on voyage again i noticed they had ripped my sloop for every possible resources as an anchored sloop trying to do a voyage meeting a pvp ready galleon was by no means fun and they shot me only for the sake of shooting me this type of encounters can be grueling and very demoralizing new players need to be aware of this because it makes or breaks the game for some of them not everyone is okay playing with other people due to anxieties and playing solo is their only option this game will not be for them i m simply trying to make a certain group of gamers aware that there s no single player version of this game and you won t be left alone out there on the seas solo and single player is two very different things if i m going to play with other people i ll play with someone i know in real life the game does encourage team work and i love that even the alliance system is cool and i know i m making it sound like the game is such a bad thing but i just have to highlight certain events that ll make some people really bumped out about having spent 40eur personally i love the game to bits there s things and details that annoy the living out of me but i understand why it s done as it is the treasure system is fantastic i love the riddles and bounties i love the different factions and that some items can be turned in to any of them for extra experience the sailing mechanics are very enjoyable once you get it down and sailing a sloop alone is almost therapeutic while the game is very linear and grindy it s a joy,74.8,219.0,11,Recommended,"June 6, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Ashtail Foxclaw

79860,2023 sea of thieves is special because it s the first game that i have played where i had a truly entertaining story to tell my folks after each session i could deep dive in all the details that make this game perfect but i won t spoil it for you what i can tell you is that whatever you try to do in this gem of a game crazy stuff will happen to you sometimes funnysometimes challengingsometimes frighteningbut also heartwarmingyes it s a sandbox game and it will mostly be about what you make out of it but if you pour in enough hours to go through all the quests and stories it has to offer you will discover something magical in the end and that something is that sot is not exactly about plundering it s about building friendships defying the odds playing bold and experimenting it taught me to charge towards the unknown to try new things to take my time to stay composed through fire and flames to interact with strangers to lose and win gracefully and heck even to enjoy defeats with all this for the first time of my life i play a game because it feels good in a meaningful way it keeps on giving a year has now passed since i shared my first incredible tale with my family and recently my 7yo son finally asked to join me we now sail and live new adventures together every saturday morning i cherish these moments with all my heart as we bond together more than ever in sea of thieves all are equal and in these crazy days we live in as an increasingly divided society the community feels like a safe haven to me this game is a ray of sunshine to me and will probably be for many years to come thank you rare 3,550.3,208.0,8,Recommended,"January 18, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"REENO

79873,2020 sea of thieves is one of the most polished games i have experienced in recent memory its environment immersive sailing and beautiful graphics made this game a pure joy to play explore and experience the campaign stories called tall tales are intriguing inventive and curious to play through when it comes to combat regarding the melee strikes with the sword or guns it feels a bit lackluster and basic battling enemies head on lacks challenge and is relatively simple that said the boat battles against skeleton ships ghost ships kraken megalodon or other players is very satisfying and unique the amount of ways to mess around with your opponent blow their ship while also repairing and steering your own creates a frantic scene of cooperation among you and your crewmates each and every time moments where you t bone an enemy ship grapple their hull and then proceed to invade their deck to release the anchor to prevent them from moving as your allies rain down a variety of cannonballs that inflict different effects and damage is exciting that i have yet to see matched in other games to add depending on the size of your crew from 2 players to 4 you will be provided larger ships from a single said sloop to a massive galleon all with their own benefits and short comings making battles incredibly challenging another key part of the game is the progression in the game for some players the lack of progression detracts motivation to continue playing however if you are someone who enjoys the experience of games more so than rewards this may be the game for you in sea of thieves what you start with is what everyone else has and there is no additional unlocks access to better weaponry ships or other in the game the quests currencies and rewards are all related to cosmetics to improve the look and feel of yourself and your ship to end if gta is the open world grindfest to unlocking cooler cars upgrades and real estate then sea of thieves is its counterpart where everything is already unlocked and you simply sail for the great times and moments with your shipmates,188.2,270.0,16,Recommended,"June 17, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Torte de Lini,False

79879,2020 update i wrote this over 4 years ago my old review is corny but my love of this game is still just as strong 1 000 hours later hope to see you on the seas someday original review sea of thieves is a satisfying adrenaline rush and surprisingly balanced if you enjoy pvp i m always on the lookout for new co op games on steam when sea of thieves popped up i mentioned it to a few friends and one of them was ecstatic he insisted that i get it asap so we could play together i m so glad i did within the first 10 hours this became one of my favorite co op games things started out a bit rocky my best friend and i simultaneously booted up the tutorial after i beached and un beached my ship i shambled through the rest of the tutorial on my end a little concerned about whether or not i d ever handle the multitasking that s required to be an effective pirate in this game soon after our good friend joined us and i went into full on panic mode there are other players right now all around us i knew there was a pvp element but i thought we were playing a private game and that we d be able to do that in the future it wasn t long until we were raided by another ship and it was definitely just for lulz the three of us were at an outpost with zero loot it wasn t long until it was over however and as we watched their ship sink and i came down from the stress i grinned that felt amazing i never envisioned getting so hyped about pvp i avoid most pvp anymore because of cheating and toxic communities but sea of thieves does it quite well and i ve had so far a very fair experience while i ve lost some battles i ve never felt that something was unreasonable i ve had people cuss me out for swiping their loot killing them etc if i could offer any advice to a new player it s learn to pay attention to your surroundings as much as possible this isn t a game where absolutely anyone can easily sneak up on you without you having ample time to do something about it and this isn t a game where people are required to leave you alone if you decide to stop at an outpost to sell your loot when you see a player ship in the distance then you re setting yourself up as a target if you truly feel a player is harassing you scuttle your ship and spawn somewhere else with almost 60 hours in this game now now well over 100 as of june 30 2020 though i really have a hard time wrapping my head around just how people feel like they can t get away from other players the only thing i can conclude is that they re just not paying enough attention to what s around them i ve played on all three ships now by myself and with a team of friends if you re solo the sloop is fast enough to outrun any ship against the wind it s actually very easy to completely avoid other players on it if that s your jam the brig and galleon add the thrill of teamwork and communication as with any pvp game sea of thieves is not without its toxic players this is honestly why i primarily play solo or with friends because i just don t personally enjoy teaming up with random people i ve met cool people and salty jerks and it s really nothing different from any other pvp experience in my opinion the rewards for completing anything in this game are purely cosmetic while i was lukewarm about that at first i appreciate how it levels out the playing field for players of any skill set even with micro transactions there s no pay to win mechanic while players are certainly a threat there are plenty of other things that can sink your ship from the kraken to a rainstorm from ghost ships to a poorly placed gunpowder barrel it s difficult to deal with some of the pve threats when you re solo but it s very possible with practice and patience sea of thieves is also graphically and musically beautiful it easily has the nicest looking water i ve ever seen in a video game i m normally a little thalassophobic when it comes to large bodies of water in video games but it s just so darn gorgeous that i m always ready to jump in and swim around further i knew i recognized the composition style from somewhere and it s none other than robin beanland that s just another plus for me as a gaming music nerd there are a variety of bugs that seemed to have been fixed at least for me in the most recent update ship compass freezing wind not showing up not being able to interact with things and having to die or find a mermaid to reset rare seems really set on making this a polished experience however and it s given me even more incentive to stick around and keep playing,999.3,153.0,8,Recommended,"June 19, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Ghost

79888,2023 please follow united critics for quality reviewssea of thieves reviewfactorsratingdescription gameplay9 5except some funny bugs it was all smooth graphics10every element matches the overall theme narration audio9superb dialogues and writings depicting riddles and storytelling variety9voyages may have the same ideology but every journey is different re playability9endless possibilities and encounters price8 5only goes on sale during season steam sales but worth the base price as the game is based on pirates who are known for their riddle ish vocabulary and mesmerizing tales there are multiple missions and interactions that are encoded in the form of riddles so i will try my best to explain everything by balancing the straightforward names and in game names sea of thieves is probably the only pirate themed game that is developed and executed marvelously everything from the point of spawn to deadly adventures boosts the gaming experience the game delivers what it promotes a thrilling pirate adventure when you read the word thieves from the title sea of thieves it doesn t mean the threat imposed by other pirate players but from the ai skeletons and deadly sea weathers too so raise the anchor open the sails and cruise through the ocean of dead and alive gameplayspotlight on preparationsafter selecting your closed or open crew and the crew size with the appropriate ship expanse you spawn on a random outpost it s a place where you can get some free supplies a lot of dialogues voyages and customizations no this is not a player friendly spawn point everywhere from the spawn points to scarce islands to underwater tunnels is pvp enabled with no mercy outpost is a good place to frame your journey pinpoints but the sea is always unpredictable so be prepared for everything filled with multiple interesting npcs you can get gold hoarders voyage find the treasure merchant alliance voyages delivery and retrieval of goods order of souls voyages hunt skeleton captains and bring back their skulls and much more from them for the customization part you are also blessed with a big stack of skins for every usable piece of equipment and the whole ship itself not only that but multiple timely events follow the monthly theme there will be an in depth link about voyages in the miscellaneous information section at the bottom of the review start of the journeyafter selecting voyages from a hefty availability it s time for you to grab the helm ship wheel and command your crew to advance for the voyage you will encounter multiple unpredictable confrontations so make sure you have enough supplies to battle the dead or alive now depending upon the voyage you voted for your journey might contain digging up of treasures battles with the skeleton captains or retrieval of goods but the threats of the sea remain the same you can run from the players or volcanic eruptions but how will you run from the wrath of sea weather it s not about the treasure you loot it s about the memories you yield during these deadly adventures this unpredictability is the reason that makes sot alive and immersive encounters from the npc during journeyit doesn t matter whether you are traversing the realm or cruising through the sea you can get attacked anytime for the coast interactions skeletons emerging from the sand wild animals volcanic eruptions are all possible threats but the sea is the deadliest territory skeleton ships ghost ships flying boulders from the volcano a fatal storm are visible from afar and can be avoided if you are fast enough but just coz there s no visible threat it doesn t mean you are safe chilling in the sea and suddenly you hear some sensational music upon looking you see a fierce megalodon chasing your ship with a full force ship wrecking bite if you somehow survive this beast using all your cannon attacks how about a giant kraken that stops your vessel in the middle of the sea and proceeds to damage your ship and suck you up just to drown you in the sea yes the marine shows no mercy creativity and balancing of pvpremember that everyone has the same arsenal of weaponry the players are not always hostile but you never know maybe you are wandering on an island and some pirates sunk your ship don t worry as you can always respawn back to the ship which spawns on the outpost losing a ship only cost you the loot that you were stored on it this reduces the blood thirsty encounters as there s no point in wasting the supply in sinking an empty ship but it s not totally pve as they can steal the loot and deposit at outposts to yield the profit for all the hardcore pvp lovers there s an arena mode competitive where they are assigned a common treasure map and the first one to retrieve and sell gains the silver coins but do you have the guts to eliminate other pirates to seize the treasure graphicsoh my god sea of thieves is the only game i have the most screenshots and clips in it s tremendously eye pleasing all the elements follow the same art design and fit perfectly with the overall mood if there was an oscar for best water graphics sot was the easiest pick everything from player characters enemies landscapes seashores underwater sky elements ghosts animations respawn ghost ship are top notch standing on the bow front part of the ship and staring at the flowing water is a magical feeling that will make you calm and speechless even going out of bounds turns the sea blood red and damages your ship like a deadly curse it s surely deadly but beautiful pros and conspros best pirate game available out there top notch graphics endless content multiplayer availability cross play fun and exciting no pay to win itemcons bugs that get your characters stuck until you kill yourself pvp is a gamble either you can get good pirates or blood thirsty chasers tips to new players always maintain your supplies to ample amount you can only hold a limited number of voyages and they reset once you leave the game so make sure to buy the voyage that you are looking forward to completing buying a voyage flag boosts your rewards but it s not permanent you will lose your flag and perks once your boat sinks also staying afk will end up disconnecting from the server miscellaneous information voyages voyages are the quests that players can buy from trading companies or the black market at all outposts for a further look at the possibilities of voyages please check out the link ratingall my time with sea of thieves was enjoyable and pleasing this is a must have experience for

79908,2020 product received for free the journey is the rewardoverviewsea of thieves sot is an open world first person action adventure game where you can be a pirate as a pirate can be it promotes pvp and pve action side by side at the same time while its main focus is directed towards utilizing team play and heavy cooperation it s not about the gold it s about the glory there is no profound main story overshadowing the game but every island character treasure and chest is dipped in a piece of lore just to be expanded more and more with the upcoming dlcs meanwhile you can set sail towards grand adventures to uncover various secrets and how this archipelago was cursed by doing lengthy quests known as tall tales if you want to pursue the somewhat convoluted story take on them or perhaps you just want to be a damn pirate go for it the game gives you free rein to choose whether you want the lore or not and i think it is great in that manner the pirate lord giving you a pep talk on the last tall tale a screenshot of sea of thieves by amirite an altogether different meaning of cooperation you re given two modes to choose what type of adventure to start adventure the primary experience of sot this mode focuses on the pvpve aspect and consists of all the voyages events and everything the game has to offer players can choose any of the vessel sizes to start their journey sloop two man brigantine three man and galleon four man arena a full pvp mode that heavily revolves around naval battles in duo or quad play players fight each other against the clock for points loot and currencies treasures and gold can t be found so easily mostly you have to follow an x mark map and solve several amusing and brain tickling riddles or perhaps take on a more aggressive approach by looting an enemy ship these quests can be either bought or found lying along the shorelines the payment for quests and loots is deeply generous but there s nothing more than skins to buy soon you ll run out of things to buy in sot currency in the game is divided into three items gold most common currency obtained by selling loot used to purchase cosmetics items and quests doubloons awarded for completing commendations they can be exchanged with duke in taverns for special voyages and cosmetics ancient coins obtained via real money to buy from the emporium shop purely cosmetic also rarely dropped by ancient skeletons trading companies sot is dominated by three main trading companies knowns as gold hoarders merchant alliance and order of souls they each only buy certain types of loot from you should you choose a riskier yet more profiting way to bootleg your belongings the reaper s bones awaits you additionally another company athena s fortune is accessible to only pirate legends requires reaching level 50 in all three main companies you can do handbrake turns in a ship who knew sailing a ship has never been so realistic you re given a compass and the rest of the knowledge comes with time sails must be angled properly to adjust the speed repairing the ship requires agility or hours of work might sink in the bottom of the seas you must interact cooperatively with most of these elements to speed things up overall it s not as complex as it sounds the whole experience is easy to learn but hard to master no progression whatsoever the gameplay becomes monotonous since no ranking system or character progression is present on one hand it s a good starting point that all players are given the same gear and weapons and only skill would save them from death on the other hand it makes it difficult to spot decent pirates and have productive journeys with random people the heart of pve is numerous world events that take you through epic naval battles or set you and your crew off to fight skeletons and solve riddles smaller events such as hunting megalodons or the kraken occurs randomly in the sea while major ones like ashen lords or ghost fleets will stay around until they re completed the events are considered as a great challenge and are almost impossible to come through without seasoned crewmates bosses are um too tanky most events end with a boss fight these encounters could be often intense as each one has different stages and summons minions during the fight however they lose their variety soon because all bosses share the same set of attacks and moves their huge health pool is just a hit it until it s dead situation that bores you to death needless to say the melee system feels lackluster and basic boss fights are chaotic and intense but are also extremely tanky and require no strategy to defeat compared to the hefty loots they drop a screenshot of sea of thieves by amirite joining publics is unnerving the fact that no lobby joining option is implemented in the game after 2 years of development is what bothers me the most no info is given when joining a game such as latency the ongoing quest etc you cannot cancel the joining process once you start searching for a crew getting more technical hud is minimalist with absolutely no intrusive elements cluttering the screen and your view for more immersion sot offers a considerable amount of accessibility features to aid anyone with the slightest disability to enjoy the game features like text to speech narrating ui elements various colorblind filters etc that distinguish sot from other titles all contents could be exhausted within 200 hours if played efficiently but bear in mind due to rng factors of quests and events the replayability is immensely high sun sands sea at first glance the cartoonish style might put you off but to be fair the visuals are extraordinary and breathtaking the water effects and physics are phenomenally realistic the days are brightened with cheerful colors it s practically impossible not to take a minute to gaze upon the stunning sunrises sunsets while sailing the seas the nights are filled with stars and auroras that

79916,2023 look i love this game i really do but there are serious fundamental issues with the current implementation of multiplayer first off pvp is profoundly unfun for and unfair to small crews and people not dedicated to the pvp grind ganking is astoundingly easy and 100 the meta strategy all players have the same amount of health and do the same amount of damage so large crews just fill your boat with more players than you can reasonably fight and spawnkill you until you sink overall the skill floor for this game is way too high and players self select into groups that make it worse players who play the game for pvp will naturally become more skilled at pvp than players who play the game for pve as such pve players are sitting ducks easy prey and even worse with captaincy a ship can be ready for a fight in less than a minute it takes hours to build up a pve loot stash of any meaningful value so pvp ships can just throw themselves at pve ships until they eventually lose and let s be real when you lose you re screwed they ll cash out immediately it s way too easy to get level 5 reaper so as a small crew pve player the game becomes heart stoppingly stressful and the devs don t seem to get this they continue to make running away even harder which would be fine in a game where the stakes were lower but is total crap in a game with enormous stakes and an even enormous er aggressor advantage you want to talk about realism it s realistic that a tiny merchant ship would see a big hulking pirate galleon trudge up from under the horizon and be able to get the hell out of dodge second the ability for anyone even allies to backstab you is exciting and interesting on paper but in practice is just an enormous impediment to camaraderie and community building if i m allied with a crew that i can t keep tabs on at all times and i have any real amount of loot i just plain can t leave my ship we can t hang out can t go on island voyages together i can t spend time with other players without the risk of being betrayed and sunk without any form of loyalty assurance this game is a profoundly lonely experience compounded by the astoundingly sparse servers at least partly limited in density because of the serious threat each new ship represents to your hoard is all of this a skill issue yes 100 i ll be the first to admit that i m garbage at pvp but frankly pvp matches as a solo are just so slow complicated expensive and frustrating that i don t have enough irl time and motivation to commit to the grind the constant threat of attack is exciting and vital to the gameplay loop s challenge and significance but the odds are so far skewed in the aggressor s favor that it s just not fun edit i m really disappointed by the announcement of safer seas i guarantee that if the fundamental issues with balancing and the gameplay loop were addressed people wouldn t be clamoring for a pve mode rather than take a good hard look at why people want pve they ve decided to throw it in there and call it a day it doesn t solve anything it just splits the playerbase into the camps of willing and not willing to deal with the existing bad design and the ability to earn commendations in safer seas seriously cheapens them why should you be able to earn the gold curse or legendary hunter of the sea of thieves in the introductory mode edit 2 they re adding an industry leading third party anticheat every industry leading anti cheat is kernel level which is beyond invasive and an unacceptable security risk i really really hope they reconsider because otherwise i m out for good i d rather deal with a few snot nosed script kiddies than sell my digital soul to some company i ve never seen this is genuinely heartbreaking,548.5,737.0,36,Not Recommended,"March 9, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Richard Johnson Wang

79925,2022 do you like the idea of sailing around a magical sea alone or with up to 3 friends and gathering treasure sparring with mermaids monsters and skeletons defending your ship against megalodons and krakens and most importantly getting drawn into fights with other players then this will probably be up your alley sea of thieves is a pvp game wrapped in a pve environment the core idea behind it is to create varied experiences between players with most else being there to facilitate that treasure is the driving force that keeps players sailing around fighting skeleton ships looting ancient vaults and many other activities other players doing the same thing or looking to steal your loot are the real variable and keep you on your toes and looking over your shoulder you can go entire sessions just doing your thing to gather gold and never interact with other players if you aren t looking for engagement but inevitably you will run into people that are and aside from some fairly rare alliances and peaceful interactions they will attack you and try to take your loot this seems to be the eternal struggle in the sea of thieves community some players embrace pvp and some just want the pve experience and would rather destroy themselves and sink their own loot than even try to defend their ship i understand there aren t a lot of games out there that facilitate the kind of pve sailing and loot gathering that sea of thieves does but if this is purely what you are looking for and you are not interested in pvp at all i d say give this a pass pvp is inevitable progression wise there are only cosmetics every player is on equal footing the only thing seperating fresh newbies and 1000 hour veterans is skill and experience every weapon is unlocked from the start and every player has to find or buy their own supplies like food to heal wood to repair your ship and cannonballs to fire all the gold you end up hoarding is used to buy pirate clothing sails cannons wheels capstans hull colours and figure heads there are a bunch of achievements to unlock that give you access to even more cosmetics and player titles there are 3 different types of ship the small sloop for 1 or 2 players the powerful but fragile brigantine for up to 3 players or the big lumbering galleon for up to 4 players each has their strengths and weaknesses and while having more players on your crew is an advantage this will only count if your crew plays well together 2 man sloops sinking 4 man galleons is a common occurrence when the galleon crew is not very experienced because in such situations the galleon loses any advantage it has and becomes more of a burden to it s own crew if you decide to give this a go maybe i ll run into you on the sea of thieves i ll either be blasting cannonballs or fireworks,820.6,121.0,7,Recommended,"September 7, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Greaves

79928,2020 oh man sea of thieves i spent 1 for a month of xbox game pass to give sea of thieves a try and i fell in love i jumped on it on steam in july despite the game not even being on sale at the time just because i wanted to keep playing it the biggest gripe i have with sea of thieves is like many others the other players who choose to do pvp battle with you i ve gotten frustrated a lot simply because other players felt like engaging and they either have a better grasp of pvp than my crew does or their internet sucks it can be and is very demoralizing to spend half an hour or an hour on one voyage and lose all of that progress however thankfully the majority of sea of thieves players do not fall into that category most players want to do their own thing and not make the gamble to lose all of their progress so usually you won t even come into contact with other players or you might end up finding friendly players if you re aiming for pvp the arena game mode exists to provide pvp players the matches they re looking for in fact there are communities dedicated to setting up pve servers and having joined them a couple of times they can be well organized and very rewarding new pve content is being added to the game almost monthly new treasure hunts new story quests new world events and more all with unique gameplay mechanics that will keep you on your toes some players complain about all enemies are skeletons but honestly there s a lot of variety in both the skeleton types and the special skeletons like captains and ashen lords there s genuine feedback to be made about boss enemies being bullet sponges but other than that the fights are honestly very fun it s also really great to have the game put everyone at an equal skill level in terms of weapons and ships there s no way to upgrade anything for more power all of the loot goes towards more cosmetics which is risky because that means the developers put their entire stock in the gameplay loop being fun enough for players to keep coming back and it definitely paid off because the gameplay loop is definitely really fun while other players can be a nuisance at times i m always coming back to sea of thieves so much so that i easily paid real money for a pet dog i definitely recommend everyone gives sea of thieves a try by using the xbox game pass for 1 for a month and then making a decision from there,454.6,142.0,6,Recommended,"September 18, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"SlyAceZeta

79995,2022 i think people miss the core point of this game pros large map with plenty of content for both pvp and pve players alike insane amount of quests and objectives or just motive to sail freely and explore a great deal of depth an equal playing field when it comes to ship combat loot a non aggressive mtx system which is cosmetic only incentive to learn and get better at the game graphically it is utterly stunning developers who care and are constantly updating the game cons now take these with a pinch of salt because there is plenty of it there is one meta for ship combat and that is boarding as long as you can deal with that then you are fine a hard game to play alone wouldn t mind subscription based private servers a small portion of the community ruin the game for others toxicity look sea of thieves is a damn good game don t let a few players sinking you destroy your experience that is the way they want to play it and fair enough each to their own the reality being that if you plan ahead if you stay out of sight and play smart then you can normally avoid combat if you wish to do so also you will find that over 50 of the players you come across their one meta is to try and board you they are not good at the game and you can deal with them fairly easily other than that it is about being smarter than the toxic idiots just like any game since online play was invented think about it in mw2 when some lovely person was spamming noob tubes what did you do you would get out a sniper rifle and take care of them or you would change your strategy to make his strategy useless my point being that there is way to play around idiots if you do get into ship combat then play it smart keep your distance and play your way in time you will learn to counter the idiots but at the end of the day the game is both a pve and a pvp based game if you get frustrated easily or feel you cannot make plans to avoid these things then sure don t buy it but the reality being that i have had whole sessions where i have not seen someone else there are so many ways to make money and have fun that you can avoid the hot spots make your own game this is sort of what rare want you to do anyway although i feel private servers to play on with friends against npc s would be far more enjoyable i also think getting rid of arena was a mistake because sadly it put the toxic lot back into the main game in closing i feel that this game has so much to offer and you should 100 ignore the negative reviews they are just from people who played the game incorrectly and didn t use sense or have any understanding of what a live service pvp game is play your own way have your own fun and do what makes you happy 9 5 10 and i will stick by that no matter how many times i sink which most of the time is down to my own stupidity and not to the fault of somebody else i am just big enough to admit it,91.5,115.0,2,Recommended,"April 20, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Stevronar

79997,2023 it s a good game but the cheating is completely out of hand don t buy it the developers just add more stuff to the store there is no anti cheat to report a cheater you have to record video take screenshots write a novel based on your hurt feelings as well as write a code snippet on how you would fix the cheat if you were them and finally provide a dissertation on how society can be changed via genetic engineering to prevent the cheating gene in front of a select panel of your peers it s probably easier to just download cheats yourself if you want to play the game when fighting devils be a devil yourself no thanks,375.6,273.0,114,Not Recommended,"June 1, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,its the australian fast bowler!,False

80006,2020 honest review from the mind of a simple critic industrial gamers gameplay sea of thieves is about as free form of an experience as you can get which is both a blessing and a curse on the one hand you could probably spend close to a dozen hours having fun sailing around without ever realizing there is a proper campaign to follow like i did and that s when i discovered that even though its free roaming gameplay is enjoyable enough once i realized what these missions called tall tales were and how to access them they led to some of my favorite moments graphics can be either beautiful or deadly under the circumstances a balanced mixture of ever changing waves and heavenly sunsets or cruel storms and destructive volcanoes a game that truly immerses the player in a vibrant world controls easy to pick up but don t be like me and pick out your banana instead of your pistol in a fight sound rough seas 24 7 and the occasional boat crunch when you drop your anchor too close to the shore love it difficulty the game offers very little in difficulty when you play with a crew the difficulty rises significantly when you try to solo a sloop solo means heightened awareness of all surroundings sea and land solo means if you gather enough treasure you welcome unwanted eyes from npc s and players alike and lastly solo means if you are chased by preying eyes and damaged you will have to act as both repairman and captain of the guns which is in my opinion no easy feat final rating even though the game offers purely cosmetic items for everything you unlock i still enjoyed having fun with friends and being shocked by the unpredictable settings that the game sets you in i for one will always recommend this game because it is downright fun to play,202.9,210.0,14,Recommended,"December 25, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Industrial Gamers!

80007,2023 have played sot for couple years now on both xbutt and pc and have watched the game slowly run itself into the depths sot at its core is a good game i m not posting this review complaining about that however i am writing this review as i have hit a brickwall with the moderators and rare themselves and more than likely will be permanently banned soon as they are getting tired of removing my posts which are calling them out in regards to their recent but we banned x accounts post sot has a lot of potential it fills that niche of allowing the user to explore freely while also giving them the choice if they want to do pve fishing pvp ambush tactics alliances hunting exploring questing story trying to break the game but something it has always struggled with is hackers and ever since they released hourglass that problem has only doubled as you need rank 100 to get the cool hip new cosmetics forcing players to do pvp which then leads to more people using hacks to succeed in pvp rather than get good at the game as people can get away with hacking as long as it isn t blatant and as long as it isn t video recorded when you mention hackers the forum mods remove it and label misinformation and when you call out that choice they then flag you with baiting staff and threaten to perma ban you if there wasn t an issue people wouldn t talk about hackers if you mention emporium aswell they get very angry emporium is a whole nother issue when i first started i thought emporium was great bought a couple skins was enjoying myself until i noticed a pattern y see people get really angry when you have paid cosmetics in game they go out of their way to harass emporium users soon as i removed my cosmetics the behaviour changed again people aren t as aggressive rare is known for putting all their eggs in a single basket y see they put everything into voyages one time content and emporium well atleast for last two years sure they added captaincy which is garbage because it gives you zero control over your own damned ship but also doesn t let you modify anything important anchor barrels cannons nobody cares about trinkets or paintings majority of captained vessels i ve seen are all copy paste aside from the ship name then you have hourglass arguably one of the worst things to happen to sot hourglass itself is fine however the server issues that came alongside it the forced interaction with pvp to get cosmetics or titles the in equality of ship supplies in matchmade pvp the mmr system which is fake and doesn t actually do anything not okay they seem hardstuck trying to push pvp instead of add features people have basically begged for years for still no new big encounter meg kraken still no new content for storms so no reason to ever enter one aside from escape fleas who run when you try to fight em but follow when you dont still no new region volcano is doa nobody ever goes in unless voyage forces it still no new enemies we still have potc enemies acting as new content no new ships no meaningful ship customization still can t restrict players on your team as a captain from using anchor aside from raising it no reason to level hunter callno reason to ever use order of soulsthe devs think reworking islands count as new content even though i ve never seen a single soul explore said reworked islands fort merrick you go to islands to collect and sell loot and then leave just as fast majority of their community still hasn t seen the new cutscene for flame or athena cause 100 pvp ranks is too much majority of their community won t do world events cause they know it s not worth the hassle you clear while watching horizon overwhelming majority won t touch sunken shrines cause you have to leave ship defenseless to clear the shrine and because of that ocean curse is always going to be ultra rare i ve only seen people do faf fof however you want to spell it activated world event with ritual skull maybe once nobody is dumb enough to waste their own time to have the work potentially stolen by every hippie in the server the tutorial for the game still after all of these years does not teach the user windmanagement which is why so many people exit tutorial and are so clueless about why the ship isn t moving fast hell the tutorial doesn t even teach you how to stop the ship an extremely unhealthy amount of people rely on anchor to do anything majority don t know that harpoon can grab loot either until people show you it zero tutorial for fishing either the quality of life features are awful for new players don t have friends time to enjoy sifting through random queue after random queue of people that want to sabotage or just want to join for payout and leave right after when you raise concern get told use discord not our problem instead of the devs getting off their arse and making an actual lobby list instead of randomly queue and pray captaincy should allow the player to write a custom message for their ship which appears in lobby list and allows the user to choose for themselves if they want to join fishing boat or shrines or pvp or meg hunters or story enjoyers or achievement hunting zero and i mean zero quality of life for users they expect demand you use discord to matchmake otherwise enjoy sifting for an hour to get people that wanna play sot complete focus on cash shop in game stuff from last year and half has been awful aside from pvp content and for all the money they re making they have worse servers than warcraft 3 reforged i don t suggest buying the game in current state they don t care about hackers unless they cheat the paid currency they don t care about server security they don t care about pve players they don t care about how bad the servers are running and the rubber banding any other game i have 20ms max this game comfortable 90ms at all times if not higher i wasn t going to write this review but y know what if they want to silence me on forums fine you can t delete reviews without paying off steam so better get shelving money to steam if you don t want my review up can t silence me otherwise tldr good game awful community awful developers and awful quality of

80016,2023 on my first day sailing my new captained ship i named it maurice we were fighting a skeleton fleet and we re struggling we still have enough resources to sink the skelly galleon but we are definitely struggling as we are playing a sloop the smallest boat with the least firepower then someone came into our ship saying that he s friendly and wanted to help us defeat the skelly ship since he said we ve been struggling a lot we were wary at first but there s something about him that made him so trustworthy it may be because his english is so nice and the way he talks is so friendly and inviting so we decided to trust him and have him at the helm while the rest of us shoot repair our ship the guy came in with a brig which is stationed on the other side of the skelly ship also shooting at the skelly ship long story short we sunk the galleon and tons of treasure float on the sea we haven t seen so much treasure before so we thanked the brig guys for their help and asked them if they wanted to share some of the spoils they declined and asked us to just hook every treasure on our ship we then chatted a bit about how their ship has a glowy red effects on the front taught us about factions in the battle for sea of thieves and had us join the opposing faction our ship now has a glowy blue effect in the front and we got really happy since my ship maurice looks so cool now this is the first time i ve met such nice people on the game i thought as all the people so far have been nothing but hostile to us all the nice people we ve met are either new to the game or are semi retired and they re just helping us out because we seemed new these guys are on a whole nother level we thought one last time we offered them the treasure at least to share since they deserved it they have reaper level 5 emissiary too which would sell really great the conversation roughly goes something like look man thanks a lot for your help feel free to take any treasure from the ship we re happy to share oh really i guess i ll take some then you know what i ll take what everything i thought he was joking i thought that bastard was joking his friend on the ship started shooting cannons at us i tried to jokingly negotiate with him to let us go and we ll drop some treasure for him but he did not budge he dropped our anchor set fire to maurice and sunk our ship we didn t have the chance to fight back since we re still mentally shocked after they killed us he started shaming us by telling us to take one treasure and swim to the closest outpost but i know that that s not worth it anymore told us to alt f4 and instantly rejoin to get all our treasure back i don t know why i didn t even try to fight back at the time and for once in my life i felt like a kid who just stepped out into the real world like a baby who had his lollies taken from him some of the last words he said to me had burned me until this day it s sea of thieves man mental crisis aside game was pretty good 9 5 10 would appreciate pve only mode though,105.2,73.0,31,Recommended,"August 2, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Doge McDogeface,False

80020,2023 original review my younger sister has been playing sot on and off for years now she finally convinced me to purchase the game a few weeks ago since i ve played for over 100 hours reached pirate legend and have really enjoyed my voyages on the seas the game is filled with content and things to do beautiful places and in depth stories but actually enjoying the story and pve aspects of sot is almost impossible not knowing the tricks and tips that the well versed community have access too as a new player can make the game seem impossible to play i was shocked that the servers were not skill or level based match making because of this it is somewhat annoying that you cant have private servers or even just pve servers while i understand where some of the concerns come from within the pro pvp community of sot i do not see how adding a pve side to the game would hurt sot if anything i think it would make the pvp aspect better by filtering out the players who are sailing to enjoy the lore and don t want to involve themselves in the pvp aspect which is totally valid and okay as a new player i really don t think i d recommend getting this game to others it is hard to get into without help especially if many of the players sharing your servers do not respect the pirate code the toxicity that some of these seasoned players show is disheartening and unwelcoming to newcomers while i have met a handful of fun and nice players over the last few weeks the bad experiences overshadow the good ones i hope that with safer seas being implemented we will see more changes for pve players and in general a more enjoyable experience for everyone update now that safer seas has been out for a while i think it s fair to say that many people within the community are disappointed for a lot of us safer seas was a lifeline for this game many of us were holding onto the hope that we could finally enjoy the game but i haven t wanted to play sot since safer seas released with no real reward for grinding not being able to use your own ships not being able to co op with other friendly pirates and being extremely limited on what you can and cant do ruins any fun aspects that the game had left i only started playing at the beginning of season 10 i obsessed over this game until safer seas released only because i was counting on the fact safer seas would be better and more enjoyable gameplay for someone like myself i can t even bring myself to log into the game anymore as it as tremendously boring while i enjoyed my time on the high seas pvp its not something that i want do all the time and i think players should be able to enjoy sea of thieves in both peaceful and pvp settings almost all other games have some form of pve or non friendly fire servers i hope that as safer seas ages changes are made to include the peaceful community,336.0,376.0,12,Not Recommended,"October 29, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Bunni ♡

80026,2021 sea of thieves is a game that amazed me for 130 hours of playing she caused me a lot of emotions but this is just the beginning many interesting tasks will not let you get bored even for a minute in this game you will have to spend at least five hours of playing a day in order to collect as many chests skulls cargo and rubies as possible in order to turn them in and get money and experience but do not relax because you are always in the open ocean where there are 5 more teams like you in the session with you and the most interesting thing is the battles these are the indescribable pleasures of firing guns or boarding and all this is combined with fun but at the same time gorgeous graphics in time you will become a legendary pirate as i became with my friends and no this is not the end of the game this is the key to more challenging adventures and huge rewards also in the game there is a customization that will give your character personality you can customize not only yourself but also your ship weapons and even musical instruments yes they are in the game too as well as various songs whick you can play with your friends there is also a donate in the game which absolutely does not affect the gameplay but gives a big opportunity to customize the character for example you can buy yourself a red cockatoo and name it polinochka as i did recruit a crew of up to four people choose one of three ships by the number of people and go to sea long live the sea of thieves,377.6,107.0,4,Recommended,"February 26, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"yaedavid

80030,season 12 update well after hundreds of hours it s time to uninstall my wife and i were death spiraling a brig she was getting red x after red x on the cannons masts down anchorballed on fire no chance they somehow stayed afloat suddenly all three come to board us one survives a blunder to the face at the top of the ladder and gets on he s impossible to kill blundered over and over won t take damage we have no holes no damage but he one shots us and we get black screened for 5 minutes then respawn across the map therefore in parting i have some good alternative names for this absolute fockjub of a game sea of grieferssea of hackerssea of spawncamperssea of exploitssea of glitchessea of incompetent devssea of utterly pathetic fps mechanicssea of toxic boarding metasea of hold a button for five seconds to pick up a fish off the skilletsea of i don t want to sit down or place a trinket sea of literally four different buttons to exit different menussea of picking up one farking

2024sea of infinite x beard errorssea of lifeless portssea of useless quarter of the map due to sea of homing missile volcanos and sea of exploding surfaces wherever you step hull devs tell me you hate your players without telling me you hate your players worst map design ever the upvotes on this review should be taken seriously by rare your game is borked many hours in now on season 12 and even with easy anti cheat the hacking is insufferable invisibility hacks will allow trolls to board your ship even when you have both ladders covered one shot you in the back anchor you and then spawncamp you this last crew never even sunk our ship they didn t even care about our treasure they just stayed on it and killed us over and over and over again we could shoot them in the face point blank they d spam roll on deck laughing and kill us from across the ship with a one shot blunder we didn t want to scuttle because we d spent hours getting loot seriously aimbots esp hacks and zero damage hacks are utterly horrid the hardcore player base is like oh these hacks don t exist yes they do just google them they ll come up as the first result and somehow rare can t combat this they are widely known and rampant in your game hacking is destroying this game the toxic players destroy this game the horrible hitreg destroys this game how can such an otherwise fantastic game be so so so bad those who know this game know that firing cannonballs in a pirate game is absolutely worthless it s literally a noob move one crewmate can bucket out water faster than you can fire a cannon fighting a ship with more than one player they will never sink if somebody is bucketing so what s the meta step 1 shoot yourself out of a cannon step 2 climb the ladder invisibility shoot through wall with aimbot ancient no sound exploit optional step 3 set fire to the ship optional step 4 camp the spawn points until the other crew gives up yep you never have to even fire a cannonball nice farging pirate game naval battles could be amazing and for those other players who enjoy naval it s been some of the most fun i ve had in a game i don t even care about losing in an intense naval fight and when i m full of holes and they board me and kill me i ll scuttle for them because they won like a real freaking pirate the naval combat is amazing so much strategy involved ammunition management aim trajectory sail height and angle speed it is a freaking masterpiece but again hackers or sweats won t even shoot a cannon they ll simply fire over on a cannon which is utterly stupid board you and anchor your ship then kill you over and over until you choose to scuttle they know where you re going to respawn they have no interest in firing a shot and getting water in your ship they simply rely on piss poor fps shooting mechanics hacks and respawn exploits to wear you down until you finally scuttle and quit it s horrific game design and it s no wonder this game attracts such a scummy player base when i convinced my son to play with us for a little while who is diamond in both apex and fortnite he played a few days and couldn t stand it he said i d rather play a game where the shots register one way rare could fix the utterly stupid and intensely toxic boarding issue retractable ladders simply make the ladders a breakable repairable object like masts wheels or capstans and so people actually have to shoot some cannonballs to lower ladders or ram to board as it stands this is a ridiculous design and something must be done about the spawn camping the scuttle to a different sea seems like an idiotic and utterly lazy solution this issue alone more than any other issue ruins this game and makes people quit it s simply not fun for a game with such awful fps mechanics cannonballs should be the meta it s a pirate game dear rare you make money from selling cosmetics right so you need your player base to keep playing right maybe fix the spawn camping issue so people don t abandon your game so quickly i ve asked ps5 friends to play sot with me and already some have replied that they hated it because the community is toxic that is a problem my kids used to play with me then we got boarded camped and trolled over and over again now they don t want to play it and i m out too beard and graphics card errors i have a 3080 my wife has a 3070 how are we being booted for graphics cards errors almost daily how are we getting network errors flip a coin as to how you re going to lose the loot you spent hours acquiring hackers on one side beard on the other final words do not waste your money or time on this game the devs would rather spend time making fancy trailer videos for instagram than fixing age old bugs combating hackers addressing the horrid hitreg using decent servers and a litany of other pathetic issues season 11 initial review let s start with this this game is amazingly fun to play with family i play with my wife and son and this have an absolute blast until you run into literally any other of the utterly toxic players horrible community simply harasses you until you leave the game there are very obvious cheating issues happening as my son and i have been ddos d while playing it s ridiculous that safer seas penalizes you for wishing not to play with the horrible community but it looks like i ll have to stick with the nerfed safer seas version to keep my router safe from ddos attacks and avoid the absolute arseholes who take joy in trolling new players new ps5 players are going to hate this game because the toxic arsewipes that sweat this game already have plenty of worthless gold and they re only there to grief you it s not worth playing even with safer seas as the game removes captained ships which means you can t sell to sovereigns at the port you have to run each piece of loot half a mile to sell it which makes this game tedious beyond imagination if rare simply let you have captained ships in safer seas mode i d absolutely love it why not allow us to play this masterpiece of a game without the cheating sweaty toxic pvp elements,537.1,243.0,23,Not Recommended,February 19,Sea of Thieves: 2024

80056,2023 ok so the primary reason you d not enjoy this is because of the squeakers the waves of little prepubescent wetpups completely lacking house training are my only real complaint here squeaking along the high seas doing things their tiny little minds find entertaining which is essentially squealing they are friendly then shooting you in the face and giggling about it short of this annoying and usually avoidable nuisance this is a very satisfying title the core of this game is sailing with the hunt for lootables and returning them safely to a vendor the underlying prime directive along the way you ll be faced with debilitating rain squalls with a smattering of shocking lightning strikes starting fires on deck bouncing off islands you didn t see in time resulting in holes torn all along yer larburd bow laddie infestations of bony pirate hating skellingtoons ghost ships rising out of the depths to challenge you unspeakable horrors lurking below waiting to hinder your progress and claw at your sanity and even a a few player ships who might choose to attack you at your lowest or come to your aid this is all played out in a simple yet incredibly effective visual style the graphics and cpu requirements being an xbox port are very low to achieve streamlined performance at max settings is not a great leap even for a dated machine however the implementation is most impressive with constant moments that are screenshot worthy and a truly immersive environment the key component to effecting this is the wave modelling lurching along then screaming your way down the backend of waves or calmly puddling with a cross wind pulling your vessel to full heel is an incredibly satisfying experience while the game itself is wildly open ended with tons of fascinating little islands hidden grottos undersea shrines temples fortified outposts sunken wrecks and other special locations to discover and explore there are also organised activities along the lines of tall tales and event quests that appear in conjunction with the games seasons currently in its 8th iteration tall tales are what one might term campaign missions and while the lore and backstory of the area we are playing in is provided through these there is also a superb pirates of the caribbean tie in with good old captain jack sparrow and the rest of the movie characters showing an appearance while many believe johnny depp was used to voice the iconic wobbly captain it was in fact a voice actor by the name of jared butler i challenge you to detect the difference mr butler has voiced depp s part in other cartoons and video games including depp s mad hatter character to circle back to the seasons these have been used to further major plotlines as well as game dynamics with the 4th season introducing an entire new island and faction for example while the current season has organised ship vs ship pvp queues that result in your vessel diving beneath the waves flying dutchman style to emerge adjacent to your matched enemy for some swopping of cannonball holes ship combat has some unique additions to what you may be expecting from similar titles while the standard hurling of wirling iron is the primary combat choice your cannon may be filled with firebombs shrapnel shells chainshot cursed balls forces dancing or inebriates entire crew and even yourself or your pets launching yourself out of a cannon is the most effective if aimed correctly method of boarding enemy vessels and while you have harpoons at your disposal climbing a ladder out of the water will most likely result in meeting a blunderbuss to the eyeball as you clamber on deck all player combat is on an equal footing as the 3 gun options and sword you have on first spawn are the only ones available in game the hp percent taken per weapon is sword 25 swing 75 thrust flintlock pistol 55 eye of reach sniper 75 blunderbuss 10 shells 10 eachfor those that find pvp a hinderance to game enjoyment it is 90 of the time avoidable once you learn how to be aware of your surroundings simply scanning the horizon will alert you to potential threats and using chat to ask people their intentions can be effective once you learn that most squeakers are idiots however if you are accosted on foot dying will respawn you on your vessel if it is still floating after a quick visit to the ferryman the different vessels are threefold sloop 1 2 person crew turns fastest and when sailing directly in the no go zone headwind is the fastest ship in game 2 cannons brigantine 2 3 person crew possible to solo but tricky has medium turning speed and is the fastest on a broad reach 4 cannons galleon 4 person crew really hard to solo and tricky with 2 has slow turning speed and is fastest on a dead run 8 cannons this obviously translates as well to pve ship combat vs skeleton crews tall tales events and ghost ships as well as other things overall a personally suprising title with something for everybody a very affordable steam price and longetivity to boot arrrrrrrrrrr for more reviews and rantings march over to my curator page the imaginings of a gamer,280.9,165.0,27,Recommended,"February 22,

80060,2022 in a sentence fun but conflicted and shallow at time of writing there is no doubt in my mind that sea of thieves is the pirate adventure experience it s got everything i want from such mermaids grog treasure maps sea monsters and an abundance of hidden burried sunken treasure as well as the rare interesting and nervwracking player encounters a la dayz but it suffers from several major problems that keep it from being a true gem the combat overall can suffer from hit reg issues but is otherwise fine ship v ship pvp however has major issues primarily because of the ships in short the small 2 man sloop is the best ship in the game the 3 man brig and 4 man galleon are slightly faster have way more cannons and are much more imposing but in reality they simply can t compete with the sloop s maneuverability meaning the game actively punishes sailing with a larger crew then there is the issue with conflicting player desires some people are here for fun naval combat some are here for a fun adventure on the seas some are here to be the terror of those seas the problem comes when those meet when i ve just spent an hour going through a story voyage hauling the treasures i fought tooth and nail for the fastest way of ruining my experience is to be ambushed by hardcore pvp players and cordially invited to eat dirt while they espouse my mothers enjoyment of their big bananas frankly the game needs community servers there is so much in the game that would benefit from actual in game communities like the alliance system burying treasure and the new seaforts that can be maintained as temporary player bases once cleared but that s apparently not on the board there is also exactly nothing in the terms of endgame and i don t mean i expect them to put in some kind of world boss actually that would be freaking sweet i m more referring to the fact that this game about plundering golden treasure has practically nothing of interest to spend it on once you ve bought all the promotions in the different factions and bought all the cosmetics you like there s nothing to put your money into besides making more money there s been talk for a long time of the fabled captaincy update that would let you make your own customized ship and help you realize that fantasy of being a recognizeable crew with your own reputation but it s been teased so long that people have started treating it like a myth currently the big goal for those dedicated is the dark adventure set of cosmetics that are certainly cool looking but also arbitrarily expensive a good session of looting might net you around 50 000 gold and sure you can get a basic hairstyle option or makeup pattern for like 200 000 gold but the basic tunic will run you over a million if you want a full set of clothing along with the weapons that s gonna run you close to 20 million and the ship set is close to 40 and it s not even the the coolest looking set you can buy the game rewards you with small amounts of premium currency from time to time a design choice i can t praise enough so if you just save up you ll earn enough to buy a cooler looking premium ship set in the countless hours it ll take you to grind the money for dark adventures to sum up fun until you ve gotten to pirate legend and done the story voyages and world events then you ll pretty much only have roaming pvp and a pile of money with nothing impactful to spend it on,326.3,86.0,5,Recommended,"April 13, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Pickled Gherkin

80087,2020 losing is fun try not to let negative reviews talking about forced pvp sway you away from this near masterpiece while the pvp can be frustrating it is some of the most dynamic and exciting pvp i ve come across in a long time blow them to bits with cannons repel boarders shoot yourself out of a cannon and board them drop their anchor steal their rowboat full of loot and slink away into the night yes the pvp is unavoidable at times but if you re paying attention to the horizon and keep situational awareness you can certainly diminish your player interactions or avoid it completely yes large crews prey on solo players yes you will lose your loot after gathering it yes you will have a total blast if you learn from the times you lost and turn that into victories i spent around 10 hours on a solo ship and the rest with friends public crews here s how it boils down solo incredibly atmospheric high tension and excitement public mixed bag generally pretty good but can be awful as well friends where this game shines sailing a galleon efficiently is a nightmare with 3 friends it s a breeze all in all it s utterly beautiful dynamic and fun pvp isn t going anywhere embrace it you will certainly lose but it gives you the best stories and really isn t writing your own sea shanty what this is all about,114.6,193.0,9,Recommended,"June 8, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Jaycen,False

80099,2020 sea of thieves is overwhelmed with pvp at the moment if you re planning on buying the game to enjoy its pve content you ll soon realize many players have played the game for so long they are only looking for pvp at this point and they will lead you into a fight no matter what your intent is they can t take no for an answer so you will be insulted countless times just because you re here when they are they will be very creative at making your experience terrible for their own enjoyment it s pretty rare that they ll just take your loot if any then leave without pushing it further for 15 minutes most likely they ll sink your ship and kill you repeatedly even though it serves no purpose besides wasting your time the community is toxic beyond belief and their debate over private servers is yet another proof the game itself is very immersive with gorgeous graphics and ambiences awesome characters ships design and most of the pve content is enjoyable even in solo it s not too casual yet not too hard though you ll definitely need a good team to unlock what this game has to offer menus are confusing at first but you get used to them pretty quickly to be honest i d be 100 recommending this game if the players base was not so despicable i ve not met anyone friendly in 40 hours of gameplay and i truly mean not once despite what some people might say i don t mind pvp every now and then but i despise toxic communities and this one is the worst i ve seen by far over nearly 25 years of gaming i cannot recommend this game to new players mixing pvp and pve together isn t a terrible idea but right now people are playing this game as if it was just another team based competitive fps and you can t really enjoy pve with that many bullies and trolls around i ve given this game a chance twice and i still enjoy its content and gameplay very much yet i uninstalled it again and i m considering asking for a refund because toxic players can t even understand when they re going too far i feel like people are asking for private servers mostly to avoid toxic players at this point not just for roleplay with rewards disabled and i cannot blame them for asking that much this shouldn t happen what a shame for such an amazing game edit anyone complaining about toxic pvp players in their review are receiving tons of judgemental comments which again proves how toxic this community is just browse through negative reviews sometimes even positive ones and see for yourself besides trolls and fake reviews this topic is present in almost every single review the same guys that are bullying players in the game are finding cheap excuses for their toxic behavior in the comments around here no good will ever come from such community until pvp is somehow restricted and toxic players are effectively removed i don t believe this is happening anytime soon i ve watched pro players streaming sot ever since release and even though they re nearly unbeatable at the game they re still annoyed by all these toxic behaviors no online game should ever come to this,118.9,691.0,71,Not Recommended,"August 27, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,ShmuPixel,False

80105,i am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 15 now my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he let me borrow his controller me and my son then played in turns and i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game has helped build my relationship with my son back to how it was before he lost his mother,513.3,687.0,36,Recommended,April 13,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Dis,True

80116,2020 edit please read discussion in the comments below for a more complete view there are others with very different opinions from me and it would be helpful to see everyone s perspective edit i am seeing a lot of comments with statements like get gud rather than continue to respond to those individually i am included my comments rebuttals at the bottom of the review i love this game dearly however there are some key issues that need to be ironed out and i am torn on whether i would recommend your first 10 20 hours like me are going to be a dream you ll grab some friends and start sailin the seven seas and living your best pirate life but like me eventually you are going to start noticing a vile vile trend the most experienced players in the game which as the game gets older turn into a larger and large portion of the player base all follow the same basic deeply frustrating tenets when it comes to naval battles that is to say they don t instead experienced players use a storied exploit to board your ship and spawn camp you until you either die or scuttle in allowing for this play style to persist rare is preventing the central promise of the game to be fulfilled we will never have the pitched epic sea battles of our dreams regarding get gud hi denso thanks for reading i was talking about the speed swimming trick with the sword dash i know that it has become kind of enshrined within the community so that many people don t view it as an exploit however almost all of the people who i have played with kinda feel like its an exploit i hope this helps i d love to talk about this more i know that my view on this can be a little contentious especially because of how many of us in the community just use it like any other ability chrispsthunder i would agree with denso actually like i said in my review it is honestly a really great game but it just has some huge holes in the combat maybe you ll be able to look past it i just feel as though the sea battles aren t what i need them to be and i m still looking for that thank you everyone for the feedback i m seeing a couple comments talking about how the sword dash is a feature and that i just need to get better at repelling boarders first off thank you to denso i did not know this was a discussion the community had before i tried google ing it a little but to be honest my research was not that thorough so thanks i worry i may have misrepresented myself in my review the sword dash trick is a part of what i feel to be a larger issue the prevalence of boarding in the sea combat although boarding needs to be in the game i feel like its too easy rn as a result most sea battles are spent dealing with people trying to climb onto the ship and not maneuvering and firing cannons back and forth a really easy fix for this that a friend of mind mentioned would be the ability to pull up ladders that way if you wanted to board someone you would actually have to cannon yourself onto the deck or run up along side them to leap aboard in conclusion i understand if you feel the boardings are just another viable strategy but for me personally and i would imagine others this detracts from the naval combat as less time is spent on actual ship to ship combat and when people do board it feels less like a clutch maneuver and more run of the mill,331.4,504.0,33,Not Recommended,"December 24, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,yetiwarlock,False
80120,2020 genreaction adventure gamecampaignyes but online only game lengthn a only onlinedifficulty modesnormalgamepedia page link seaofthieves gamepedia com overviewsea of thieves is one of the best multiplayer coop experience you can currently get it highly depends on your crew you and up to your 3 friends can join to have your own adventure the beauty of this game is that it does not have any progress in developing your character at first it may seem pretty repetitive and boring there is no way to make your ship stronger or character do more damage this makes every encounter on the seas challenging the only progress that you can make is by knowing the core mechanics better and use them to your advantage by smart managing your ship and using all variety of different cannonballs it is deffinietly possible to sink a 4 person galleon while flying 2 person sloop the only things that you can buy for money are clothes and different skins to your weapons and equipment but you won t get any benefits by using endgame and rare varieties of this skins you can look whatever you like fitting in many different sets of clothes not losing any stats game had a pretty rough start in 2018 by a lack of content but now rare took a good care of their masterpiece by adding regularly new content and even new core mechanics such as fire rare is one of the most transparent and connected to community companies i ve ever seen they love their game and care about community the updates are well thought out and makes changes that make me go back every time the new update is released however this is not a game for everyone its mainly for people that have lots of free time to spare quick in and out voyages can become a long hours of traveling thru seas collenting more and more loot just to the point that other crew will decide to attack you and steal all the loot yes this game is pvp only that doesn t necessarily mean that everyday you would find someone so desperate to kill you that he will chase you thru all map and eventually get you in confrontation but loosing your hard earned progress just a few minutes away from outpost in with u would cash in your loot is a part of the game i literally have a thiev word in the title so by setting sail be sure that you will eventually lose many thousands of cash by other players it is in my opinion a great test whether you really like this game if you would sail for like a 4 5 hours on duo sloop with your friend just to be downed by a galleon of reapers bones and after a break to chill after this loss you would still want to play and maybe make up what your lost trust me you won t regret,994.1,101.0,5,Recommended,"June 12, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"༺Remiel༻

80128,a pirates life to havea beautiful game with plenty of stuff to do sadly it requires having friends because most encounters with players end in pvp instead of friendship another down side is the requirement of a x box live account but as long as you have played minecraft in the last year or two you should most likely have one being forced onto you already i forgot to mention that the game desperately needs a decent tutorial for pvp or ship maintenance you only get told how to patch a single hole and how to raise the mast but by the time you actually encounter players and get shot up to a point where you survive but have to repair you already forgot how to do it game doesnt tell you to aim for different areas on the ship either for more damage you wont sink a ship by hitting the same spot 50 times i would recommend getting it on sale for 20 bucks not the full price imo,263.7,46.0,2,Recommended,May 9,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Kiba2134

80132,2023 what can i say except that i absolutely love this game back in 2020 i eagerly counted the days until it was finally released for pc and on steam since then i have been immersed in its captivating world with a group of friends and every session we had an absolute blast we have embarked on daring adventures sailing from smugglers bay to the volcanic islands in the devil s roar delivering crucial cargo just in the nick of time to wild henry we have fearlessly battled against formidable foes such as krakens sharks and even bigger sharks all while weathering treacherous tropical storms we have sent countless skeleton ships to the depths of the sea plundering vaults brimming with untold treasures and amassing wealth fit for kings on this incredible journey we have not only discovered new allies and formed powerful alliances but we have also experienced the thrill of deception betraying those very alliances and reveling in the spoils of victory by indulging in merriment at the tavern we have even encountered comical mishaps like accidentally setting our ship ablaze due to a forgetful cook leaving food on the pan and our hearts sank as we witnessed our beloved ship succumb to enemy cannon fire its demise punctuated by the deafening thunder of their broadsides throughout the years the game has consistently delivered unforgettable moments without a doubt this game stands as one of the most captivating and joyous experiences i have had in the world of gaming embarking on epic quests with a crew of up to four pirates allows for unparalleled camaraderie and exploration in the vast sea of thieves i wholeheartedly recommend playing this game with your friends as it elevates the overall gaming experience to new heights yet even when sailing solo the dynamic game world and ever changing events ensure an exhilarating adventure awaits at every turn in my humble opinion this game is an absolute masterpiece deserving nothing short of a perfect 10 10 rating,666.0,60.0,2,Recommended,"June 12, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"LuNa

80142,2021 i first got this game at the same time as my friend when it was 50 off we both played it together for a little and were at first a little overwhelmed by how vast and intricate the objectives and mechanics were we spawned in a cosy cavern lit with lanterns where we immediately discovered that you can get dangerously drunk we spent our first 10 minutes in the game stumbling around the tavern as we kept filling our tankards getting more and more tipsy with each pint i highly recommend trying it if you get the game its a lot of fun the aim of the game is to travel out onto the oceans in your pirate ship doing quests conquering other vessels collecting hauls of gold and riches and really doing whatever else you want there is nothing you can buy that will provide you a competitive advantage for you in the game so the gold you earn goes towards cosmetics for your ship clothing for your pirate and skins for your weapons and instruments yes you can play hearty sea shanties to pass the time the main way to tell if someone is experienced at the game or a noob is by what they are wearing and if they have expensive cosmetics its a charming system in my opinion their is however a class that everyone is working towards pirate legend this is the highest class of pirate which you can obtain by getting level 50 emissary in three trading companies trading companies are different factions that you can represent which give you quests that when completed level you up in that faction the different trading companies are the gold hoarders the merciant alliance the reaper s bones athena s fortune and the order of souls the map consists of a vast ocean scattered with different islands forts and outposts the pvp aspect of the game really got my attention the exhilaration of exchanging cannon fire with other ships boarding enemies vessels and taking them out with your sword and gun and stowing away in the shadows of the opponents ships waiting for the right time to pounce making sure to do all this while managing your own ship patching holes with planks of wood bucketing water out of the bottom of the ship putting out fire on deck hoisting the sails and adjusting them to the direction of the wind and steering the ship to get the perfect angle for cannon fire a cluster of tasks all at once with loud noises all around and people yelling commands it really immerses you and makes you feel like you re really there all in all this game is a masterpiece of combat and adventure one of the most enjoyable games i own i highly recommend this to anyone who wants some good pvp some amazing discovery and some downright fun time with friends have fun sailing and watch out for the kraken,80.7,52.0,3,Recommended,"May 2, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Sascha Hoiles

80148,2022 i am not going to lie this game is a masterpiece you can play solo or with friends and the experience is overall great the graphics are well optimized and stunning especially the clear night sky the sound design is fabulous and the devs still continue to try and make this game even greater via their updates whether you are a casual gamer who plays few hours a week or a hardcore farmer ready to reach the skies there is content for you however tonight i had another bad experience with some players of this game there is a company called the reaper s bones which goal is to fight and sink the boats that belong to the other trading companies well after farming it for several hours and dodging a server hopper people hopping into a server and leaving instantly if there is no loot stacked onto a ship in order to go find it elsewhere another one came to the server chasing us while boasting you are reaper come fight us then sinking themselves in order to make us think that they left the server and then coming to our boat sinking it and watching us die without even trying to steal and sell our loot the problem is that if they accepted our alliance offer we both could have gained some precious coin instead of fighting to the death the lore of this pvp faction serves as an excuse for these players to rapidly switch servers until they find a huge stack of loot that other players accumulated and to go sink them i already hear regular players reading this review and thinking well why did you became a reaper if you didn t want to fight my answer there once was a pvp mode called the arena where the only goal was to fight against the others this mode was removed sea of thieves then became a full pvpve game with necessary farming to get those juicy cosmetics especially in this specific reaper s bones pvp faction and while these toxic players spam the excuse of a pvp faction i raise my right to do pve in total tranquility please devs do something to prevent server hopping i won t be playing this game for some time,406.2,99.0,16,Recommended,"June 21, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Machiavelli_5040,False

80160,2022 edit first lol the people proving my point about the toxic players like you literally couldn t have validated that part of my review any more than you have in replies saying just skill issue or just insults is removed actual convos only be civil second not mad just honest i never said i wasnt going to keep playing just pointing out flaws its a review after all i am just saying if you dont like rust skip this its pirate rust its not a good casual game yes i play it every night on a galleon i bought with 3 other friends doesnt mean solo play isnt almost entirely trash for the most part lack of people isn t the issue its lack of balance for solo players third no one cares that you never saw a cheater they still exist they still mess with people and all that proof is on youtube game needs a report button i have 200 hours in 40 days i saw 6 i ll start by saying i love the game but it has a lot of stuff that makes me feel like i cant recommend it past if you re a rust player who wants to be a pirate and abuse certain parts of the game the game is super fun super atmospheric and when you can at least fight people and get in ship battles and have a fair fight it s super fun looks great feels great easy to pick up hard to master it s even better with friends that said there s a few flaws with the game a few but the issue is that they are very big and obvious flaws within sea of thieves land combat combat in the game is really really simple but is infested with people who abuse bugs and mechanics to cheese this really shows when you literally can t do anything as a solo player against anyone who isn t solo due to these terrible bugs and mechanics people abuse within the combat system you want to sword fight someone well unless you got a group of buddies the same size as them prepare to have people animation cancel with the sword lunge to fly 35 yards and one shot you if you were too busy fighting their duo or the duo just shoots you in the back with a blunderbuss or pistol you wanna sword fight 1v1 nah they ll just abuse the fact that you can phase through players to just keep running through you and your block to hit you in the back or reload as they do it to blunderbuss pistol you in the back player collision needs to be a thing it d solve a lot of the issues this game has with combat feeling terrible why have a constant block just make it a parry ship combat the second issue is that in ship combat people will usually do anything but fight with cannons usually people do two things which is they opt to use a bunch of these silly specialty cannonballs that disable steering force anchor drops disable guns disable barrels from being accessed so you cant repair put you to sleep etc it goes on those balls should be pve only and used less by skelly ships because the ability to spam those on players makes ship combat a bit of a joke when a brig can lock your guns down permanently because they went around and collected a bunch of peace balls it s that or people will often just not even fight instead they launch themselves from their cannon to your ship bit of a dumb mechanic as well it should leave you half dead and crippled for balance and firebomb the whole deck or they just swim under you with bomb barrels and cause so much damage its impossible to not be sunk unless you have two or more crew mates unless you re a 2 crew on a mid or large sized ship you simply cant defend against it the smallest ship basically just insta sinks when one of those goes off under the deck or they put one down below one up top wreck the mast and steering wheel and then if you fight it sinks you repair they kill you as you try and it sinks the small ship is just too weak to the bomb barrels this is again well more apparent when you re playing solo digging up a chest and cant be at your ship to even defend it let alone see the person coming then your whole ship is gone treasures gone quest maps are gone and all they had to do was drop on barrel in the bottom deck not fun sure you can shoot the barrel as they carry it but again im not at the ship im following my maps cheating the third issue is hackers given the age of the game its kind of surprising the lack of ability to actually report someone that i ve seen i had some 16 year old following me around flying to my ship and spawning dropping bomb barrels at my location with less than a second on the timer left and you literally cannot defend against it they fly over head drop them you get blasted if you arent on a bigger ship you re just done i tried to leave and find a new game same server i literally cannot play the game when that happened from the barrel hacker then they just sit on the beach as my ship is sinking with me in it in voip spamming hahah you re bad while their voice cracks and they laugh about sinking you using barrel hacks super fun oh report the dude can t there s no way to see other crews unless you spyglass them but they just fly away before i can get a name its pretty rare but it happens super fun pvp pvp while being a draw to the game is also a factor that costs this game most of the new players it gets as of now you get sunk and you spawn nearby and can be attacked endlessly if there is a cheater they can bully you endlessly currently pvpers can come at you just trying to enjoy the narrative content of the game and steamroll you endlessly while risking nothing at all and stealing quest items they cant even sell you know what would fix these issues in a heartbeat though pve only servers another thing that would fix it your ship sinks and you go to a new server i hear that may become a thing but right now nah a third fix 2 servers pvp double rewards pve normal fix four pve servers that make you use a different pirate than pvp servers so you can do casual stuff in pve and trick the pve pirate out and have a pvp pirate and do stufff there to trick them out on a pvp server so you can do both depending on what you wanna do at that time pvp purists dont like that though they claim that it would make the game worse or kill it but it wouldn t they do all it would do is force them to do more than grief people because it would require they need to be face people who know how to pvp arent new and they want easy loot so they cry about people just wanting to enjoy the game pvp should be end game not thee game in its entirety greifing the game for pvp is at least 75 of the time people greifing you while they spam slurs insults at you in voice chat you spawn on your ship to fire in the spawn spot and being shot you scuttle the ship and try to move on but it spawns you 2 minutes away so they rush over and sink you for literally nothing then complain when you dont interact with them its not a fun game because the older players make it unfun i cant recommend it to casuals being that its very unfriendly to new players with the odd mechanics for combat ship fights bad pvp pve balance i just cant say it doesn t make the game somewhat unplayable because it does i know a bunch of people who abuse said mechanics grief are just going to say get good or whine about suggesting they should be gone or nerfed but that s the truth if you dont like gimmicks in your games that make the interesting parts worse this game probably aint for you if you can handle that its not balanced and the current player base tries to make new players quit and cheaters that can ruin a lobby sometimes then hit this game up its still fun just annoying when it all happens and it happens a lot if they fix the silly mechanics and bad pvpve balance i ll for sure swap my review but yeah those are just not fun parts of the game and they really need a way to report cheaters and toxic players

80168,2023 tl dr i want to leave a mixed review but since it s one extreme or the other negative review even if there s plenty to love now for the meat of it the corp speak from the latest news is hilarious and a spit in the face for the people who want to love the game but can t you know the countless people who want to sail around and enjoy the myriad of pve content the game has to offer but keep getting murdered and griefed at every which turn and of course when people bring it up online the best in gaming community just fires back with git good or play something else it s this community that makes me avoid everything in the world from being around the community see someone docked at an outpost avoid them like the plague go find another outpost see someone out at sea again avoid like the plague go the complete other direction while using your ship s speed advantage that they don t explain for new players and everything i ve learned i ve had to read online that said i d be remiss to say there isn t plenty i enjoy seriously i plugged in 100 hours before i knew it and want to actively spend more money on the game to play pirate barbie vibing with some fishing sailing around from gorgeous waters and islands doing quests voyages taking in the charm of all the npcs they ve sprinkled about the music the sound design there are so many cool things going on i cannot emphasize this enough i genuinely and completely want to adore this game but the community that microsoft rare wants to tote as being amazing is honestly anything but when you encounter them in game will i probably try and do a few more commendations to keep myself occupied after this review yes but until they finally add a means for the pve community to enjoy themselves without fear of griefing cheaters at every which turn i ll move on before too long unless my friends want to hop on,112.6,48.0,1,Not Recommended,"July 28, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Tree Fren,False
80169,2023 legitimately fun game if a bit shallow repetitive but absolutely ruined by the huge incentive for players to just be jerks but if you enjoy the game play loop simple cosmetic achievement based progression it can absolutely be fun until your ship is sunk you lose everything you spent hours of your time gaining if you care about earning gold progressing the game by buying new cosmetics increasing your reputation you will care when that gold is stolen hours of your time is wasted this is what made me quit if you don t care about cosmetics and earning reputation to play more of the same type of repetitive missions there s no point in playing actually playing the game is slow ships move slow players walk swim slow combat is slow and the only things to do are earn gold for more cosmetics or attack other players for their gold to buy cosmetics or just to be a jerk surely you can just choose to avoid pvp or avoid other players not really the map is small enough that you will run in to other players frequently and there s plenty of players that are only looking to attack other players there is a match making mode hourglass fights to participate in pvp against other players who want to play pvp however this is not the game s primary pvp you can also simply join the main game attack other players with no downsides there is no in game police that will chase player killers or shops that won t buy stolen goods everyone is incentivized to kill you at any time and they ll be rewarded for it with your hard earned loot what is the point spending multiple hours getting a few hundred thousand gold worth of treasure when you can simply kill everyone on the server and take the treasure they spent hours earning pvp players have no risk the only thing to lose is the tiny bit of money spent on cannonballs wood food yet they have a massive incentive to attack other players since they can get hours worth of loot in 20 minutes and if they sink they just try again if you enjoy doing anything other than pvp you re always at a disadvantage against people who want to do pvp and this seems intended by the devs want to play solo too bad every other ship is faster than you much more capable of destroying you than you are of defending yourself or fleeing since the vast majority of players have at least 1 friend playing with them sure your sloop is more maneuverable than a brig or galleon but good luck out maneuvering them on the open ocean especially without anyone to help repair your ship while you steer want to do world events or even just pve voyages gold hoarders order of souls merchants etc too bad even though these are the most inherent basic ways to just play the game all of these draw attention to yourself leave your ship vulnerable while you carry them out there s a very good chance of your ship being sunk looted while you re on an island or fighting ghost fleets want to do tall tales too bad even with 0 loot onboard your ship the vast majority of other players want to kill you and or sink your ship on sight you can try to out run them possibly for over an hour the game always takes a long time to play most people playing are younger with multiple hours to dedicate even just to harassing others or try to sneak onto the island progress turn in the tall tale which for me has always resulted in me dying losing all progress on that tall tale since checkpoints are exceptionally rare in the open world tall tales additionally you frequently have to turn items in at specific outposts so if there s another player at that island you now have to risk dying or simply sail around the map for 30 60 minutes hope they leave and that you don t get killed by someone else while waiting trying to flee from an enemy player s ship too bad there s an extremely high chance of random events attacking you such as skeleton ships and the kraken or megalodon which only slows you down helps the pvp players since they don t mind waiting for the random events to sink you you d think well the random events could spawn on the enemy ships too you re right but multiple things make random events less lethal for players looking for pvp they re almost always better equipped for combat repairing their ship than you since they chose to begin attacking other players they re much more able to take damage to their ship since it doesn t matter if they slow down or go off course to fix it if you do that they catch up kill you they can afford to simply sail away come back later if their ship is ever in actual danger since no one is chasing them the fact that players can be 1 shot by a blunderbuss means if you re outnumbered you always lose all but 1 enemy players jump onto your boat kill you while dropping your anchor raising sails lighting fires while the other player moves their ship away from your cannons leaving their ship 100 safe and allowing the enemy players to re spawn infinitely if you manage to kill the enemy player s onboard your ship they just spawn come right back since it takes only a few seconds for them to drop your anchor masts yet significantly longer to un do these actions it s nearly impossible to escape once they ve boarded your ship they ll just stand in a spot where you can t blunderbuss them and shoot you the instant you get close have fun re spawning 10 times while your ship sinks more and more all game mechanics are heavily focused towards slowing down your play changes in wind direction random events like fog storms pve attacks and the massive distance between everything both in the ocean on foot which makes sense for a game with extremely shallow progression yet this also plays in favor of pvp players since they don t have to run around on islands or swim down to mermaid caves better yet they can just sink your ship while you do all that slow tedious stuff there s also constant server performance issues but it s barely worth mentioning compared to the game mechanics purposefully chosen by the devs the team is slow to push updates both feature updates bug fixes if you have performance issues now you re basically guaranteed to still have them 3 weeks from now hope you aren t looking forward to the next feature update it s almost always going to be less than what they promised filled with bugs tl drthis game could be fun if it was either filled with slow tedious game mechanics to slow down your progression in order to make the game seem larger longeror massively incentivizing rewarding killing other playerswith the game doing both it just takes forever then you die and lose all your stuff not fun not worth it,93.7,176.0,18,Not Recommended,"November 10, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Snipers Recon,False

80183,2023 here are my honest thoughts on the game high seas with over 150hours invested into high seas i feel i am in a good position to give an honest and fair review of high seas so here it is high seas players for the most part are pve players looking to enjoy friendly pvp encounters but want to focus on pve content with maximum rewards gained for their valuable time and effort however if the comments in these forums are anything to go off those that would have you believe that the pvp community are lovely people are full of themselves the pvp community in this game is by far the worst i have ever come across even worse than dayz and that s saying something they will constantly shun you and purposefully try to bully you into believing their opinion is the right one and that you are not to be believed nor trusted with your experiences because they themselves have never had a bad one or have good ones every play through this is far from the truth if you load into high seas you can be rest assured that within your first few hours of playing the game you will have some sweat lord roll up on you and do what they do best get toxic verbally abusive to the point of telling you to end yourself and sink you while throwing slurs and abuse your way god only help you if you re a female player because you are going to get called a lot worse and really have some disgusting things said to you this is if they don t chase you across half the map first or you don t manage to run away and scuttle before they get to you high seas to the devs and pvp lords is a perfect game couldn t be fixed and must be played to their pleasure not yours i have spent many hours playing high seas and it has only gotten more toxic since safer seas has come out noting once again in these forums there are a few select people who get confused with pvevp and pvpve the concept is simple pvevp player vs environment vs player while pvp is a concept and component in the game the core focus is pve and the game should theoretically be played as such with the game mechanics facilitating this with pvp elements to your pve gameplay not the other way around as these people love to try to say this game is pvpve it is marketed tagged and sold as a pvevp and unlike the very out of touch select group in these forums having played my last hs session today i can tell you this entire statement is accurate having been minding my own business and rolled up on by a sweat lord sworn at called a coward told to go end yourself edited because the 3 letter acronym is banned text go play ss if you don t want pvp loser this is the type of gameplay they will try to tell you doesn t exist or rarely happens you re just unlucky but the truth is it happens more often than they will admit and if they say it doesn t they re probably the ones instigating it with their entire argument backed by its called sea of thieves or you got a pvpve game its what you paid for sad mentality which these people seem to harbour so much saltiness towards the pve player base for some unknown reason but its very sad they are so driven to make the pve player base leave by bullying them out or at the very least conform to their ideology bringing me back to the whole pvevp meaning and what the game is actually marketed as compared to how the game is actually played safer seas oh let s talk about this game mode it was wrongly advertised and wrongly marketed as a place where people who enjoy the aforementioned pvevp can go to really enjoy their experience of player vs environment and not be punished for it however we have seen a couple of moderators and players tell us this game mode serves as a tutorial for hs and if that is the case should have been marketed as one in the first place before people spent real money on a game to play a game mode that failed to deliver in its initial concept marketed purpose since this game mode has come out these forums have exploded with many many players expressing their sincere displeasure with this mode and how it has been delivered attempting to give honest constructive and genuine feedback to the moderation team and as stated in a statement from rare this team works directly with them the devs in the hope that they would listen to this feedback and act in the best interest of their player base and not their own selfish desires however this has been the case where we have now seen the admin team forming a single minded agenda based response system copying and pasting responses shutting down threads that tell them they are doing a bad job and like myself banning people who speak out more harshly against this type of despicable behaviour the feedback given should of been welcomed but instead we have been told that unlike every other game on the market the devs will not adapt to their player base and will instead stick their heads in the sand and wish it all went away by censoring and silencing people who speak out against it let s get this out there while this game mode might be enjoyed by a small handful of pve players who like to play with their families or may have special access needs this game mode is not enjoyed by the majority of pve players for its simple yet obvious attempt at giving the pve community the middle finger by cutting profits rewards taking away captained ships blocking voyages and more the attempts to silence people and delete their comments only go to show that anyone who does not agree with the dev s failed vision of a pvp only game will be silenced like many others i have spent real world money on this game and in the epic store buying skins etc helping to keep the community the player base and the game alive not to mention pay these devs mods bills i am sincerely appalled at the moderators and the dev team for their actions in silencing people for having opposing views that may shine a light on their actions and calling them out for it in an age where censorship is the only way to enforce your point it is disturbing to see it happening here too i have compiled and will continue to compile video evidence of the censorship taking place on these forums which may make a great video one day who knows all i know is if you have read this far and are considering buying this game i would carefully think about your valuable real world coin because if you do and are hoping the game will be a welcome place where you can act like a pirate but have fun in the game you may want to think again the support structure in place both in these forums and at rare will not support any grievance you have pvp tickets raised for toxic behaviour go unaddressed and you had better not have an opposing view to that of the game devs or stand from under because you re in for hell if you do if the devs truly cared about the game and their vision they would listen to their community and adapt accordingly take fortnite for example it listens to its community and adapts to the times giving its players what they ask for because of it they make millions of dollars a week estimated 8billion in 2023 from 6 billion in 2022 and are one of the most successful games running for many years now if the devs want to look at successful game models fortnite is one along with many others and paying attention to what s working and what isn t for your community is how you run a successful business game it s really that simple i know that i will cop a lot of abuse from these select group of players in these forums against this post however i have said what needed to be said and am not afraid to stick up for what s right and wrong i am no sheep i know this comment post will probably be deleted and probably see me banned again but i have other ways i can get this comment out if so,157.5,240.0,28,Not Recommended,"December

80216,2022 casual players beware this game is not for you your gaming session is going to be at least a few hours depending on the other players in your server you may have an unproductive and frustrating few hours pvp is highly predatory and presents a serious impediment to casual new and especially solo players harassment and verbal abuse from other players abound i recommend turning off the voice and chat options for younger gamers the game has a ton of pve content from exploration to incredible world building and quest content you could spend hundreds of hours alone on that portion of the game for many players this a big draw and reminds me of my nights spent on melee island as guybrush threepwood even the pirate villages at night look like the islands of that famed franchise some of the shortcomings of the quest tall tales system could probably be fixed with a few tweaks like more frequent checkpoints and some way to disincentivize other players from targeting questers which brings me to this game s biggest issue pvp new players solo players and pve players are fodder for the pvp crowd if you re a casual player with not much time to invest in a game and you plan to play solo i suggest avoiding this game the game has a bit of an identity crisis that i frankly think puts off both pve and pvp players from the pvp perspective with only 4 5 ships per server it s hard to find other players to pvp when you finally do come across someone they often have no interest in a battle this leads to pvp players attacking anyone they come across regardless of whether there s anything to be gained likewise from the pve perspective constantly having your progress set back by a pvp attack can be frustrating because the world is large and travel between islands time consuming you may lose hours of work most players we encountered as new players were needlessly hostile only a few recognized that we were new and those encounters were very friendly during some gaming sessions we found ourselves in a server with cool chill people who just wanted to go about their business questing and exploring one person asked first before engaging in pvp those were really refreshing encounters but few and far between some people justify their behavior by screaming about how it s a pirate game and pirates were jerks so it s ok if they re jerks too pirates also had scurvy and syphilis so how serious are you about this piracy thing folks,691.1,463.0,48,Not Recommended,"March 1, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Caustic

80222,2023 a while ago i gave a now deleted negative review for this game and for where the game was at i think it was well deserved requiring pvp in a game with so much rich pve content was almost worse for me than just releasing a completely awful game the wasted potential for a pve mode or a split progression system was incredibly frustrating and ultimately led to me abandoning the game there are plenty of games with pve modes and pvp modes that work do well and please both sides but they devs continued to try and force pvp only down our throats this was a few years ago and at the time the devs said they weren t looking at a pve mode and that it was against the spirit of the game fast forward to this week and safer seas their version of a pve mode was added to the game i m so glad the devs learned from their mistakes because this game is incredible now that the pvp mode is disabled safer seas certainly isn t perfect it needs more features like higher progression levels for factions etc i just want to experience all the content the game has to offer without the toxic pvp aspect i don t even really care about the 30 rewards the fact that i can t fully level up the factions or participate in events that don t require pvp is more of a bummer for me there are also features like captaincy that were taken out of safer seas that have no business being taken out but the fact that the devs listened to the playerbase at all and added a pve mode is such a positive sign to me that i actually have hope for this game to get even better which i couldn t say a few years ago so here s to hoping that the devs continue to learn grow and provide a fantastic experience for those who want pve pvp or both,116.9,58.0,4,Recommended,"December 11, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,TRP,False

80228,2023 sea of thieves is a very entertaining game but has some downsides that can make it rather unappealing to some people i will break it down in a pros cons list pros great with friends total of 4 crew members on the largest ship including yourself plenty to do quests treasure maps for that looty booty fishing pve plundering pve is actually rather entertaining and rewarding large map plenty of islands outposts secrets to find and explore safer seas so you could go into a private session to do tall tales or get to know the game mechanics guilds allows 24 players to join work together to gain additional rewards also allows ship sharing a few different ships for different crew sizes variety of tools weapons ammo types to utilise customisation options for both the ship player pets dogs cats foxes parrots monkeys plus if you can afford to spare the ancient coins outfits for the pets sea shanties need i say more cons pvp in all areas i ve been attacked at sea spawn camped on my own boat ambushed at an outpost where i was trying to sell my haul of loot tricked with the alliance system there is no passive zones or passive mode upon spawn with a x amount of time before you start taking damage again which is rather annoying sea of thieves has a rather crappy community some people will avoid you or be nice to you but most will try to kill you just for sport the slim chance of loot i ve spent 30mins in a session just fishing chilling winding down after a busy day people have literally killed me for fish fish for crying out loud which can barely get you 1k gold useless reporting system can t report racism griefing or any type of harassment without a video of it happening most reports without that get ignored less enjoyable by your lonesome it s not terrible it s just better with friends safer seas private sessions have a slight waiting time to them aren t as rewarding as normal sessions gold gains are reduced significantly no emissaries level gains are capped guilds are a thing but being able to set sail with multiple crewed ships on the same server from one guild from my knowledge hasn t been implemented if you have more than 3 friends that you want to play sea of thieves with in the same server be prepared to do 20mins of server hopping requires a xbox microsoft account conclusion generally i do believe this game is pretty awesome as for 6 months i continuously sank time into it but while communities can often make games in the case of sea of thieves it can also break them i ve played solo with friends i ve joined random people via the official discord met some really cool people on the high seas however these cool people are far few between rare makes it more rewarding for people to be douches towards each other that for me is quite annoying because i often play to chill out not compete with others for loot that i ve already worked hard for so all in all if you re reading this review i d say this game is worth buying but only if you ve got friends to play with whilst it s on a 33 discount or more,386.7,99.0,0,Recommended,"July 5, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,The Logman,False

80230,2021 my thoughts after 700 hours of hoping to see improvements not cpt jack sparrow btw the review isn t about whether it was worth my money but for other people to contemplate whether it s worth theirs you should be so lucky that someone would dedicate the time to experience a game thoroughly and then write about it tl dr following a fairly harsh review i would still recommend to players looking for a few weeks worth of fun with friends you might even enjoy it for longer don t expect a long lasting experience even considering my hours played sea of thieves is entirely session based meaning quest progression and resources you gathered won t follow you into your next session aside from a couple dozen tall tales story driven quests with checkpoints and it s the reason this game will likely never get any in depth content every quest or world event has to be designed to fit within a reasonable period of time otherwise playing 1 2 hour sessions would be a waste this means much of the game s content is rather shallow and inevitably repetitive think generic fetching and kill x amount of mobs type of quests these are pretty much the only quests you get in sea of thieves the boss fights are all damage sponges the quests are simple and repetitive and you spend half your time sailing from a to b with nothing to do but keep the steering wheel straight ultimately everything you do feels like an unengaging grind despite being designed for somewhat brief gameplay sessions and what does this all serve you earn gold and you unlock commendations gold that you can only spend on cosmetics with commendations sometimes unlocking more cosmetics to purchase nothing you can do will alter your gameplay in any meaningful way which is intended to balance a game where pvp is always present and unconstrained and largely arbitrary players will try to sink you with hardly any motive you spend your time working towards whatever cosmetics you think looks nice only to find that the best ones are likely available exclusively in the in game store completely undermining the core incentive to even play the game in the first place to further emphasize sea of thieves follows the games as a service gaas model which typically would mean financing the game in the long term with cosmetics exclusive items boosters monthly subscriptions dlc expansions etc but sea of thieves has none of those things mostly because it can t aside from cosmetics which again are undermined by also being the only form of progression in the game this issue stems from the developers not creating any disincentives for pvp or giving players the tools to dissuade disengage bargain or anything it s so often kill or flee on sight where are the player interactions that this game s entire premise is built upon if you could unlock new gear level up or upgrade your ship newer players would never be able to compete with veterans because you cannot escape pvp however much you try and no pve only servers would just kill the game sea of thieves just isn t designed to be your main primary game that you can play for years despite adopting the gaas model fortunately there s many things the developers could do to fix that i just don t know if they have the budget resources for it though a pirates of the caribbean crossover is not one of those things for new players the game provides a fun and novel experience especially with friends for like a couple of weeks once the veneer of novelty wears off you won t find any longevity or end game content to keep you interested so keep that in mind,788.7,225.0,14,Not Recommended,"August 28, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Dauceer

80238,tl dr sea of thieves lets you go on a unique adventure each time you play it its random nature and well established game systems make the game offer a delightful experience in sea of thieves it is never certain what you will encounter in a play session the quests set your first intent in the game and can influence the experience you will have throughout a few hours but it is never exact the chaotic human factor can result in you being in scenarios you couldn t even imagine sea of thieves is a well executed unique game considering the possibilities it provides for each player and their play sessions the game s main progression is through various factions although each of these factions prioritizes acquiring treasure and delivering it safely each faction focuses on a few quest types these quests influence you to search and dig up for treasure transfer commodities fight skeletons or even ghost ships and get rewarded for each of them sea of thieves is a game that rewards you handsomely for the effort you put into the game apart from the factions there are world events in the game these events are always visible to other people on your server as well so they can become pretty competitive random world events consist of ghost ship battles on foot boss fights raids that have special conditions and waves of enemies and even more during my time in the game i liked the competitive aspect of the world events and they added greatly to my experience when it comes to combat the game has a great variety of tools too there are a total of four unique weapons for combat on foot and then you have the sea combat where things get even more complicated during fights with other ships you can utilize a great number of cannonball types for your cannons and you can even board your enemies ship to lower their anchor or defeat them onboard i haven t put many hours into fighting other pirates on the seas but i can assure you that sea of thieves is a game that is easy to get into but pretty hard to master the best thing about the game is that you sail on the seas with a few more other crews which adds to the overall experience you never know what kind of crew you would encounter during your play sessions this chaotic nature of the game is what makes it so replayable and fun to play in sea of thieves each play session is unique due to the game s online aspect in short sea of thieves gives you the feeling that you go on an adventure a true one its chaotic nature and simple but varying systems render the game a great deal of fun to play i would suggest sea of thieves to everyone no matter what your age or game preferences are i believe you can enjoy this game,95.8,26.0,1,Recommended,February 12,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Ata,False

80258,2023 this is probably the best pirate game ever made but i cannot recommend for anyone who dislikes forced multiplayer you will have to interact with other players and 90 of them will try their hardest to you over this is by design and isn t necessarily a bad thing if that s the kind of stuff you re into no honor among thieves i suppose safer seas was recently introduced but it does more harm than good for new players it ll be a trap that wastes your time for players who don t want to deal with randoms you lose access to a significant portion of midgame progression and some more recently added features like guilds and captained ships it would ve been much nicer to have safer seas be just a gold penalty and significantly more ai ship spawns as it stands now it seems more like a half hearted attempt to appeal to an unhappy part of the playerbase without actually understanding what they want and why they want it once i sailed the high seas with a couple friends we d encountered other players many times before usually resulting in an instant fight to the death which already irked me given that we ve lost significant amounts of time earned loot many times on occasion we would meet friendly or neutral pirates who were doing their own thing passing by uneventfully this time we came across a neutral crew who shared a bit of conversation with us things were casual until they noticed we flew a pride flag i m sure i don t have to elaborate on what happened after safer seas should be for players that don t want to have a 50 50 chance of losing an hours worth of loot because someone decided they were going to level reaper players that want to play the only real pirate game around without being randomly by other people these people don t hate ship combat or whatever they hate random people deciding their fun is over without having a say in the matter all of that being said sea of thieves is pretty fun playing with a few friends all getting on a ship and sailing around looting big vaults and digging up treasure going on a fun little adventure if you think you can deal with random pirate crews you up after a long labour intensive quest somtimes then i absolutely encourage giving this game a shot,77.7,32.0,3,Recommended,"December 7, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Boksman,False
80259,2023 i have around 1000 hours on xbox live prior to cancelling my subscription and getting this game on steam so here s my review sea of thieves offers a visually stunning game play experience with its beautiful and vibrant world the game s picturesque environments from sun drenched beaches to treacherous storms at sea provide a visually immersive and captivating setting additionally sea of thieves excels in providing engaging quests and dynamic events that keep players on their toes whether it s embarking on treasure hunts fending off skeletons or unraveling intriguing mysteries the game offers a variety of activities that can be truly enjoyable however one aspect where sea of thieves falters is in its pvp model while the game allows for player versus player encounters these interactions often devolve into mindless attempts to board ships rather than engaging in strategic ship battles this lack of depth in the pvp mechanics can lead to repetitive and less satisfying gameplay experiences it would benefit from more nuanced combat mechanics and a greater emphasis on tactical decision making during ship to ship encounters sea of thieves suffers from a glaring lack of progression the game fails to provide a satisfying sense of growth or accomplishment for players without a robust progression system there is little incentive to continue playing and investing time in the game the absence of meaningful rewards for completing quests or taking part in activities diminishes the overall motivation to explore and engage with the world another major letdown is the in game currency which is rendered essentially worthless the accumulation of gold in sea of thieves serves little purpose beyond cosmetic purchases and even those options are limited in variety the lack of meaningful economic game play mechanics leaves players feeling unfulfilled and underwhelmed as their efforts to amass wealth in the game hold little value or significance in conclusion sea of thieves features beautiful game play engaging quests and dynamic events that make for an immersive pirate adventure however improvements are needed in its pvp model to move beyond mindless ship boarding and focus on more strategic ship battles additionally enhancing the progression system and providing more valuable uses for in game currency would further enrich the game play experience and provide players with a greater sense of accomplishment and purpose,241.1,131.0,10,Not Recommended,"May 23, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Onizuka

80274,2021 sorta fun with friends but it s a real bummer alone when you get chased for 30 minutes by other players or sunk with a ship full of treasure that took you 4 hours to collect there are tons of world events in the game and virtually none of them are worth doing with less than 3 4 players because they all attract attention and 90 of the players on the server sailing with you just want to attack you on sight and grief you there is a whole alliance system to join with other player ships and it is virtually unused the bread and butter of the game requires you to leave your ship to get treasure and solve puzzles riddles and there is nothing stopping another group of players from destroying your ship while you re out playing the game and experiencing content even if they don t kill you you now have no way to transport the treasure you just collected and basically have to off yourself in order to respawn at your ship in a new location less and less i end a game session with a feeling of satisfaction and more and more feeling disappointed angry and with a bad taste in my mouth maybe this game isn t for me but in my opinion this is a relaxing beautiful and well designed game ruined by 12 year old trolls,133.9,243.0,38,Not Recommended,"November 16, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,krhfulcher,False

80285,2020 sea of thieves had a rocky launch with barely any content in 2018 however after the last big updates this is a hidden gem of games first monthly major updates get the community going a lot tons of quests voyages and story based adventures sea of thieves is about as free form of an experience as you can get which is both a blessing and a curse on the one hand you could probably spend close to a dozen hours having fun sailing around without ever realizing there is a proper campaign to follow and that s when i discovered that even though its free roaming gameplay is enjoyable enough and on the other hand you can chase the campaign missions tall tales which includes lots of sailing solving puzzles and fighting since you are sailing a lot the chances that you are going to fight while sailing is very high progression in sea of thieves like its overall structure is pretty loose rather than gaining experience points to level up a character you increase your reputation with five different companies by completing voyages finishing commendations similar to achievements or turning in specific items almost everything you unlock is purely cosmetic if you ve got a good group of two or three friends to play with it s hard to find a game as entertaining as this one final verdict 7 5 10,127.5,26.0,1,Recommended,"June 14, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Ajvar The Boneless

80286,by far one of the most amazing n best games i ve experienced and played even to this day sadly as a solo player it does get boring rather quick this game is incredibly nice and fun with the friends though for sure something i do honestly miss but overall by far best ocean mechanics in any game amazing customization ships and cosmetics for both ship and your character as well as weapons lot of stuff to do and achieve unlock work towards etc and this game only keeps improving i personally like the devs as well by far the best and one s who actually listen to their community and why this game is succeeding to this day it is not pay to win like most games and for an ue4 this game surpasses even the most ue5 ones in my opinion of course i am truly not a fan of the massive reward nerf for safer seas and pve based players though in my recent times playing i have hardly experienced any pvp players and tend to be left alone but that s just me even then not everyone is entirely toxic in my experience,189.2,35.0,0,Recommended,January 24,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"2stepsfrömhell

80295,2023 so i put some hours into this game most as a duo some alone some with as a full crew this game is an absolute treat to play with friends if it goes right and nobody decides to ruin it for you or if you are playing with competent friends and decide to ruin it for others did both can confirm it is indeed fun to sink someone after a hard fought battle and also to just chill and do pve for a day that being said the developers are really really stubborn in a bad way they insist that the game is supposed to be this grand adventure where player interaction is king and therefore the pvpve aspect is integral to the experience while the majority of the playerbase which is casual says it isn t there was a pvp mode called arena in the past so all your sweaty pvp needs could be met without ruining some poor dad and sons weekend play session they removed that because the demand was not nearly high enough to warrant the servers instead of drawing the conclusion that that must mean most people simply do not want pvp forced onto them they just removed the mode and forced all the pvpers back in the standard pvpve server so now nobody is happy if you want to just pvp now tough luck if you just want to pve tough luck if you had a tough day this game will not allow you to relax with pve and friends if you want the action loaded pvp this game will not allow that unless you get lucky and find a willing target on the pretty huge map quickly it is in this weird middle ground where really nobody is happy sadly and i am certain this will not change rare has said so so often that they view this as integral and refuse to add pve servers or even just simple level based matchmaking there is an audience for this type of pvpve game but them marketing it as this fun light hearted and make your own story type of game is misleading especially with how winning the battle against your attackers will not even save you entirely they probably had no loot themselves so you got nothing out of this they just respawn with a new ship and try to get to you again as fast as possible while you still have all your hard earned loot to lose i really love most aspects of this game but the fact that it forces it s pvp system where spawn camping is the actual meta strategy to sink enemies onto every player every time you play does sour it too much to recommend you can play for hours and lose all your loot to some dude who you really had no chance against since he had three friends with him who all played 1000 hours and you were playing with just one friend who is a casual player little additions for the interested readers the communitymy god the community i have been called slurs and other things many times either for playing too well of playing too bad people will get sooo angry with you for choosing to run from a fight when you have four hours of loot to lose while the attackers have nothing on board to loot people will get angry for chasing them when you have no loot and want theirs this community can be the nicest chillest people ever if you are lucky most of the time though this game just attracts the people who enjoy ruining your day in any way since that is what the game enables with its design the people who want to have a good time with others simply get pushed out over time by all the toxicity and you can see this shift that is taking place where with every season and expansion there is a bunch of new friendly players who quickly die out after one too many bad sinks the pvp experienceto sink an enemy ship you must board it unless you have double the crew or your oponent has close to no supplies they will always be able to simply repair their damage and bail out the water faster than you can put holes into their ship same goes for you so the actual ship to ship combat is honestly secondary to the on ship boarding combat if you are good enough simply putting a single hole into the enemies ship and spawnkilling them over and over while their ship fills up is the best strategy for a quick sink this means spawnkilling an act reviled in other games is necessary to an extent to win a battle in this one also due to this the pvp is obviously heavily favored towards larger crews since even if they miss most of their shots them just killing you once will mean they can put one hole in your ship and every time you respawn you will now have to kill two or more people at the same time to be able to repair rare is seemingly trying to make this better they disabled ally revives on enemy ships some time ago and you can respawn at multiple different locations on your ship to make it harder for people to completely spawncamp you the core issue still persists obviously they only way i can think off to make the ship to ship combat a more important part of sinking someone is to either decrease how effective the bucket is or to increase the rate at which the ships fill up so you have a better chance to actually overwhelm the enemy crew with so many holes they simply cannot keep up with repairs right now unless you have a similar sized or smaller crew in your broadside for a long time who really just doesn t play well it is impossible to sink with purely naval combat all in all the pvp is heavily unbalanced has a high skill ceiling which is obviously a good thing don t misunderstand and is only really fun when fighting a crew of similar size and skill unless you are some sort of or masochist or sadist instead of these cool cinematic cannon firing naval battles it s just boarding attempt after boarding attempt after boarding attempt with some cannon fire sprinkled in matchmaking and servers for solo duo trio and quad crews specifically would solve they crew size and skill imbalance easily but this will never happen with rare i want to give rare some credit where it is due they are trying to make things better they made it so the solo and duo ship masts specifically is harder to break as said they disabled ally revives on enemy ships to make the spawn camping a little better and i am sure they will continue to do their best still with their current philosophy of swearing by this pvpve very open model this game will never be the adventure many people know it could be oh and hit registration is still a huge issue has been for years so do not count on your shots hitting to actually deal damage in a game where that can mean losing hours of progress,289.5,65.0,6,Not Recommended,"April 26, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Fiddledugg,False

80298,2021 i love the scenery the music the quests and the gameplay however this game force you to pvp which make you unable to enjoy those there isnt any mechanic to protect new player baby pirates who cant handle a gun against those kraken hunter legendary pirate etc etc and the community is so toxic they will kill you on sight even you show reluctant to fight back i stopped playing previously after felt sick of the environment coming back for the interesting gameplay also want to see whats in the update feel like quitting again after being drowned a few times yeah you may say i lack the skill to properly play this game as if pvp is the only element in this game finding treasure solving riddle pff this game has so much potential and it is a shame that the force pvp mechanic draw back alot of new comer you can easily develop a mechanic to protect newbies or players who just want to sail peacefully am fine with getting lesser rewards and make higher reward for dangerous route pvp allowed but such a shame developer dont care about peaceful player like you already made arena mode for those bloodthirsty mofos why dont you also cater those who just want to play peacefully until then wouldnt recommend this unless you love pvp bullying and most importantly you have another 3 friends to play with you solo or duo its a shipwreck simulator for you,112.5,472.0,76,Not Recommended,"December 4, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,菜potato,False

80304,2022 honestly if you are a solo or duo player i wouldn t play until they implement private servers the toxicity of this player base is worse than flint michigan water its sea of thieves not friends comes to mind when i find myself complaining about my misfortune but there really is nothing more frustrating than wasting hours of my limited time weekly to be sank for no logical reason if i ve no protection against toxic players who wish nothing more than to see my sloop at the bottom of the ocean regardless of loot then its not sea of thieves and it most certainly isn t sea of friends so its kinda just a sea of ssholes or sea of brain dead 5 year olds wanna try playing with randoms to increase your chances of not having your game session ruined and time wasted sorry we only got sea of xbox kiddies breathing and screeching down their mics incessantly until you cant take it anymore i love the game and i love the mechanics and at it s core i personally consider it a very good game if you ve got 3 other friends to play with so you can run a galleon then you wont have any problem enjoying it as a solo or duo player though there just isn t enough protection besides being an sshole myself from players who s sole intent is to simply ruin others play sessions rare want me back for season 8 private servers add more npc faction ships to provide a pve threat to certain areas of the map remember pirates of the caribbean online and how parts of the map were at war between spanish british and french navies fighting give us something like that and it validates private servers with no pvp for the love of flamebeard i just want to be left alone by 5 year olds screaming nonsense 2 psychotic girls screeching some whacko who forgot to take his meds athena griefers who won t even wait for you to finish the veil quest thats all thankyouedit so it s been about a month since i posted this review and i wanted to leave a little update to extend my opinions on this game and some of the comments made here to those saying git gud skill issue i m sorry i m not you i guess i simply don t have the time or will to focus on this game the same way that you do i have other priorities i enjoy the pve elements and the threats that pve provides is it easy yes thats why i asked for more pve threats in my initial review much of the comments to this review and rightfully pointed out by others thankyou are plain examples of the ignorance and toxicity so prevalent in the player base i believe this game can be pve and pvp i suppose i would propose a open play private group option when starting your journey at game launch similar to elite dangerous allowing those who feel pvp capable or ready for some higher risk to play freely as they would and those who would like to play without other players intervening to do so alone i literally do not see issue with this proposal and from what i ve seen people against this are typically so because it decreases the pool of lesser skilled players for them to easily prey upon using elite as an example the community is pretty stable on this topic and sees little issue with the separation of its player base in such a way as the game provides threats and risks in ways besides pvp i believe sot is at a design issue crossroads that it should have made a decision on long ago pve players are clearly frustrated by the strong push for pvp both from the developers in the form of pvp adventures and world design reapers and other pvp players this is a game that provides great pve elements that very few other games out there are able to hone in on some of these great pve elements are core to the cycle of playing this game digging up treasure sailing a ship freakin sea volcanoes meshing unavoidable pvp encounters with a vibrant and full pve game world with great pve core elements makes enjoying certain core elements rather difficult when the reward is so easily removed all my treasure being sunk after all we play games for the reward the frustration around this issue will persist until rare makes a decision and releases a statement on their intentions with pvp and private servers going forward the community instability and toxicity regarding important topics like this one and the way it treats this issue in game and out of along with the difficulties faced enjoying this games core elements while playing it have devalued this game for me that is why i do not recommend this game edit 2 because this seems to have dropped off the review page for sea of thieves i can only assume the devs or steam probably dont like what i have to say here despite being one of the most helpful reviews for people apparently i just wanted to say thankyou here to everybody who stayed civil in the comment section while also pointing out that it looks like they have no intention to change any of above mentioned issues for season 8 for that reason my review remains unchanged its sad to see a game i enjoyed so much for a handful of great design choices continue to implement multiplayer adventures and events that ruin the enjoyment of said design choices i really do wish i had a single player or private group option and ill stick

80319,2023 this game is fun you get to dig up gold fight skeletons fish it looks nice has good sound design and music has a relaxing game feel that lets even sitting on a boat doing next to nothing not feel boring and you get to have a hook hand however the games pvp is 48 over in 30 seconds 48 takes 15 minutes to resolve and 4 passable but still inferior to most multiplayer pvp experiences no there is no way to turn it off unlike other pvevp games there is a mode coming in december of this year that allows one to be in a private server but many features are removed and it s supposed to be an extended tutorial also there s cannonballs that can prevent your cannons from working cause your anchor to drop or just flood a bunch of your ship along with this is chainshot that has a large hitbox and can break your sails reducing your speed or outright stopping you if all sails are broken most fights are spamming both of these until someone sinks and there s bombs but they only work if no one shoots you before you can carry the thing over there s sword play that feels like your attacks are missing even if they hit and guns two are worse than the blunderbuss because that can insta kill someone if you re close if that sounds like an awful time you can just pass on this game now the game has such a hostile community that most players associate any ship flying the rainbow flag with actual nazis and racist 14 year olds imagine having such an awful community that something as pog as gay rights is seen as a dark omen also you ll be told to get good regardless of performance as will everyone around you including whoever is berating you doing any work to get loot leaves your ship the thing that s more important than your individual life vulnerable to ambushes because you aren t on the damn thing losing your ship has a high chance of rendering any work done in the past however many hours useless to help prevent this one person per crew is unable to play the video game and instead sits on the boat for the entire game looking at an empty ocean for other ships and if they see one everyone has to stop what they re doing and defend the boat spamming the magic balls and chain shot fun due to 0 matchmaking precautions you can be match up with a group of children that just installed nearby a group of day one legends who could 1v4 in their sleep and vice versa no one has fun when this happens there is a designated pvp mode people don t really like it so queue times are long and many people playing don t like pvp and are just there for the cosmetics so even if you find a match it might be against someone who will insta sink themselves to grind xp so they can get hats there s mmr here so at least sometimes you ll get a good fight good being a relative term this game actually has such god awful player vs player everything that people have been begging for a pve mode since launch independent of one another the die hard fans of this game are repulsed by that idea and will be upset upon hearing it like i wanna talk about the other parts but the game is well made in that crossing paths with another ship is inevitable so every activity is mixed with pvp so awful that even the people that like it admit that every game does it better and can only defend it by calling it unique sea of thieves is a passable pirate sandbox with other people being a feature grafted on after launch and for a multiplayer game that sucks big time,516.8,202.0,33,Not Recommended,"October 16, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,MADAM FISH,False

80336,2023 it was outstandingly enjoyable when i bought it in the summer of 2020 when i sailed with friends we usually had a good time sailing anywhere trying different quests and making a nice amount of gold when i sailed alone it was very relaxing and enjoyable to hunt fish or just hangout on my favorite island there were players of every type rude polite quiet new old it was a mixed bag i could handle accept and enjoy anything that was in the game as the seasons changed and new content arrived the tone of the game was changing my friends and i could feel it we had done hundreds of quests fought many ai raided strongholds we did everything we could we began to realize that many of the quest types were too similar go and fetch this item fight these enemies and deal with a skeleton ship every now and then we had overplayed many of the quests new and old and had bored ourselves with the repetition when new content arrived we were all excited and tried many of them the ghost ship fleets flameheart ashen winds any of the adventures again and again they never felt fun or challenging they were just a big time commitment most of the new events we only tried once because we would still feel bored a week after we did it the last thing we all did together was the first pirates life adventure it was at least an hour of gameplay and we left it feeling bored exhausted and annoyed when the adventure was over and we couldn t walk on our ship because we would phase through the floorboards we furiously uninstalled and left months later i felt the itch to play again because it still had a place in my heart there were so many good times had by myself or with friends and i had to give it another chance it was hurtful to see that sea of thieves was walking the same path as rainbow six siege warframe payday 2 and some of my other once beloved games an overabundance of content with varying levels of quality trying its best to keep you playing the game by adding new content i sailed back to my favorite island and took a good look at how things had changed many of the items i wanted to purchase with gold were absurdly expensive yet they were barely a recolor of something i already owned plunder passes filled with interesting items that i wasn t going to spend over a month grinding for the items of the first plunder pass had still not been added to the store despite reading that they would be over a year ago new quests and events that were still in essence the same as events we had when i first played the game in 2020 i knew sea of thieves was lost and that day i lost my love for it when the captaincy update came along i told my old friends and we gathered to take a look and see what the game was still turning into when i found out i couldn t use the word drunk in my ship s name it put a bad taste in all of our mouths we looked through all the ship cosmetics and their requirements and we weren t about to make that much of a commitment to one game that we didn t love anymore we uninstalled once again and now they try not to think about what horrid familiar and expensive shapes this game will take next while they continue to frown grumble and curse what this game has become and how it didn t deliver what exactly what they wanted i reminisce on the wonderful times that this game delivered to me all the fish i caught the outfits i made the islands with beauty i admired the gentle and sweet people i met and the great battles with skeletons or strangers on the sea i once loved every moment of it and it had earned a special place in my games library and my heart i won t forget what this game has given to me especially now that it gives nothing to me now it will continue down the path of content with commitment and i can t dedicate my time to a game that asks for so much of it i may reinstall in the coming years return to my island to reminisce once again help a new friend complete an adventure but my love for this game is gone it sails to new lands,656.9,126.0,9,Not Recommended,"February 7, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Road Kill

80337,2022 tldr mandatory pvp game with terrible pvp mechanics and no concept of risk reward balancing the game needs pvp to work but the current mechanics make for terrible gameplay and overly incentivise toxic behaviour there is plenty of pve content and they keep adding more of it and it s fun but if you spend any decent amount of time doing pve you will have to protect your hoard in pvp which is fine it s a pirate game as the barking seals often remind me but 99 of the time you encounter someone who wants to pick a fight it s some fresh spawn with no loot who will attempt to steal your hard work with no risk to themselves your options are 1 run you can t really get away unless they let you get away but if you spend half an hour on nothing but helm and sails you might wear out their patience or they might literally follow you around the map forever not fun in the slightest 2 fight the ship side of naval combat is actually pretty good except that chainshot is utterly broken against sloops and i have no friends but that s just me the other side of naval combat is crews using overly forgiving respawn mechanics to kamikaze their players onto your ship using throwables dropping your anchor stealing your supplies respawn camping or just swimming across with a gunpowder barrel this boarding can be done from great distances by firing people out of cannons at no risk beyond a small wait to respawn and once they re on your ship pirate on pirate combat sucks it s janky clumsy and the hitreg is awful when i imagine pirates boarding ships and fighting each other a single fat man with a blunderbuss jumping up and down side to side to avoid bullets while shouting racial slurs is not the first thing that comes to mind so let s say you avoid the raining toxic pirates and actually win this hypothetical fight what do you get nothing nothing at all there is no reward other than continued existence and the salty tears of your enemies whenever someone attacks you you re risking everything while they probably risk nothing at all nowhere is safe you cannot avoid other players even if you seem to make friends and form an alliance to give them free loot they get an extra 50 of your sell value for no effort it takes literal seconds for them to sink your ship and take everything because 100 is better than 50 and they will because people in this game have no concept of honour it s a pirate game after all and in my playtime i ve had what i would consider a successful alliance exactly once and this doesn t even include people who are just for the sake of it you could be fishing doing tall tales on a solo sloop with a huge neon sign saying no loot here and you will still get attacked 50 of the time you see another player but it s a pirate game no pirates steal for profit if you do this you re just a terrible person who somehow derives pleasure from other people s pain and you seriously need to see a psychologist edit after safer seas the example doesn t work so well but my point still stands there is no downside to being a toxic in fact it is usually beneficial so instead of tense alliances where crews work together for a short time towards a shared goal and then either part ways or bring out the guns it s always better to just shoot first and ask questions never there is never a reason for teamwork because everything is possible solo if you throw enough respawns at it the only reason to have a ceasefire is to get in a better position to start shooting so what needs to change 1 rewards for killing antagonistic pirates if i spend time defending my loot i should get something out of it otherwise every sail i see on the horizon is just another waste of my time there needs to be some kind of bounty system where if someone else shoots first and i successfully defeat them i get paid it makes absolutely no sense that i have to continually risk my hours of work levelling emissary against people who just spawned and they re the only ones who can get anything out of the encounter 2 imo there needs to be a better parley ceasefire system than the current alliances it shouldn t stop people from shooting each other but in a kind of pirate code way severely disincentivise it maybe tie it into the bounty system from point 1 where if you break parley other pirates get rewards for killing you that way you end up with a risk reward situation where betrayal is still possible but you have to decide if the cost is worth it 3 never going to happen because too many people would cry about it but pirate combat needs an overhaul more punishing respawns to stop the endless suicide missions especially for larger crews less one shot one kill so that shooting first isn t the only viable option when you see another player looking at you blunderbuss when a ship is sunk there should be an immediate server migration otherwise you get angry players hunting you from beyond the grave and you just have to keep killing them over and over for no reward until they finally get lucky and kill you 4 there needs to be a reason for ships to work together whether willingly or with a finger on the trigger the whole time alliances are vestigial because there is never a need for them and 100 50 the game needs pve content that s actually hard enough that you may need more than one ship and no you need 5 people to summon the megalodon doesn t count look up artificial difficulty if you have trouble understanding why 5 there needs to be a way to play the overly grindy tall tales with no pvp at all and possibly throw some hunters call stuff in as well earning gold would be disabled i hate that spotting another player often adds half an hour or more to the repetitive storyline especially when the achievements make you play through it five times for some reason alternatively make them worth my while with actual rewards that might be worth fighting for edited after safer seas update i probably would have preferred other pvm stuff be disabled to keep pvp player counts up but it s definitely better than nothing i want good pvp not this janky torrent of expendable pirates i want tense briefly lived alliances where nobody trusts each other but still has to work together not meaningless loot increases i want to win fights by knowing i out fought my opponent not because my crew was more expendable or because i got the first shot off and things went downhill from there the game supposedly thrives on tension but it also completely removes any reason to ever trust other players all trust does is open you up for betrayal in turn the only meaningful interaction with other players is as obstacles the best way to survive is to run or to murder on sight instead of the ocean of player interaction that should be possible the only tension is that of wondering whether i ll have to run off the map to finally make my pursuers give up which by comparison is just plain boring,581.0,133.0,22,Not Recommended,"April 17, 2022",Sea of

80338,2022 i had 220 hours in sea of thieves with the xbox game pass before buying it outright on steam i think it s great for what it is season 5 brought a lot of small but generally positive improvements to the game which i appreciated more than the disney rollercoaster in that it is on rails which was a pirate s life storage crates save so much time that i now buy one at the start of every session fireworks are great the new commendations are quite fun and i like that the burying treasure mechanic gives you a new way to play the game hiding loot instead of selling it at an outpost the new shanties are pretty good too pros very pretty a fun time with friends commendations can give you little goals for your session which seems to be a more satisfying way of playing then just going after booty once you ve been playing a while you have access to such a range of cosmetics for your pirate and your ship currency is kind of meaningless so you never really lose anything from sinking apart from your time of course cons solo slooping is fine until you run into sweatlords getting sunk by a crew of 2 4 players when you re on your own feels pretty bad pvp quite often consists of another crew dropping your capstan and then chain killing you or attacking you while you are away from your ship selling loot there seem to be fewer friendly interactions with other crews recently than before at the core of it the game is mostly fetch quests you have to make your own fun to enjoy it tips for dealing with sweatlordstm if they don t have voice chat don t trust them don t let other crews on board your ship unless you are sure they are friendly gunpowder is probably more likely to sink you than anyone else so in summary i recommend it play it with friends don t be a sweatlordtm practice your broadsides drink grog use your speaking trumpet blunderbusses are lame chunky bois 4 life,428.3,36.0,1,Recommended,"February 10, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Hrolfr Fylkir,False

80345,2022 sea of thieves is a bad game i know that may seem perhaps dishonest coming from someone with 257 hours on the game however i can assure you that it is not sea of thieves certainly has its moments and it can be fun completing quests and sinking ships although i acknowledge this fact the majority of a player s time in sea of thieves will be spent either gathering resources sailing which gets really boring after a while lost on some quest or in combat although the first three tasks are clearly either boring or annoying the fourth task combat surely should make up for it right ship combat is pretty fun if you have friends who know what they are doing if you have incompetent friends you will have a bad time against sweaty players if you do not have anyone to play with you can play solo but it sucks to play against multiple players solo unless you are extremely experienced with a competent crew ship combat can be fun if your opponent wants to fight you sidenote actual gun and sword combat in this game sucks due to sweats server lag the distance that ships usually are from each other spawn camping and hitreg which is very bad in this game at the end of my last part about combat i stated ship combat can be fun if your opponent wants to fight you players in this game tend to run from combat very frequently and personally i can t blame them sinking in this game reset all of resources on your ship such as food wood and cannonballs which take time to regain the game practically incentivizes you to run away which isn t fun for either player overall sea of thieves can be fun under the right circumstances but because of the way the game incentivizes running from combat and the tedious actions that the player must take to be effective the game is not fun also when i first tried to play the game on a laptop the load times could take up to 30min to load into a server and half the time i would get kicked for being afk before i even loaded in,278.4,40.0,5,Not Recommended,"November 18, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"2002 Toyota Camry

80349,2021 i will continue to play this game with friends and i will continue to cautiously recommend it to other people i really do enjoy the world the story and the way things generally handle and play out in sea of thieves amassing hoards of gold and doubloons and chests and gems and everything in between is great and satisfying but the one extremely glaring side of the game that i m having a really hard time getting over recently is the pvp there s nothing that feels good about the pvp here if you re a person who doesn t want to delve into how fight other players as efficient as possible you pretty much just throw things at other people and hope they land and you end up on top swords have a 3 hit combo that only continues if you re hitting a player or a pve enemy and can get very frustrating very quickly when fighting another player due to the ability to just spin around each other and keep swinging with no apparent movement speed penalty the eye of reach sniper rifle and pistol at least do as advertised but have the drawback of not being able to precisely aim them due to a lack of a proper sight which is fair honestly my biggest gripe comes from the reasoning behind engaging in pvp is it efficient no is it personally fun and satisfying for me not at all why should i want to engage in pvp aside from maybe getting some achievements or commendations in game achievements done pretty much none even the faction that s supposed to be the bad guys has a limited number of scenarios in which you gain reputation for your emissary for sinking other ships the important bits from the wiki reaper s bones emissaries can gain emissary reputation in the following ways picking up any treasure for the first time stolen and reaper s bones treasure will reward higher reputationplacing any treasure on your ship for the first time stolen and reaper s bones treasure will reward higher reputationkilling other emissary player pirates of any company gives reputation up to 3 times within 10 minutes things that do not give emissary grade reputation for reaper s bones emissaries killing non emissary ship piratessinking any trading company emissary or non emissary ships reputation is given for picking up the broken emissary flags instead essentially what this means is while you re flying the reaper s bones emissary flag collecting stolen treasures and putting them on your ship gets you rep and killing other players that are flying any of the emissary flags can also give rep but only 3 times within 10 minutes so hardcore spawn camping is useless beyond a certain point the great thing is since this faction is has its basis in pvp and stealing and such you can see these ships on your map and what emissary grade they are with reaper s bones i ve used this plenty of times before to plan ahead and avoid people that could possibly pose a problem to whatever voyage i m doing the issue with all of this people don t care they won t fly the reaper s bones flag to benefit from killing you and turning in your broken emissary flag they won t care if you even have an emissary flag or even loot for that matter there s a very unfortunate number of people that will roll up on you rail your ship with no text or voice chat offered and move on doesn t matter if you re minding your own business doing a tall tale if you re a new player who is trying to get used to the game or someone trying to teach a new player and introduce them you ll sink all the same and this all hurts i ve had fantastical experiences with people in this game before such as me and a friend meeting some dude and his wife and we ended up doing multiple skull forts in an alliance bantering with each other and chilling for about 2 hours before they decided to hop off i ve help people with tall tales with their own voyages with fighting krakens and megalodons and skeleton lords the cooperation with random people that you can experience is fantastical but it s so harshly undermined by the dozen or so times i ve invested an hour into a long voyage and been completely and utterly shut down despite offering alliances handing over portions of my treasures or even all of my treasures just so i can continue my voyage and finish it out in peace for the reputation and a fraction of the gold i would ve normally gotten one of the things that s really harping on me as of late is trying to introduce my new and inexperienced friends to the might and magic of doing fort of the damned going and getting all the flames of fate working together and being amped up the entire time then when we re a significant portion of the way through the boss railing on him while he chomps down bananas we hear two cannon shots as two of our masts go down by the time we get down to our ship two people are at the top of our ladders with their swords and pistols ready stopping us from getting back on one of my friends and i try and communicate through voice through text and get no response whatsoever after all of us dying to the crew of mutes i try and hop out of the ferry of the damned and back onto our ship to see what they re up to and if they wanna talk this time i immediately get blown away by one of the new siren weapons and multiple of them come to emote on me as i m dead they went a bit further than some of my other experiences with mute pvpers with the bm and emoting but this is not an uncommon experience an immediate stop to your fun and your mood just because other people could the vocal community continues to shoot themselves in the foot insisting to new players that this is sea of thieves not sea of friends or that s just how things go if you can t handle it go play something else seemingly trying to ward them off rare has added and introduced far too much pve content in that of original set of tall tales the pirates of the caribbean tall tales and their whole suite of 3 new types of pve enemies to expect everyone to be happy with getting thrashed by relentless pvpers as much as i wish it was this isn t a perfect world and you don t have those cool epic interactions of uneasy alliances you have people sailing their brand new ship back to the people that sunk them and fighting again and vice versa getting stuck in this loop until either one crew loses the desire to continue fighting for the treasure or the treasure is sold sea of thieves is an amazing game to play and vibe with friends on chilling and shooting the between islands and voyages and there isn t really another game that offers this to my knowledge we like the sailing and lamenting about going into headwind again and getting struck by lightning and flying off the boat we have a hard time wanting to launch the game and take our chances of running into another one of these crews and that s a real bad feeling to have,175.3,73.0,8,Not Recommended,"June 26, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Advanst

80352,i ve played sea of thieves for over 2 000 hours i preordered this game for my xbox and was there on day one i ve seen the highs and the lows and unfortunately it s been mostly lows lately my dedication to this game runs deep but after all these hours i can safely say it s not worth your time anymore if you re looking for a pirate adventure steer clear of sea of thieves this game is a disaster overrun by cheaters exploiters toxic players and a development team that seems to have lost its way here s why 1 exploit city this game is no longer about skill it s about who can abuse exploits the most players use the crud launch to swim faster than any ship and leap onto your boat like dolphins or the funny launch to swim across the entire map in no time then there s dpi glitching where players become practically unhittable in water making every encounter a frustrating mess it s not about being a pirate anymore it s about who can break the game first 2 cheaters still running wild even worse some cheaters are still slipping past rare s weak anti cheat teleportation invisibility esp and aimbots were rampant for a long time while they re cracking down on some of this the damage is already done you ll still run into these cheaters frequently enough to ruin your day the anti cheat is almost nonexistent and those who exploit the game seem to be the real winners 3 toxic players and racism the sea of thieves community is as toxic as it gets voice chat is full of racial slurs homophobic comments and just plain nastiness report them all you want nothing changes it s like the devs have given up on moderating their player base leaving decent players to endure a never ending stream of abuse the devs seem to be more concerned with selling cosmetics than addressing the garbage fire that is their community 4 hourglass mode is a total downgrade remember the arena the one mode that actually required skill and was fun for competitive players well it s gone rare replaced it with hourglass and somehow it s worse in every possible way cheaters are everywhere the matchmaking is broken and the mode is far less fun it s a joke compared to what the arena once was and it feels like rare simply gave up on competitive gameplay altogether they ve completely abandoned their core playerbase and now cater to casual players and whales willing to shell out for overpriced cosmetics it feels like the devs have turned their backs on anyone who actually cares about the game s competitive integrity 5 a horrible experience for new players new players beware you re not just jumping into a pirate adventure you re jumping into a feeding frenzy where you re the prey between the glitch abusing veterans actual cheaters and toxic griefers there s virtually no chance for a fair or enjoyable experience the game doesn t explain itself well and you ll spend most of your time getting obliterated while trying to figure out what you re supposed to be doing 6 all about the money instead of addressing the rampant cheating and exploit issues rare s priority is cramming more and more cosmetics into the pirate emporium it s obvious they care more about milking their player base than providing a stable enjoyable gaming experience why fix the broken core gameplay when you can sell a 25 ship skin right final thoughts sea of thieves had the potential to be the best pirate game out there but now it s just a frustrating mess exploits cheaters toxic players and a development team more focused on cash grabs than fixing core problems have dragged this game down to the depths avoid it unless you enjoy pain,177.3,19.0,2,Not Recommended,September 14,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Sown

80356,2021 currently the best pirate game on the market sea of thieves managed to scratch that itch i ve had for a while i was looking for a game that allowed me to relax after work but still engage me enough to get my adrenaline pumping i truly understood that i am a 30 year old who is jumping in a game mostly populated by people younger than myself the guy i play with a 13 y o kid from america i dubbed battlesquirrel for good reason screechy high on energy has the focus and memory of a squirrel i freaking love it sea of thieves has an edge though not a lot of players will understand or find confusing its you and your crew versus 4 other boats versus the world most players won t bother you while you do quest a few of them will attack anything that moves there is no game mode where this isn t the case you will always play on servers that will host players that are out to get you that is literally what you sign up for and if you play smart you can outplay them you can also take high risks to earn high rewards but again people are out to get you always meaning yes you can play for 5 hours get killed and lose everything you worked hard for for 5 hours if you can t stand that type of thrill knowing you can lose it all this game won t be for you if you like fishing killing skeletons and beating megalodons without players trying to sink you this game won t be for you so what keeps you motivated the game doesn t have loot in the sense of hundreds of weapons everything evolves around skins that show what you have done and indirectly how good you are the damage from all weapons are the same as that of another player this game is 100 skill if you need lineair progression to feel motivated this game will bore the hell out of you everything you do is to get skins what you need to realize is you play this game shocking to have fun no two runs will feel the same and yes there are leaderboards that reset periodically yet the ultimate goal to become a pirate legend it s just skins and a faction that combines the regular quests into a mix that is it you play for fun and get rewarded with skins you will start to recognize on others in some regard you finished the true tutorial once you hit legend equally after release this game was very bare bones right now season 1 going into season 2 the game feels very fleshed out three factions that focus on world events similar to a profession a risky pvp faction that literally marks you on the map for everyone to see find or flee from and a couple of other factions the biggest selling point is that there won t be a single encounter with players that feels the same and believe it or not the game is actually balanced quite well knowing your strengths and accepting your weaknesses yes a 4 player 8 cannon galleon can be beaten by a 2 player sloop with 2 cannons but if you go up against similarly skilled players the galleon will be stronger in many situations managing to sink one in your tiny maneuverable little sloop very very memorable right now the game knows 2 game modes adventure and arena arena are shorter fights with up to 4 other boats in which you fight other crews for points the goal being to hit other boats for points sink them to make them lose points deliver a chest to a central dropping zone to get a large chunk of points the goal being the boat with the most points when the timer ends it truly teaches you to fight and sink other ships fast adventure is the main gamemode the game is all about you get access to the entire worldmap and you share this world with currently 4 other boats everyone doing their own thing some fight skeleton ships some fight forts some are getting chased my giant megalodon sharks some are out to hunt other players battlesquirl and i are the latter we actively look for fights but we honor the code to leave beginners alone when we notice they are struggling to defend themselves this gamemode allows for the most interaction and rarely feels repetitive playing for 5 8 hours in a row without sinking once having sunk 10 other ships it s great until you meet that one pro boat that server hop until they find a server with players like yourself and go straight for you sink you and sell the loot you worked hard for for hours by sinking others karmaso what are the downsides really to start with this game can be played solo but i wouldn t recommend it completely possible but the game isn t designed for that type of playstyle you earn less money and can t sell as fast you are both the captain cannoneer and repairman and you cannot do all at once against any decent crew you won t stand a chance but it s not impossible another thing to remember is this game s adventure mode doesn t allow for short sessions i d say you need at least 3 hours of playtime to get a decent session if you have a friend that wants to join you mid game that is troublesome because the loot on your boat isn t saved it resets when you die it resets when you log out if you need to switch boats you basically reset your progress if you have a friend that leaves mid adventure you cannot downgrade ships without losing your progress you only keep the money you earned by selling your loot another point is a skill gap you will notice once you start getting good there are players that literally join and leave servers systematically until they find a server that hosts what they want to do this cherry picking playstyle can be and will feel very unfair generally really good players that spawn go in a straight line towards you sink you do steal and or finish the event you started sell it and switch to another server server hoppers are a real thing and even though i understand their arguments it s an unfair pain in the pirate cave major events like fort of the damned need a long time to prepare you have this fun but very long fight only to find out a server hopper waited on the edge for 30 minutes doing nothing but wait until you finished it to sink you sell your loot and jump to the next server doing the same there currently is no penalty for this join and leave behavior in the game it makes your own triumphs feel hollow when you are literally wasting your time doing the work for others who don t even bother to invest some time into a server i don t mind losing to good players that have been lurking our sea s for 2 hours i do mind if they only pick your server because of the event you are doing it s sea of thieves not sea of teleporting universe hoppers who steal baseline get this game if you want to play pirate with lots of random events memorable runs and a very high replayability don t get this game if you need to feel rewarded for every action you make it s a true game not an addiction machine made to keep you

80358,2020 what can i say other than that this game blew my expectations out of the water get it good sea of thieves is by far the most fun i ve had playing a video game since my early days of halo 3 world of warcraft cod4 and other classics this game takes multiplayer to another level by seamlessly combining both story and procedurally based quests with high intensity high stakes pve and pvp battles often both happening at once many other multiplayer games try to make online play feel like it s a living breathing world inhabited by the players but no other games in my opinion even comes close to the feeling that you get in sot combat in all areas feels great with a high skill cap and relatively straightforward mechanics players are highly incentivized to get good every single time i ve died had my ship sank or lost all my loot has been my fault the other player was better no questions asked you can pull off some sick in this game if you re a skilled player and the game encourages you to do it with completely overpowered gunpowder barrels and even stronger stronghold gunpowder barrels a single player acting alone can take down an entire galleon of 4 other players on it if they re experienced enough with a deep understanding of the mechanics a well thought through plan and bit of pirate luck any player can become a terror of the seas let s talk bugs there aren t many it seems that the development team is actively looking to stomp anything that would cause immersion break and they re damn good at it there are the occasional issues that slip through the beta tests and into the live server in the most recent patch there seems to have been an issue introduced that when a ship collides with a landmass and then gets pushed off of the landmass the ship still things it s in contact with something this causes the ship to moan and creak like it s rubbing up against rocks and sounds quite horrible but causes no damage to the ship i also think it slows you down until the effect wears off but that is not confirmed however even this issue is not that big of a deal it was surprising the first couple times and then i got used to it and learned to stop running into things unless i m trying to run into something in which case it s a tactical pirate maneuver the artistic direction in this game is phenomenal hands down i cannot even begin to describe how absolutely stunning some of the views in sea of thieves are sailing across a pristine ocean that glows with the most beautiful blue while the sun sets and the sky is and explosion of orange surrounded by a transition to a perfect blue sky and fluffy white clouds is just another day in sot the atmosphere of this game is a magnificent combination of hyper stylized graphics and incredible sound design which makes for an almost unbelievable at times gaming experience you won t soon forget i m so in love with the art in this game i ve spent almost 50 on aesthetics alone and i ve only been playing it for 28 hours but that brings me on to my last point the price point if you saw 50 and felt the trauma of old archeage coming to haunt you fear not this game only has cosmetic options for sale on the cash shop not only that most items will cost you around 5 the more high end items will set you back about 40 but that is money well spent in my opinion as a general rule of thumb i do not spend more money on games than the price of the game itself i am not someone who buys cosmetics or toys because it is just not worth it to me this game is completely different and you better believe i bought an entire ship overhaul with the collectors edition items and i did it happily these developers have 100 earned my money and i will gladly continue to support this game financially as long as i m enjoying it sea of thieves is a 10 10 for me and i highly recommend you try it,98.7,40.0,4,Recommended,"June 18, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"A Homie

80386,2022 i really want to like this game but i can t it can probably be a good game for players who like pvp if in the right company but it s not a game for solo pve players like me like i wrote in my old review i wish there were dedicated pve servers or the possibility to play in offline mode i mean the content is there they don t need to add pve content they just need to make the game have seperate servers for pve and pvp some pve players most i think just want to do thier pve stuff without getting killed by other players all the time especially since there s people who will spawn camp you for hours 4 against 1 then for pvp players what fun is there to bully someone who just fish and don t even try to fight back if you want pvp action you surely would enjoy playing against others who want the same so in conclusion i think everyone would benefit from having seperate pve and pvp servers or at least an option to turn on pve mode which let you play on pve server even tho pvp remain default old review 5 7 h there really should be dedicated pve servers some of us just want to enjoy the pve aspect without getting killed over and over by pvpers also the game feels sooooo slow and unrewarding sadly edit so i gave it another try and it seems that the player base is quite toxic as well not everyone but most people on pc at least from my experience most people attack everyone on sight regardless if you re just fishing or talking to an npc even a full crew on the biggest ship attacks a solo player on the smallest ship and spawn camp them this game can maybe be good for playing with friends if you enjoy pvp but sadly not respectful towards casual pve ers,96.5,208.0,41,Not Recommended,"July 19, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Vireosa,False
80387,2023 i used to love this game i reached 75 with all the major traders and reached rank 48 in reapers so ill go ahead and give my thoughts on this game all major positives can easily be found in other reviews so ill focus on what makes this game unbearable to play 1 pvp sadly the skill ceiling for sot is so high that all new players will grow to hate online interactions i ve sank my fair share of ships and rightfully got away with it unfortunately i haven t seen a new player for almost 3 months all pvp interactions will be against sweaty players with great aim 2 cheats this game doesn t seem to have an anticheat most players do not use god mode or speed hacks its mostly esp and aimbot or autofire scripts 3 time investment it takes around an hour to turn any kind loot into gold i enjoy this kind of time investment that being said its hard to enjoy the game when 45 min of progress is immediately erased by a streamer who is server hopping for content speaking from experience on this one 4 the community if you sink git good trash if you sink them you are a hacker hit reg issues 5 lack of punishment for toxic behavior i ve been called every slur in the book by a 14 year old who probably doesn t even know what a slur is while i m not offended or bothered by it i don t think its appropriate for most kids to be around reporting a player in sea of thieves requires you to sign up on sot website and submit video proof to get someone reprimanded i don t have the patience for that nor should i be responsible for moderating other players update 7 23 2023 i m no longer playing sea of thieves due to the lack of punishment for toxic activity on 7 09 2023 i was harassed by a few players so i went ahead and filled out a report in addition i let sea of thieves moderation know that if nothing was done i would add the information in the report to my review after a day or so of harassment i learned that the aforementioned user was only banned for a few days so here s the video of my encounter with him part 1 youtube video sea of thieves report part 1 views 63 my sea of thieves experience on 7 9 2023 part 2 youtube video sea of thieves report part 2 views 48 my sea of thieves experience part 2 6 game modesyou really only have 1 option pvpvei believe it takes anywhere between 3 and 5 positive interactions to offset 1 negative experience this game is probably 2 positives for every 1 negative exceptions can be found for almost all of the things listed above but honestly why listen to the exceptions,280.1,33.0,2,Not Recommended,"April 1, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,pwill1998,False

80395,2022 as someone that really really enjoys the feeling of sailing through this vast open world scavenging and learning about the stories it has to offer i just can t in good conscience recommend this game to anyone yes it came out on a deplorable state but even after all these years the game still keeps a major flaw that nullifies every single enjoyment you can get out of the game the pvpve system there s quite a wide gap between the idea of you can get into conflict at any moment and the way it s executed through gameplay there s more to gain from being an and assaulting a ship than not doing it and that s the problem the game has a plethora of pve content and stories that involve moving pretty much across the whole map so the chances of finding at least one player are pretty high now do you think they will just let you be or will they try to sink you simply cause they can 9 out of 10 times it will be the later the enemy ship most likely doesn t care that you don t have anything even if there s no point in killing you they will do it simply cause there s nothing telling them they can t do it the developer s vision of this game actively lets everyone and anyone engage in combat even if one of the parties doesn t agree or doesn t want to ever engage and lemme tell you absolutely do not come to this game expecting either a fun pvp experience or a rewarding pve experience both of them suck fighting and shooting is not satisfying in a any way and pve gets ruined the moment someone wants to fight you until the edge of the map so where does it leave the playerbase the majority doing pvp are straight up looking to ruin everyone else s fun and the people doing pve are new beginners trying the game out or getting the hang of it by doing whatever pve mission they can and hoping someone doesn t gank them for no reason but this is a pirate s game pirate s are supposed to fight and steal some people say this is also a blatant stupidity based on media over the decades portraying pirates as nothing more than heartless thieves pirates had a code alliances and rarely fought each other but hey if a few movies say they re always bad i guess it must be true until the day sea of thieves gets a toggle for pvp or pve servers this is not an enjoyable experience for anyone except streamers looking to get reaction videos nothing more,81.4,58.0,4,Not Recommended,"March 31, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Mizu

80396,2020 if you are looking for all of you work that you put into something and worked for to just be thrown away by some people who just want to ruin your day then this game is for you but if you are a player who enjoys fighting ai ships gigant megalodons dangerous krakens and just want to enjoy a nice well build world with an amazing scenery and some of the best water textures you will see in games at the time while hunting for treasure and having over all a great time well then i am sorry because the first thing talked about in this review is what you will get because the main part of the commuity in this game doesn t care about if you have anything worth taking they will just chase you down and spawn kill you unitll you uninstall this game there will also most likely never be a pve server because the devs are listening to the players who play the game the most and those would be the toxic player hunters who will call you the n word and a b ch untill you no loger play the game and if anyone ever tells you that a pve server would ruin the game because then people would only play on those servers doesn t that just prove the point and if someone tells you that people would get bored of only doing pve then those people have cleary never played any singleplayer game or a an open world exploring game,881.8,153.0,27,Not Recommended,"September 3, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Tschudaun,False

80406,2020 sea of thieves is a game with an overwhelmingly large amount of potential but it doesn t meet what it s shooting for sea of thieves is a genuinely fun game it s easily one of my favorite games of all time but that doesn t mean it s a perfect game and that i can ignore serious issues that have hindered and will continue to hinder my experience sea of thieves suffers from a slew of half baked balance issues game breaking bugs and honestly underwhelming rewards but before i get into the meat as to why i can t recommend this game i must briefly list the goods about this game as there are plenty of them to list here that can make the game worthwhile pros a genuinely amazing game with friends arguably one of the best a flat gear state so new players are equally as equipped as experienced players every form of currency is for cosmetic items only and again they have no effect on gameplay plenty of events that are always fun to do many commendations to complete alongside very fun tall tales combat is incredibly fun and has a high skill ceiling ship combat is one of the most refreshing combat styles i ve had in a game hoarding and selling loot never gets old monthly updates that actually add a good bit of content every update it runs well on a machine as old as mine and is insanely beautiful now that the positives of the game are out of the way i must do my fair part and acknowledge that this game does have big issues that can sour the experience for people which for me has happened time and time again if you can manage to stomach these aspects of the game you may actually come to love sea of thieves as much as i do cons the game has many game breaking bugs that have quite literally broken events such as clipping in skull forts or megs despawning when attacking or flying over my ship the games community is overall pretty toxic and is often overlooked in favor of it being a pirate game which is a poor excuse for bad behaviour new players will have a very hard time learning this game without a guide and will have an even harder time if players focus them due to their new nature the game has incredibly bad hit reg at times sometimes perfectly placed shots won t hit and awful misses will be a hit when you sink an enemy boat they will spawn only a few islands away at best and can indefinitely pursue you with no loss to themselves which is quite miserable the cross platform play is nice if you have friends that play on console but are unfair to console players as pc players have an incredibly large advantage the in game default settings are terrible and the graphics options are lacking and terrible pirate legend is not at all worth getting and athenas is arguably the worst emissary in the game a terrible reward for hitting tier 50 on 3 different merchant factions you will earn so much gold and have absolutely nothing to spend it on which sucks rare has an issue with addressing bugs in this game as i ve experienced bugs that have been reported on the forums over 2 years ago the game has an issue with tabbing out and it takes a year to tab in and out of the game the pirate code in the tavern teaches new players an unrealistic mindset to have in a game about piracy and should be removed the games price tag is quite high the game rarely goes on sale while having predatory microtransactions that are quite expensive yes you don t need to buy them but when they take content that was going to be given to pirate legends like pets and make them micros it s an issue unless you have a premade team the game can be pretty unfun solo slooping takes a lot of effort and experience and playing with randoms makes an uncoordinated experience cosmetic sets are split apart and time gated so for collectors such as myself it can be an issue when you own part of a set while the other part is locked away forever requires an xbox account this is minor honestly just a nit pick the sloop is a hard boat to fight as it has almost every advantage of bigger ships except for speed and firepower the boat is near impossible to sink if at least 1 person on the boat is managing the water and holes as you can simply use the bucket xx trick and throw the water through the window the sloop should be changed slightly to make it easier to fight this has since been nerfed the game requires a large amount of time investment if you re going to want to make any progress in a play session and as a college student this really sucks sometimes with all of these issues it s genuinely hard to recommend this game to anyone even though i absolutely love the game i think if you re ever going to purchase this game you should only do so if you have a crew of friends at your side plenty of free time and if it s on sale as of right now rare has some pretty prevalent issues that need to be worked out before it s in a state of being worth buying at 40 usd i will continue to play this game as i do love it very much and i have many friends at my side while i play but as of right now you should hold off from buying it tldr pretty fun game if you have friends and free time but it can be pretty unfair and stressful at times edit rare has since decided to remove the ability to tweak the engine to get above 90 fov in game which is a massive turn off for me now and further reinforces my point on why i can t possibly recommend this game gimping players ability to not get motion sick when playing a game they enjoy purely for balance reasons is insane higher fov does not effect the pvp aspect of the game in any way rare has once again lowered the quality of sea of thieves by introducing nonsensical balance changes to the game that only serve to cater to the console side of their player base,575.6,98.0,7,Not Recommended,"October 14, 2020",Sea

80415,2021 what the devs have stated in their product description is pretty much on point undoubtedly the definitive pirate game on steam they mention unforgettable stories and it rings true to the point that each voyage players embark on is an adventure in and of itself some of the moments my friends and i talk about until this day that s how memorable it is worth knowing that many players have voiced their displeasure regarding pvp while i must admit to the frustrations over being sunk and treasures stolen it also simulates what sailing on treacherous seas feel like and that s what gives this game its identity to offset that players can invite others to a parley many situations where i could have lost all my loot if i hadn t used diplomacy goes to show that such pvp crises can be averted you ll familiarize yourselves with different types of ships and their parts respectively a galleon is the largest has more cannons but the hardest to manage sailing one to its full potential requires good captaining a full complement of capable crew members and constant communication i ve sailed with quite a number of serious players who use nautical terminology mixed with pirate lingo you ll get your chance to learn those through course of your experience sailing with different people the most memorable moment for me was a desperate escape from a galleon and the payback that came after they bombarded us without warning and immediately headed leewards in our direction we struggled to keep the sloop afloat while also trying to outsail them a kraken then appeared out of nowhere stopping the 4 player galleon dead in its tracks karma had hit them and without hesitation we unleashed a barrage of unrelenting retribution at an angle where their cannons could not hit us not only did we take all their treasure but we also killed that kraken whether it s using roguish tactics to double cross newfound allies or forming a fleet hellbent on revenge i m sure many have their own epic tales to tell this should be one of the best co op games of all time,368.3,21.0,0,Recommended,"March 3, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Stalwart87

80429,2021 this game thoroughly demonstrates why i don t like pvp i ll get to that in a minute or two sea of thieves is a pirate simulator full of things to see and do if you can find the time to enjoy them in peace it s a fusion of pvp and pve but there s a fair amount wrong with that which i ll cover later there are 3 types of ships accommodating crews of 1 to 4 players the sloop is a small ship that is slow yet agile and easy to manage this is the best option by far for solo players and supports up to 2 people the brigantine is larger and faster but is much harder to manage not only having more sails than a sloop but also taking longer to adjust anything on board minimum 2 players recommended supports up to 3 finally the galleon is the fastest and most heavily armed ship but turns slowly and needs at least 3 crew members to reach full potential while it supports up to 4 the pve gameplay consists of finding loot via voyages basically quests consisting of delivering cargo digging up chests and killing skeletons lying around in the water or stashed away on islands or looted from special encounters or other players the voyages are fun and enjoyable and the seafaring is artfully simplistic yet satisfying the time it takes to sail between islands can leave you idle for a while especially while sailing against the wind the pvp elements are where the game begins to fall apart the world is open and shared with up to 4 other ships at all times these ships are free to attack and sink you at any time for any reason causing you to effectively lose everything you had on board at the time barring some edge cases this means that at any time you can be attacked and robbed of all the loot you had stashed on board making frequent trips back to the outposts a necessity to minimize losses you are free to fight back of course but that s where the real problems start to come in first sea battles are long and drawn out cannonballs cause holes in the hull which starts to fill the ship with water but at any time a crew member can use a plank of which every ship starts with 15 and more are easily found throughout the world and take a few seconds to patch the hole bailing the water out is even easier and one person can do it as fast or faster than the ship can fill this makes ship to ship combat a game of attrition with overwhelming and sinking the opponent only occuring when they run out of resources or are solo and get knocked off the ship or die this leads many people to skip the ship to ship and go straight to crew to crew mainly in the form of spawncamping spawncamping is far and away the best strategy to sink a ship once you have one person on board and get the upper hand all you have to do is wait for the ship to go under and kill them every time they respawn respawning comes with a hefty lag spike and that combined with the disorientation can get you caught in a death loop the worst part is that this isn t penalized or punished at all it s the only legitimate strategy because you can t actually steal anything from the enemy ship because the respawn timers are too short to load more than 2 or 3 items but far and away the worst part is the toxic people that pvp environments attract there are people who will pursue you across the map for no reason people who will hunt you down over and over for no reason and people who will fix your sinking ship just so they can spawncamp you more none of this is penalized the only punishable offense is using slurs or hate speech in the text voice chat it s called sea of thieves not sea of friends they ll say i say that there s surprisingly little thieving going on it s all murder because of the fusion between pve and pvp it s worse than usual because now trolls can force you to participate in content you dislike as opposed to just being a poor sportsman and actively prevent you from playing the content you do like by chasing you across the map and back for no reason there is no thievery in sea of thieves in my 130 hours i have been stolen from twice robbed once and had non hostile encounters with other crews 4 times every other encounter dozens has gone immediately to a firefight that ended in someone being spawncamped it s not possible to avoid fights either sloops sail fastest against the wind but fastest is infinitesimally faster than the second fastest ship unless you want to get a spot on a galleon with at least 2 other people you re going to get caught or at the very least chased until all your playtime has melted away the toxicity seeps into the forums too the sheer mention of wanting to not experience the pvp content gets you called anything from a noob to a moron to a the community comes up with new ways to mock pve enjoyers every day none of that really matters to me the sheer aura of stress and paranoia alone is enough to turn me off of this game everything else is just another nail in the coffin,130.2,716.0,154,Not

80460,2022 if you like chasing ships for literally hours on end or running away from ships because you are stacked with loot again for countless hours then this is the game for you there is no way to catch a ship once it is out of range unless they make ridiculous mistakes likewise there is no way to stop someone who is chasing you so its mostly a game of who will get bored and give up first usually these sorts of chases last for hours the failure imo is that the ship chasing has nothing to lose even if you sink them they just respawn on the same server with a fresh ship that already has enough supplies for a fight meanwhile the ship with loot running has nothing to gain if they sink the pursuer and everything to lose if they get sunk basically there is no balance of risk vs reward in these situations which are all to common in the game as far as i am concerned until this fundamental imbalance is addressed the game is pretty trash on top of that the game progression mainly centers around purchasing vanity items you can have a pretty sword but it doesn t do any more damage than an ugly one for example which wouldn t be so bad until you see that something as simple as buying a simple sail that is slightly shorter and therefore easier to see around cost over 8 200 000 gold something that would take the sweatiest gamer a couple weeks to accumulate and that s just for one single item if you like to unlock everything it would take multiple lifetimes of several hours a day game play to unlock it all to make it worse after purchasing the game initially they still lock many items behind cash only purchases personally i have no issue with game funded by microtransactions but i will never support microtransactions in a game i already had to pay for either the game is free to play with microtransaction or else you purchase the game and there are no microtransactions i refuse to do both,365.2,58.0,9,Not Recommended,"May 18, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"FцllSїzёd

80463,2023 i played this game a lot with friends a few years ago via game pass but we gave up because of all the sweats who s only goals were to chase you down and kill your fun we were not interested in pvp then and are not now additionally i wanted to play with my young kids but there was zero chance i was going to expose them to the toxic players in the pvp world of this game i am thrilled that rare finally realized there are more players interested in pve and created safer seas for this group of players but to handicap the safer seas so much and call it a tutorial before you play the real game of high seas is silly and pointless pve focused players will never go back to high seas period and its very clear based on the high server demand caused by pve players that they are the future of the game so while i do like the game and i want to play with friends and family it s already clear that the grind that will be required in the nerfed safer seas to earn gold will limit to long term play value so at this time i can t recommend this game to others that are looking for pve if you want pvp then go for it rare i truly hope you will take the limitations away from safer seas there is no good reason not to allow both player types to enjoy your game to its fullest i know there are a lot of other pve players just like me who want to enjoy the full game but just don t want to deal with the toxic a holes in pvp please consider removing the restrictions,91.7,34.0,1,Not Recommended,"December 8, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Noob Magnet,False
80464,2020 sea of thieves is one of the best multiplayer coop experience you can currently get it highly depends of your crew you and up to your 3 friends can join to have your own adventure the beauty of this game is that it does not have any progress in developing your character at first it may seems pretty repetitive and boring there is no way to make your ship stronger or character do more damage this makes every encounter on the seas challenging the only progress that you can make is by knowing the core mechanics better and use them to your advantage by smart managing your ship and using all variety of different cannonballs it is deffinietly possible to sink a 4 person galleon while flying 2 person sloop the only things that you can buy for money are clothes and different skins to your weapons and equipment but you won t gets any benefits by using endgame and rare varieties of this skins you can look whatever you like fitting in many different sets of clothes not losing any stats game had a pretty rough start in 2018 by a lack of content but now rare took a good care of their masterpiece by adding regularly new content and even new core mechanics such as fire rare is one of the most transparent and connected to community companies i ve ever seen they love their game and care about community the updates are well thought and makes changes that make me go back every time the new update is released however this is not game for everyone its mainly for people that have lots of free time to spare quick in and out voyages can become a long hours of traveling thru seas collenting more and more loot just to the point that other crew will decide to attack you and steal all the loot yes this game is pvp only that doesn t necessarily means that everyday you would find someone so desperate to kill you that he will chase you thru all map and eventually get you in confrontation but loosing your hard earned progress just few minutes away from outpost in with u would cash in your loot is a part of game i literally have a thiev word in the title so by setting sail be sure that you will eventually lose many thousands cash by other players it is in my opinion a great test whether you really like this game if you would sail for like a 4 5 hours on duo sloop with your friend just to be downed by a galleon of reapers bones and after a break to chill after this loss you would still want to play and maybe make up what your lost it is definitely a game that i would recommend with all my heart after 1 5 year couple hundred hours and millions in cash stolen from me i am still waiting with a smile on my face to buy this game second time just to have an hour counter i love the aesthetics unique climate developers and every part except double gunning of this masterpiece i you are not sure just buy a 1 dollar trial on xbox game pass with your buddies and give it a shot like i did in march 2019 trust me you won t regret,184.1,17.0,4,Recommended,"June 3, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Krzemień

80471,2022 it s a fun game but it is poorly advertised it is shown to be an adventure style exploratory game however it couldn t be more wrong yes there is an adventure style play to it but you will more so these days run into excessively toxic people sailing the sea of thieves yes it has a strong element of pvp and pve however the mass majority you seem to encounter in game automatically jump to hostile pvp and use racial and sexual slurs berating you if you don t fight them on their terms and a load of other things that make you question the sense of decency of those who play this doesn t speak for everyone however it just feels like you run into those more than anyone else you can report these people but even doing so you need proof and a lot of the time it doesn t feel like it does any good aside from the people who gain immense joy from ruining the fun by being such wonderful examples of humanity it does have a very expansive world with beautiful graphics a rather colorful and wonderful storyline with continued development coming every season there does feel like a limit to it however as if the game does have a point where you ve just done everything so you get kinda bored just sailing around doing the same old same old as you wait for the next big thing but that s the only in game downside,368.3,24.0,3,Not Recommended,"September 15, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Inverted_Destiny TTV

80477,2021 english version below einleitunglieber leser liebe leserin wenn du das hier liest dann spielst du gerade wahrscheinlich mit dem gedanken dir sea of thieves zu kaufen warum du dies tun solltest und warum sea of thieves eines des besten wenn nicht sogar das beste piratengame ist was es momentan auf dem markt gibt willkommen in der sea of thieves da sea of thieves ein recht umfangreiches spiel ist ist es schwer einen guten anfang f r diese review zu finden von daher fang ich mit meiner review da an wo ihr jedes mal anfangt wenn ich in see stechen wollt an einem der au enposten bei au enposten handelt es sich um einen der inseltypen welche in der sea of thieves auf euch warten hier findet ihr auch 3 vertreter der drei hauptallianzen einen vertreter der goldsammler eine vertreterin des seelenordens als auch eine vertreterin des handelsbunds w hrend ihr bei den goldsammlern schatzkarten oder r tsel kauft bei dessen beendigung eine belohnung meist in form einer kiste voll gold auf euch wartet k nnt ihr bei dem seelenorden kopfgeldmissionen kaufen bei welchen ihr verfluchte skelette erledigen m sst der handelsbund hingegen bietet euch transportmissionen an bei welchen ihr bestimmte gegenst nde oder auch tiere abholen oder fangen m sst und dann zu einer bestimmten person bringen welche irgendwo auf einer insel auf eure lieferung wartet es sei angemerkt dass es noch weitere missionstypen von den 3 hauptallianzen gibt welche sich deutlich von den anderen unterscheiden allerdings verzichte ich hier auf eine beschreibung einfach damit die welche sich noch nicht haben spoilern lassen sich noch auf die ein oder andere berraschung freuen k nnen bei den 3 vertretern gebt ihr am ende auch die gegenst nde ab welche ihr auf euren abenteuern gesammelt habt gebt ihr die gegenst nde bei den jeweiligen organisationen ab so bekommt ihr gold gewinnt obendrein auch noch ansehen bei den jeweiligen organisationen was euch neue missionstypen aber auch outfits f r euch und euer schiff gew hrt des weiteren habt ihr die m glichkeit unter der botschafterflagge einer organisation zu segeln was euch einen bonus f r abgegebene gegenst nde gew hrt f r diejenigen welche nicht nur missionen abarbeiten wollen sondern auch etwas story erfahren wollen h lt die sea of thieves einige geschichten bereit welche euch einen teil der geschichte der sea of thieves erkl ren durch das neue pirates life update gibt es des weiteren noch einen weiteren handlungsstrang in welchem ihr mit als auch gegen charaktere aus den fluch der karibik filmen k mpft und durch die meere segelt des weiteren gibt es auf vielen inseln b cher in welchen teile der schicksale einiger ber hmter piraten der sea of thieves festgehalten sind es lohnt sich somit definitiv mal ein bisschen l nger auf einer insel zu verweilen oder einen kurzen abstecher zu machen allgemein ist die welt so sch n gestaltet und mit so viel liebe zum detail aufgebaut dass es fast unm glich ist dem drang zu widerstehen nicht doch noch diese kleine insel da dr ben zu erkunden aber alleine das segeln ber die endlosen weiten des meeres wird euch viele wundersch ne momente bereiten aber lasst euch von dem frieden nicht t uschen ihr seid n mlich nicht alleine auf den meeren unterwegs hinter jeder insel kann ein anderer spieler auf euch warten welcher euch nicht unbedingt wohlgesonnen ist und einen teil wenn nicht sogar eure gesamte beute haben will und dann hilft meist nur noch die kanonen und klingen sprechen zu lassen fazitich bin in dieser review auf viele aspekte nicht eingegangen wie z b auf andere fraktionen die verschiedenen inseltypen oder die verschiedenen gebiete in welche die sea of thieves aufgeteilt ist das aber aus dem einfachen grund dass es am besten ist diese dinge selber zu entdecken weil dies einfach ein ganz gro er und ganz starker aspekt von sea of thieves ist das erkunden wer also nicht allzu geduldig ist oder ein spiel gerne schnell durchspielt und dann zum n chsten wechselt dem kann ich sea of thieves nicht empfehlen wer aber wie ich einen sehr gro en drang dazu hat riesige welten zu erkunden in stressigen situationen einen k hlen kopf bewahren kann und schon immer davon getr umt hat als pirat die see unsicher zu machen dem empfehle ich dieses spiel voll und ganz ich w nsche euch also eine gute fahrt ruhige gew sser und vielleicht trifft man sich ja mal mit kanonen oder in einer taverne auf einen grog english version introduction dear reader if you re reading this you re probably thinking of buying sea of thieves why you should do this and why sea of thieves is one of the best if not the best pirate game out there right now welcome to the sea of thieves since sea of thieves is quite a big game it s hard to get a good start for this review so i start my review where you start every time you want to set sail at one of the outposts outposts are one of the types of islands that await you in the sea of thieves here you will also find 3 representatives of the three main alliances a representative of the gold hoarders a representative of the order of souls and a representative of the merchant alliance while you buy treasure maps or puzzles from the gold hoarders and a reward usually in the form of a box full of gold awaits you when they are completed you can buy bounty missions from the order of souls in which you have to kill cursed skeletons the merchant all on the other hand offers you transport missions in which you have to pick up or catch certain objects or animals and then bring them to a certain person who is waiting for your delivery somewhere on an island it should be noted that there are other mission types from the 3 main alliances which differ significantly from the others however i will forego a description here simply so that those who have not been spoilered can still look forward some surprises at the end of the day you hand in the items that you have collected on your adventures to the 3 representatives if you hand over the items to the respective organizations you will get gold and on top of that you will also gain prestige with the respective organizations which will grant you new types of missions but also outfits for you and your ship furthermore you have the opportunity to sail under the emissary flag of an organization which grants you a bonus for items handed in for those who not only want to work through missions but also want to experience some story the sea of thieves has some stories ready which explain part of the history of the sea of thieves to you with the new pirates life update there is also another storyline in which you fight with and against characters from the pirates of the caribbean films but don t be fooled by the peace you are not alone on the seas behind every island another player can wait for you who is not necessarily well disposed towards you and wants some if not all of your loot conclusion in this review i haven t talked about many aspects such as other factions the different types of islands or the different areas into which the sea of thieves is divided but for the simple reason that it is best to discover these things for yourself because this is simply a very big and very strong aspect of sea of thieves exploring so if you are not too patient or like to play through a game quickly and then switch to the next i cannot recommend sea of thieves but if you like me have a very strong urge to explore huge worlds can keep a cool head in stressful situations and have always dreamed of making the sea unsafe as a pirate i fully recommend this game,274.8,26.0,0,Recommended,"December 28, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Janinus,False

80488,2020 i wish there was a neutral review for games because that is what i would rate this in its current state pros graphics the game is beautiful in fact it is the best looking water sun and sky i have seen in a game the colors are vibrant and pleasing on the eye sailing sailing is meditative for me it almost feels real and listening to the ocean is relaxing pve quest they are enjoyable i really like finding a riddle in bottle and trying to solve it tall tales are great if you are able to complete them without people killing you digging up treasure and finding other items is also really fun cons forced pvp i understand what they were trying to go for but humans suck and they go out of their way to ruin your gameplay they either need to add pve servers private servers or allow you to host a game and have your friends connect people say doing this will ruin the game but they are wrong ark and 7 days to die do it and those games are doing just fine being killed in port there are pirate rules written on the wall when you first spawn in the pub that say all matters will be settled at sea well guess what people aren t following those rules if they don t want to make pve or private servers then make ports and islands neutral where you can t attack people or steal loot however once you get out into open sea it can become far game then that would be a test of skill for all these die hard pvpers then toxic community being killed is one thing but being harassed while it happens is another kids and even one time a kid and his dad were yelling and saying horrible things while killing my wife and i this is another reason for private servers pve servers or local host game play community in general i absolutely love everything about this game except the community we can t play without people attacking non stop and then you lose an hour or two of work and gain nothing you are always out numbered and no one and i mean no one will help you everyone just shoots at first sight there is zero cooperation in this game pvp would be fine if it was a fair fight 1v1 or 2v2 but it never is you are always outnumbered and those people think they are good at the game because four of them killed a solo sloop needs more pve needs more enemy types and more variety of quest the ones they have now are fun but they just need to add more to spice it up a bit my wife and i still want to play this game but if we continue to be killed and harassed we are just going to have to quit we just want to play a relaxing pirate game where we can hunt treasure and do quest i really hope they add pve because you are isolating a huge demographic of people that would pay to play your game be smart rare and add pve servers you will make more money this way other games do it and they are successful this game would be a 10 10 in my opinion but right now it s a 4 10 with the forced pvp way to stressful for people who just want to relax and treasure hunt after a long hard day of work update screw this game screw the toxic community and screw rare do not buy this game and support this type of behavior wife and i are uninstalling rare goes and creates private servers but no gold or rep farming why it doesn t impact anyone by playing solo or pve everything is cosmetic so who cares i could spend hundreds of hours just sailing around and treasure hunting by myself that is fun to me despite people telling me it would be boring they don t get to decide what i think is fun or not this game definitely needs some pve servers rare if you implement this i will return and even pay money in your in game shop because i do like some of the ship cosmetics but until then screw you and your toxic game you don t understand people at all give them pvp only and it will bring out the worst in people you don t even listen to the large community asking for pve terrible company overall score 4 10 with the potential to be a 10 10 with pve servers,118.3,811.0,357,Not Recommended,"June 6, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Zaku Kai,False

80497,2023 i used to hate the players but now i hate the game the devs have said their piece on pve servers and that s made it pretty clear this game is a sandbox for bullies and predatory players by design there is merit to the pvp in this game and players have a dedicated pvp mode they can opt into but they don t because that would be a fair fight against a willing and consenting opponent instead they want to go into the main mode where naive players are drawn in by the whimsical aesthetic of the game and the draw of the seas only for their real purpose to be food for the sharks no really think about it if someone is playing as a pvp hunting player in the main mode they aren t looking to encounter someone who is prepared and willing to fight against them that s what sea dogs mode is for they want someone who s unprepared they want an unfair fight they want to fight someone who doesn t consent to the competition again i used to hate the players but that s humanity people have dark sides and want to do dark things to other humans i blame the devs who s refusal to acknowledge the constant insistence by the community that they want to be free of these bullies can only be interpreted as an endorsement of said bullying they created this entire game as a vehicle to get money out of those bullies so i cannot fundamentally un recommend this game enough this is a despicable project,332.2,46.0,3,Not Recommended,"June 30, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,RiKShaw,False
80499,2020 imagine having such an awesome game foundation and then screwing it up by keeping it as dull as possible no ship upgrades no character upgrades one branch of common enemy skeletons each and every mission plays out exactly the same and don t get you anywhere except give you more gold which you can exchange for cosmetics only so basically you grind for cosmetics and you sail to grief other players because there s nothing else to really gain from them that you wouldn t be able to find a lot faster somehwere else the only thing pvp gives you is angery noises and salty tears that s about it it pains me to see that such an awesome game is lacking literally everything that would otherwise make this one of the most rewarding pvp games out there most early access turds have more content in the long run and a more promising meta gameplay than this which effing sucks because the foundation is there and it s yuuuuuge the teamplay is awesome crew members need to perform their tasks accordingly sea battles are a truly exciting experience the water is beautiful sailing is fun but there is no depth to it not even in 2020 a good idea with shallow execution also these controls are beyond stupid one box opens with f and another one with r and both of them are closed with x like why why would you screw with my fingers like that i m a pirate not a pianist,104.5,38.0,6,Not Recommended,"November 15, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Elmo

80500,2023 this post summed up in a sentence to save you my rant great game but enter at own risk will be verbally abused and have anxiety attacks if you didn t have anger problems you probably will now this game was everything i wanted in a ship pirate style sailing game too bad the community and player base receives a pirate game and immediately dictates its a slaughter fest even after shooting up a white flair to show us they mean no harm can t enjoy the game with casual merchants runs without 2 sloops or paired galleons jumping on us the moment we spawn the foul language and racist rants from 10 20 year olds on the daily if you think you can enjoying a game where you sail the seas and find buried treasure then prepare for server hopping to avoid aggro trash or 3 straight hours of avoiding ships that refuse to leave you be perfect landing mark for trolls and people with aggression problems to vent and let out their anger this game can be fun challenging exciting team building and beautiful and yet its one of the most anxiety triggering aggressive troll magnet games out there even siege and league have a better player base we ve managed to find very rare decent players wanting to pvp minus the toxic rants and accepting being sunk the one time and calling a truce i can count on my hand how many people have teamed up with us or allied and help raise the feeling of the game until the racist slurs and being called the b word repeatedly over playing the game makes me want to avoid this game at all cost,184.7,23.0,0,Recommended,"April 29, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"BlueWillow

80556,in sea of thieves i experienced some unique moments setting aside the pirate life and the fact that the game looks and runs superbly i can t help but remember the time when i was playing with friends and instead of using the bait for fishing i ate it i ate it and a few seconds later i vomited on a friend right in his mouth then he vomited on me you have to appreciate the attention to detail and believe me since then i avoid doing that in real life as captain jack sparrow would say yo ho ho and a bottle of rum hey don t vomit on me and that s just one of the moments it s a must play with friends we ve had hundreds of hours of fun and i have just as many recorded on my hard drive mainly because i m too lazy to make montages from the recordings anyhow i 100 recommend it the game is hands down the best multiplayer pirate game since there s still no better single player one than assassin s creed black flag,88.8,18.0,6,Recommended,July 24,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Dan | Greuceanu

80558,2022 product received for free i have a serious love hate relationship with sea of thieves it is both one of the best games i have ever played and one of the most frustrating games i have ever played all wrapped into one the gameplay of sea of thieves is incredible the sailing is the best in any game i have ever played the feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game the cooking mechanic the healing from food the not terrible fishing mechanic all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right the land based combat is relatively uninspired yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents some of my favorite memories in gaming full stop come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long form content available in the game the game is gorgeous some of the best ocean water graphics in any game the rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in i swear to gaben that i can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands the music and sound design are some of the best in the industry outright the game is incredible but sea of thieves sweaties ruin the game for me there is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who s enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else s fun i understand that pvp is part of the pirate life but it is by far the worst part of the game by far i would be willing to pay money hell a freaking monthly subscription for the opportunity to play sot as a strictly pve game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots i actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn t seen sunlight since the obama administration i know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater sot sphere but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish and i really freaking wish that i could enjoy the aspects of sot that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others,64.5,16.0,1,Recommended,"April 17, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,MrMr,True
80559,2021 this has been said countless times throughout countless forums and reviews but it s going to be said one more time this is a game that attracts the worst kind of people that s not to say that it is a bad game playing with a full group of friends there s fun to be had whether you re fighting sea monsters digging up chests or if you re lucky having epic pvp ship battles the problem is with that last type because thus far i and my group of above mentioned friends have had one pvp battle otherwise it goes more like this you find a treasure map which uses riddles and hints to make you carefully examine every inch of an island populated by skeletons some of which demand your full attention due to their ability to pop out of the ground suddenly with a barrel of instant killing gunpowder finally after numerous crack shots and expending your limited inventory of items certain npc enemies can only be hurt by certain things you reach the last clue and start counting out paces to dig up your treasure and hear cannon fire the map lead you to the far side of the island so by the time you make it back to your ship you can just barely see the mast sinking beneath the waves what an exciting battle that you were a part of and have lost everything to as in order to get your new ship you must abandon the treasure you dug up and be escorted by a mermaid the community response is usually just that s the game you paid for but sometimes you get someone offering advice leave someone on the ship so one of your group has paid for a game that they don t get to play because while everyone else is off enjoying the game they re staring at the horizon this continues to every other aspect of the game as well sometimes you don t get the option of a sentry defense such as when a ghost ship rises right up out of the waves alongside you for a fight or a kraken latches onto your ship and as you re busy enjoying this real fight another player is fired out of their cannon onto your deck with a full arsenal of bombs solely to ensure that you lose to an npc so that they can have your stuff for free the only defense it seems is to never do anything the final straw for this was having just spent three real world hours sailing in circles while another ship was lurking just on the horizon close enough to watch but much too far to engage with two hours of staring each other down and seeing them turn towards our ship any time we dared to drop anchor and consider actually playing the game only to have them turn away back to the far edge of sight the second we reconsidered and went back to standing off with them it certainly wasn t fun for us and i can t imagine it was fun for them either but that s what it was it s common for people to compare this experience to titles like rust where player to player interaction creates its own stories but rust doesn t boast about it s epic pve boss fights or grand story lines or interesting npcs those are there i m lead to believe but i can t seem to take my eyes off of the sails in the distance long enough to find them,91.3,171.0,20,Not Recommended,"February 20, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Jinairen

80568,2021 before you buy this game if all you want to do is sail around and blow up other ships this is your game this is a pvp game now this is not a pirate adventure game most of the adventurers have gone on to other games the dev s have committed to the pvp crowd recently releasing events that focus entirely on sinking ships i m not asking the devs to change their game it can be pvp you pvp players don t have to defend the game from me this is just a recommendation for those players who are looking for adventure to look somewhere else its fun and exciting if someone tries to steal your loot to benefit themselves but usually its just players looking to sink ships and kill other players ignoring the loot to pvp i have to stress these players are not playing for treasure they are playing for the satisfaction of ruining other peoples quests flying under non pvp flags sinking the ship and sailing off ignoring the treasure yes there are people who will say this isn t their gameplay but this was my gameplay especially recently it gets tiring very quickly if you are a part of the pirate adventure crowd oh and to review gameplay i suppose the enemies are repetitive just all skeletons theres only a few types of quests it makes sense why they focus on the pvp now,67.0,17.0,1,Not Recommended,"March 15, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Zest

80578,2023 i ve always enjoyed pirate themed games and stories it s one of my favorite aesthetics i remember reading about sea of thieves back in 2018 shortly after it first came out and i thought the game looked absolutely smashing i was quickly dissuaded from the game however as so many reviews mentioned the brutal no choice pvp nature of the game and at times toxic nature of the community especially with me not being very good at pvp and having slow reaction times cut forward to two months ago when a friend convinced me to buy the game after showing me how many pve activities there are and just how fun and interesting the world is my starting experience was getting destroyed by a 4 person galleon minutes after completing the tutorial and joining the larger world no problem right that happens i ll just continue on life after life ship after ship crews and ships of 2 3 people more than myself show no hesitation in destroying my ship and occasionally shouting rude comments in the process running or fighting the result is the same i got to about 50 hrs of gameplay with my largest streak of not getting killed being about 4 hours it was promising when rare announced safer seas as a non pvp mode but as they will cap reputation and offer reduced treasure in this mode 30 rewards it is clear they only intend safer seas to be an extended tutorial ptr i know there are other people like me who just want to play this beautiful and fun game without pvp and would happily buy things from the store to support the development of the game overall however currently and even with the proposed safe seas mode people not interested in pvp are being treated as second class players by the develoopers,75.9,22.0,3,Not Recommended,"October 3, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Housand

80601,2021 after they broke the fov for pc i cant play this game anymore due to motion sickness after spending lots of real money on their emporium too so disappointed this sums it up pretty well let s be real for a second why do people use high fov because low fov makes them motion sick that is a fact and even with fov cranked up all the way to the maximum with a config edit i do get motion sick during storms due to excessive ship shaking and lower fovs only worsen the situation high fov is a legitimate accessibility feature they just removed this alone renders the game nigh unplayable for me and many other players because we literally cannot play it due to us getting motion sick in a matter minutes hours all depends on a person for boasting high amount of accessibility features some of which are legitimately great developers forgot about a fairly common and long known issue among players some of them get motion sick and cannot play at low fovs due to that now let s talk about unfair advantage to which i want to say what advantage exactly high fov is advantageous for peripheral vision but it drastically reduces your ability to see in the distance as all objects get way smaller but sot gameplay is primarily based on distance who spots the ship in the horizon first person to whom said ship is visibly larger or one who can see a bit more to the sides but everything in the distance is smaller obviously the first one and on practice i ve experienced it numerous times as i struggle to find that tiny sail in the distance god help me to figure out if they have an emissary on top of that not to mention that i have harder time reading tall tales as they are almost 2x smaller and not being able to use some tricks like looking down to the map from upper floor trough the openings it s too small but sure i can see to the sides a bit more how did that help me in gameplay not a lot because melee fights are not that prevalent and skeletons don t pose much of a threat regardless of fov in conclusion fov does not provide players unfair advantage if anything it have a slew of disadvantages specific to sot fov is not just see more on the sides it s a trade off between being able to see in a more wide angle at exchange of being able to see in a distance now to tos if you look at where the configuration files are stored they are located in the userspace not in the game folder meaning that editing those are within the user discretion and is not editing static game files it s not the same as patching game archives to change textures and such developers still can claim it s part of game files but those same files are created by the game on first startup as well as edited by it when user configured the game while config did exploit a configuration section that was not exposed in the ui it is still just a configuration of the game not a hack or a cheat which are bannable people are pissed about this fix not because it gives advantage they are pissed because it made the game a lot worse for them as they are no longer can play it comfortably without getting motion sick,148.8,79.0,12,Not Recommended,"June 22, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,sh0u,False

80689,2022 after playing 264 hours of this game here is why i don t like this game a typical day of me trying to play the game is the following i have at my disposal 1 hour and 20 minutes to do a quest to raise my reputation with the order of souls after spending 30 minutes trying to find an average player who can vote on raising the flag and voyages i finally found someone we started the quest and we were attacked by some other players and they forced us to spend 20 min on pvp till we gave up and sunk our ship i could have continued to attack seeking vengeance still i decided to exit the game since i had at my disposal only 30 more minutes to do something entertaining instead of hunting kids thus i checked my library and i played something else the problem with this game is that it is for people who have a lot of free time at their disposal and are eager to do a lot of grinding if you are a working dad like me this is not a game that will entertain you in your small breaks i like some aspects of the game it is great fun when you play with friends but i grew on it to realise it wastes time with toxic pvp players eager to ruin your day that said the game promotes you to have this behaviour because you are a pirate thanks to this game i realised that pirates were bullies there was nothing noble about them like most players in the game still hate this game noob players make this game toxic,602.8,25.0,5,Not Recommended,"August 19, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"lomlom

80814,2022 i will admit that i haven t played in recent months as of this review which may change sometime down the line but the main reason as to why will be put in the summary i have also played the initial month of my time on the game pass version before getting it here on steam so my time played is a little skewed and to those who are among the side of the playerbase i point out in the review and intend on giving me clowns go ahead and waste your points you ll only be proving my point tl dr it can be fun if you like the whole sea faring aspect more so with friends but expect the toxic as s sweats to slam dunk on you with little to no care on what impact they have on your experience edit on 6 15 2022 i will give this a more proper review once the captaincy update comes out in which i will have put in more time in the game and thus give the review a do over edit on 6 25 2022 if anyone wants an idea of how the playerbase for this game is just look to the comments n edit on 8 4 2022 as i thought the captaincy update did bring new things to the table but at the same time gave the sweats even more reasons to s on everyone that tries to focus on the criteria required for unlocking said stuff no measures put into place to those trying to protect themselves from the kill happy idiots oooh protect yourself oooh it s a pirate game oooh git gud oooh they re after your loot oooh mad cause bad anyone that insists on saying anything along the lines of these take it and shove it the sweats are the reason that i and so many others are wanting pve servers some even willing to put up with harder aspects of it just so that the pvpillagers don t ruin the game experience rare themselves have nurtured this playerbase that has shown time and time again to be out for the kill and not the loot since to them it s a very minor bonus compared to hunting someone down if you plan on getting this game know that you could invest hours into a single voyage or towards a commendation achievement and could lose all of that progress in one fell swoop should some of the idiots swing by to slam dunk on you for s s and giggles combined with how the game has hit registration issues since launch even for melee since all attacks including melee count as a projectile of some sort and thus subject to the mmo esque latency the game has resulting in hits not connecting even with a blunderbuss pressed right against your opponent s face yet them able to hit you when five feet off to the side this is of course without factoring in the vast skill gap between those who have been playing the game since launch compared to those who only started a year couple of seasons ago the core gameplay loop is that you take quests voyages from each of the representatives on the outpost islands there s the gold hoarders the merchant alliance and the order of souls treasure hunting cargo delivery and skeleton bounties respectively these are what players will usually do for gold at the start but each and every island has some bits of treasure scattered about them save for the outpost ones along with the mermaid shrines for those willing to dive to the depths to get them there s also the varying tall tales for those wishing to pursue a set of stories in the game on top of the seasonal content ugh that comes out every three or so months however said loop can easily run itself dry as what comes off as fun and interesting at first can easily be ruined once you encounter other players on their ships rare is going purely by a tools not rules approach to the multiplayer aspect and of all of the encounters i had less than five percent of them were friendly while the rest shot on sight and even pursued to the ends of the earth even if it meant having to sail into the volcanic areas or the red seas themselves the multiplayer aspect is there but as said above you re likely to get a sword in your gut or a bullet in your face for your troubles doubly so if you re playing solo as each and every player is pretty much out for themselves you could have no loot and no supplies on your ship and you ll still be sunk just because the sweats feel having easy kills with rare being dead set on keeping the game as a pvpve one what s worse is that you could be sailing to an outpost after a good few hours in one session sometimes on just a single voyage only to be attacked right as you are offloading and thus have all of your spoils cashed in by the ones that took everything from you this is especially problematic as you ll often be on an island looking for loot only for them to swing by and sink your ship thus leaving you and your potential loot stranded until you warp to where your ship is which is often on the other side of the map compared to where you were previously at tools not rules yes but there s only so much that regular folks especially ones that prefer pve can take before they end up dumping the game due to the sweats that ruin the experience for them,235.0,24.0,2,Not Recommended,"June 6, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Aleron

80860,product received for free i got this game as a gift from my dad after i let him know it was on sale after the implementation of safer seas the gameplay is great fun because unlike most pirate themed games you play as someone on a ship not the ship itself and safer seas has been a fun opportunity for me to play a game with my dad however i m giving this game a negative review for one simple reason rare it took over five years for them to implement safer seas despite demand for some kind of pve mode in the steam forums and elsewhere their mods have lashed out at people who criticize the game or request expansion of safer seas to be much less punitive towards people who don t enjoy pvp and now they ve delivered an ultimatum in the steam discussions threatening to shut them down altogether because they think their mods are the ones being abused the game itself is fun at least in safer seas so i recommend buying it when it s heavily on sale let rare know how much money they re missing out on rare you are terrible at public relations and you will suffer for it i will continue to play and enjoy what s available in safer seas and i will never spend a real world dollar on any of the micro transactions in the emporium as long as you continue to lash out against criticism and suggestions and unlike you i will gladly accept comments and criticism of this review constructive or otherwise edit that ultimatum thread i mentioned has been deleted and rare has pinned two posts advising people to go to other forums to give feedback saying that the devs rarely view the ones on steam apparently they didn t know how to counter the overwhelming outcry against their ultimatum including a couple posts that pointed out steam s own best practice guidelines which pointedly discourage their habit of arguing with players and locking threads so not only does rare suck at public relations but they are also cowards wonderful edit 2 rare has taken to deleting threads from the steam discussions without warning and without announcement in fact i was just banned for posting threads in which i endeavored to not mention them specifically and didn t use any language that violates steam community rules or guidelines so i take back what i said do not buy this game do not encourage others to buy it and if you already have it never spend any money in the emporium edit 3 for some reason i am no longer able to post comments on this review and steam support s initial response has not been helpful so apparently being banned from a game s community means i m not able to comment on my own review but since i m still receiving comments the review is clearly still visible a and because i m still able to edit this review i m going to respond to comments here for the time being comments christian3476 skill issue that s as asinine as saying a teetotaler s refusal to take part in a drinking contest is a liver issue ethan complains about pvp in a pirate game called sea of thieves wild where in the review did i complain about pvp and as for the implication that pvp is intrinsic to pirate themed games consider the following games that all came out before sea of thieves sid meier s pirates assassin s creed iv black flag risen 2 the monkey island series balenciaga high seas aren t even that dangerous lol you can spend days soloing without seeing another player sometimes cool but moot i don t enjoy massive multiplayer and any encounter with someone i don t know is one too many especially if they re as toxic as the players of this game tend to be chukyuniqul i will never understand this mentality of oh i wanna like this game but it s not for me therefore it s the game s fault it s like complaining that someone s hot but has an ass personality except their personality isn t even that bad they just don t with what you with i don t understand that mentality either good thing it s not my mentality to expand on your simile it s more like i want to go out with someone but their parents are the worst kind of bigots and always have their bigot friends over so the only way i can communicate with the one i m attracted to without having to be around the bigots is over the phone mate the game s not for you you have a right to counter recommend to other pve focused players but you re being whingy when you re tryina make it out like rare somehow owes you to make it into the game you like it s pure bratty entitlement i really wanna like hunt but it s too high a skill and knowledge floor for me the pvp focus is too great so i explained in my brief and negative review why without making crytek look like they re somehow failing at their job way to miss the point i m not saying rare owes me anything only that they are shooting themselves in the foot by alienating and even punishing a huge potential revenue source by not making some fairly simple changes to gameplay options especially given that they ve already added safer seas opportunity cost look it up lastly if you have all those pve focused pirate games why not go play those and leave the blend of pvp and pve that this one has to the people who actually like it way to miss the forest for the trees i listed those pirate games to point out that pirate themed games are not inherently about pvp sea of thieves has very different gameplay mechanics than most other pirate games

80975,this game is incredibly fun and the amount of content is well worth its price however due to the community this game is nothing but a torture chamber say you want to get on with some of your friends cause ya like pirates or sailing the seas and making money so yall crew up and hop on before you even leave the starting island you re attacked so ya server hop attacked a few minutes after leaving port server hop ship sank this time by a cheater make an alliance they will betray you to make a fraction of the profit they would ve made if you sold it and shared the payment thats what alliances do the community is incredibly toxic most attack for no reason even when you clearly have not treasure aboard not to mention again that this game has a huge cheater problem and has had one for many years now rare doesnt care they even joked and made fun of players that wanted a pve only mode by making it where you cant progress while in that mode its just a sandbox basically absolute joke and spite from the devs at rare the only people who defend pvp in this game are the cheaters and scum whose only excuse is this is a pirate game if that were only so instead of this game being a cesspool of toxicity and cheaters i dont understand why they have all this pve content that you cant do because of the forced pvp its honestly worse than dark souls invasions after a long day of work i just want to explore the seas and progress my milestones but instead i m sunk by mrcoolswag69 named every slur in the book over the chat and told to kill myself and uninstall the game rare had such a good opportunity to make an amazing adventure game but fumbled it with forced pvp combined with the cheapest anticheat in the industry and bans anyone who speaks out against them or their vision of this game newsflash devs the players of your game know what they want if you did what we wanted youd have alot more sales and a higher player count the majority do not want forced pvp in this mainly pve game so be warned potential buyer you will not have fun or be able to relax in this game,249.0,17.0,3,Not Recommended,June 13,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Feylene

80982,2021 sea of thieves is completely unplayable if what you most want in the world is a game that allows you to team up with your friends and be a jerk harassing and interfering with the play of other players without any in game justification this is the game for you if like me you thought it would be possible to play the pve elements of this game that are so heavily advertised in its trailers you are wrong skip it the trailer you may note suggests indulging in some pvp in the arena which you might think means this game like most games has a dedicated pvp experience but you would be wrong the adventure mode features pvp as well is that so awful yes it is unless literally your only interest is in pvp it is awful skip it there are a variety of quest types available including the long story focused tall tales all of which are in the format go to island explore island do thing on island therefore what every single quest has in common is getting off your boat as a solo player or part of a two man crew this ended in death by pvp every single time online guides tell me that once the enemy is aboard your ship you have lost therefore never leave your ship that rings true since literally every time my friend and i got out on an island to kill skeletons or collect gold as suggested both by the built in quests and the marketing for the game an enemy crew appeared to kill us take all our accumulated loot and generally spawn kill us for however long it took to sink our ship ah you say they stole your accumulated loot what a great pirate game and you would be wrong because having no loot in fact being obviously freshly spawned with nothing on the ship of any value didn t prevent spawn camping by enemy players for so far as i can tell no purpose other than to enjoy being jerks this is a pirate game says the chorus of griefers so invested in the jerk status quo if you re getting sunk it s because you re bad yeah nah this is pretty simple if you re attacked when you re not on your boat you ve already lost if you get attacked first you ve already lost if you get attacked by a powerful galleon crewed by four people while you are in a sloop alone or with a friend you ve already lost the pvp in this game is not balanced in any way that makes it possible to succeed as a single player against even a marginally competent crew the pvp in this game is not balanced in any way that makes it possible to complete the many pve quests without your quest loot being stolen and your ship destroyed the pvp in this game is not balanced in any way that prevents enemy players from hanging out on your boat and spawn killing you over and over until they get bored or you get frustrated and sink your own ship for the privilege of being teleported across the map to be harassed by other jerk players in some other part of the world if getting sunk and having your session progress reset to zero were an occasional experience that would be fine if there were the slightest hope of defending yourself that would be fine if it were at all possible to complete the adventure goals this game is sold on without getting killed that would be fine but none of those things is true instead you are either all in for a full crew pvp experience or you are screwed if you have any interest in any of the game elements advertised in the many trailers you are screwed in short if you want to play this game at all outside the very narrow mode of gameplay favored by the griefing pvp community of this game you are screwed the commentary surrounding this problem with the game design is depressingly homogenous people like me point out that if you re interested in playing the game as advertised you can t because of the endless griefer parade approximately thirty milliseconds later said griefers appear to insist well actually it s a pirate game and you can t grief other players because that s just how it works we re pirates and under their logic hanging around on a treasure less ship to spawn kill the noob crew over and over and over until they scuttle their ship is somehow being a pirate so if you re a jerk and you re looking for an online arena to be a jerk with your jerk friends and generally make a miserable gameplay experience for random strangers look no further sea of thieves is the game for you if you want a game that allows the sorts of high seas adventures and skeleton battles and exploring promised in the game trailers and you think you ought to be able to do those things without being swarmed by jerks every thirty seconds and killed repeatedly just for jerks sheer joy at knowingly ruining your game session find some other game sea of thieves is for jerks and it seems the devs are all in on mandatory jerk gameplay so unless you re a jerk skip it,128.8,84.0,41,Not Recommended,"April 19, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,CheerfulSpider,False
80998,played originally on xbox and switched to steam when a friend got it for me this game would be in my top games if they hadn t made toxic players their only customer base instead of opening it up to non pvp players like i hoped with safer seas instead they took out most off the game locking everything behind high seas and handing you a shell off a game expecting you to be happy with it in the new safer seas you can t do a lot off the events such as the fort of fortune you are unable to own or captain a ship though you can still customize the ship you use some of the milestones are locked behind being on a captained ship so you are unable to make progress on those which is a bummer the reputation gain is capped at 40 and you cant be emissaries for any off the factions any pvp factions you can make no progress on in general which is understandable the gold and reputation earned is set to 30 of normal and the chests you can find are set to some of the lowest ones over all safer seas is not worth playing at all even for beginners just go through the tutorial mission all that has come of safer seas is that it has given already incredibly toxic players another reason to be more toxic citing if they didn t want pvp they would go back to safer seas i hope that the developers don t use the joke that is safer seas as a statistic to back up their ideas that people don t like the non pvp version so that they don t have to keep offering it i would be willing to spend more time and money on a game that catered to the wants of a large group of people that don t want to have to deal with pvp when being a pirate but still want a good game,65.4,20.0,0,Not Recommended,January 2,Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"keedakat

81114,2021 i see loads of people defending this game s biggest fault by saying it s supposed to be part of the experience but the biggest fault is the toxic community present in the game which is absurdly prevalent and burdening on options for how you can and will play rather than having the freedom to adventure as you wish you have to learn to constantly accommodate and compensate for the unyielding toxicity of the play style of those around you the game designers haven t incidentally missed this the design perpetuates a dynamic of rewarding random attacks and theft with no downsides there is absolutely no safety zone mode server or setting to protect players for even a moment from attempts to troll grief follow deceive harass and taunt you attempts to have this issue addressed have come from many players since alpha many forums including the official sea of thieves moderated forum are full of people asking for some fix to this dynamic usually the users suggest a pve mode all are mocked by sideways commentary along the same lines as any empowered population lording over and under represented population the sentiment of these mocking comments boil down to we re having fun so we don t care that you re not as if in fear that enabling pve or any non pvp session protection will reduce their fun this is not entirely unwarranted as the population of those who are unprepared and unwilling to take part in pvp encounters would no longer be easily found in abundance and those who remained would have to deal with more difficult opponents the great appeal for many of those who enjoy pvp and the draw that scares game devs from implementing any form of safe zone is simply the thrill of dominating other players when you find them vulnerable it s an addictive pass time that does nothing for you but build a dependence on trying again to get that same thrill of dominance that cannot be found with a peaceful encounter with friendly and willing strangers only with victims the chemical rush from this activity is short lived because the thought processes that stimulate the endocrine system to provide your reward is in the moment and very simplistic the less intense stimulation from peaceful encounters is slower to build and slower to burn off as it comes from a more complex set of processes which can be remembered and built upon some prefer that bigger and more intense thrill and require an environment that facilitates lots of it with new options frequently released to help maintain some level of intensity others prefer a more manageable and sustainable experience that more organically leads to development of the options in which those players wish to partake with far less frequency called for one of these experiences is perpetuated by the sea of thieves design the other is facilitated by world of warcraft ffxiv grand theft auto lotro warframe pirates of the burning sea etc should you decide to buy this game on steam please know that it may very likely take you three or more hours of playtime if you re not rushing through set up character creation tutorial level and then out to a server where you can run into other players and experience this unending toxicity first hand steam will not refund your purchase after three hours of accumulative playtime so if you want to see this for yourself rush through and get out there as fast as you possibly can see if you like it if you do create a new pirate take it really slow through the tutorial to get your settings adjusted and controls the way you like and collect that huge stash of gold hidden in the storage cellar before moving on good luck hope you have more fun than we did,617.6,24.0,10,Not Recommended,"June 1, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Agressively Pansexual Ninja

81138,2022 amazing game with stunning graphics and sound that s it that s all the positive aspects i can think of i was really disappointed with the game in the lack of pve servers rare hasn t considered that there are two player bases in this game the ones who like to farm who find enjoyment in pve and overall to enjoy a pirate game their way but there s also the player base who are thirsty for blood and find their fun in pvp and indirectly ruin the fun of others who aren t in to pvp this game has completely neglected the player base that enjoy pve and for that reason you are forced to become good at pvp to play this game despite some players hating pvp i see absolutely no fun in grinding for hours and enjoying those hours to end up getting looted by another ship and essentially wasting all that time you spent where exacty do you get the motivation to do it again i have absolutely no idea the player decides what is fun if there are two different types of fun in the game then split the game to make those types separate in other words make a pvp server and pve server and sure i ve seen arguments saying that s it s a pvp game hints why it s called sea of thieves but what if someone wants to play this game because it looks like a cool pirate game but can t because that person isn t in to pvp you see the problem the verdict is if you like to fight other players by all means this game is for you but if you want a relaxing pirate game without any worry of players killing you do not get this game get ac black flag instead,113.8,24.0,2,Not Recommended,"April 9, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"CynicalFox

81659,2023 the designers insist on game design decisions based on a game ideal they have in their head the result is a severely toxic environment where you either like pvp and sabotaging others or you re punished for not liking it mmo s 30 years ago figured out how and why this approach doesn t work and only benefits the most aggressive and oppressive part of the community yet as with every other aspect of the game that s needed changing over the years the devs believe they know better adding pve servers wouldn t result in dead servers as some defenders would imply it d give a space for people that otherwise just wouldn t play and a more positive experience for those who are starved enough for a decent piracy game made in the last 10 years to get into a pvp environment despite not having any interest in the pvp content if you force pve players into pvp all you re doing is giving easy pickings to people who like pvp it s not engaging for the pvper doesn t test their skills and it s a negative experience for the pve player the only reason a pvp player would want pve players in their very limited servers is to bully people or an alternative option if they re too unskilled to engage with anyone actually interested in pvp it benefits only the least admirable part of the community and i don t understand why the slur spewing toxic part of the community needs a leg up why do pve players have to pay the price for the enjoyment of a volatile subsection of pvp players it s a bizarre choice when on the other hand they ll censor words as benign as hangman brief side mention that the game is designed to be aggressive to solo players the only way to really play on your own is to be avoidant or prey on other solo players anything else and you are violently outclassed by design that aside the game has been out for years yet still has routine bugs that go from obnoxious to game breaking be it crashing old accounts having consistently more issues so loyal early adopters are punished for believing in the team textures refusing to load at all flying ships unkillable krakens texture breaking in story mode physics launching your ship into the sky for parking too close to a dock and more i m sure i forgot the monetization is cosmetic but as there s hardly any goal in game beyond cosmetics you can say that short of pay to win the game is 100 monetized and aggressively so enjoy paying between 15 20 bucks for one decent ship design which isn t impossible to get ingame but it relies on waiting on islands for hours to have a chance at getting the equivalent of maybe a dollar s worth of premium currency if you catch it in time this is a game that has solely survived on the hopes and dreams of millions desperate for a good game about piracy which as a theme have ironically been a desert with the rare oasis and no consistency in genre a hole they fill marginally for the time though with luck not for much longer if you have 3 friends that show up consistently you might circumvent a lot of the cruelty designed into the game levelled at pve and especially solo players otherwise avoid this game it scratches the pirate itch but it does so clumsily with many price tags and a blatant disregard for your time or enjoyment edit they added pve servers where you can t engage with most of the mechanics the few you can naturally make the progression 3 3x as grindy this only really makes the servers where you can engage them more toxic as a result it s like a sneering apology hissed through gritted teeth and does more harm than good to pve players it s an insult rather than a compromise,129.2,23.0,1,Not Recommended,"January 6, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Danubean Horror,False

81818,2022 this game would be great if it had pve servers the dev s have designed a game based around hours long pve treasure quests and battles that is filled with toxic pvp players spawn camping everything it makes the game unplayable they closed down their arena which was pure pvp do to barely anyone using it but continue to force the idea that no one wants a pve only server,236.8,29.0,6,Not Recommended,"August 13, 2022",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,Lord Kai,False
81883,2021 it s nice looking and seems fun for a while until you realize its an endless grind which is excusable because most games are like that now what sucks about sea of thieves is the player base even if you have nothing on your ship and sail up to say hello to someone you ll be met with some 12 year old on his xbox who thinks sending you to the ferry over and over and sinking your ship while you don t even fight back is fun to which he ll probably tell you to get good or something similar as it takes him 10 minutes to sink your ship with fire my point is the games fun with friends but most every other multiplayer interaction you have will make you want to quit the game also to add salt to my wounds the linux support for this game is terrible and will make you constantly restart your game which takes much longer than it should just to start playing not to mention if you crash you ll have to do it all over again,532.9,24.0,4,Not Recommended,"December 21, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"T H R E E

81898,2021 do you want a game where you play for 6 hours killing bosses and doing quests for loot that when you want to turn in for gold you get ambushed and chased around by other players then lose everything in the heartbeat and get nothing in return for your time spent i must congratulate you this is the game you were looking for to explain the basics of the game this game is a sandbox game which means from the start of the game you have all of the items other players have weapons tools etc so the only thing you get in return for story quests and adventuring is gear to make you more good looking much like fortnite you are in an open world with 5 other players randomly spawned on outposts where you gather your starting supplies food cannonballs wooden planks you can choose to do story quests which take a whole eternity to do work for the ingame factions to gain reputation and unlock costumes and cosmetics for your ship or do events also called the wwii events where players can just come and sink your ship while you re doing it or wait for you in reaper s hideout and camp there waiting for you and then ambush you so you lose everything you farmed the whole day very amusing i know final thoughts if you are some hardcore veteran at pvp or even played fortnite this game is totally for you because its about reactions and good strategy on how to fight players for me this game is a tragedy costing me 30 i played it with my friends some moments where legendary but after everything i played through and after losing a full ship packed with treasure from a fort i m done with this game i m going back to league of legends or some mmorpgif you read through the review i m glad you took your time and read this and i hope it was helpful,329.5,93.0,39,Not Recommended,"October 29, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,The Unbroken,False

82059,2020 product received for free bottom line this game is a repetitive frustrating and unrewarding time sink the vast open world consists of virtually identical islands inhabited with virtually identical content combat is wooden and boring pvp is basically just a contest to see who has a bigger team every mission quest is either go here kill 5 bad guys or go here and find treasure even the so called tall tales are just very long kill 10 rats type experiences with an ounce of story mixed in it gets incredibly boring and predictable very fast quests are frequently bugged meaning bad guys and treasure do not appear there s no way to tell if a quest is bugged so you may spend 90 minutes looking for something that is not there all of your clothing and equipment is 100 cosmetic meaning there is no in game benefit to changing the default clothing and equipment every single thing you do takes a very long time absolutely everything is tedious for example say you sail around for two hours collecting treasure once you arrive at the port instead of just pressing a sell all treasure button or selling directly from your inventory you have to carry each individual item by hand one at a time to specific people on an island to sell it to a process that is instantaneous in most games takes 20 30 minutes in this one you can very slowly build up reputation with various factions a higher reputation will give you access to additional kill 10 rats type missions and additional clothing and equipment that carry no in game benefit in other words much like how the clothing is cosmetic having a higher reputation is also cosmetic and does not affect your game experience there is no end game to speak of you re literally just re living the tutorial every time you play the more likely outcome to your questing is that you ll spend two hours putzing around scrounging for treasure and then a galleon full of 13 year olds with aimbot will instantly kill you and steal your stuff in 30 seconds to that point every time i tried starting an open crew with 2 or more people i invariably was teamed up with either one person who does not speak english one 10 year old or someone who want to set the ship our ship on fire for just laughs it s a massive multiplayer game that incentivizes you to play solo there is a pvp arena and a pve map the pvp arena is almost always empty the pve map is full of people who are desperately just trying to enjoy pve and a handful of players who just want to torment them is it any wonder people think this community is toxic except that s not really the issue it s that the game rewards people for being jerks the game is toxic not the players,80.5,19.0,2,Not Recommended,"July 10, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Time Machine to 1988

82247,2020 nice game my issue lies primarily in the community which with every single ship me and my friends have encountered around 3 so far just start trying to sink us even though we made it clear were friendly and were docked 2 of those times as a new player the last thing i want to do is go against a sweaty team of bloodthirsty players edit i played a good bit more and i m done this games community is so awful its mind blowing there have been 0 friendly ships period and i went to do fort of the damned the largest pve event in the game and people came in a destroyed our boat and took everything without a word we got a second key but they hid and camped out at the reapers hideout and killed us again my experience has been nothing but pain playing this i can say its like rust in all the worst ways i really cannot illustrate how upset i am right now with the state of this games community and i don t think ill ever be coming back to this game without someone to hard carry edit 2 i have no idea why i came back to this game whatever the reason i regret it never will i make the mistake again,80.1,31.0,4,Not Recommended,"December 27, 2020",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"K-Fed

82368,2023 please do not buy this you will regret it later down the lineif i was to describe the game in one line it would be novel at first dull and lonely in the endi ve spent 100 hours now and i majorly regret the purchase even refunded it originally only to decide i would give it a real try now that i cant refund it im sad i didnt keep the money not so much for the money itself but because of what this game offersthis game offers zero actual solo enjoyment the people you find randomly either just leave afk or act incredibly rude and mean if you dont have friends this will not be a way to make some rather a constant source of struggles and upsets by a horrible and abusive playerbase that just want to make others feel bad theres some customization but you get like 10 000 gold in an hour if you re efficient ish and you need like a million for anything nice essentially anyway the new captain thing is nice but a lot of it is designed for players that play a lot and the rest is just cash shop stuffthe solo ish missions and the tall tales which is like adventures you go on are dull with little to not rewards other than some basic cosmetics they arent that fun and they are set in the same multiplayer ocean where others can interrupt and stop and destroy your mission i meet some nice people from time to time but thats the exception rather than the norm and when things go south people turn toxic incredibly fast i can not un recommend this enough go get a totally legal version that you can play on a custom solo server or go play another game like rust or something that would have much more in actuality to dothe music is nice but after 30 hours the same 14 songs get rather dull to play on repeat theres some random mini game like things to do like fishing which i guess is nice albeit barely profitable in comparison and at the end of the day they are mostly tediom without true joy the meat and potato s in this game is the people and again if thats what you come for the combat its clunky aim has some wierd custom controls you have to set up the the guns dont really have reticules or any sort of aim which is fine once you learn but for a new player can be upsetting and pulling out your sword when you run out or an enemy comes close takes way too long its like do able and ive won multiple fights against multiple opponents against me but its eh at best ship combat i mean its okay albeit the solo sloop one cannon just gets outmatched in every single way and gets out run if you are two people youll end up wanting a brig for the extra cannon theres up and downsides to everything but ultimately it just isnt a very nice experience especially when you have to rely on other people and players over all i hate it its a waste of 80 gigabytes of space that you could install 5 6 better games with save your money enjoy yourself with something that will truly feel rewarding and nice this has done nothing but give me upset from the first couple of hours till now i wish the best for you on your journey,101.4,20.0,4,Not Recommended,"January 6, 2023",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Frost

84045,2021 even post captaincy this game is still in desperate need of content that actual drives the players its a good experience but everything ultimately feels fruitless gold is effectively worthless and there is deliberately no real progression every reward eventually liquidates into a useless yellow currency there is real opportunity for mechanics like equipment crafting i don t see the point in making everything unlock able via gold one you get what you want there is no point hoarding it beyond seeing the number go up why not make it that the different loot you collect has different meaningful value why should a kraken meg and skeleton crew all drop effectively the same thing whats worse is that eventually these cool experiences become inconveniences and about as interesting as the in game weather you ve effectively made a tech demo with a theme park built on top i would understand the choice to make lateral content like quests if it actually built upon the gameplay in a meaningful way but it doesn t rare even identified this and made a safe little bubble for a pirates life so the kiddies didn t get stomped by experienced players when looking for captain jack swallows pvp is the only evergreen gratifying content to most experienced gamers it has the same appeal as rust i don t need this stuff but taking it away from you is the fun part but the game simply isn t designed for it google sot hitreg and you ll find 1000 s of threads it also doesn t help that your most economically rewarding encounters in this game against other players will always be when ganking terrible or new players it doesn t feel rewarding to sneak onto someones boat with a keg for the 9th time granted it does have hold my beer energy and i ll get some laughs from new players who ve never seen it before literally every person i ve played this game with has been surprised when they hear there is no progression half the time it kicks the wind out of their sails and they end up dropping the game within a week for something else which is such a shame its painfully obvious there is a massive hole in the middle of your game rare and you ve repeatedly ignored the warnings and don t heed your own communities advice this game would be an empty corpse and cautionary tale if not for it being free on game pass you lucked out being microsoft s golden child the game play and actual experience of this game is s tier but the design philosophy and direction make this truly wasted potential,195.7,20.0,1,Not Recommended,"September 20, 2021",Sea of Thieves: 2024 Edition,"Scroteus
