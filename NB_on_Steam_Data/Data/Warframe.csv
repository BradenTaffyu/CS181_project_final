43528,2018 first good things about warframe this game has spoiled me i will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer be it aaa or indie this game is free get it free you are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game all characters quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time that being said i have spent money on this why cosmetics of course fashion is endgame you know now just what is warframe warframe is a mostly pve third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay you have seen games do parkour before of course but these are space ninjas we re talking about which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets rockets and or high energy plasma or just take out your trusty sword hammer fists and cripple anything in your path what will you face humanoids robots aliens you name it yes there are bosses and they can and will kick your butt what will you face them with hundreds and i mean hundreds of weapons to choose from each of them unique in its own way and deeply customizable to suit your needs and or taste you can carry three of them at a time a primary weapon bow rifle etc a secondary weapon pistol throwing knives and other things and of course a melee weapon now you can always tear through the game solo but for the best experience the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of earth to an all out extermination in the frozen wastelands of pluto but doing missions is just one part of it you also have a widely explorable open world area with its own assortment of missions waiting for you and this open world thing is only going get bigger in future updates oh and the updates they are a regular thing like every other day now what s the story can t tell you its a secret no really the game community is super protective of the game lore there is a certain point in the game where you will know and then we can talk about it but until then you gotta find out for yourself for now just consider yourself a space ninja how about difficulty scales up with your level just like most modern mmos the game will be just as hard as you want to handle if you want to go at it casually there s content for you if you re looking for a challenge good news the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely now bad things about warframe pvp sucks grinding lots of grinding there are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and or have been in development hell for ages your inventory slots are limited and you can buy more by using the premium currency while technically you do not need to buy more slots since you can simply sell what you don t need or want it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum if you ever do about grinding this is both a good and bad thing about the game most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it s a little diferent in warframe the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game grinding is what you do to pass the time it is so integrated into the game world that you don t really notice it so yeah there is a lot of grinding but you have fun while doing it final thoughts now i m not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything more like game of the decade but the level of attention and communication that digital extremes the game devs has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous these people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry and i can only see good things in the future for them in conclusion we don t deserve warframe also you can have a space dog cat and pet them 10 10 edit grammar,940.4,321.0,22,Recommended,"30 August, 2018",Warframe,"Avabo

43554,2019 pros movement is something else it may begin to do a number on your pinky finger but once you get a hang of the moment controls this is possibly the best platforming i ve seen in a third person shooter high octane to the point where sometimes i feel i m getting motion sickness you can farm prime parts to sell for platinum the premium currency which means that with some patience you can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real world money most items have a ton of customization options aside from the ability to recolor which you get from the very start without having a spend anything warframes recolorable weapons recolorable your own spaceship yes recolor away pets sadly are a biiiiit harder to recolor i think very very well optimized i play this game butter smooth on my ages old pc and wouldn t be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop cons very very grindy if you just craft a warframe it literally takes days 72 hours before your frame is finished being made you can actually kinda follow the development as you progress through the game production value shoots up as you progress showing that later content earth through uranus feels very samey where you re just progressing from node to node junction to junction and it will test your patience uranus neptune and above though you begin to actually get proper quests with cinematics and everything however the game takes too long getting here i feel that s why they plopped cetus and fortuna where they are now to give new players a break from the node to node slog and overall content drought terrible customer support there is very little info on how to progress past uranus so heed my words when you hear odd sounds in uranus sealab words get your scanner out and scan the noodle monsters where did space mom go she said she was only going out for cigarettes it s been years,525.1,217.0,72,Recommended,"February 12, 2019",Warframe,"Rabblerouser

43558,2017 this game is evil at first you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character weapon designs you will say to yourself how can this be free and for the first 20 or so hours everything will seem fine but then all of a sudden you will match up with someone who has a way cooler frame than you and you will look in awe at them and every cell in your body will tell you you need to become that guy but then after doing some research online you will realise that his frame is no longer obtainable so you have to trade with some dude who has dedicated atleast 1000 hours to this dark ritual of a game so gullible as you are you will start to slowly farm rare items to gain enough premium currency to be able to afford this frost prime then after 20 25 hours of grinding you will start to question your own exsistence as you have only garned about a third of the platinum you need to buy that warframe and then in your hour of darkness the game will hit you with a 50 discount on the premium currency and in this hour of darkness where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming you will succumb to the dark lords but not only will you buy enough platinum to afford the warframe of your dreams you will buy one of the most expensive bundles as the dark lords known only in the common tounge as digital extremes had intended because who wants to save 5 bucks when you can save 50 you will powerfull for a time you will feel as though nothing can stop you untill you run out of platinum and the cycle begins anew and thus in countinues for eternity 10 10 would feed my soul to the dark lords for flashy weapons again,232.4,492.0,641,Recommended,"August 3, 2017",Warframe,Il Tempo Gigante,False
43561,2023 warframe is a hard game to put into words for anyone who hasn t played it for as many good things there are about it there are bad things that make the game somewhat tedious despite this i have a hard time not recommending the game almost nothing in out of the reach of free to play players which is something that a lot of other games can t say for themselves lets start with the good premium currency trading this might feel weird to be put in the good category but it has a lot to do with the above comment the premium currency is a tradable currency in game this means that you as a player can grind items and then sell them for the premium currency to other players on top of this warframe is incredibly lenient with how much it gives out discounts for its premium currency i m not at all ashamed to admit that i ve gotten a fair share of 50 off coupons in game and immediately used it to get 100 of the currency for 50 this combined with the fact that a lot of players are willing to trade tit for tat means that trading in this game is fairly robust heck i ve even had some interactions where people would throw something in extra for free grinding grinding in this game feels extremely rewarding and once you learn how when and where to do it becomes exceedingly fun to do most grinds to craft things will only take you a few hours at most and the fact that you get to choose items from any relic during relic missions means that most of the time you come out of missions feeling like you accomplished something community this is a bit of a weirder one although the community is incredibly nice and willing to help the main incentives to do so are related to grinding as such a lot of times it feels a lot more fun to just go into missions with a group of friends rather than do things publicly because its easier to plan out variety the game has a stupid amount of variety in the amount of playstyles that you can choose further augmented by things called mods that can increase various attributes this game is incredibly flexible and freeform in terms of how you can choose to play and its a part that i greatly enjoy alright so that was most of the good things so now i ll hit you with the bad time gating although grinding is fairly quick in most cases crafting in this game takes a set amount of time ranging from 1 minute all the way to a few days for warframes this causes you to be incredibly bored early in the game because you want to try other things but just can t because you need to wait on things to complete before getting to the meat and bones of the variety i talked about above you can rush the crafting with the premium currency if you so choose however mastery gating with the above comes mastery gating basically mastery is your characters level so to speak to increase mastery you need to level your equipment whether its warframes weapons or even pets this combined with time gating means that the pace of the game starts off incredibly slow because not only does getting mastery up take awhile you can also only level up your mastery once per day mastery dictates what missions you can do what weapons you can use and what warframes you have access to so its a fairly high minus for me on top of this if you have any weapons or warframes that you really enjoy it gets to a point where you re never able to play them because you need to level other things to progress your mastery lack of direction warframe is confusing incredibly confusing the tutorial teaches you very little about the game and then just throws you off a cliff and tells you to have fun exploring the game there s no goals for you to immediatly work towards nor does it explain how you get new warframes how open world areas like cetus fortuna and deimos work nor does it really try to explain how to get some of the best mods in the game this is all left to the player to figure out on their own and often times means you re spending an exceedingly large amount of time on the warframe wiki figuring things out though at least the wiki is exceedingly intricate and well made content lockout a lot of the content in the game is locked behind the main questline that it never tells you about the specific quest that needs completed is the war within which is locked behind a whole other series of quests and mastery level 5 which will take a casual player probably a little over a couple weeks to get to trading although i praised the trading above there is two caveats to it that requires an addendum which is that the only way to effectively market items in this game is via using warframe market which is an online third party website you can go to a relay and market items there but even though i ve spent a few hours attempting to sell items that way it almost never gets any bites unless its rivens speaking of which rivens rivens are like capstone mods for weapons in this game they re purposely random and incredibly op although i have nothing against them existing there s a few things that i absolutely despise about them the first part is pricing riven pricing is stupidly complex and it takes a lot of learning to understand how to do it yourself because of this there is riven appraisal discords websites and public chats for specifically this one thing rivens are also the devs way of influencing the meta through the disposition system basically the worse a weapon is the higher the maximum stats on the riven are allowed to be this means that if you like a popular weapon that the chances are that a rivens for that weapons are proportionately increased because of the supply demand and b that the cost of god tier rivens for that weapon is well above anyones pay grade a good riven depending on the weapon can range anywhere from 50 of the premium currency about 5 usd to around 2000 100 usd or even more and even on top of that rivens are also mastery locked ranging from mastery 8 all the way up to 16 to give you an idea of how annoying mastery is to level with the amount of time as of writing this post i m currently only mastery 12 yikes admittedly i could be quite a bit higher but i like to enjoy the games i play and so liked to stick to a few specific warframes and weapons overall i still recommend warframe with a couple caveats you have to be willing to grind and you have to be patient if you can do both of these things the game becomes very fun and has something to offer for almost everyone also you should probably find a friend to taxi you around to make your early game

43619,2014 my god i have not had this much fun since i discovered tf2 warframe easily takes the cake for one of the best free to play games on steam there s a nice balance between what you can get without paying a cent and buying stuff which imo is what makes this game so good i was always a sucker for third person shooters and this might as well be my favorite the gunplay is a bit bumpy starting off but once you get through the first mastery rank test there are many weapons to choose from something i really like about this game is that it lets you play how you wanna play you can be be at the sidelines of the battle assisting your team and picking off targets you can mess with your opponent lining them up for a perfect slash dash you can soak up hits while your team flanks for the objective or you can all the ninja and come from the front guns blazing also melee play is an actual and reliable choice the controls are laughably easy to get into after an hour i was completely used to it and now with the new update 14 there is an new and better intro to the game it might take a while to discover what this does how that works what happens when i do this etc but that can be cleared away with a quick look at the wiki i would give it a 8 10 has yet to disappoint me,123.7,280.0,1,Recommended,"July 19, 2014",Warframe,A Toasty Engineer,False

43642,warframe is a great passtime for people that enjoy games with many things to do and a strong sense of community seriously it s got one of the best game communities out there and much like deep rock galactic that s a selling point i m trying to sell any newcomers before even starting to talk about anything however it s important to clarify warframe is a farming game a grindy at times even repetitive game that expects you to put in hours of your life to unlock certain characters or beat a certain level many times battling rng to get a certain item and to even construct the characters it takes 3 whole days of waiting for the foundry warframe s crafting system to actually make it it is a free game so you can pay your way out of tiresome situations however let s leave the ugly parts aside because surprisingly warframe is one of the best experiences you can have for free if you re a fan of this sort of game my main selling points are the following the premise warfarm your way into godhood you start out controlling a warframe which to a newcomer looks like some sort of power ranger and you already kill everything in your path something very important about the starting cutscene that shows you the powers of your frames is that you actually see how strong you are at first it looks ridiculous but soon you notice you go from wow i m badass to wow i can kill this whole pack of enemies with a button and then to wow i just dealt 100 000 000 damage to a 500 hp enemy and to evolve you farm for new characters upgrades new weapons and all the cool you see other players using just playing you ll see random ass materials piling up number going up and making your brain go unga bunga then you use the unga bunga numbers to make your cool character even more on crack the gameplay is quite straight forward for the most part you load into a mission you do an objective and you extract going back to your base and reaping the rewards you got during the mission there s many types of missions you do but most of them involve killing a bunch of fodder and doing something like defending an objective collecting things hacking into some vaults sneakily without setting alarms or just going so fast it doesn t even matter lmao there s some bosses you can slay as well something important though is that warframe isn t a game to test your skill in fact i d argue that skill is barely even a factor knowledge is much much more important to becoming strong playing well isn t as big of a deal as knowing how to become broken and the more you progress the more knowledge becomes powerful if you also like trading you re in good luck warframe s premium currency platinum is tradeable which means you can experience everything platinum has to offer for entirely free in fact as soon as you hit mid game you ll much likely be farming platinum by selling items to fellow players and using that platinum to buy many things like weapon and character slots other items from other players and even cosmetics there is no premium account requirement to trade you simply have an item somebody has the platinum and everyone s happy i incentivize everyone to get rich in this game i love trading and it s really satisfying to be a part of this community oh did i mention the battle pass system is also entirely free that s a bonus point for ya in terms of content this is actually a double edged sword there is so much but so much content it can even feel humiliating as a newcomer to not know what the is going on the game is by all means overwhelming you the second you start to see just how vast it is from the different factions you level up in to the open worlds modular weapons different currencies what are archons what are arcanes is it like the regular mod upgrades what is duviri what is a gemussy amps liches sisters sanctuary steel path rivens clans the zariman all those bounties and everything this game has to offer surrounds you there is so much to learn for a newcomer it might intimidate you away my advice learn one thing at a time warframe is no race you should learn all the mechanics in your own pace conclusion if you consider playing warframe beware of what kind of game it is it isn t a game everyone would love but for the incredible cutscenes and deep lore alone i say give it a try if you re a fan of milestones if you feel hooked go ahead and interact with the community we re welcoming you with open arms it s a great game to spend your free time playing and it offers a lot of options to customize everything about your experience and yes i also mean you can customize everything you have skins colors weapons your little base your ship pets and robots even your kahl if you re a newcomer you probably don t know who he is what i m saying is warframe isn t just warfarm it is also fashionframe also don t talk about nezha in global chat lol,736.1,114.0,3,Recommended,April 1,Warframe,"Vapor Towers

43675,i first played this game back when it was on the xbox one 2013 and put in about 100 hours once my friends decided to move on i moved on as well the game was a fun way to burn some time with some friends there weren t many goals back then let alone much of a story i had some frames some weapons color palettes from holiday events never spent a dime on the game i decided to re download it early last year to my pc after getting curious as to how the game has changed and also to get some nostalgia from a game i played a lot in high school wow so much has changed i played through the new intro mission and was very surprised this game has fleshed out quests now i was super excited but the thought of grinding all over again for some frames felt daunting especially after how they changed which planets give which frame blueprints and they added so many more planets and missions compared to when i first played so i put it down and eventually uninstalled which brings us to january of this year i heard there was cross save added around the end of 2023 and decided to give it a shot when i set it up i made it so that i kept my pc accounts progress but also receiving all the items i had from xbox all i can say is wow i got what i had back and replayed the missions i was hooked this game is incredible the story the combat the world this really feels like a passion project and the art direction takes it to a new level every single item warframe and ability feel so incredibly unique in not only how they look but also how they play and are used in the game the combat is incredibly tight and responsive and that paired with the movement really makes you feel like some futuristic space ninja wizard the possibilities for builds are endless and even though the current state of the game has an end game meta everything is viable and usable the story is a slow burn and while it does take a long time to get into it is extremely worth it there were moments where i had goosebumps especially towards the end this definitely feels like some avant garde mix match of sci fi and fantasy and it blurs the lines so damn well i cannot stress that enough while the games core purpose is grinding to get upgrades new warframes weapons etc it still feels like as long as you have something building in your foundry you will always have something new to try next time you log in the micro transactions in this game there are three main ways to buy things in this game one with in game earned credits the second is a premium currency purchased with real money called platinum and the third is straight forward just buying items with money through steam almost everything can be earned in game save for most of the cosmetics but even getting the premium currency in the game is possible without spending any money there is an active trading community that uses the premium currency and it is surprisingly easy to get into there are 3rd party websites like warframe market that list buying orders and selling orders so it is easy to find someone that has what you need or needs what you have the premium currency can buy almost every item in the game using this method and can also be used to speed up the foundry when crafting an item the items that you buy straight through steam are usually user created items that warframe has for sale as cosmetics and it in part supports the creator i have spent my fair share of money on this game but the credit goes to the art department for making things look so good this game is great addictive fast fun interesting rewarding the grind won t be for everyone but every hour and future hour i have in this game is well spent 9 10,342.9,73.0,0,Recommended,June 18,Warframe,"Melancholia

43706,2021 updatethe addition of the duviri paradox to warframe is a refreshing change of pace playing as the drifter in slower paced combat is an amazing experience and the scenery is stunning there are many secrets to discover in the world and it offers a lot of replayability however the game is marketed as a roguelite and i feel that my playthroughs were unnecessarily long i focused on side quests and finding secret chests to get buffs but i could have just rushed the main objective and beaten the run in 15 to 20 minutes there is no real challenge to it unlike a true rogue like genre i have not tried steel path but the enemies just have more health overall i love the story gameplay and environment but it s just too easy the good sidebefore we start i want to say that i am very difficult when it comes to games i usually play the same games for 5 10 hours and get bored with warframe and one of my records warframe what more to say 60 000 players since the last 24 hours on the pc platform only a cross platform cross progression to be announced by q4 2022 the new wars on december 15th a release of the games on mobile warframe is very present in the f2p community it is one of the only games that allow me to get everything without spending a dime but they got me with their 75 coupon the game allows us to trade weapon and armor blueprints with other players in exchange for platinum platinum is the paid currency the purchase of platinum is therefore optional warframe has evolved well since 2013 is graphics have improved the particles and the special effects are always present to send your retina to the purgatory the company recently added directx12 and an enhanced mode in the graphics which makes a great difference in terms of graphics the music is wonderful no complaints on the other hand the sound of hearing the grineer agonizing for hours in survival mode makes my ears bleed warframe offers more than 24 game modes arena assassination assault capture defection defense disruption excavation exterminate free roam bounty plains of eidolon orb vallis cambion drift hijack infested salvage interception junction mobile defense pursuit exclusive to archwing rescue rush exclusive to archwing sabotage sanctuary onslaught skirmish exclusive to railjack spy survival volatile exclusive to railjack the bad sidewhen we start warframe the story is a bit vague it takes some time to fully understand what is going on in the system the cutscenes of the main quests will help you understand the story the difficulty is variable i had no difficulty in advancing in the game you just have to read your mods the steel path on the other hand hard mode is quite a challenge if you are not prepared in terms of game progression it is quite smooth the mastery lever rises quickly for the first 12 ranks 30 legendary in total but after it s very slow but you should not focus on it and make a fixation the weapons are long to craft waiting system going from 12h to 72h for warframe there is the possibility of moving the time forward with platinum but i don t think that is worth it for shooter looter addicts you won t regret it give warframe a chance the first moment may be confusing for my last negative point which is personal and subjective for everyone i do not like to play keyboard mouse at all warframe is a game that i play with my controller graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dos gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deaf audience kids teens adults grandma pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second live for grinding story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10,610.8,98.0,12,Recommended,"December 7, 2021",Warframe,Curry,True
43708,2016 product received for free the best f2p game i ve ever come across a fair bit buggy but that s to be expected the amount of content updates that are constantly added to the game are insane to give an example if you were to compare what warframe is now to what it was back in 2013 you d be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense there s so much to cover that i cannot fit it all into one review but let s start with the fundamentals the only other shooter i ve played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what warframe allows would be resident evil 6 this game s combat system is that deep i m not talking about things like mods or attribute values i m talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have in default mode the shooting mechanics are pretty straight forward but the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode the game reveals its mechanical complexity with melee now your primary means of attack you re able to empower attacks block parry do combos through the use of stance mods the game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of devil may cry than an traditional shooter delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash and with most stance mods having at least 5 combo chains in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated stance mods the skill ceiling is significantly increased beyond that are your movement options you can do a sliding slash both on the ground and mid air you can run on and scale hang from walls dodge in any direction and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump the basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of mods mods are items that fit into weapons and warframes alike to help improve and tailor the player s chosen combat style every item has 10 mod slots and 1 stance or aura slot each mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect it it through this system that allows warframe to appeal to virtually any type of player s preferred approach to combat customization is a large part of warframe whether aesthetic or stat wise you re even able to choose your own ship though such a choice is purely for show customize the interior of it along with your frames weapons etc better yet most warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding this however brings us to some of the cons that warframe can rely on a bit too much at times the game is very grind heavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blue print to its benefit there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them furthermore the game is exceptionally optimized and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 45 50 on a mid range computer i had an gtx 660 as reference another problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy one of the worst i ve heard of so far is the inital archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in directx 11 mode there are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game certain cosmetic items and even warframes are sometimes only purchasable with platinum which requires that players spend real money or trade sell in game items to other players for platinum if one does not wish to spend real money story wise the game explains very little to the player up front and uses codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala dark souls with multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the tenno themselves there is a lot of world building content for players to go through overall though it s an amazing and unique f2p game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon if ever 8 2 out of 10,825.1,104.0,12,Recommended,"May 4, 2016",Warframe,"Archon

43712,2017 as someone who is very asocial and not a team player i can honestly say this game kinda broke me out of that shell i m not one for online games that requires social interaction but this game becomes so addicting that it makes you wanna work with others to get sh t done though you don t necessarily have to play with other people if you don t want to but it s a lot faster trying to get things accomplished the game is very grindy rng heavy and requires a shtload of investment if you wanna make any real progress so if you have a life then avoid this game lol there s been times where other players have p ssed me off which is any online game really but i ll get to that at the bottom of this review you are a warframe aka tenno think of a space ninja lol there are enemy factions at war with each other your job is to fight them you can do spy missions defense missions defend cryostasis pod exterminate missions kill all enemies etc at the end of these missions you get rewards like blueprints to make weapons and new warframes component parts credits in game currency mods which you can equip on your weapons and warframes mods like melee damage 90 etc you can customize the colors of your weapons and warframes customize the interior of your spaceship you can have a sentinel or pet to assist you in battle just all kinds of cool stuff here and there then there s this other currency called platinum which you have to buy with real money or another way to get platinum is to farm for prime parts to sell to other players you need this if you run out of space to use weapons and warframes or if you want to buy accessories for your appearance speed up the building process of weapons warframes etc personally what i think is a pain in the az are the wait times you have to endure when building sh t oh what s that you finally got all the parts to build the warframe or weapon you ve been wanting it ll only take 3 f ckin days to build it d don t like waiting that long spend some plat to speed it up don t have plat welp guess you ll just be waiting then d or you can you know buy some plat d oh and don t forget to take your master rank test to increase your rank to use better weapons etc oh you failed welp 24 hour wai what the f ck then of course before you can even build your stuff you need the parts first which requires mindless grinding and a chunk of time and there s no guarantee you ll actually get the specific parts you want because of the rng system like for example there s prime versions of warframes and weapons you can get and in order to get them you need to get relics objects that you obtain from doing missions which hold specific prime parts within them to get the prime parts from the relics you need to do void fissure missions which is basically you fighting these holy looking azholes and getting them to drop this stuff called reactant which will crack open the relic once you have 10 reactant sounds easy but the problem is that there are 6 prime parts in the relic and the game randomly picks an item out of the relic or if you re playing with 3 other people the game will randomly pick 1 prime part from each persons relic thus making farming a bit easier so that gives you an idea of how time consuming this process can be when you re trying to farm for something specific this game is nothing but poke and hope and saying hey guys look at this stuff i have that you don t have and definitely isn t for the impatient lol that s all i ve been doing for almost 700 f ckin hours not that i m complaining but yeah this will suck the soul out of you and possibly turn you into a warframe crackhead as for the warframe community this game surprisingly has some really nice people that are willing to help you out if you re not afraid to ask and in a way i guess it makes sense considering this game literally doesn t teach you sh t doesn t handwalk you at all barely gives you any instructions as to what the f ck is going on and how to play the game i had to look up most information on the internet the warframe wiki and a bunch of youtube videos i think the developers need to step it up in that department as well as other aspects as mentioned above i m very asocial and hate people but this game kinda showed me that not everybody on the planet is a d khead with the mindset of a 12 year old one random guy saw me asking for help in the region chat decided to personally message me and spent like 400 000 credits to upgrade some mods for me and spent a bit of platinum to help me out completely shocked me i ll be honest although some of the players on here are big babies like actual manchildren no joke there are warframe players in this game with elitist mentalities that will throw fits when you don t play the game the way they want you to play the hardcore math on paper tryhards and it s quite annoying especially for someone like me it s very rare that you encounter these turds but every now and then it happens like this one time i was playing as valkyr prime a very melee heavy warframe and was doing a sortie mission called mobile defense where you have to go to a spot and kill the enemies and keep them from destroying data you re protecting i was playing with 3 other randoms and this guy was btching because i was getting most of the kills said he can t stand valkyr and told me i need to pick a better warframe lol i m sorry but last time i checked i thought it was valkyr s job to go around and tear sh t apart lol i mean honestly it s not my problem if you re slow at killing enemies but i m the one that needs to pick a better frame don t whine and b tch to me go cry to the developers and tell them to nerf valkyr if you don t like it lol on that note i think i need to take a break from this game because f ck anxiety xdi do enjoy the game though i d be lying if i said i didn t so thumbs up,716.8,128.0,22,Recommended,"March 10, 2017",Warframe,Capricorn Anomaly,False

43717,this review its from a destiny player that after years of bungie negligence decided to quit and try this wonderfull game always saw as destiny but only pve and worse oh boi how much i was wrongthe beginning one reason i started playing this game its because of gauss i saw some videos about him and i was hooked i wanted to try this warframe xd and well was more and more commong seeing my friends playing it and i was amazed by the uniques of every warframe the customization the immense variety of builds at this point i was just too curious i had to try this game my khora 3 a screenshot of warframe by shikii 400h reviewpositive notes the insane variety of warframes and the fact they are very different from each othermy top 5 gauss xaku voruna kullervo octavia bc her music weapons variety real variety not reskins like destiny even the prime versions are different especially the weapons you can make the incarnon version some locations looks amazing like the void duviri fortuna deimos ingame trading you can buy sell items for the premium currency plats so yeah you are not forced spend real money to get the premium currency just go and hustle tenno i think i made at least 3 4k plats until now builds after 400h im still getting lost to how many builds this game have pets companions i love the cat thats it steelpath it s like a ng but very hard or very easy with the right build story especially story quest like the new war that quest can solo most of destiny expansions stories i love destiny lore and some stories like forsaken but this one was so so much better felt like a movie devs not being out of touch with the game its not for granted something like this modern era of games right bungie negative notes old maps locations sucks they are so repetitive and some locations are copy and pasted from other planets some prime packs being overpriced like the new gauss one like 130 i dont have problems spending for games i like but this one is too much confusion if was not for my friends i would pass hard times before the new war the first 100 150h of this game are very confusing and its easy doing mistakes or not farming in a efficient way this game have to be more clear scammers i have to say this is not the game fault but a wanted to point to who is reading this to not get scammed by people in the ingame trading chat most of the people there are broke or want cheap items always check on the market before selling some factions being broken to farm like fortuna its misarable farming for reaching rank 4 5 crafting time like really i have to wait 3days for trying a new warframe what i am playing clash of clans conclusiona beautiful game with some flaws that you can still enjoy it and having a lot of fun especially with friends you can pick it when ever you want having fun messing around with builds and trying something new and it has a lot a lot of things to do its very hard to get bored warframe a screenshot of warframe by shikii,719.6,66.0,5,Recommended,February 9,Warframe,"Shikii

43805,2018 for those of you who played before 2016 take note since the second dream s release warframe has been extensively given a lot of love and care and is beyond a mere game s worth of content for those who are new ever wanted a free to play game that s actually not pay to win warframe s it despite looking like a pay to win at first glance warframes and weapons can be built from the blueprints in store and the blueprints you earn either in boss fights or the materials you find playing naturally in game prime warframes and weapons can be earned through void relics and easily traded for platinum the game s premium currency in an economy that easily makes it possible for completely free to play players to enjoy the game s cosmetics and easily gather the resources they need with a little effort everything takes a short amount of time to farm and a long time to cook but if you pace yourself well you can accomplish a lot within a week of playing this game once you re past the early hours this game doesn t hold your hand however expect to get confused with the modding and forma system at first but it s a satisfying learning experience reminiscent of 90s gaming where you actually put some bloody effort into your games combat is fluid free form the parkour system is genuinely fun to use and fits well with the fast paced combat of the game digital extremes who have history in aaa gaming before this the darkness 2 was a great game if not short are consistently providing their love and support into the game alongside informing the community of their future plans for the game hands down i would recommend this game i mean my friend s got 7k hours on it so clearly she must find a reason to keep playing it since launch,686.6,89.0,6,Recommended,"April 27, 2018",Warframe,"Lellodee

43842,2019 i started playing this game back in 2014 ran it on a netbook at 800x600 30fps after the tutorial i immediately quit the game and said to myself its overwhelming and i need to think about it i revisited the game anywhere 6 months later with a friend and we had an absolute blast through fighting the jackal first intro with stalker farming alad v to get valkyr and many more experiences that 2014 15 warframe had to offer i remember crafting tiered void keys and going into void survival in hopes of getting the all elusive forma which mind you we were absolutely ecstatic to even acquire back then lol and getting small little prime parts we surprisingly had no idea what to do with we struggled to try to expand the clan with every forma going into our little clan station to build an awesome setup that we would use forever then everything changed when during a uranus survival mission my good friend ran into a sentient drone scanned it as this was that whole scanning enemy phase that every player goes through where you basically spend an entire mission running around trying to collect all the scans before we knew what helios was xp and told me to scan it as well we blindly followed the natah quest and the scope of the game expanded before our very eyes we had absolutely no idea that story quest even existed let alone how to acquire it soon enough we had completed the second dream we looked on the forums to which school to pick and both went with madurai for the chest laser because back then each school had a different ascension power like thing you could activate this was before the war within update came out so thats where the story ended fast forward to today i ve cracked over 1 500 hours in warframe and more to count with empyrean coming i will most definitely still be playing for years to come as this is a game i grew up on steam with i am amazed to see how this game has expanded over the years where most games would stop updates or would move onto a second game warframe in particular has evolved and adapted every year while keeping a strong and close relationship with their community which in this day and age isn t something you see very often overall i strongly reccomend this game its addicting i had a friend say this was this generation s wow which doesn t seem too farfetched its got an in depth and complicated story spanning a massive amount of characters and interactions sub plots and smaller stories that intertwine with each other to make this huge universe its gun play movement and ability use is satisfying it blends overpowered weaponry with occasionally challenging gamemodes and a rewarding atmosphere for a farming mmo its community is wonderful and friendly theres always a few bad apples as every game has of course i can confirm this game can be confusing and overwhelming for new players but i hope those who are interested in this game will 100 give it a shot and experience a game that has been crafted with passion and memes by an amazing development team who loves to interact with their community i m excited and ready for warframe s future,128.9,73.0,1,Recommended,"August 22, 2019",Warframe,"Yahooooo

43846,2013 introwarframe is a fast paced third person shooter the developer digital extremes is the studio behind the darkness 2 and dark sector digital extremes gets involved with the community by providing regular patches video updates and participation in the forums digital extremes borrows heavily from their previous game dark sector that was developed in 2008 and scrapped on 2012 in favor of making warframe summary great atmosphere environments great weapon skills character selection great clan system dojo is impressive great developer support updates are good chunks and come often great movement opportunities running across wall is fun grind blueprints materials gameplay the gameplay is pretty solid if you are looking something flashy like devil may cry you are not going to get it here that being said the variation of weapons really make up for this the warframes themselves are great in terms of variety and design each one has stats and abilities that set them apart which results in a fresh experience every time you play with a new warframe being able to run along walls or run up them makes mobility in the game more dynamic in terms of getting from point a to point b rank systemrank system emphasis on developing experience with warframes weapons and equipment rather than getting exp in general your rank is a signature of how much firepower you have accumulated in your arsenal since rank challenges vary it will test a wide array of your skills from marksmanship mobility and combat abilities this system results in the player being more well rounded by fleshing out your skills in a multitude of areas customizationupgrading transmuting and fusion are several methods to improve your options the level of equipment acts as points for attaching mods this allows for multiple combinations of mods to get different desired advantages to fight certain factions or missions the forma is also a great way to make a weapon use less points in certain slots allowing you to develop it even further atmospherethe setting is great and in my opinion helped attract alot of people to this game the atmosphere and level designs are becoming more varied as the developers are updating the game with new environments the new environments are really fun to play in and sometimes have their own perks updatesas someone who made a long guide for this game i can say that their updates are so solid i feel my guide gets outdated every month and requires me to go back and make it relevant this is most apparent in their ui changes they have made which made my videos a bit weird to see for the newer players clanthe dojo is one of the nicest additions i have seen yet not only does it offer a nice place for members to go to but in a sense its structure is an achievement of everyone who has helped contribute to it the dojo offers a wide variety of nice side things like being able to do pvp and being able to craft new weapons that are only available through research pay to win if you are worried about this game being pay to win rest assured that s not how it is the only real benefit to paying besides cosmetics is being able to get slots you can put time in and get the same results you just can t have many warframes weapons at once they also designed it in a way that is hybrid in some areas for example in foundry you will be able to pay money to speed up the process so instead of buying the weapon you can collect the resources craft the item in foundry and then pay to speed up the process so you don t have to wait grinding yes there is grinding when you are looking for specific warframes and materials generally you will grind in the places where you reap the most benefits and try to get the pay off aka the warframe as soon as possible the grinding got a bit worse in a way when they introduced more materials which made the chances lower of getting blueprints this is setoff a bit by the fact that they introduced alot more environment maps which increase its replayability so if you do not mind grinding buy slots to make more warframes if you like the game enough conclusionoverall warframe is a classic example of how free to play games can be great and interesting and still give developers plenty of profits without turning it into a pay to win game if you are looking for an interesting game just give it a try i am sure it won t disappoint,699.5,530.0,0,Recommended,"November 26, 2013",Warframe,"Falem

43893,2021 755 hours in and i love this game the gameplay is top tier and after you get through the difficulty of learning the in game systems it has so much depth and allows for so much creativity however i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to potential new players the on boarding experience while improved over the years is still pretty bad they teach you the gameplay well enough but then throw you into a frankenstein s monster of systems that they did not put nearly enough effort into explaining there are also so many vestigial systems as a new player you might find yourself pouring in time to understand one of these bastardized systems to only to find out that it s out dated and been unsupported for years looking at you archwings among other things they really could stand to invest some time and money into improving the onboarding experience for new players clean up remove unused systems optimize the current ones and create worthwhile tutorials for them new content is great for us who have played for hundreds of hours but i feel like they would do themselves more good if they spent some extra time and money on the early game there is a reason only 40 of players have gotten to the 2 hour mark of this game and this is the biggest reason why i wish this was a game i could recommend to not only others on steam but to my friend group as it stands now i cannot,905.8,199.0,8,Not Recommended,"December 21, 2021",Warframe,Celosia,False

43907,2017 warframe is a fantastic example of a game fully supported by the devs for a long long time i first tried it back when it came out and didn t really like it so i reinstalled it several years later after the plane of eidolon update and boy was it a pleasantly different experience there s so many things to do it s mind boggling and it will take some faq and tip list reading as well as playing for a while until it all clicks and you understand what it s all about and it s about magical tech space ninja in the far future there s story and quests and the ability to replay completed missions for more experience and loot and it s all for free there is a premium currency but you can easily trade stuff easily obtainable stuff with other players for that you can play solo or with up to three friends or go public matchmaking there s also pvp if that s your thing although the game is 99 pve the community is also the most positive bunch of people i ve ever seen it s really hard to believe for someone coming from dota and overwatch also the game looks fantastic the visual style is well defined and i really like it i guess it s to be expected from the developers who made my favorite unreal tournament i fully recommend this game give it a try it costs nothing,810.1,74.0,3,Recommended,"December 24, 2017",Warframe,Mrmo,True

43925,2019 this game broke my heart but i m still going to give it a thumbs up because it does deserve a chance there is nothing fundamentally broken about this game and it can be a blast to play however be warned that in the end it is not what it seemed to be when you started playing there are great reviews from people way more skilled and knowledgeable than me so i m not going to cover the basics as they have been already explained way better in said other reviews instead i ll talk a bit about why i have stopped playing this game 1 this game does not understand fun grinding i know that this matter is highly subjective but i still think that the system warframe chose to apply is the biggest chore possible instead of grinding for materials or loot with the weapons and frames you like you grind the same stuff with equipment you despise again and again this is because you have to do so to increase your mastery level to obtain more gear you cannot get more mastery level with gear that you have leveled up already in other words with gear that you obviously like to use and it takes forever to level that gear up unless you go for the most efficient way possible and grind one boring level over and over and over again and it still takes hours to get one horrible weapon or frame to level 30 i stopped playing when i noticed that i had spent more time playing with frames and weapons that i hate rather than the ones i enjoyed to play with 2 you need to be in a clan guild to access half of the equipment in this game i d like to join a clan i have made friends with or a clan that i know people from maybe even create my own clan but you cannot do anything in this game without a clan not even trade you have to join a clan immediately you end up joining a massive clan and never play with the members because they already have their farming times and buddies or a dying clan that suddenly vanishes without a trace and you need to find another one repeat over and over again 3 i don t like how the story turned out i have played this game since 2013 and it has gone through some major changes during this time most of them were great and added a lot to the game but the story destroyed the world of warframe in my opinion it is not really that great even though it has been praised by many at least in my opinion maybe i just had hoped for more the story is not completely flawed by any means but i remember the times when this game was a mystery when the level design and the frames told a story when i looked out to the space and stayed there for 15 minutes wondering where i was when me and my friends spent 3 hours in a single orokin void mission just admiring the architecture trying to figure out what happened why were there puzzle rooms who made them what were the capsules filled with odd substance or negative looking space why was all this abandoned it truly was a blast and it evoked the feeling that i often look for in games the one you feel when you find something really surreal and for a moment question everything this game was the perfect environment for your own story and i think it really suited this game a boring loot shooter does not need a boring story at least let me have some freedom this review really ended up longer than i was hoping for if you made it here thanks for reading and if you haven t tried the game go for it you might like it,819.4,117.0,10,Recommended,"March 30, 2019",Warframe,"Turvemuumio

43927,2016 warframe is a amazing mastery based multiplayer game you can choose from hundreds of weapons and 29 warframes the good part is that you can mod those however you like you can choose from thousands of different mods the game has some grinding elements but the developers are trying to get away from grinding in the future new stuff is added everytime de updates the game regularly with more stuff for you to collect and balances to weapons and warframes you can play with up to 3 friends and there are a lot of gamemodes so you won t get bored if you don t have friends don t worry there is a good matchmaking system that will find you a party to play with you also have a campaign and a lot of bosses to beat don t get scared by the premium currency the game is tottaly not pay2win a paying user has nothing over you you can get anything without money as a player with 300 hours i never added money in to the game and i managed to get all the prime warframes and 1500 platinum cash just from trading go ahead and install the game i am sure you will like it get a friend or two to play with you start your space ninja adventure today good luck,414.6,60.0,4,Recommended,"June 26, 2016",Warframe,"MorpHeer

43938,warframe is a wonderful game that i didn t understand at first no i liked the campaign the plot and some of the character s abilities but at that time i still didn t understand how i could collect new warframes weapons and companions back then i just ran after meg with a bow and spear for a few months alone after such a long time i began to get bored with the game and i deleted it but it was only a break a year later when i saw the trailer for the new update i wanted to try playing again i ran after meg again but suddenly discovered for myself the inscriptions that always seemed to be there but i did not pay attention one of these inscriptions was about the single player game mode and then i decided to see what else there were and then i chose the online mode went on a mission and found that three players had joined me i usually went through the missions slowly for about 15 30 minutes but these players broke through to the finish line with great speed almost without noticing the enemies demolishing everything in their path this was a turning point because i was wondering how they do it so quickly where do they get so many powerful and different weapons from i started looking through the store on the ship the workbench and found that it was possible to get warframes and weapons without resorting to donating but buying blueprints for credits game currency and collecting materials in missions to collect the necessary when i made my first oberon warframe i immediately felt that there was much more interesting in the game than i thought i started collecting a lot of guns completing missions that i had previously considered incredibly difficult delved into the card upgrade system and even started participating in events it s a worthwhile game,625.0,49.0,0,Recommended,May 7,Warframe,"!! teRanJOo ⁧⁧ᵛᵃˡᵛᵉ

43942,2017 warframe has come a long way from when i first started playing but i can honestly say the majority of it was great let me start by describing what warframe is its an over the shoulder third person shooter where you play the role of a ninja warrior in space the solar system is in chaos and it s up to you to maintain the balance with many weapon types to choose from and different frames to use to suit your playstyle the possibilities are endless however there are certain strategies in higher level missions that even veteran players will tell you work it s pretty much an mmo at this point so certain classes of warframes work better at farming resources on certain missions the developers also release new content as operations to introduce the new features for example the newest addition was corpus dropships that drop squads of enemies into battle it was introduced as operation ambulas reborn which featured a reworked boss that dropped in from the ship with a squad of regular enemies there were a few bugs at first but the incredibly awesome support team was very quick to respond to reports and get back within 24 48 hours all in all this has become one of the best free to play games i have ever played and the graphics do an excellent job of immersing you in a living breathing world that is constantly changing i have to say that there are certain aspects of the game which require you to pay for features such as certain weapons cosmetic packs etc other than that if you work hard and spend a decent amount of time on it everything important is attainable without paying money for it i do encourage you to support the developers by buying things that you may like but only at your own discretion speaking of which there is also a thriving market for the ingame currency platinum where you can spend platinum to buy parts weapon mods and other hard to obtain aspects from other players as well as selling your own parts and mods to other players to obtain platinum the prices will indeed vary on the rarity of what you are trying to get but there is also sites and a wiki for any questions you may have about said things all in all i have had a great experience with this game rather than reading my long winded review about the game why not try it yourself it s free also feel free to add me ingame and i will do my best to be as helpful as possible my name is mix masterson see you on the battlefield and have fun,889.5,50.0,2,Recommended,"May 12, 2017",Warframe,"Captain Masterson

43959,2016 i made a review back in 2016 it s 2019 and i m back in the game with a better review tl dr at the bottom main features at the bottom before tl drpros 1 everything is obtainable if you play the game with the exception of the founders pack some of it is definitely grindier than others but you re able to obtain every single thing in the game without paying anything that is of course whether you re willing to invest a buttload of time into the game 2 fantastic graphics on low end pcsi ve had to use a laptop for majority of my gaming and warframe is definitely up there in optimization my potato laptop is able to load in fortuna and cetus open world content albeit slightly longer load times i run the game on the lowest graphical settings and it still looks like high quality graphics from a aaa game from 2012 ish 3 gameplay with the added open world content the gameplay has gotten even better archwing combat is actually viable now killing eidolons and profit takers without any guides are by far one of the most fun things i ve done in my entire life of playing video games the gameplay remains fast paced engaging and hardly gets dull 4 the dev team the dev team is by far one of the most dedicated teams out there bugfixes occur within a day of an exploit or bug being found this is nothing like ubisoft s r6 which i absolutely love dev team where it literally takes months for bugs to be fixed months even with the player community constantly updating reddit withh footage of the bugs and yet de manages to fix things within a day in a free to play game the dev team is awesome and they listen to the community majority of the times 5 community is so disgustingly nice it reminds me of the people from the good place veteran players are all copies of good janet and literally help newbies when they re bored in my 3 ish years of playing the game on and off i ve only encountered one player and even then it was mainly because he misunderstood things my in game warframe playtime has touched 1000 hours i think an encounter rate of 1 per 1000 hour is insanely good lol 6 the game now provides some guidance and direction 3 years ago it felt more like a diablo game collect stuff and make the best build to one shot everything now planet junctions along with a huge number of storyline quests to do provide the game a direction for new players to work towards these quests and junctions allow new players to unlock warframes and weapons progressively through increasing difficulty it s easier to play the game now without having to refer to the wiki every 5mins cons 1 still a pretty bad tutorial tutorial remains pretty unchanged since 2016 covers basic gameplay with maneouvers just the tip of the iceberg however the community has somehow become even better and more friendly since then a friend of mine who ve just started was shown the ropes by random players who he met during public missions though you ll probably have to google a few guides it does help that warframe has grown in popularity on youtube and plenty of youtubers like iflynn make introductory videos and how to s explaining many of the in game mechanics in detail 2 pay 4 convenience this remains unchanged you pay to skip ahead anyone who grinds will attain the same content as someone who has paid a large chunk of the content is only obtainable by playing the game 3 limited areas to play in still it wasn t open world when i first wrote this review they ve begun implementing open world content which i have spent hours upon hours on and they re planning on making even more which is insane however the open world content are still separate instances with a maximum of 4 players in each instance i feel like it would ve been great if the 4 player limit per instance for open world content were removed because it s so vast yet feels empty with a full squad at times 4 it s not as easy to get burnt out 3 years later and you ll get burnt out when you first start i recently got 3 friends to try out warframe whilst they weren t getting burnt out due to the addition of planet junctions they took frequent breaks due to crafting times a sizeable chunk of the early game content got them leaving the game to play something else because majority of it doesn t get looked at early defense missions can take over 10 15mins for just 5 waves because of the tileset and buggy ai easy missions turn tideous because the dev team doesn t really look into this 5 the lore is a jigsaw puzzleas someone who loves digging into the lore i spent years learning about warcraft lore warframe is one of those games where i can never bring myself to learn about the lore because of it s all over the place the quests provide information about the lore but it s poorly developed on not recommended for those who play games for the story features new updates all the time now with fortuna and cetus as open world content a lot of warframes which act as classes extremely flexible detailed mechanics modding damage 2 0 large amount of viable weapons majority are extremely different from each all are able to be molded to endgame though not practical at times fantastic graphics incredibly optimized expect smooth framerates throughout plenty of customization and cosmetics you will rarely find another person that looks exactly like you limited areas to play in repetitive very limited number of mission types pvp is pointless you don t get much other than cosmetics ridiculously grindy at times limited trades each day tallies with your mastery rank which you can increase by leveling items limited inventory appears as a cash grab quite early on but you can earn platinum through trading tldr it s free and not pay to win runs on potato pcs you can obtain everything if you spend time and effort play if you like loot based games play if you love insane mobility and gunplay buttload of content which would take at least 400 600hrs to cover everything even with guides grindy with stupid unnecessary daily limitations and caps community is awesome devs are awesome with constant updates and hotfixes,872.7,46.0,8,Recommended,"April 9,

43977,warframe where being a space ninja isn t just a job it s a lifestyle dive into this game and you ll find yourself wall running like a caffeinated squirrel shooting enemies with weapons that look like they belong in a sci fi fever dream and customizing your warframe so much you ll forget what your actual warframe looks like the only thing faster than your warframe s maneuvers is the speed at which updates drop ensuring you ll never run out of new stuff to confuse your friends with just when you think you ve mastered it all a new expansion drops reminding you that in warframe the only constant is chaos and that s why we love it rating 9 10 for sheer ninja absurdity,613.1,64.0,6,Recommended,July 4,Warframe,Omen,True
43979,2018 i don t know what i expected from this game when i got into it this year but it definitely exceeded my expectations i ll be honest what got me into it was fashion frames nice graphics basically everything visual but i got so much more i ll start with cons because compared to pros i find them to be much fewer imo warframe is not a noob friendly game the content is huge and it is so easy to get lost in it there are no guides or any instructions in the game that tell you what you need or how to get it if there are any it s a little bit confusing other con is that game is quite repetitive and might become boring fast i ll talk about this issue in pros now let s hop on to the pros as i have already mentioned visuals in this game are fantastic views from different missions landing craft and overall atmosphere in warframe is just beyond captivating with soundtracks topping the cake gameplay is fun and satisfying sometimes challenging but not impossible grind is addicting once you discover how to farm certain parts which i didn t know in the beginning you are in a loop of never ending farming and it is entertaining as well as rewarding basically the more time you spend in warframe the more rewarding items frames you get when i started warframe i had not even a slightest idea that it had story i thought it was just an online game and that s it oh boy oh boy and what i got was the second dream for those who don t know it s a quest and it blew my mind speaking of content in the game and issue i have mentioned earlier there are different kinds of missions the types that change from time to time missions that are always available quests missions with story and open world zone if you play this game regularly you will find yourself doing same everyday and this is what might turn you off but don t let that change your mind developers constantly offer players new content another huge plus i find in this game is its audience mature and quite friendly of course there are always kids trolls on the internet but they are minority in warframe and finally the game is absolutely free you can acquire everything if you put enough time into it,872.7,48.0,1,Recommended,"August 10, 2018",Warframe,Necoco,False

44027,2022 warframe is a very popular game everyone knows about her but not everyone likes her in my opinion this is one of the best games of its genre and now i will try to explain to you why in this review we will analyze whether warframe is worth playing in 2021 pros of the gameoptimization yes i would like to say exactly this for all its beauty and the game looks really high quality it is absolutely not demanding on the hardware of your pc even if you have a laptop that overheats when you launch the browser the game will run stably on it so there definitely will not be required new video cards 16 gigabytes of ram and other things therefore if you have a weak computer then there is nothing to be afraid of content there is a lot of content here i won t even try to list everything for you for a clear example i ll say that i ve been playing warframe since 2013 when it was still in beta test then at one time i didn t think about this game for 3 4 years and went in just a few months ago so i was just taken aback by how much new things have been added here for you to understand it s been a few months now and i still have to google a lot of new things and i m still far from understanding everything it is also worth mentioning the frequency of these updates according to the statistics that i found major updates come out somewhere every 1 2 months and these are not just ordinary events with the chinese new year and other things these are full fledged updates with new characters weapons bosses quests locations and so on cooperativethe game is still geared towards team play together it will be much easier for you to farm complete difficult missions go to some raid events and so on you can do it solo but it s very difficult but solo players shouldn t despair well except for the lack of friends in short you can do it alone here it just won t be so fast well in the end no one bothers you to play with random people or join a clan like in the good old mmos for example i lost most of the time just by myself and have absolutely no regrets it helps to understand the game plot i m still surprised by this but the story in warframe is better than in many single player rpgs which is very unusual for games of this format there are a bunch of full fledged quests in several stages yes there are stupid quests where frankly it doesn t matter what is happening but there are also those that i went through as if i were watching a movie it reveals your race origin and so on sometimes of course they overdo it but in general it is interesting consfarmin the game you need to farm and you need to farm a lot plus there are such unpleasant moments as the time of manufacture for example if you are crafting a new character or weapon then you have to wait 72 or 24 hours which is just a very long time for donate of course you can speed up but it s very expensive if you are used to playing non stop then you will be uncomfortable with this waiting and here you can look at it from the other side for example now i don t have the opportunity to enter the game so often so for me it has turned from wild farming into a pleasant not so frequent practice i go in all the trunks and characters are ready i do not accelerate anything and absolutely do not suffer from it in short here you can either run into the farm play every day set goals for yourself pump like crazy and slowly play for your own pleasure absolutely not straining very high entry thresholdwarframe is one of those games where you can t jump right into the action and get tangible results quickly there are a lot of quests missions and conditions here due to which you cannot access something far away until you complete the already open quests but in fact it s not as scary as it sounds because as you progress through the game you gradually understand the game and now the most important thing get ready that for tangible results and not just a game for fun you will need to set yourself clear goals and search for information in huge quantities but there are also positive aspects the game has been around for 8 years and during this time it has acquired a huge knowledge base forums and guides therefore it will not be difficult to find something at all donate there is a donate you can buy a lot for it and it is sometimes imposed but not much the funny thing is that for a donation you can buy resources ready made characters or weapons that do not need to be crafted for several days well the most problematic thing to make a character you need to knock out its parts and drawing sometimes this is easy enough to do and sometimes you may not get what you need for weeks on end that s when you have to resort to donations but here too there are advantages firstly when you enter the game you can often get a discount of as much as 75 on donations it s a lot really secondly the game has the ability to trade you can trade almost everything with a few exceptions and when you play enough time you will have a lot of valuable blueprints and other things then you can easily sell it all in exchange for local currencies in the future you can provide be yourself with this without pouring money into the game at all but not immediately of course conclusions warframe is a beautiful interesting and optimized game with a huge amount of content and update frequency but with all this it has its own characteristics of farming and the amount of information because of which many people leave it without trying to figure it out so is it worth playing in 2022 personally i recommend at least trying it because in any case you can not get carried away but play for fun,490.3,72.0,5,Recommended,"January 28, 2022",Warframe,"MILF

44072,2019 after playing it for 92 days on xbox and now 300 some odd here on steam i gotta say warframe is a pretty good game could it be better yes but you can say that about any game in the world now that doesn t mean i don t think warframe needs imporvements like the constant content drought that happens with the game or the fact that many updates and new additions to the game are more so tailored to new players rather than adding true end game content that the veterans that have been playing for thousands and thousands of hours desperately need rather than having to go in and see how long they can make it in a survival because they have simply ran out of things to grind for at a certain point but even still i always find myself returning to warframe as a person who normally doesnt enjoy the full hard grind mmo action style games because at a certain point i get bored of the repetitive nature of them and want to move onto something else but warframe has and continues to be a game that breaks that trend for me as i started playing back in 2014 after a friend who played the game on pc told me about it and i figured i d give it a shot and from there the game had managed to hook me with its flowing movement system diverse roster or frames and weapons that you can play with and the overall level of freedom and power the game lets you feel and while you can feel the grind while you are working towards increasing your mastery rank or trying to farm out that last 1000 plastids to get a new weapon it still feels satisfying to do so simply because even though the mission type are generally quite similar the weapons and combat of the game are just fun to play with whether you run around with a big ass sword and cut down people from the waist or you use a weapon with the dreaded self damage just so you can see your enemies get blown sky high or you use a punch through tonkor because you want to use an explosive weapon but you don t want to actually use an explosive weapon its all fun to just around with and see what you can get up to trying out different builds and all of this just cumulates into an experience that is fun to play and refreshing from the normal monotony that is most grinding mmos also de themselves as a company is fantastic providing feedback to their community constantly keeping in touch with us and making sure we know what they are getting up to trying their best to keep us happy so overall i would say its definetly a game to check out and learn more about because it appeals to those that enjoy grind games and those that don t,655.4,46.0,5,Recommended,"September 13, 2019",Warframe,"Banadian Boose

44083,2020 fun game to get into with a lot to do the new player experience is terrible though so get used to reading the wiki and viewing tutorials in order to really like the game you need to be able to set goals for yourself because the game never explicitly tells you what you can or should do next my recommendation is to just complete as many missions in the star chart as you can and enjoy the story quests that begin to pop up on the later planets the second dream and the war within are probably the two best pieces of content the game has to offer in terms of story and cinematic experiences as for other content plains of eidolon and fortuna are awesome as well i still have yet to kill or capture an eidolon and have no clue about anything regarding the orb mothers it may appear to be pay to win at first but it s really not as you can earn everything in game via trading and grinding and the things you can purchase really don t have much of an effect on the way the game is played since you still have to level them up and mod them to be able to play higher end content in short it s free to play if you re interested give it a try it s not for everyone but i d always recommend trying it who knows you might like it,550.0,35.0,1,Recommended,"May 16, 2020",Warframe,DikerdodlePlays,False

44107,2017 at first you think this game is epic and cool all the exotic features like archwing parkour and different weapons and warframes are just so good then you start to become better at the game and explore all the features like raids fissure runs and sorties suddenly a mastery rank 23 comes and join your game mr 23 is max level currently you see him with a prime waframe prime weapons an elite kavat pet and extremely good looking cosmetics you make it your life goal to become just like the player you grind for those prime stuff by repeatedly playing missions that drop relics which can be opened to unlock primed parts here is when rng comes and gives you terminal cancer 1 your chances of getting that exact relic that you want usually isnt too high making you repeat the mission a couple of times before you get 1 2 relics drop 5 prime parts and usually you try to go for the rarest part it will take a couple relic runs to drop the rarest part with the rng now that you have grinded for those parts you can now finally build your cool akbronco prime but wait there s more you realize your akbronco prime sucks and you need to buff it with mods you can equip mods on to your weapon and boost its power significantly mods drain slots and have polarities matching polarities will reduce the drain allowing you to put more mods on the weapon now there is this wonderful thing called forma which lets you alter the polarity to reduce drain but how do you use it simple you level your weapon to the max 30 which would take around 1 2 hours then forma it and reset it to level 0 again now do this a couple times for all the weapons and warframes you have assuming you are slow like me and take 2 hours to max a weapon and you forma each one 3 times and you have 15 weapons to forma 2x3 66x15 90there goes 90 hours of my life but wait there is like over 100 weapons in the game maybe even 200 what about the warframes which take twice as long to level and needs like 5 formas what about the grind for the 50 relics that you opened just to get a trinity prime chassis trash what about selling your good prime parts to get platinum and buy cosmetics if you read this far you could ve already went to akkad and leveled your hydroid so i am proud to say that i ve wasted hours on a game and i am still not even half way to being good if you want to be good at the game you gotta have like 2k hours but hey at least it looks cool right i thinkcondensed review mad grind looks cool give it a try cool co op experience,400.9,45.0,19,Recommended,"July 20, 2017",Warframe,Lightmaster8,False

44115,2017 with nearly a quarter of a million reviews at the time of posting it s hard to say anything about warframe that hasn t already been said warframe is frightfully addictive and once you get over the initial wall of what the hell is going on it can be very hard to put it back down so many of the negative reviews on steam consist of the game has changed or it ruined my life and when you ve sunk so many hundreds of hours into a game i find it somewhat insulting that some people still choose to leave negative reviews on a free game that s not to say warframe is faultless but after earning hundreds of hours of your time it feels like you must ve enjoyed the game at some point warframe is a third person hacky slashy shooter set in space with robot like ninjas that sentence is about as awesome as playing the game and the combat is incredibly satisfyting once you get the hang of it and a few decent weapons many of the characters feel unique albeit with some redundant characters frames cluttering up what could be and still is mostly an impressively diverse roster the same applies to weaponry too missions go through small instances in teams of 1 4 to complete certain objectives whether it be rescuing a target eliminating hostiles or defending a point all missions are somewhat procedurally generated bar the story missions by somewhat i mean you ll start to recognise each room a ton but they can pop up in any order and multiple times i can practically recall every room you can find on pluto excavation hierarchon since that particular mission has taken more hours from me than some entire games have but i digress warframe is enjoyable on three conditions excercise some self control those without willpower may find themselves completely sucked into the world of warframe wallets may empty and lives may crumble it harkens back to the days of everquest and the whole whoops i was mid raid and forgot to feed my baby so self control guys set your own goals those who need a game to tell them exactly what to do will struggle with warframe besides a few story missions that will take a few hours getting strong enough to take them on will require hours of working on building your arsenal through modding your frames and weapons or acquiring new ones this takes time and without a sense of direction i can see players simply going through missions one by one and getting frustrated by difficulty or repetition quickly chill out pick a gun bow sword or whatever and just work towards it it s a slow but rewarding process bring or find some friends warframe can be a lonely place even in groups if you have no one to talk to in a one hour defence mission having some people to laugh with work with and rage with against lech kril why is his hit box for his thing so tiny aaaah will help immensely this game is full of potential a way to earn the supposedly p2w currency through trading bosses raids pets secret powers this game has it all as long as you love doing sweet flips off walls shooting guys in mid air and can keep yourself from going mad this game is potentially timesink gold for anyone looking for a new game to keep themselves occupied warframe is great it s eaten more hours than any game i ve ever played on steam and i can forsee it taking more as they continue to update this already vast game it s worth your time to at least give it a few hours it s free after all so why not,861.5,33.0,3,Recommended,"April 5, 2017",Warframe,"Bracko

44149,2019 nolite te bastardes carborundorum3 5 5 my feelings about warframe are decidedly ambivalent on the one hand it can be a lot of fun on the other it can be a soul crushing grindfest how you react to this will depend entirely on how much you can tolerate the endless mission replays needed in order to get the relics drops you require in order to build that next weapon or frame and what for just so you can rinse and repeat but as i ve already said it can be a lot of fun at least for the first few hundred hours i loved it for 350 hours but now i find myself increasingly disinclined to play it although i expect i ll dip my toe in from time to time but what about the game itself well in general i m not a huge fan of the f2p model there are one or two notable exceptions usually the developers struggle to make it work but warframe is probably as good an example of this type of game as you re likely to find these days in many respects de have got it right it is possible to play completely for free although i would encourage players to buy some platinum i have as de deserves to make a buck or two for all their hard work playing for free can put you at a slight disadvantage but only when playing with players who ve bought higher level weapons and frames success lies more in the mods you have available and how you use them than in anything else personally i ve only used my platinum to buy additional inventory slots as a large part of warframe is the farming for and building of new gear and here s where the grind comes in it goes on and on and on and as i ve said it can be both tedious and frustrating warframe is also the most complicated game i ve ever played mainly i suspect due to its having been developed and modified over such a long period be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to fathom out what the hell you re supposed to do and then there s the gameplay itself this is where warframe scores most highly the movement and combat mechanics are excellent every weapon and there are so many of them has a unique feel lots of them are just levelling up fodder but they re all fun to use the same applies to the frames of which there are approximately 60 at time of writing of course there are keepers in amongst the chaff and these weapons and frames bring the most enjoyment the parkour style movement is well implemented and very satisfying once you get the hang of it the mission types are limited but the main story line does offer some relief from the routine and is deeper and more fleshed out than the stories found in many aaa paid for games the community is good for the most part a git gud attitude does exist to some extent but it s not prevalent all in all warframe is an impressive achievement it s a well designed game with lots of content and it offers a good deal of enjoyment it s just a shame that it s marred by the dispiriting grind recommended with the above qualifications i thank you,351.3,33.0,2,Recommended,"August 21, 2019",Warframe,"RunOrShoot?

44178,2020 so there are people who played thousands of hours and now write negative reviews because there is not enough game or because the game is bad funny why did you play all this time if you didn t have fun if i would stop right now with 105 hours at the moment and not even near any kind endgame i would be completely happy with my playtime and all the fun i got from the game and it is even free with a fair monetization not pay to win youtube video fired for a retweet warframe cuts sponsorship for creator over political disagreement views 70 434 brands are only loyal to people who apparently agree with them politically too now it s not enough to shill their product you must be their political tool support the channel directly the devs try to listen to the community and communicate fairly openly about their plans it is a small developer and there are always bugs and some missteps but they always try to improve the game experience the game has even its own yearly convention and it has an unusually friendly community which is always willing to help new players this is needed since the game doesn t do a good job explaining all the different game systems so expect to read wiki articles watch youtube guides or ask questions if you want to dive into the min maxing game warframe is a 3rd person science fiction loot shooter with unsual setting ninjas in space and very unique atmosphere has its own distinctive art style and lots of interesting lore to uncover there are story quests and some of them are surprisingly good and there are lots of warframes weapons mods and builds to level and experiment with youtube video views 0 since it has years of content updates there is lots to do including randomly generated levels space combat open world areas clans housing pets vehicles and more it is most fun as coop experience but can also be played solo just don t expect pvp there are pvp modes in theory but nobody plays them lots of mission types but of course in the end everything boils down to grinding for ressources mods or blueprints to craft more stuff to grind more doing the same stuff over and over again if you don t like grind this is not for you graphics are good especially for a game released in 2013 texture resolution could be better but art style and lighting make it a very nice looking game and it has great music of course there could always be more variation in environments but what is here is more than you would expect especially later planets look faboulos warframe a screenshot of warframe by guthwulf the highlight is the gameplay itself it has a parcour system with very fluid and free movement the warframes and weapons all feel unique and the weapon handling is great combat feels responsive and satisfying there is also a big emphasis on melee combat simple hack slash besides shooting guns and using the special abilities of your warframes difficulty is low for most content you don t need the perfect build to get through the main content but there is a great flow to the gameplay so it still feels good personally i prefer warframe over games like destiny or borderlands the same way i prefer path of exile over diablo all in all give it a try it is free after all and has a great active community so you will always find people to play together with or get help if needed,141.2,107.0,15,Recommended,"March 6, 2020",Warframe,Guthwulf,False
44179,2019 now i know what y all are thinkin why is this dude giving wf a negative review despite it s pretty awesome gameplay and good replayability well i can say wf is a good game it s really good and i do recommend it above all else but this is to be a wake up call and a reminder to be cautious about sinking anything into this gamei spent a good maybe 100 atleast and logged 243 hours into this game enjoying all of what it had to offer to me and one day i can t logon amidst a growing problem i read negative plat balance so i think weird so i open up a support ticket asking what was going on and maybe see what i had done wrong but a day later i realize what s up and add a comment onto my ticket stating that i knew what was going on and stated that it was being taken care of by the bank i wait 8 or so weeks and see what they d say now keep in mind they technically can t take back content that s used within the game atleast from my understanding so i m left with a 4084 plat balance which was accumulated by me purchasing the previous prime access chroma and some other platinum bundles for more stuff within wf so fast forward over to late january i get an email saying my tickets been responded to i check it out i get the zendeskbot telling me the same crap i was told when i looked this problem up to investigate further about what it meant and afterwards my ticket was closed and i just resigned myself from wf my acc forever locked because 4084 plat translated over to real world currency is just 100 usd for me to spend in order to get back in now the takeaway warframe isn t a bad game by any means it has its own lovely community a tight knit thing of systems and mechanics etc etc but the only bad i got with it is the customer support there have been some reviews complaining about it and it hasn t been solved from what i ve heard so until this get s fixed i have to leave this here so de can open their eyes and get better at supporting a larger audience who may run into troubles like these edit as of a few days ago i ve casted off my 4084 debt and am playing warframe again but this will not change my review one bit my point still stands and i hope they look back on it and dozens of other reviews like this and fix their support,315.5,360.0,74,Not Recommended,"February 10, 2019",Warframe,"*screams in gay*

44213,2016 edit this review is a bit outdated but the situation is pretty much the same if not worse game might seem fun in the beginning but i would not recommend trying it as it quickly turns into horrible grind where you have to pay if you don t want to play hundreds of hours of the same missions to see if you are lucky and if you are go grind for resources now which also in many cases takes quite a bit of time and after that wait several days until the item is built but then at some point you are either burnt or unlucky and you just pay as you get what you are looking for instantly and already built with each update devs look for new ways to make you do that while saying yeah we want to decrease the grind sure original review here i guess it was fun while it lasted it s hard for me to write this after so long to begin with the game has great community and still has a lot of potential if many core issues are fixed we started playing warframe with my friends when it was not on steam yet like almost 4 years ago none of them play it anymore just because of glaring issues that you begin to see after some time developers are focusing mostly on new content no matter what game design issues that were in the game from the beginning are simply ignored or a band aid fix is released which doesn t adress the issue itself broken enemy armor and health scaling useless weapons and warframes aka mastery fodder energy management is non existant most warframe abilities either useless and nobody ever uses them or op due to superb cc capability or straight invulnerability etc and at some point get nerfed without buffing other abilities to compensate and so on every once in a while devs introduce a new system just to forget it for next year or two two three weeks after it s been released and almost nobody uses it and there s a plenty of such cases archwing dark sectors conclave kubrows syndicates maroo s bazaar focus seems like similar destiny awaits recently introduced lunaro grind oh god grind increases exponentially with each new update i feel really bad for newer players devs tell they want to change the situation where old time players have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on and how they fix it they release a weapon with crafting requirement of 30000 for a not so common resource called cryotic to explain you can get like 100 cryotic in 2 3 minutes maximum if you re good at only type of missions where you can get it excavation there you have to defend excavator for 2 min which can be simply one shot by high level enemy there s enemy damage scaling issues too yup not to say the weapon itself is again a useless one after community uproar passed and people seemingly forgot about this issue devs release new primed warframe with requirements for similar kind of resource oxium of 14000 by similar i mean the way to obtain it you have to play specific missions to get it and amount is like 10 per specific enemy at best and there are not too many of those enemies after another community uproar it was changed to 7000 which is still a huge amount for many people and more so for newer players also void a place where primed glorified versions of warframes and weapons drop there were already many prime warframes released and some of them have already been vaulted taken out of drop tables the official reason for that is there isn t too much space in void mission for many primed warframes and weapons and not to create dilution in drop tables some primes were vaulted but from dev team s actions you can guess the real reason is different there are several mission types in the void that have little to no prime part rewards and devs keep adding useless resources to the drop tables where they simply were not present several updates ago thus intentionally diluting void mission rewards also devs tend to put most desirable primed parts into most boring and long 20 min missions in the void and the chance for this part is like 5 or so and guess what it s 5 for one of 5 different parts making it 1 if you re lucky for the exact part you want i guess it s okay that people don t want to waste 2000 minutes of their time to have a chance to get the part they need not to go too much into details i d say void missions are not the only missions that have this problem recently there was an update addressing most of op warframe abilities and that seems to be causing another community uproar now as broken enemy mechanics are not fixed and most of the time those op abilities were used to work around those broken enemy mechanics i m not sure how high level missions sorties or raids aka trials will look like after this update as in some cases there will be no counteraction to nearly instakill damage any more especially when you barely scratch the enemy s health lvl 100 enemies endgame here is like it s either you relying on those op abilities to keep you alive or you get one two shot the moment you fail to do so tl dr devs produce more and more content and bugs and broken mechanics too and seems like they forget of even 2 3 month old content ever incresing grind with latest updates exponentially warframe abilities nerfs without fixing core enemy problems that were causing players to rely on these op abilities many initial game design flaws that most likely never will be adressed,758.8,380.0,25,Not Recommended,"May 28,

44217,2017 i wanna get a few things off my chest in this review of warframe as someone who has been playing for over 550 hours for those who are new to the game so they don t goof up as much as i did first off the game will take up space on your computer so this isn t for the weak ones that crash easily either and will also take up a portion of your time if you decide to play this second this game is not something you can play for 8 hours straight a day unless you have a clear objective of what it is you re gonna do when playing be it alert missions that crop up with your desired rewards missions farming resources and prime items etc then you will get bored easily i say this because of the hours i ve wasted in indecision of what it is i wanted to do and its just easier when you plan out what you want to work on third be prepared to grind the out of the missions when collecting resources or trying to rank up you will not get far simply blitzing through each mission and searching areas for much needed loot will help you later do not listen to those complaining about not getting enough loot when they go grinding they make the mistake of speedrunning instead of being meticulous that said this leads me to my next point fourth this is a genuine f2p and although real currency can not will be used it is not necessary to advance at all using platinum this is the currency you do exchange your real money into is completely optional and there are multiple tips i ll give on the use of it for newcomers 1 spending platinum is optional2 don t use it on frivolous things like credits the game s other currency that you can earn in any mission or resources as it is not worth it in value3 save it for big purchases like colours hard to obtain warframes or accessories trust me you ll want to be stingy4 there are ways of gaining plat without spending real money but it does involve grinding specific items and finding willing trading partners these items are called prime items and hold onto as many as possible you do not want to be selling them for credits even if you cannot use them trade them as prime junk with other items to gain platinum just be patient when looking for partners finally each warframe has a set of abilities connected to them that you can use buttons 1 4 on your keyboard activate them during missions it took me ages to realise they were even there so i figured its best to tell you upfront to avoid my ignorance happening to you its entirely up to you on how you play this and yes there will be tech issues as addressed by other players but otherwise its a fun way to spend a few hours of your day as well as be a paradise for hoarding and collecting or hell for the recovering ones anyway in short good luck grinding the out of this game,955.5,50.0,5,Recommended,"February 8, 2017",Warframe,Anaglyphite,False

44226,2015 similar in some ways to the multiplayer experience seen in mass effect 3 warframe wastes no time in telling stories particularly elaborate the background narrative in fact will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of ninja called to fight a futuristic alien faction home menu you can choose between different worlds to visit where we await missions to complete possibly in the company of three other players challenge between intergalactic ninja the objectives vary enough but the main flaw of the title digital extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels you will be prompted to save the hostages locate a reactor to destroy or find an object but whatever the delivery in warframe you ll almost always eliminate waves of enemies chasing the various waypoint marked on the map the gameplay fortunately fairly obvious problems of repetition of the title with the view placed behind our tenno the name of the metal ninja who impersonate we will have firearms and trusts katana come into play the warframe champions representing the different possible configurations of the armor these identify the different classes of ninja with unique features useful to customize the game experience challenge between intergalactic ninja initially there are three while the other can be purchased with real money or get through the crafting system included in the title the warframe not only change the appearance of your character but activate specific skill such as enabling stealth attacks rather than providing armor thicker than usual and so on the user then accesses to further customizations to buy with credits earned in each mission completed successfully these enhance the efficiency of its warframe but not only there are in fact many consumable items to carry around for the later missions useful to address the weaknesses of its configuration and style of play,224.9,42.0,6,Recommended,"May 10, 2015",Warframe,Kaneki Ken,False

44236,2016 the devs have become so interested in profits that within the past month they have made a mechanic riven mods and forced people to pay for the mechanic in terms of additional slots for the mechanic at almost 5 for 3 made a weapon with research costs so high that the only option for 99 of the players is to buy the weapon with currency bought with real money not to mention all of the other cash schemes such as their prime vault packages paying 60 for something that they voluntarily made scarce by removing all options to get the item until the items are available again after two years and even then only available for 1 month no thanks it was supposed to be a temporary solution and yet they implemented it permanently also they have put their game under beta for years now so that they continue to see how far they can screw over the playerbase i wouldn t recommend this game not even if they decided to give me a million plat currency bought with money mark my words the developers will only be continuing to pull greedy underhanded schemes,957.0,192.0,7,Not Recommended,"December 23, 2016",Warframe,Detective Gumshoe,False

44265,this game this game is one of the only games i keep coming back to despite me wanting to not go back to looking into the abyss from fun gameplay loops to amazing devs to probably the most customizable game ever it s got it all my total time has been around 3k hours but just got back to playing on steam for achievements and what can i say this game is a treat if you lime playing a space ninja that s a part time fisherman part time miner part time space battleship captain and more then this is the right game for you the game has become unrecognizable from a couple of years ago because the amount of stuff you can do you can play for hours and not run out of things to do which could be detrimental sometimes but nothing is really mandatory customization is this game is outrageous the color of your ship the color of your warframe the color of your pets the color of the trail you can leave behind to an absurd amount of cosmetics you can get outrageous amounts of customization done hundreds of weapons melee weapons pistols etc you can mix and match to 40 warframes and make some unique customized loadouts all of this for free basically besides some cosmetics that are paywall all weapons and most other things can be farmed and obtained for free one big con this game is not new player friendly as i said the game is 100 free to farm for all the weapons warframes the premium currency platinum but it s not good for beginners as of now the game takes about 50 hours of gameplay to become an addictive game the first 49 hours though not so fun the quests in the beginning also need a huge rework because the later parts of the game has quests that compete with some of the best quests in other games the first couple quite lackluster would i recommend heck yes it s a phenomenal game with a phenomenal dev team that does their best and makes the best,708.5,24.0,0,Recommended,August 11,Warframe,IceLikeIsaac,False

44329,2016 great concept rubbish implementation the core ideas of warframe are ace get a load of powers and guns smash weird enemies in varied environments all the while getting stronger add onto this a solid movement system as well as an initially rewarding progression system and warframe should have the strength of core gameplay to barrel right through minor flaws of balancing or uneven progression mechanics unfortunately warframe doesn t have minor issues with progression it s infested with them while most of the epynomous warframes are all if not balanced then at least varied the vast majority of the game s massive arrray of weapons exist only to level so that you can progress the weird and clunky mastery mechanic whereby you get to take a series of uninteresting tests to unlock some but only a few of the more advanced weapons the mechanic does provide some advantages to levelling new weapons but only once you re long past the point of painfully grinding a progression of dull nondescript weapons instead of getting to play with whatever your favourite is compounding the issue newer stuff is almost always better and rather than spending any effort on balance the devs created a system of random powerups the variance of which is so massive that it will make weapons either embarassingly overpowered or actually provide bonuses to stats that the weapon does not posess it s a mess of a system and only the most extreme signal that digital extremes haven t got the faintest idea what to do with their game recommendation play it for a bit it s free and the core gameplay isn t bad but be very aware that you re far better off waiting a long time before spending anything on the game s ridiculously overpriced rmt offerings further this is no blizzard or riot game don t expect well thought out development in tndem with the ridiculously priced monthly rmt content packs,395.4,150.0,10,Not Recommended,"December 22, 2016",Warframe,Riztro,False

44362,2016 warframe is a pve coop with some pvp end game that has a striking resemblance to borderlands even down to the music i don t know which came first but too many similarities to think that they were developed completely independently the most notable difference is that warframe has a series of very large maps and is not open world in warframe you have a home base your spaceship you mount expeditions to the various maps selecting appropriate gear for the mission in hand the basic idea behind warframe is that you have a battle suit called a warframe that comes with various skills you can own many different warframes and weapons with which you can undertake missions to gather materials designs and points to work your way up to the best equipment and skills the crafting is central to warframe and is excellent you can buy all the gear but it s much better to craft it all it s easy to understand and very well designed indeed most importantly there isn t the slightest sign of rng anywhere in the craftng thank heaven sure drops are rng but you would expect that levelling up has been very well designed you the player levels but all your gear levels up too each individual item has a level literally everything can be upgraded and tweaked even mods can be upgraded when you get new gear that has to be levelled up but the game has been designed in such a way that it s not as difficult as it may sound to level up a new gun for example if you take along a level 1 item to a higher level conflict it will level up fast the really clever part of warframe is that the gear you make never goes obsolete gear comes in a myriad of different or flavours different skills of it s own if you like and that s what drives you to collect more but once you have some gear it isn t actually essential to get more you just upgrade and mod it until it s as good as it can be then it remains with you for life so to speak sure there is some gear that is better towards the end game but if you really want to stick to your favourite gun then you can the really important part of warframs is building up a solid collection of mods for your gear the mods are transferable and can change a basic weapon in to a super powerd end game weapon most of your time will be spent trying to get good mods and upgrading them in to great mods you carry a primary gun secondary gun and a melee weapon melee figures highly in the game but you can choose your own path if you want to ignore melee you can if you want to go full ninja using swords and so on you can it s up to you although there are different formats for the missions if you think of a combination of borderlands and l4d then you won t go too far wrong there are slower missions that you can solo and pace but the moment you enter a party then it s going to be really fast comparing it to borderlands the balance of the game is far better you always feel that you are challenged but you always feel that your weapons are doing what they should do the social aspect of the game is weak actually very similar to borderlands as yet i haven t seen any elitism which is refreshing people just form parties and get on with it without moaning that player isn t performing or whatever teamplay tends to be very poor but that s actually very typical for a coop the average young lad is more interested in rambo ing a level rather than doing what he should be doing acting as part of a team so many players are primarily built for dps and speed warframes take a unique perspective on gender given their context within the storyline you are a tenno an ancient warrior and you own and use a series of warframes that have different abilities and features oddly warframes are gender locked so as you choose different warframes for different missions so your gender will alternate how strange is that of course you can just stick to one warframe if you prefer but that s really not the point of the game the main quests in the game are good but the in game explanations are very poor you often find yourself completely baffled as to what s going on you will need to reference youtube for many of the quests just in an attempt to understand what you are supposed to be doing missions small quests are much simpler and really don t need any explanation at all you just see them light up on the starchart when you should run them and you click and go there s also a constant supply of alert missions that give bonus rewards all in all there is a lot to do the only one real criticism i have found is that in two solo quests it locks you in the quest until you have won you can not leave you can not bypass you have to win or it s literally game over you can t get out by dying there is no stuck key restart your pc and you will be back in the quest with no way out you can t get help from friends you can t progress the game at all until you win to my mind that is utter insanity so many players will have reached one of those points and just thrown in the towel there isn t really much warning either you could well have a useless warframe on when you reach the point and it s really game over seems strange on an mmo that you want to get rid of customers really total nonsense thank heaven there are only two points like that the only thing i can say is if ever it says that you are about to have restricted access to the rest of the game immediately check youtube to find out what you are in for get your best gear on and just hope because it may be the end of the game for you party games operate exactly the same as borderlands there is no server as such rather the person who starts the party hosts the party this means that generally pings are very good but can vary depending how far you are from the host and what type of connection they have in general though the gameplay is not particularly ping dependant the gameplay is not structured so that you require tanks and healers and so on although they do exist the developers could do with making players depend on the team more to lessen the rambo behaviour in the game the game is free but of course it constantly and i really mean constantly tempts you to spend real money the game is definitely not p2w or p2p but it most certainly is more fun if you spend a little most items can be crafted but of course some of the exclusive skins will cost you money there are three currencies in the game credits earnt by playing platinum bought for cash and finally cash the advantage of platinum is that it can be traded between players so some exclusive items can be obtained by trading however cash can not be traded so if you want the really exclusive skins then there is little option but to part with hard earned cash although players can trade there is no in game player market the only market in the game is for players to buy items from the game which are sold at fixed cash prices platinum tradeable currency in the game and credits you earn playing taxation can also be very high on traded items ultimately the downfall the reason you may stop playing the game is the lack of variation in missions and the lack of true coop play if you like speed play and are part of a static you could keep going forever on this game but otherwise you are likely to get bored sooner or later don t think for an instant that it s not worth playing though it most certainly is i ve been on the lookout for a borderlands type mmo for a very long time shame i didn t know there was one already out there stop wasting time download it it s an amazing

44369,2018 this game is one of the best in free to play category i tried to play the game in 2014 2 times yet i got bored in first few missions the game felt boring and first story quest felt lame after all that prejudgement my friends kept recommending the game i started one last time after first 6 quests i started to enjoy and understand the mentality of the game i noticed that the fun part is not the level design or the game modes what makes game different is each warframes abilities and types of weapons and melees you can use there bunch of combinations with every weapon mod and warframe each one gives you different play styles and that keeps the game fresh and fun game doesnt teach you everything but community is really good and helpful any stranger from chat or in forums will help you also there is trading in exchange of plat microtransaction that means if you grind enough you can trade your items to but this currency i bought plat for ones with 75 discount it was worth supporting developers after each update they always kept bringing new content and story missions every new patch and quest means more story and more to do you should give it a try but be sure you played the second dream and war within those are the major and damn cool quests every gamer should experience these two quest,177.8,36.0,0,Recommended,"January 10, 2018",Warframe,"Höllenfeuer

44371,2023 its a great game and a fun time sink which is hard to find these days my biggest issue with the game is the game support or lack of it the fact players can get a ban suspension for trading with other players is absolutely silly i received a 2 week suspension for selling someone some mods at the current market price of about 1500 platinum then i get an in game mail saying items removed from account after reaching out to support i was told the trade you did with the other player involved platinum that was obtained by fraudulent means so the platinum has been removed from your account but my items not returned at this time we have chosen to give you another chance at playing the game however we have placed a 2 week suspension on your account plus 2 months of not being able to trade with other players so now not only am i out those items but now my account is also in a negative platinum balance because of it so after my two week suspension i also have to pay the company money to make up for the negative balance on the account there is nothing in the eula or tos in regards to it being the players responsibility to make sure they are doing legitimate trades or to ensure who they are trading with are proper players this is on top of the bunch of people who received bans or suspensions from support as well for receiving gifts from people through their own market place,434.9,23.0,2,Not Recommended,"August 11, 2023",Warframe,Mango McConaughey,False

44496,2019 ah i ve played this game so much and lived in its world for so long i feel like a detailed review is not even needed anymore and instead would require only saying this was my second home for a really long time however number one f2p model in the industry this game features so many things i was honestly overwhelmed the first 20 hours vanilla wow didn t manage to make me feel like that with 70 spells macros in my action bars and the completely new thing back in 2004 the devs are working their butts off to make this the best game possible and it s all for free they also have regular streams with prizes people keep saying it s p2w but it s not using the store and the currency just shortens the grind but it also decreases the fun you get even if you spend your hard earned money to speed things up and get the best weapons you still won t be better than other players if you don t know how to play i won t go into the pros and cons as there are too many pros and very few cons mostly personal situational so i ll go a different route start playing this game you ll see most of its quirks and features in about 10 hours at first the design might be a bit weird if you re like me but after that you ll absolutely love it or you won t sometimes it can get confusing but the community is great so the chat is always your best friend digital extremes in my book ties with cd projekt red no doubt and the way they re evolving might get them to the no 1 spot that s it go play it now edit digital extremes in my book ties with cd projekt red i completely forgot about this bit well we can safely say that de is now my favorite name out there,747.9,22.0,3,Recommended,"September 11, 2019",Warframe,"M A R O Z A

44525,2021 warframe is a space ninja sim set on exploring the player s oedipus complex where your step moms are constantly stuck and constantly need help gameplay wise it s a grind heavy action mmo with an excellent mobility system great core gameplay cool gun design and a sense of wonder which will all in time turn into bitterness boredom disappointment and erotic fanfiction the game exists in a constant semi broken state but you get used to it after a while the gameplay is built around an action loop you load in do your chosen objective running on walls like a hyperactive teenager then finish the mission and collect the loot the formula has variations the action might take place in an open world section or in space with co op ship piloting and boarding and sometimes the variations are good and sometimes they are not the power progression is gated between build timers exp milestones random drop chances out of season april fool s jokes and most of all behind the game never lowering itself to properly explain anything nevertheless the core of being a ridiculously mobile and deadly ninja is almost always there and it carries the experience is the game fun yes is it not fun yes as it stands it leaves you with a choice make the gameplay optional or make the winning optional if you choose the former the only comment you will leave under this review in a few months will be e e e e e ee eee e ee since your mind will long have gone replaced by a big button you instinctively try to press to solve any in game or irl problem and if you choose to reject the one button you ll be constantly feeling underpowered slowing your team down and disappointing your space mom especially with the high level content it s up to you to pick your poison and play the balancing act the devs won t save you from this choice you can believe in them but it s like believing in santa the development cycle looks as follows first the devs will tell you they re gonna go buy groceries real quick then they ll disappear for half a year then show up drunk and with a paraplegic goat in tow after a year or so of vet visits the developers might silently admit that the goat while eventually nice might not have been a bag of groceries and they ll proceed to announce groceries 2 0 whether you re going to end up with a cucumber themed dildo or a korean ladyboy nicknamed gross eris is anybody s guess however you can play with gross eris for free of course there s a catch if you don t know where to get things what things to get how to sell them and how to not go insane while doing it comfortably playing for free isn t an option oh it will be after 100 200 hours of game knowledge settle in but not now attempting it from the start really isn t worth it so here s an actual advice if you like the game initially wait for the 75 platinum discount you could get on logging in spend the standard mmo subscription amount on plat get yourself an affinity booster a resource booster some weapons slots warframe slots a couple of reactors and a palette or two if you still like the game and are playing a month after repeat the process everything past that paying ll be optional and as bonus your family will actually get to see you between the game sessions listening to you mumbling e e eeeee eeeee when asked to pass the salt personally i have no regrets over the time i spent being a ninja warframe begs to be a game about skill and while it is made a game about numbers there s just enough freedom and cleavage to make you enjoy the ride nonetheless and then there s daughter i ain t saying i d simp for her mind you but you would don t lie,647.0,21.0,23,Recommended,"July 13, 2021",Warframe,Polly-morph,False

44538,2021 i dont mind the grind i actually loved the way warframe was when it was ran under de alone however this prime resurgence event isnt worth my time or my money in fact this is showing tencents impact since they bought de sure most of the updates have been good or at least passable up to this point but now i honestly cant say i recommend this game if the game continues this downward trend with tencent at the helm the game will fail i have 3k hours on ps4 and 256 hours on pc as of right now and i have never seen such a blatant cash grab event it genuinely is starting to feel like a mobile game im gonna vote not only with my wallet but also my time say no to this cash grab style event edit i came back for new war as i said i would had to farm up for my void rig which took me 16 hours of game time now im waiting 12 hours for the build then ill make additions to my review i still wont recommend the game im wary of what kind of tencent is gonna pull with warframe but im still gonna play here and there since im already mostly end game anyways railjack is fun and is my main content i run do i advise getting the game i think its an ok game there s lots to do decent story and its beautiful lots of awesome cosmetics but its a grind fest if your unlucky a lot time gating is on par with mobile games and big updates take years to drop and are almost always mediocre on release then get fleshed out later off that alone i say give it a shot if you dont mind the cons but be wary of the new management tencent is still at the helm and im keeping a close eye on what they do i personally dont recommend this game but ive put in the time im gonna at least see the story through till they finish it update after finishing the new war quest decent story gameplay was lackluster but i do like some of the new additions and that i was free to choose who i wanted back and such this game has so much potential and this quest was so underwhelming because of how much potential it had was it worth all the grind absolutely not also when will they reduce the time gating its annoying especially when paired with several days of grind due to bad luck,449.8,39.0,2,Not Recommended,"November 16, 2021",Warframe,"星ちゃん

44560,2021 hate to leave a negative review but the game s direction during the past few years leaves a lot to be desired we waited 3 5 years for the new war to be released and it ultimately didn t change the game at all and continued the cycle of waiting years for actual content that is worth playing the new war was good but it wasn t enough to retain my interest in the game we spent 3 5 years waiting grinding open worlds new primes new frames new weapons and of course other games all filler content made for us to grind just for grind s sake i m tired of the excuses that the game is f2p and filled with stuff to do because at the end of the day none of it means anything players regularly leave the game en masse after big updates because we are understandably frustrated with how little there is to enjoy in the core gameplay i am really hoping de does something to make the game feel alive again because much of the game feels like wasted potential the question now is how many more years do we have to wait for the next major story update until that update arrives there are better time investments than this,442.5,26.0,3,Not Recommended,"December 26, 2021",Warframe,"Dominus

44597,2014 my review of warframewarframe is an amazing game with a truly original story and setting in the year 2029 austria birth place of hitler arnold schwarzenegger money boy and joseph fritzl decided to place a ban on all other forms of national production farms were closed factories shut down and local stores were forced out of business the only businesses allowed to operate were the ports for importing food to feed the now practically enslaved workforce all national production refocused on the construction of the door frame austria s answer to your door hanging needs by the year 2031 rogue factions within the austrian government decided it was time to strike uploading a selective virus in to the entire nations production lines this led to the creation of the war frame a door frame so focused on war that it caused conflict wherever it was mounted homes across the globe now featured austrian doorframes and unfortunately a rogue batch of warframes were also set loose across the globe these warframes were notorious sealing front doors to homes to prevent you visiting your neighbours sealing doorways to places of worship so people could no longer pray to their chosen gods and gradually over time the world fell to darkness and chaos as even the doorways to power plants and gas stations refused to open some warframes gained sentience and self awareness and as they saw the human uprising finally coming to fruition their evil colleagues and companions burned in the streets and smashed to splinters they rose up to assist their human allies in the fight against their own kind you take the role of one of nineteen types of warframe from oak to pine to cedar wood the choices are limitless your skills totally customizable from tea tray services to opening for the elderly as one of the newly freed warframes you must take up the mantle of free door m fighter fighting across not only earth but the moon mars and titan to free the oppressed human people from their true foes the evil warframes of the austrian mega doorframe corp 11 10 would open and close door again,496.5,166.0,0,Recommended,"April 13, 2014",Warframe,"SandCastle

44685,2019 this game is fantastic it s deep complex and gives you a wide variety of objectives and ways to improve your character while the game is a grind for sure the wide variety of missions and activities keeps you too busy to get bored easily the learning curve is high for new players as very little is explained in the game however there s a breath of online resources from the wiki to the discord server that are incredibly helpful and the community is fantastic this game is by far the biggest bang for you buck out there because its free and you can access all the content without spending money warframe has microtransactions but they do it the right way and have been open to feedback from the community when something seems unfair and why wouldn t you be open to paying for some of the content essentially help with the grinding when many people get hundreds to even thousands of hours of playing time and the developers are constantly churning out new content i have over 150 hours at this point and have only spent 30 and i still have most of that in in game currency i have spent far more for games that have given me far less i have no problem spending more in the future to not only help with my hours playing but also to support the game itself i see many of the bad reviews complaining about the game getting boring and a lack of content but they have 1000 hours in the game one had over 5000 if it takes me that long to get burned out sign me up this game is well worth the time and money or lack there of,720.8,25.0,4,Recommended,"September 13, 2019",Warframe,"kneekap

44686,2022 all of these hours are from the good ol days up to the eidolon update in my opinion problems with warframe were really starting when archwings came out and hearing about the various changes over the years just solidifies that view back when it first came out there was an achievable progression and that space ninja vibe was really in place some of the best times in my life but that will not cloud what i perceive to be an error in philosophy the best parts of warframe are the frames the abilities builds and the modems that go with augmenting them the most amount of polish in the game is concentrated there no doubt it is the best part of the game and it kept my interest for 800 hours when you spend so much dev time on very middling and mixed expansions such as eidolon or archwings such the dissonance there really detracts from the experience i respect the fact that game development itself is fun and trying new things is fine but when you implement things that in themselves don t truly flesh out the game and do this multiple times there comes a point where the identity of the game is in question eidolons were very clearly implemented when open worlds were hot and the archwings were whatever they were trying to be i feel like the cohesion of your game should matter a bit more than whatever you feel like cobbling together lastly the grinding perhaps with regard to newer players the number one reason i can t recommend warframe there is that difficult territory when you are trying to accomplish making content that keep older players interested as well as drawing new players and one solution to this is padding of whatever the new content is this favors the older players and makes it more difficult for newer players sure the new players will be wowed by the initial warframe and its moderate beginnings however when an mmo adds so much grinding and adds so many systems to navigate optimize this game is no longer new player friendly it is adding new things not refining the old and hoping that the young are entranced enough to deal with the curve that warframe now has now maybe for someone who is a glutton for the whetstone this may be fine it may be a worthy investment of time for me though it no longer is and i feel the same can be said for many others tl dr for anyone new i won t denounce giving warframe a shot enjoy the experience while you can extract that warframe feel the game is free but i will not recommend staying the grind at this point is and what else value you get out of it is perceived at best,813.7,36.0,0,Not Recommended,"September 28, 2022",Warframe,Zerithos,False
44688,warframe is a curate s egg good in parts it is ambitious and has a lot of good and fun aspects overall though this 11 year old game is showing its age in a similar way to older mmos or especially path of exile another f2p action game an ever growing collection of overambitious neglected content islands where the developers try and include a whole other genre of game into warframe eg space shooters railjack soulslikes duviri roguelikes duviri again open world games plains of eidolon etc then they get bored of it and move on to the next new game genre i m surprised there s no battle royale mode in warframe engine limitations which mean that these new game modes have to be shoehorned into existing code in awkward ways eg the open world areas which are just very large mission instances you have to finish the open world in the correct way or you lose all your progress just like if you abort a mission an overlong leveling experience the star chart that is pretty dull repetitive and unrewarding when compared to more recent content 11 years of power creep means gameplay especially coop is all about zoom zoom gotta go fast mowing through hordes of brainless totally unchallenging enemies in order to finish the mission as fast as possible things like spy missions exist but stealth gameplay is counterproductive because it takes so long to finish a mission stealthily compared to just blasting everything much of de s monetisation is designed around regular release of new warframes playable heroes games that rely on this eventually run into problems because there end up being just too many characters and abilities to balance properly older characters end up being neglected and the developers are tempted to make each new character op cash shop prices are pretty inflated you re nickel and dimed through much of the game s interface and there are some predatory tactics eg when you go to buy a gear blueprint in the market it prominently shows you a price for the item in platinum the premium currency and hides the fact that you can buy the item s blueprint using in game currency melee weapons are stupidly powerful i basically never use my primary or secondary weapons gun because i can just throw my exploding melee boomerang glaive and obliterate everything there s also no need to use warframe abilities in most of the gameplay as enemies are so easy to defeat this means all the warframes play exactly the same zoom zoom throw glaive everything explodes warframe is a looter shooter but there is almost no actual loot instead virtually everything that drops during missions is crafting materials at a guess there are probably over 500 different crafting materials in the game the only way almost to get new gear is to craft it at a crafting station in your spaceship you have to wait real life hours or days for the crafting to complete like a mobile game or you can pay platinum to speed it up the thing which finally prompted me to write this review however is the quest called the new war this is a massive quest released in 2021 it is part of the main storyline and lots of game mechanics are gated behind it so it s really compulsory if you want to reach and keep up with warframe s endgame once you start this quest you are locked in it until you complete the whole thing which takes at least 3 4 hours you have no access to any of your warframe characters or gear instead you control various quest characters who have their own limited sets of abilities this is odd but tolerable until you reach a section where you must defeat 2 out of 3 new bosses archons these boss fights are far harder than any previous fight in the game that most players will have encountered think dark souls 3 but the bosses have an obnoxious amount of health to fight them you don t have your overpowered warframe you have a puny human armed with a bow which has to charge up before each shot and each shot removes only about 1 2 of the boss s health did i mention the bosses can heal themselves and teleport behind you so once you reach this stage of the quest your account is bricked until you defeat these overly hard and tedious too much health bosses you literally cannot play the game anymore you are locked out unless you convince digital extremes support to deactivate the quest on your account git gud i guess i ve beaten ds1 ds3 and elden ring but i can t be bothered with these boss fights they are just not what i play warframe for there are other better games for that it s fine and good to include challenging boss fights but they should be optional late game activities not a compulsory roadblock,462.8,22.0,0,Not Recommended,February 28,Warframe,trollusk,False

44723,2020 i really loved this game their ideas the gameplay and the absolute triumph of achieving the build or equipment i was looking for or finally beating that one thing i ve been meaning to beat it is a damn beautiful and cool game to boot the frames and weapons took my breath away and the things i heard about them before made me proud to be part of this communitybut all of that feels empty now not because i got tired of it but because it lost it s meaning they ve been steadily dropping the drop rate of components over time despite people nearly begging them not to do that oh the one piece you need to finish building a frame or weapon do that boss run for a couple hundred more times maybe you ll get it fine that s all forgettable but it s been 3 years or so since one of the most ground breaking quests that went into the lore of warframe they promised the new war they even went and promised us duviri paradox but still haven t delivered on these and it seems to be forgotten now there are still some game breaking bugs they haven t fixed both on pc and ps4 i m a little sick of following through the floor and now their newest update deimos freakin arcana what i certainly wasn t hoping for i want to recommend this game like i used to i had been talking to friends about playing it but now i just can t bring myself to mention it to them it s too embarrassing thinking back on the times they said it was boring and not as interesting as it used to be until they get their act up and actually do the things they promised and stop doing things like decreasing the drop rate or nerfing abilities and weapons and actually fixing some of the problems showing up in the game i can t recommend it sorry,284.3,27.0,1,Not Recommended,"December 12, 2020",Warframe,"Ynaraku_Ashiva

44725,2019 warframe is a mediocre single player experience but a great multiplayer experience if you ve got a consistent cast of friends to play with for a free to play mmo the grind is manageable and the stuff you can buy is always stuff you could always just grind for there is no actual advantage to be gained by paying money except for saving yourself a bit of time and grind i believe literally the only thing that only real money can buy is some cosmetics and more storage space if you re the sort of pack rat like me who won t even throw away a bad or mediocre piece of equipment because what if and also because it would leave unsatisfactory holes in the collection gameplay wise warframe has come a long way from its humble beginnings and now you actually feel like a badass space ninja with even the simplest movement combos and combat actions the soundtrack is excellent the visuals are stunning and the game sees constant updates buffs and reworks to stuff that doesn t work or has ended up being underpowered constant introductions of new frames new gear new quests new areas etc if you haven t played for a year and then return you ll have to learn half the game anew because they are constantly upgrading and innovating warframe really has an extremely dedicated crew the storytelling is very love it or hate it the people i know myself included fall sharply into one camp that rolls their eyes and makes wanking gestures while suffering through the story parts and people who are breathlessly excited for the story parts i m in the latter camp i think they execute the story excellently the only complaints i could make about parts that require a bit too much grinding is levelling up the quills and vox solaris but even that s been largely dealt with by subsequent updates if you don t mind doing a bit of research to see what the most effective approach is,910.4,20.0,2,Recommended,"March 29, 2019",Warframe,"PurpleXVI

44772,2022 warframe is a really conflicting game for me on one end the early mid game is really fun you ll probably enjoy learning the different mission types exploring the different open world areas although tread carefully because there are end game enemies in there you can thankfully evade and learning the different warframes movement is fluid gunplay is enjoyable as an arcade proposition and replayablility is high graphics and the soundtrack are also pretty great the story is ok for some reason de have decided to make the game episodic so the story cuts off abruptly on a cliffhanger and it sometimes takes years for the next part of the story to come out the lore is much deeper than expected and a lot of fun to explore but honestly the story s not doing it much justice then however you get to the end game and it s a mess for one the grind levels turn to 11 later in the game rng is cruel in this game and some frame parts have absurdly low drop rates meaning you have to play the same mission 15 20 if not more times to get the part you need the frames that broke me were nidus and harrow all of nidus parts drop in one of the most reviled missions in the game while harrow s neuroptics have a 16 67 drop rate in a spy mission yet i never got one after 25 attempts to make matters worse the initially exciting gameplay gets unbelievably tedious as you play on warframe s ai is mindnumbingly stupid rescue missions will make you want to tear your eyes out and the difficulty bumps come with more enemies per level with longer healthbars increased damage and new units with more powerful aka annoying abilities the enemies don t get smarter and the gameplay doesn t reach any more depth especially if you are playing tanky frames like rhino valkyr or inaros to name a few you can go through some of the hardest missions by just smashing your face against the keyboard to make matters ever worse there s only a limited number of mission types with identical objectives but at different locations and varying degrees of difficulty the constant repetition thanks to the grindy game design and the lack of variety of objectives means late game missions are more of a chore than actual fun the open worlds help since you can do things unrelated to combat like fishing and mining but the problem still lingers finally the elephant in the room is warframe pay to win many youtubers will answer no even when not asked but i beg to differ the game gives you little platinum on purpose and you ll need it for frame and weapon slots while apologists will claim that you don t need to spend a penny to play this game i know for a fact you ll need to have a healthy arsenal of frames and weapons to progress at higher levels for which you ll need slots for which you ll need platinum for which you ll need money yes you can make platinum from trading but my several attempts at selling even fairly rare items at very low prices yielded no results in my 500 hours i put in about 30 i d say that s a fair amount for what the game has to offer but de s insistence on claiming you don t need to put in any money at all to progress is frankly misleading sure you can go through the first 100 hours without spending a penny but past the mid game phase you ll need to splurge if you want to have a chance to finish high level missions or deal with the sentients in conclusion warframe is by no means a bad game it s pretty fun initially de have worked their arses off to get it from the abysmal state it was in during its original release to its current surprisingly polished form and the hours tick by quickly however the more you progress the less fun it gets with repetition dumb ai and ridiculous grinding eating at your very being personally i felt relieved when i uninstalled it and have committed to never playing a grindy game like that ever again but if you can stomach that and you only care about kicking low iq ai arses while zooming around like sonic the hedgehog this game will keep you entertained for hundred of hours,508.4,16.0,0,Not Recommended,"July 28, 2022",Warframe,Steve Phoenix,False

44809,2016 now before i begin the review i d like to say something really quicklyi absolutely love the game it s by far one of my favorite games of all time or well in the lower end of my top 20 but i simply cannot recommend warframe in its current state the actual reviewwarframe is a free to play third person shooter with mmorpg elements in this game you assume the role as a tenno a faction descended from the long lost orokin empire the tenno control the titular warframes which are essentially robot ninjas in various missions in the the guidance of the lotus a mysterious woman who is responsible for reawakening the tenno from their cryo sleep that s really all i can say about the story without spoiling a lot of the cleverly hidden lore about the game positives massive selection of weaponry and warframes to choose from stunning visuals especially for a 2013 game a very interesting lore and story for those that want a break from slashing aliens to ribbons decent soundtrackhowever every rose has it s thorns and warframe has some nasty ones at that very apparent framerate problems during late game fights what with the massive amounts of enemies and particle effects flying left and right even with an up to date pc grinding can get easily repetitive after a while though that is to be expected with an mmorpg a lot of bugs everything from animation issues to complete crashes can happen at any moment as of october 2016 the endgame is incredibly lacking in things to do when the dev team make chances to weapons or mechanics they are often times for the worse just take the recent vacuum within updates and hotfixes as an example the balance is terrible even with the most powerful weapons players struggle to kill level 100 enemies and said enemies are capable of killing a player in a matter of milliseconds if they re not careful and that s not mentioning the power creep problems that newer items have nowadays although it is free to play there are indeed microtransactions albiet they are not as bad as other f2p games as the only things that can be optained exclusively through real world money are cosmetics prime access accesories everything else can be earned by playing the game if much slower and finally the biggest problem of all the new player experience is garbage several essential things are left unexplained to newer players forcing most to resort to wiki s just to get startedas i stated earlier i still like the game despite its shortcomings but i simply cannot recommend it in its current state,918.5,164.0,8,Not Recommended,"October 26, 2016",Warframe,"StefanFr

44872,2020 there s plenty of videos out there explaining exactly how this game is on a downward spiral and sadly i have to agree the game was really good for the first few hundred hours but after that not so much they hype up each update but when they release they re usually unplayable or extremely grindy i tried to grind rivens kuva liches and railjack but i just feel like i ve wasted my time and it s not just me look at the global achievement stats as of right now only 1 3 of steam players have actually killed a lich and 1 4 have actually assembled a railjack i could go on but i ll just end it by saying how de was praised in the past for removing a kubrow color slot machine but then ended up adding rivens to the game which cost way way more plat if you intend to buy them they added bullet jumping because they liked how players were coptering and zooming around the map but then they nerfed that too in fact they just kinda just nerf whatever is popular i can pretty much guarantee you that the kuva bramma is going to get nerfed soon and i don t really feel the whole looter shooter aspect to the game either i mean what exactly are you looting resources anyways if you haven t played it already then play it it s fun in the beginning edit rip kuva bramma,921.9,24.0,2,Not Recommended,"April 7, 2020",Warframe,hentai lord,False

44884,2018 i like this game and my friends like this game despite it being more and more of a horde shooter this is less of a don t play this game and more of a you should probably know this before you play the game kind of review do not trade or deal in platinum unless you are prepared to get banned if someone steals platinum and it is traded to your account instead of charging the person who stole the platinum they will charge whoever owns that platinum if you go to support and ask why you are being charged money for someone elses crime they will tell you that it s your fault for using thier in game trading system and they will just take the money from the account who owns it despite who stole it the biggest issue is that when they substract their lost plat from the system even when they know and i mean they litterally admitted that they knew my friend hadn t stole it and they had indeed traced it to the source they still banned him let me repeat they know where the stolen plat came from and still choose to punish the person who they knew hadn t stolen it in order to play the game he had to contact customer support and pay for the stolen plat meaning not only do they take the plat and ban you but you now have to pay for someone elses theft i could have the smallest amount of understanding if they just took the plat they don t want to wreck the in game economy but to make you pay for stolen plat when they admitted they knew he hadn t stolen it imagine if someone sold you a car they stole and then instead of just taking the car the police took the car asked you to pay for it and charged you with theft despite knowing who stole it that s what de is doing furthermore my friend had spent the plat buying deco for the dojo and effectavly that plat was already removed from the game since he gave it to de for the decorations so there was 0 chance of it affecting the in game economy if all this wasn t enough they also suspend you from the forums so you can t say anything about it and there s no way to know how often this happens since there aren t threads about it since they ban you this honestly seems like they are running a scam they care more about their cost than they do about their players which it pretty typical for de lets be honest but i ve never seen it to this extent i m sure it s not an real scam but they just handle it so poorly it seems like that now as a small disclaimer i have friends who have never run into this problem this particular friend was mr 15 with some 800 hours in the game and has traded probably close to 100k of plat around mostly since all he usually does is farm prime parts and hunt eidolons so he really raked the plat in if you hardly ever trade you ll likely be safe but there s always that chance and de handles it like a limp noodle so if you play this game do not go anywhere near the real money currency unless you want to risk getting fined and have to pay for someone s crime edit since some people aren t aware stealing plat happens when someone used a faulty credit card then quickly trades the plat away makes many many accounts and funnels the starting plat to an account some form of hacking the game itself there s probably other ways but these are the ones i ve heard about,126.3,202.0,82,Not Recommended,"May 24, 2018",Warframe,Korbeaux,False

44934,2022 after roughly 1500 hours in this game across ps4 and steam i can safely say i m done this game has had a multitude of core design philosophy issues since launch that myself and many other players were willing to overlook but almost a decade later that goodwill is gone so what exactly are the problems 1 lack of identitythis game simply has no idea what it wants to be anymore it has morphed from a free to play randomly generated 3rd person shooter into whatever the hell this is de s idea of progression and innovation is to just half assedly copy and tack on lazily designed systems for no other reason than because other games have them did you like the nemesis system here s a grindy broken alternative do you like open world games here s 3 open worlds to grind through and even though they all look and play the exact f same you have to grind them all to unlock the massive glut of the game s content that has been arbitrarily gated off behind it do you like cod and destiny here s a hacked out multiplayer mode nobody plays with virtually all of the cool weapons and mods disabled do you like 2d fighting games here s a s y minigame where you have to re grind to unlock the characters you already have and 95 of the playerbase doesn t even know it exists it s clear that there is no actual endgame or coherent vision being worked towards every update is just a mindless race to inch closer towards copying every other game on the planet 2 monetizationthe only thing worse than nonsensical game systems carelessly stacked on top of each other is the inevitable monetization that comes with it while it s true that roughly everything in the game can be accessed for free the monetization of this game is a deliberately mystifying clusterf ck geared towards alienating new players and veterans alike with basic noob weapons still being sold for 20 each and absolutely untenable resource grinds that are clearly designed to confuse and or frustrate people into spending 3 refusal to listen to player feedbackperhaps the final nail in the coffin is the attitude the dev team has taken towards the player base in recent years from sudden account bans to punishing players because another person they traded with glitched in premium currency de seems to have adopted a much more indiscriminately cavalier attitude towards dealing with fans when they aren t actively alienating players they are busy implementing bafflingly backwards nerfs and design changes that don t accomplish anything but make the game less fun there s no point in trying to grind or unlock anything cool anymore because de will just nuke it to the ground once enough people catch wind of it in sum if you missed out on warframe during its heyday from 2015 2018 that ship has sailed and there s really no longer any reason to check it out now it sucks because this used to be one of my favorite games of all time and a shining example of how to do f2p right but now it s just another copy paste corporate grindfest de has every right to keep blindly throwing at the wall but long time players have no obligation to sit through it anymore,541.0,63.0,2,Not Recommended,"October 30, 2022",Warframe,"Balachai

44939,2022 i won t be going into a deep dive of the positives of this game you have probably heard everything positive already about this game i want to go into my experience and how i eventually just got tired of it the game starts off throwing a lot of random buzz words at you that might make 0 sense for me it was a confusing mess that took a while to sort of understand after that i had a pretty enjoyable time its fun to just play with friends and mindlessly kill stuff then i did that again and again and again and again i think you get the point the story still kept me going for a while and i thought i was making some alright progress in the game then the game threw this massive open world at me filled with stuff to do and then it did that again at first i was genuinely impressed and once again confused but the more i played this part of the game the more i started realizing this really is a free to play game to progress in these areas you are practically being told to treat the game as a job you clock into every day daily activities as well as the heavy grind absolutely soured my taste of any positives the game had going for it at that point i completely lost sight of what the game actually expected me to do play the overworld do normal missions focus on grinding for better suits do the story i genuinely couldn t tell anymore what the game was going for and what i was really playing the game for its exactly at this point where progress started to feel like a snails pace i already played like 100 hours of the same types of missions what else was there to see that made me decide to quit the game it still probably is a fun game to just jump into and play from time to time but the game doesn t want you to do that it wants you to consistently log back in to spend money and time i would rather spend my time on other games that respects my time and money more then this game if you want to play it go ahead its still a solid game but if your time spent ends up amounting to anything will rely purely on what you are trying to get out of this game,111.9,40.0,3,Not Recommended,"October 5, 2022",Warframe,Drumbas,False

44952,2016 this game is really fun to play at first after all the fun of new gameplay starts to get boring there s not really much to keep your interest the game has pseudo map building not random maps it copy pastes areas in the world so that every mission feels the same there aren t a ton of different ways to play just a few new tricks to do the same missions there are only about 4 or 5 different kind of missions to do and each planet has them repeatedly the only thing interesting after a while is getting new weapons which aren t really all that different from each other now i m not saying don t play the game i m saying don t expect to get a ton of hours of fun it is a fun game with a simple gimmick that gets very old really quick,120.0,19.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 4, 2016",Warframe,"SceneTurkey

45068,2022 i have about 3000 hours total on my main but can t even be f to log back in that one i would also love to keep the review short and sweet but there s simply too much to say about this game this game is a hidden gem or at least it was nowadays this game is comparable to insert cash grab game here like anything in life you shall start with the good what s good about this game is the depth of anything literarlly anything you ll want to do and accomplish in this game you ll never manage to because there will always be an extra layer of content on top of it even if it s not now there will be soon trust me what s also good about this game is the friendly community to the starters this game is hella hard and grindy but you can easily find willing to help players literarlly everywhere just load into any mission and find a higher rank player than you and ask for help i can guarantee you with 100 certainty that he will help you without any hesitation progression in this game is also kinda easy but only if you are guided on how to do it what s also a very good thing about this game is the variety of things you want to cosplay into a pink furry you can do that you want to become a literal cannon ball you can do that do you want to become a ghost and do stealthy shi you can also do that you can do almost anything you want with the right amount of grind and this is preety much all i can say are the good points for a new player now i have no shame nor hesitation to tell y all what a shell of this game has become just because of some absolutely mindless developers and their way of managing the game just by using spreadsheets and data and not even playing their own god dayumn game 1 nerfs and reworks the game has too many grind levels to the point where you d need to put in some dozens of hours to farm for a specific setup just to optimize the speed of some mission or task this is good because it also implies there some kind of skill gap roof system where you can do anything but some can do it better because they put in more effort but their effort goes straight down the toilet when de decides that this specific weapon or character is too powerful because their excel spreadsheet back in the offices say that 60 of the players use that specific thing only in that specific situation i mean yea that s the whole point of optimization finding the right setup to do things the fastest way and you ing nerf it hello ok fine we will use some other explosive weapon setup or nuke type characters to deal with the situation nope they nerf the amount of ammo of that weapon rendering it borderline useless sure fine get some mods to compensate that nope they will simply nerf the weapon to the ground rinse and ing repeat this has happened to any all time favorite weapons that the playerbase has ever met the exact same process so we get mad right players get mad and we complain seems like they didn t like the change let s add some mods that might change the situation useless mods that do borderline nothing better than their counterpart fine you can argue that for this specific weapon that 20 faster reload speed increases its dps but that s horse you ll never use that weapon seriously unless you just use it for fun or because you like it 2 skins baby skins everywherelately there s a trend with this dev team to release more and more skins that btw in this game don t give you nothing but eye sores or pleasing idk you decide and they also charge mad money for some of them sure that s fine i guess but the problem is that they prefer to add skins with each update instead of fixing bugs optimizing things reworking things or simply add qol stuff nah bro you want to fast travel from here to here here take big booty furry girl khora skin for 40 do you want your favorite weapon to be better or a skin for it nah bro here take big booty ghost girl wisp for 40 they d do anything to get more money out of your pockets and delay content for as long as possible come on man they are a small indie company have you seen their actual office building and their actual size of the development team i can t imagine how much money they make monthly and they hide behind this shiddy reason pathetic 3 content but at what cost ok fine we get a big update big spike in unique players and in online activity because people come and go from this game often we get open worlds we get a spacecraft we get reskins of the same weapons but with some small change in their values which make them so op you can t even wrap your head around it new quests and lore this is the biggest thing honestly then you play it farm for things ungodly amount of grinds btw with specific setup just to be nerfed soon just keep that in mind and one month later a patch comes and there s two possibilities they either make the grind harder and longer or they choose the even worse option to nerf things to the ground so that 60 of the people who were using that specific weapon setup don t do it anymore then you sit there and think about it why did i farm 50 hours for these things just to be nerfed new content gets added grind is over 9000 new maps get added grind new factions grind new pets grind new mech style combat gets added grind new hoverboard gets added grind new space ship gets added grind grind grind grind it s a grindy game and there s nothing wrong with that but to grind something and to be nerfed later so you basically wasted your time is outrageous 4 de doesn t even listen to their playerbase whenever there s something wrong with this game community finds it first so what do you do when you find a bug or something that shouldn t be the way it is you report it to the dev team what do they do nothing lmfao get f cked over the years there were so many issues with the game and de decided to ignore them every single time and add more skins over it hoping we forget and sometimes even worse they nerf things that work good and are actually nice to have but they simply take the candy from the children there was this jetpack called itzal which if modded properly you can literarlly teleport like 20m instantly and you could spam it we used it to move around the open world maps which would ve taken waaay too long to navigate without that so almost everybody was using it what did they do they added a very long delay 3 5 seconds i don t even know what it is hence i stopped using that to it so we stop using it ok sure there was a work around with your operator which can do the same thing but less times that also gets nerfed needless to say that the operator grind takes literal weeks to be able to do what i just said they nerfed it because they looked at the spreadsheets one day at their morning coffee and observed that 80 100 of the people are using that to fast travel so they took it away 5 band aid mods as filler content when all fails and community is mad just add the same mods reskined and with a gimmick extra modifier to it of course add it behind huge layers of grind lmfao what were you expecting these mods are good once you acquire them and grind for them but the grind is simply useless why do i need 4 different types of serration when i can have one that fits all why do we need umbral mods when you can simply make the normal mods better why do we need galvanized mods and don t even get me started on rivens rivens are mods that are simply slot machines but instead of paying to roll the slots with money you pay with your timeto finish it all you simply cannot have something convenient and efficient for de to not nerf it tl dr the game is a grindfest and the devs will nerf your grind anyway because that s what their spreadsheet says instead of fixing things just add more big booty titties warframes and cosmetics that are way overpriced,126.7,20.0,0,Not Recommended,"October 29, 2022",Warframe,"wait im goated?

45075,a game about grinding for the sake of grinding warframe is plagued with a dev team with a poor sense of direction they make decisions and add content that feels out of line with their game s direction sometimes even verging on bizarre it s a game that demands a ton of investment and can be fun for a while but after a time you will come to realize that this investment leads you nowhere special the endgame is weak and more or less indistinguishable from the rest of the game and veteran players will quickly find themselves bored unless they are easily entertained by nature at one point there was challenging endgame content in the form of 8 player raids but those have long since been removed after the devs deemed them in need of a rework they were promised to return in some form later on but after six years there is no evidence of them coming back instead we got what fishing horses open world how these things fit into the game as it was i ll never understand the devs have done this with beloved content and gameplay mechanics many times and will likely continue to do so moving forward i reinstalled it recently to check the state of the game and sate my curiosity disappointed with what i found i have resigned to let this game go for good if you want a complex enriching experience from your games and time investment by my reckoning warfarm is not the place to find it i strongly advise looking for another place to sink your time even if you ve got too much of it on your hands congratulations on enduring my rant just figured i d offer some last words before i uninstall again,848.2,35.0,5,Not Recommended,April 18,Warframe,"RPGzusofNazareth

45078,2021 if i had to summarize warframe it s as though the mantra wouldn t it be cool if was writ large everything about warframe lacks cohesion the devs don t consider game impact when they add new systems they don t consider how players will play the game after a new bit of content comes out worst of all the initial release of any new content is essentially a beta because it is full of bugs broken doesn t work right and leads to mass player disappointment there are all sorts of little bugs little problems little issues with game flow that constantly plague you as you play the game the devs don t seem to listen to complaints either overall i can t recommend this game it s never going to get better they re never going to fix the things that annoy you and the community is perfectly happy with just getting more of the same buggy broken game it s sad because the game has a lot of potential if they had just stuck with a tight core vision but it s clear that there s no real understanding of how people play the game or how to drive player behavior,482.5,21.0,1,Not Recommended,"September 1, 2021",Warframe,Auspice,False

45395,2016 this is a very grindy and self motivated game about loot for loot s sake that said you are a backflipping space ninja with unreasonable superpowers and overpowered weaponry basically the core gameplay revolves around running a few basic game types like defense and capture to gear up level equipment and collect resources for more equipment to do it all better though it is a grind it s one about setting entire armies on fire or clawing them apart with your bare hands with your buddies i didn t think much of it at first and it certainly looks like a standard pay to win time waster but after a few hours i found myself having some honest to goodness fun and a fair environment to have it in the movement is exciting and the community is refreshingly polite and helpful it s fairly easy and efficient to grind out valuable items that other players will buy for premium currency so even the most luxurious mtx cosmetics are within reach i do feel a small monetary investment i ve paid 5 so far is necessary to feel comfortable but that is a necessary evil of funding a game like this the decisions of the dev team can be questionable but the core gameplay is solid just expect the usual devs plz ordeal and trust that the overall direction is stable and positive overall i give it an 8 10 it s far from perfect but for a free or very cheap game it s a heck of a time i still enjoy logging in and killing 4 grineer with one arrow while spreading toxic spores over entire maps and that s enough reason for me to keep playing,872.8,18.0,7,Recommended,"November 1, 2016",Warframe,"Brother Batsi

45524,warframe actually blew me away with how cool it is it runs well has fantastic graphics amazing gameplay and there even enough variety in missions to keep you from getting too bored then i ran into the grind and it s not good i ve played mmos i ve partaken of the grind before i ve also played free to play games and know that scummy progression design is fairly standard but this every corner of it is designed to wear down the player enough to get them to spend money it s like a mobile game you spend hours upon hours grinding just to craft one thing then they hit you with a crafting timer then after that crafting timer you can combine that item into another longer crafting timer these timers can take days want to speed up the timer pay or better yet just skip the crafting completely and pay,63.4,32.0,12,Not Recommended,June 22,Warframe,"Skippie Granola

45536,2022 this isn t to addon to the chinese negative review spam i do not care about the wukong nerf this is a general review aimed at new players considering to get the game that being said i strongly believe the game is new player unfriendly this game is an mmo casual hack and slash shooter on the surface and in practice the gameplay loop is very simple and its enjoyable however if you wanted to make some serious progress you require hundreds of hours of time investment and multiple deep dives into the wikipedia there s a lot of feature and content creep in the game just due to its age and if you re starting out fresh on a f2p account you will be behind the curve and struggling to keep up with even the most basic missions with no clear direction to go other than unlocking the entire map i would say its fun with friends but if there s a serious gap in mastery rank you will be eating dust trying to catch up to your friends while they power carry you thru missions the game is fun if you are willing to put forward the effort and learn its deeper mechanics to get some of the higher end gear requires a combination of commitment to the trading system multiple micro transactions of the game s premium currency and or weeks worth of grinding,565.5,25.0,1,Not Recommended,"September 24, 2022",Warframe,"Crow

45656,2020 i have played warframe for a pretty long period of time and i just cant recommend it to anyone simply because of the direction the studio chose to take constant buffing and nerfing meta weapons to encourage players to farm more and hopefully purchase forma seems like a pretty predatory practice to me i can never be sure when my favourite weapons get thrown into the dumpster pile it is also abundantly clear that the business model is gearing towards getting more new players into the game and turning the old players away as they believe that the older players would not spend as much as compared to the newer players surely most negative reviews posted here would be from veterans who feel shafted by the studio s choices as they probably wouldn t express concern if they didn t care about the game in the first place warframe used to be a really fun game where i was really excited to see what new updates were in the pipeline but at this day and age seeing that game in my steam library really does leave a sour taste in my mouth really sad to see such a good ip being squandered in this manner i really do hope it improves in the near future but i do have little hope of that ever happening,866.6,23.0,1,Not Recommended,"January 19, 2020",Warframe,tinyguy,False

45681,2017 i tend to write essays especially on things i am against so brace yourself warframe started as a game with potential from developers who were about to bankrupt now several years after they are huge company having sheetload of attention and money too much of money warframe is now a moneymaker with stupid policy and strict rules that will get you banned on chat for saying something that is not politically correct policy according to which you don t own your account they rent it to you do something they don t like get banned with no reason given they can do it and they do now let s go to the game itself it is different than other games i played to be honest i haven t heard of anything similar to it except destiny nice concept of the gameplay at least for me metric fckton of weapons and stuff to unlock buy and customize some creative story pushed on the side because they can t link it to multiplayer game style story is player character focused already feels weird that is what in my opinion holds it together keeps playerbase big but suffers from the broken mechanics and idiotic decisions weapons and warframes are extremely unbalanced only a bunch of them makes it to meta when they finally get to rework some op weapon or game breaking new warframe they nerf it to the hell weak weapons almost never get a boost and when they get it s something that makes them mediocre still nothing to compare to that shiny tigris prime weak warframes just get called sheet and abandoned by everyone they are reworked when it s time to release new prime access again money money money and it s either a buff making frame so broken that everyone knows it will get nerfed soon or a useless change that won t make the situation any better the main problem through is insane grind in order to get high mastery rank that will let you grind even more weapons and get better in other players eyes this mechanic is addicting and not fun at all on top of that with every update they only add even more grind including new resources that are required for incoming content which are harder and harder to get it s getting to the point where a new player will literally have to spend hundreds of hours in order to play a mission with some friends who have already spent hundreds of hours getting to it there is one more thing maximum rank in the game is 30 there are steam achivements but you aren t even able to get it yet maximum possible rank to get is 24 6 sep 2017 with all existing weapons warframes archwings sentinels and pets maxed out including prime wraith and vandal versions what to expect from game being 5 years old and still in beta revxdev s about their ban for criticizing thanks for help getting this together to google chrome tl dr warframe started out great but has got worse over time and will continue to get worse unless de pulls a miracle out of nowhere they won t don t play it save your time a lot of content interesting and unique story variety of mechanics developer policy can ban you for nothing grind lack of balance powercreep game is a growing moneymaker,803.1,20.0,3,Not Recommended,"May 28, 2017",Warframe,"V

45787,2022 this game is a blast i ll start there and very addicting too i ll probably keep playing after this review but if you can avoid getting into it i would the developers seem like they don t know what they re doing as game developers like they re feeling their way through it and just faking it until they make it they listen to the big streamers and no one else they keep flip flopping back and forth on what weapons they want us using and which ones they don t the recent changes they made with ammo made every weapon suck it makes you have to spend longer in game looking for ammo now or just use your glaive to nuke it as a working class person who works 40 hour a week i m already at my max amount if time i can spend on this game if you make me look for ammo and slow me down i can t get as much accomplished during my daily session and just lose interest after that every single update they release completely breaks the game and it never gets fully fixed before the next game breaking update is released my buddy gets stuck as a stick figure model moving around a level but not being able to shoot his gun we all get the bug where you can t open the escape menu to do anything and when that happens you can t do anything else but to alt f4 and hope you didn t just lose the last hour of grinding you did and half of the time you do these are just two examples of many i could go on for hours if i made a list of what all is broken that s surprising for a game that came out in 2013 they need to put out tests of these updates before pushing them on everyone this isn t working and it s making me regret the last few times i ve used a plat coupon to purchase platinum and then traded for stuff in game that they decide the next week to nerf or change,563.0,30.0,4,Not Recommended,"September 17, 2022",Warframe,HoneyBadger,False

46038,2017 video review youtube video views 0 warframe is a third person action game that s most known for its cooperative gameplay its similarity to destiny and its grind in it you play as a tenno which is basically just some superhero warrior in some superhero suit that they apparently can never step out of or something i m not sure even after 37 hours of playing warframe since the game isn t very good at conveying story or lore outside of just typing it all up and allowing you to read it if you d prefer a book to a video game if you re looking for a narrative driven action game turn back now if you want an extremely fun and badass cooperative experience then stick around warframe might just be for you the gameplay of warframe is addictingly fun you run jump and slide around these procedurally generated levels in pre determined missions and kill things solve puzzles and collect loot there s several different mission types from espionage defense and etc you get to upgrade and outfit your warframe some combat pets and every single one of your weapons to your liking with modifications as you level them up and unlock better ones new items can be purchased mostly with premium currency or crafted for very difficult to grind in game ingredients as well as a credit fee and credits are an earnable in game currency there are also special missions you can do called archwing missions after you do the followup ones to build an archwing these are literally wings that go on your warframe and come with a special new gun that you can use while flying around in space it s hardly ever relevant but a cool feature nonetheless the gameplay however can end up getting just a little repetitive since in all honestly you mostly just have to spam e to win for most missions but overall the gameplay is what will keep you coming back to a game like this it s especially fun when played with anywhere between one to three friends playing it by yourself would be rather boring i imagine which is why i didn t really try that the game is really designed to be a cooperative experience there s a pvp aspect to the game as well but it s mostly dead i ve never even successfully found a match for it the graphics look fantastic warframe was released four years ago and the graphics don t look outdated at all the sound effects are all really solid and smooth as well they put quality work into their production of effects however there are some graphical glitches to be noted such as how this pet dog you can get that helps you in combat likes to grow to the size of whatever it s attacking when it does a specific takedown move and in areas with bigger enemies this can be quite the sight the game has a few other glitches too it s not the most stable game by any means one example is how i once attacked some enemies and my game froze for a minute as it processed all the hits or something another example is how one time at the end of a mission i got lit on fire and kept dying over and over on the way to the extraction as a result since even dying didn t remove the fire i d talk about warframe s story a bit but the story is highly irrelevant you ll probably only follow it through the tutorial questline there are other questlines too but they re more used to unlock new things than to deliver a narrative if you expect some interesting characters or anything like that then you re looking at the wrong game and finally it s a free to play game so we need to talk about its f2p model well pretty much everything can be bought with premium currency and everything is a to obtain without premium currency its model is entirely one that requires grinding or money to skip the grind it s not that bad since it doesn t impair the fun of the game that much but it can be a little annoying to constantly have to grind for something else you re missing as i m pretty sure if this was a p2p game that this grind wouldn t be anywhere near as grueling as it is the game has pretty in depth customization in terms of how you upgrade everything but also in just customizing the look of your warframe your weapons your pets your ship and everything that s yours the only pain is that a lot of the cosmetics are entirely microtransactions this is another downfall of the f2p system is that you ll have to pay to unlock different colors and ornaments and other fancy looking things overall warframe is a very fun game despite its bugs and shortcomings it s definitely something to be played cooperatively it s biggest flaw really is just the grind it is a boatload of fun in just about every other aspect though i give it an 8 10 it s one of the most fun games i ve played in a while and it s something any action lover with a friend or three should try out it s free after all why not give it a shot at least,119.9,27.0,7,Recommended,"August 21, 2017",Warframe,Resoula,False

46372,2014 pros nice graphicsgreat variety of warframes and weaponsand it s free cons ninjas play free more like mindless drones collecting resources so they can make better gear to collect more resources with play free even though the game is free to play there is only very little you can t buy with real money as in you can either spend 3 4 days depending on how much do you play farming for resources to get a new warframe character class and then spend another 2 3 days building it or you can just buy it for 20 dollarsthe game does everything in its power to make you throw money at it want a pet you can either farm for an egg which can drop from dens present only on one planet usually found in quantities of 4 per mission then you have to farm for credits and resource obtainable only in special area accessible only with a key received from several missions as a random reward then you have to craft an item to even begin the breeding and then you have to wait 4 days before your pet matures or you can throw money at the game to bypass all this but that s not all if you happen to not play the game for a while your pet will die because you have to feed it with item that costs quite a lot of credits there was also a new resource introduced some time ago which drops only from one enemy in the game that also happens to attempt suicide whenever he sees you to make you even angrier and drop money to bypass boring grindcash shop is incredibly overpriced 40 dollars for a discounted pack with three weapons out of which only one is good and a color palette weapons in that pack also have extremely small chance of dropping from a single enemy in the game who happens to be someone who can and more often than not will kill you before you even notice coincidence maybe those color palettes cost about 4 dollars each and there is about 10 in the store the game is focused on grinding and farming if you want to play high level content you have to level up some gear and farm credits and resources to get your mastery rank up so you can then start farming resources for the good gun viable in high level missions so you can grind and farm even more to get even better weapons so you can grind all the mods and credits faster so you can repeat the whole process more effectivelygame is intentionally gear based literally no amount of skill can help you if you don t have good gear modsbosses are just bullet sponges with the weakspot mechanicdrop tables are diluted especially when new gear comes outgames are hosted on players computers so expect heavy lag and common disconnectstl drif you enjoy doing the same boring and tedious thing over and over and over again this game is probably for you on the other hand if you don t like being ripped off by greedy developer you should look somewhere else,510.3,94.0,7,Not Recommended,"November 8, 2014",Warframe,"MasterDeBunker

47085,2014 this may be tldr but do not worry i am going to break it dowin in to category nicley note that there are good and bad things about pretty much every categorygameplayfor the most part the gameplay is smooth and very resoponcive as the player is given access to three weapons to take in to battle a primary weapon a pistol and a sword or duel swords the shooting mechanics are a bit ordinary hold right click to zoom in all that jazz as the sword play at first is just as ordinary with sword play advances further with combos and such like things as one furthers themselves in the game note that there is only one combo unlock per stance so it does not progress that much although a well balanced sword can out damage most weapons in game with that aside this game will take you to a lot of different planets known and unknown alike on these planets every single mission is basically on one giant map cut in to different sections as some are reused or a player is simply spawned on the oposit side thn they were before so needless to say one planet means one look that you will get tired of really fast some on top of that are built in facilitys that make the dungeouns very constrictive so do not have your hopes up for a visually pleasing level design not to mention that most maps have a horrible layout that makes it impossible to take advantage of the jumping mechanics in this game such as wall running except for in particular portions where it is needed to cross a map it makes the mechanic feel like a gimmic and it plays as one as well the jump mechanics for the most part are terrible one of the most difficult challenges in the game is jumping from one platform to a higher platform because half the time the character will run up a wall and do a back flip leaving you further away from an objective or if one is taking fire from an enemy and wishes to dispatch him it takes at least 2 seconds to get up that small ledge as proper enemies can take away a large portion of health shield given that opertunity craftingnow this is the insentive to keep you going every single weapon in this game can be crafted as well as warframes for the most part it is enjoyable to grind through missions in hopes to get that last rare matterial needed for an item that will finally progress a character the down side is if you are planning on playing for free be prepared to wait a lot there is a wait period for every item crafted which would not be too bad except the least one has to wait is 10 hours most weapons take at least a full 24 hours and warframes take a whole 3 days they claim this game is not pay to win but they sure as hell put a lot of insentive on paying players geting what they want faster for example free player grinds for blueprints fights boss three times in hopes of getting all blueprints for warframe 2 hours max grinds for all crafing matterials as well as cash 5 hours at least begins crafting warframe pieces all at once 12 hours warframe pieces are done begin final blueprint craft for warframe not like they could just let you put them together right thn and there after all those hours 3 day wait period that is the free to play model right there coopnow this game is hard to play alone but it does start you off with 12 revives and rewards players with 4 revives daily so thats a nice litte feature to keep ya going coop is a must in this game and it is 50 50 the community is good and willing to help out with a lot of nice people but more often thn not if one runs with random players they are going to have a bad time there are not that many new players in this game beyond the existing community so a majority of people one will find themselves teaming up with are vets with awesome gear and way op weapons which will drain the experiance from this game drastically as one runs missions trying to hunt for matterials to build a warframe these players will treat every mission as a race and dash to the finish line leaving you in the dust if you explore and look for loot you will not get any kills simply stumble across the map seeing an endless amount of dead bodies left behind every time this type of gameplay does not reward you with anything if one feels the need to explore and actually look around it is best to play with a friend or go in alone but if you do not care and let them race themselves to a red light that is fine go ahead and explore just beware once they get to that red light a countdown eventually begins that will take you away from exploring and eject you from the mission on top of that every other mission has a side objective with a nice cash bonus prize usually in the form of kills get 3 kills in 10 seconds get 5 kills while sliding get 30 kills with rifle things of that nature i enjoy this idea but with random racers joining in every other match they hog kills and assume you are not trying to complete that objective nor will they ask you the so called cooperation turns in to a competitive challenge which one can say goodbye to all crafting hunts and focus on beating this random player to the kills it can be entertaining but it forces one to play at a different pace and a different playstyle thn they may be used to and happening to often that it just does not seem worth it pay to win in the grand scheme it is a little pay to win that is for sure they claim that there are items that one cannot buy but must find through drops in the world i have yet to have come across any such thing i would not say that this game is pay to win but more like an over aptitude to push payment as the best option to play if there is something in the game you get they will have an option to pay pay to get rid of wait time on crafting materials pay to bypass crafting and get the item you want now pay for more revives hell pay for rare crafting items as well pay to unlock my color options for color pallet pay to get a new warframe now without wait there is just too much micro transactions that it constantly punishes player for not paying every little feature one can buy plus the prices oh my god the prices are horrible the lower end things cost around 5 dollars but warframes and weapons are expensive as they have warframes going for over 20 dollarsand you bet ya that those warframes are damn near impossible to get in game through drops this is what you are dealing with while going in to this game i for one like this game a lot it is creative and fun but destiny is right around the corner and is this x10 with no micro transactions this is a good game but way too many cons and way too many things they want you to spend money on i am sorry bot i will not recommend this game for the reasons listed,285.2,17.0,1,Not Recommended,"August 28,

47135,2021 the grind does not equate to the quality of the rewards anything deemed too efficient or fun by the devs gets nerfed into oblivion players find the next best alternative rinse and repeat and the game becomes boring real quick,605.5,21.0,4,Not Recommended,"October 4, 2021",Warframe,Furious Monkey Fucker,False
47168,2017 let me tell you why i do not recommend playing wf if you re looking to game seriously i started playing warframe in 2013 it was utter tbh and in 2017 they have improved soooo much i m honestly really impressed with de the quests are awesome gameplay is fun in the beginning and you can earn plat easily with a bit of farm here is what s bad there is no endgame people have always come with the excuse fashionframe is endgame but honestly even de mentioned that the endgame in warframe is a huge problem they released trials which no one gives a single about basically when you get mastery rank 23 through lvl weps and warframes there is literally the same things to do as in rank 1 so pros fun gameplay in the beginning great quests earn in game cash easily great optimazation well updatedcon repetitive gameplay grinding no end game feels unfullfilling,251.8,48.0,3,Not Recommended,"June 6, 2017",Warframe,sportshugo,False

48330,2022 the good news is that warframe is free and you can actually play through all of the content without paying the bad news is that the gameplay is extremely repetitive and boring there are a couple enemy factions with their own locations but beyond that every level looks and plays the same and you will carry out the same missions over and over guided by a thin veneer of a story that is not interesting or meaningful in the least when the game came out 9 years ago the movement fighting mechanics and graphics felt fresh but it has really not changed since then and now just feels dated not to mention hard to pick up for a newcomer with its overwhelming amount of content warframe 2 is long overdue but hopefully it will be a more handcrafted experience and digital extremes will not leave everything to the rng generator next time,71.8,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 23, 2022",Warframe,"Nucular

48331,2019 tl dr a solo mmo full of complex mechanics and grinding which ultimately falls flat due to digital extremes lack of imagination and skill in utilising a solid system avoid if you expect any sort of social experience enjoy if you just want to grind gear and kill the same 3 races of enemies over and over while comparing the size of your pp with random people in clan alliance region chat do not expect any form of team play spending money not a must but highly advised unless you are immortal mr19 3 months time spent in missions 555 hours the game is very intriguing and unfamiliar at first it takes a while to understand its hidden mechanics and optimal ways to play it that didn t discourage me since i m used to using game wikis i rather enjoy complex game mechanics and there are plenty in wf at the beginning the weird story revealed through quests that shed some light on the strange universe drew me in i quickly realised that it s better to set matchmaking to solo otherwise the mission objectives are accomplished by higher level players before you even understand what s going on and what you need to do but that doesn t go on for long by the end of your second planet you are familiar with almost all the game modes and can use the help of random players when fighting your way through the star chart fast forward 3 months of intense play focused on optimising the time spent in game and rushing to the end game content i realised it s more efficient to set matchmaking to solo again because people are either bad which can ruin runs in a couple game modes or slow which is what you re trying to avoid in a game that is doing everything it can to prolong your play time with grinding and rng this might not sound too terrible but this is a pve mmo an mmo where solo mode is the best way to do things efficiently in the end that is not the current state of the game it is built into its foundation the only reason you want to play with other people is to increase enemy spawn numbers so you can increase the amount of drops resources gained or when opening relics since it expands your reward options resources become a non problem after you get to a high enough level after unlocking all the content in the game you only need kuva for rolling rivens endo for upgrading mods and prime parts for the trader baro ki teer that shows up every 2 weeks i expected this game to have some semblence of a hard cooperative game mode a game mode where people need to communicate plan set up specific builds maybe something similar to rpgs where you have dedicated roles like tank dps support crowd control etc the only game mode that requires any real planning is eidolon hunting the loop revolving around how to get you started is ridiculous you need to hunt eidolons in order to be able to hunt eidolons efficiently then you hunt eidolons some more so you can hunt eidolons even more efficiently they are a closed loop with barely any impact on anything outside of them the talent focus trees they help you unlock are mostly 90 used for upgrading your operator which is used only when fighting eidolons and one other boss in the game and pressing two buttons in kuva siphons floods for which you need 0 focus upgrades in the last year and a half 18 months after they introduced the second open world area orb vallis fortuna there has been zero new content added de are only making little balancing tweaks and changes adding a new frame and weapon every few months they ve added a game mode disruption which is anything but refreshing although it at least has the highest reward potential of all the game modes speed wise adding weapons and frames is welcome but those are just tools used to accomplish goals for me content equals new goals new missions new bosses new quests new mechanics changes done to balancing shadow rendering and recycling existing content does not equal new content two weeks ago they have finally implemented the first part of the dreaded melee 3 0 changes and now i know why they were dreaded they have completely annihilated the current melee meta utterly nerfed range on the large weapons made two of the most used mods obsolete and made melee weapons far less enjoyable overall i was never focused on melee so it didn t affect my play style but i was hoping it would open up more possibilities not simply nerf the strongest ones this has had the reverse effect melee is even less not more appealing that is de s modus operandi it seems they introduce powerful gear into the game high level people spend days of in game time to farm upgrade and use that gear en masse de dislikes the weapons are so popular de nerfs the best weapons so people are forced to use the weapons that are subpar this is not a good way of broadening viable options this ties in directly with their concept of game difficulty they believe that making the game more difficult equates to stripping the players of their hard earned power a direct example of this is the way you get your hands on the newest released frame grendel they force you to play 3 different game modes without any mods the mods you ve been farming this entire time spending weeks to perfect this is not only disheartening tiresome and boring it shows a complete lack of imagination it s simply not fun then there are the new liches this is supposed to be regarded as new content fine let s say it is you play any grineer mission of a certain level to have a chance of spawning an enemy killing it spawns your personal lich that is randomly generated based on the frame you used to kill it then you need to grind kuva siphon missions to have a 50 chance only recently raised from 30 chance of gaining one of four requiem relics relics complete lack of imagination yet again then you need to farm all the relics to get the 2 uncommon drops from each of them max 40 chance per relic which makes 8 mods in total then you need to grind random missions to gain information on which order to use 3 of the 8 mods in in order to be able to finally kill the lich or just stick random mods into random slots and hope for the best everything regarding liches happens in already existing game modes in already existing missions in already existing tile sets fighting already existing enemies that are very very slightly altered the reward an existing weapon slightly altered by randomly generating a bonus stat this is not new content this was the final straw that has led me to abandon this game the potential seems huge but they are doing nothing to expand the experience instead opting to recycle and tweak the shallow content which you discover in your first 100 hours of play i have zero confidence in digital extremes ability to make content that would make me excited to ever play this game
