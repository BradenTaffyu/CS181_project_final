48538,2023 this game is absolutely terrible warzone gets all of the content while the people who actually pay for the main game get shafted by the developers and get fed scraps all game decisions are driven by some secret internal algorithm that activision uses to maximize profit from cosmetics and keep players playing as long as possible this makes every single game released since the birth of warzone feel soulless and directionless in comparison to before people who keep buying the fully priced dlc they call games they will be releasing is primarily the problem however too many call of duty fans love getting fed their yearly slop and cry out why criticize the game just don t play it because they lack the critical thinking skills required to understand that you can criticize a game without hating the entire franchise activision consistently and repeatedly overworks its developers and stifles actual creativity most obviously apparent in the zombies mode offerings in cold war every single zombies map was at least 50 reused assets from the campaign which then progressed into vanguard being this extremely terrible attempt at a small scale outbreak with a single round based map thrown in there which was also a remake to now modern warfare iii zombies is quite literally just warzone dmz with zombies put in as an environmental hazard there are no rounds you have 60 minutes to play or you get kicked out there are 24 people on the map but it is entirely pve the execs at activision are the worst executives i have ever seen in the video gaming industry shamelessly forcing the developers of call of duty to implement the worst most unfun features into their games to try and optimize their backend numbers which shows that people spend money on microtransactions which in reality are macrotransactions you should not support this game or support activision blizzard each game released gets lazier and lazier while activision cries out about how it s the largest and most innovative offering yet when in reality it s the sloppiest and most soulless please spend your money on something better than this,380.1,839.0,11,Not Recommended,"18 August, 2023",Call of Duty®,"Astradave

48572,2023 while clearly crafted with care in some respects i cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this game the reason behind that is what exactly you are buying a pretty okay campaign that is a somewhat worthwhile way to kill 10 hours and the crux of this review a dilapidated abandoned mistreated unfinished barren wasteland of a classic multiplayer experience if you like warzone and plan on just playing warzone then just play warzone there is no reason at all to buy this game they treat classic multiplayer like it s just warzone weapon leveling simulator and the problem with that is the perfectly good other wz weapon leveling simulator that is also free dmz if all you care about is leveling weapons for wz look up farming tutorials to use in dmz if on the other hand you were hoping that by purchasing this game you can get access to a quality classic multiplayer experience the likes of which we had a decade ago you will find yourself sorely disappointed and betrayed i was going to go into great depth to show just how lazily classic multiplayer has been treated but honestly it s not worth any more time than i ve already wasted writing this review just settle on this the game feels like it has 4 maps there is no 9v9 or 10v10 post launch seasonal content focuses 95 on wz and dmz the free aspects of the game lobbies disband after every game which opens the door to predatory retention based matchmaking that transparently attempts to get you hooked in a perpetually up dopamine down dopamine cycle etc i m upset because the game had so much potential to be special i hadn t played a cod game since the first black ops before i got this game and i was really excited to get hooked on this game after seeing how much content and support mw2019 got on launch and post launch but after the release of what classic multiplayer content they are offering in season 2 it s clear that classic multiplayer is absolutely dead and basically just in maintenance mode at this point four months after launch it s just sad and there is absolutely no excuse for classic multiplayer in this franchise which consistently makes a billion dollars once a year to get shafted like this,147.6,986.0,17,Not Recommended,"February 11, 2023",Call of Duty®,HandsomeAwkward,False

48588,2023 this is mainly a review of the multiplayer and a mention of the campaign i have not played warzone past the bare minimum man i really wanted to love this one i ve been an avid call of duty player since 2013 and have a range of opinions on all the games in the series but this has got to be the biggest letdown of them all all of the trailers and promotional material really set my expectations high and given it is a sequel to one of the best cod games modern warfare 2019 i was expecting a lot from this release then the game released i don t know where to start to begin the ui is terrible instead of the clean and concise menus of mw 2019 where all of the option can be clearly seen this game opts for a side scrolling mess i guess the developers didn t get the memo that literally no other games are doing this or chose to ignore it to become different either way it sucks this menu style isn t just for the main menu oh no this is done for the class creation menus as well and for the class selection at the start of every game its messy and constrictive the weapons and equipment range from you are actively disadvantaging yourself by using this to you d be stupid not to use it a good example of the former is the tactical camera field upgrade as the game calls it the worse piece of equipment from black ops 1 comes back as the worst piece of equipment in this game it is incredibly situational such as watching an angle while you camp another or watch as a domination flag gets captured because your teammates won t play the objective you could be using any other field upgrade like dead silence which silences your footsteps but not before alerting everyone around you that its being used the weapon progression system is bad too this game introduces the idea of weapon platforms in which similar weapons such as the ak 47 and the ak 74u can have interchangeable components meaning you can switch from assault rifle to sub machine gun without having to reconfigure the gun from scratch this would be a good idea except it doesn t take all that long to do a reconfigure and the majority of the time you will be switching gun to level it up which means none of the components will carry over in addition some guns are locked behind another gun s level progression rather than player level i could go on but i wanted to talk about his games main issue skill based matchmaking if you didn t know this is a type of matchmaking that grabs players of similar skill levels and matches them up into a lobby this means you will always be playing against those with equal skill to you that s the idea anyway in execution its much worse this type of matchmaking breeds two distinct groups smurfs meaning those who purposely throw games to be put in lobbies of worse players and sweaty try hards who seem to think their life is on the line in every match thus play like they have severe adhd if you have a good match well done your prize is having the next match filled with bot teammates and the best enemy team you ve ever seen this is bad for an avid player like myself but its downright unplayable for the more casual players the tired businessman wanting to unwind after a long day or the new players who have never played a cod game in their life and though it would be a fun game to play relating to this skill based matchmaking will ensure that your friend in a party with you who is level 30 while you re level 300 will have an awful time my next point of contention is the ricochet anti cheat software the game uses to catch cheaters it doesn t work or rather its highly inconsistent the player who just so happens to aim his gun at you despite having zero indication you were there the player with the ghost perk active before its timer runs out the player who just blatantly doesn t take damage when you shoot him and don t bother expecting activision or infinity ward to read your reports because they could not care less and that really the best way to describe this game the developers simply do not care why bother with the multiplayer when warzone battle royale is such a cash cow to add to this if it saves money on development then why bother buying the licenses for all the gun names that s right the game series that started the trend of contemporary military shooters with real gun names didn t pay the licensing rights for any of the guns in their game that may look like an mp5 or an ak but its not just trust me dude its even more of a joke because they didn t do this for mw 2019 i could actually go on all day about even more gripes i have such as the useless game modes no one plays the lacklustre co op missions the horribly boring pve raids or the actual false advertising in their content promises but this review is very very long there are positives if you can believe it the campaign is quite good if a little unmemorable the gun play is actually quite good most are fun to fire and the quick draw mechanic on pistols leads to some really cool moments a la the john wick 2 catacombs scene the graphics are awesome little details like reflections in gold guns and the detail in the maps really goes to show that at least a few people working on this game enjoyed making it its just a damn shame about the rest of it and i think we can all agree its time to let the battle royale genre die,516.5,566.0,12,Not

48607,2023 december 18 update i have failed i have fallen under the pressure of my friends and joined the dark side while mw3 was 30 off december 6 update for mw3 season 1 so now warzone is disconnected from being standalone linked to mw2 and now accessible from the cod hq so no more application instance jumping for that dmz is still confused one place it says it s part of warzone the next is says it s part of mw2 but once you are in dmz the only option is to instance hop like a bunny back to cod hq bunny hopping is still very real if you want to play mw2 which is completely unaceptable there no reason we can t have access to all within cod hq for mw3 wz dmz mw2 i ll still play it but i m not buying mw3 unless they bring foward a new raid and actual improvement to ui user experience original review the recent update bring a subpar ui to something even worse you are forced into mw3 cod hq before going anywhere even if you haven t bought it and which is no longer integrated with mw2 or warzone so if you select one or the other it shut down to desktop to open a new instance of the software want to switch from mw2 to warzone for some dmz or battle royale you have to go back to mw3 cod hq which means mw2 shutdown open mw3 shut down open warzone dmz when i tried to get out of dmz it didn t even go back to warzone instead doing the shutdown reopen cycle this is unaceptable and this is a step back,709.6,197.0,4,Not Recommended,"November 9, 2023",Call of Duty®,deathguy,False

48617,2023 i would write a full review but i d rather not spend more time on this game than i already have anyways here s a list of fun facts 1 cod has fallen from grace 2 activision is a company that only cares about money and is nothing but sexual predators who make women kill themselves 3 bobby kotick looks like the word burgundy and i d rather look at my own unshaven after i ve just taken a 4 they are doing everything in their power to cover their tracks by renaming this to just call of duty for convenience purposes or whatever the hell but actually they re doing it so that way they can hide the mixed and negative reviews in later releases 5 all of the bundles are overpriced and half of them look like 6 they really tried to bring players back by doing a collab with the boys but it was actually the most boring thing ever and they couldn t even get antony starr to give them original voicelines so they used some from the show and used some z list voice actor on fiverr to do the rest 7 nicki minaj is a sex offender music sucks too 8 21 savage is a felon music sucks too 9 re releasing snoop dogg as another overpriced bundle is their way of questioning your intelligence buying it means you re stupid 10 infinity ward has been lying to you since before the game dropped they ll continue to lie to you until they pay for it 11 i ve had more fun writing this review than i have in the 362 hours i ve spent playing this game 12 i recently went back and played call of duty vanguard and had more fun playing that than i did this plus the ui didn t make me want to punch an infant 13 treyarch has been carrying this cod as they are the only team in this game that actually cares about the community it s true they are in charge of ranked play and have responded to the community more than activision has regarding their lawsuits 14 i am uninstalling this heaping pile of and if they actually make this the main hub for future cod titles including treyarch s next masterpiece they will never see my bank card again 15 this is the last fun fact just like this is the last time cod will ever reach over 80k players thanks for coming to my review i will leave comments open because unlike activision and infinity ward i like feedback,452.5,931.0,107,Not Recommended,"August 5, 2023",Call of Duty®,"Cedan

48657,2023 only reason i play it is because i paid 70 for it here is what i have experienced so far 1 if you re good at this game activision will make sure you are not whether the skill based damage is true or not i have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun with no attachments one shots me also no matter what gun you use you will always be beaten by a pistol especially a revolved get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big how 2 if you bought the battle pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers congratulations now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them or quit the game and restart it to use them every time you earn a token it doesn t register so you have to relaunch the game 3 if enemy team talks during the match in between rounds on s d or after the match you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time until you quit the game and restart 4 whoever designed the ui my god hideous you remember back in bo1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away well now you have to scroll to get to the other half scroll this is very minor but still how did older cods have better uis than this reminds me of that scene from the movie ready player one when they put up all the ads on the screen look it up 5 the players are the same no explanation you know exactly what i mean we all do they don t play any different here overall 70 for this is not worth it at all this game does have many small issues but many small issues is not better than one big issue you would ve had more fun buying playing cyberpunk 2077 on launch day if you re considering buying this game don t do it now i have fun maybe 30 of the time but i can t let 70 go to waste edit steam told me i played an additional 11 hours and asked me to revise my review here s my revision still sucksedit allowing comments but only if you re a cod mwii hater just like mefinal edit this game is i am uninstalling forever,206.6,429.0,37,Not Recommended,"January 2, 2023",Call of Duty®,⍙ Luna ⍙,False

48687,2022 not worth it at all ever since those infamous patents were leaked from cod ww2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point you re simply not allowed to have fun not a single chance you perform good in one match the game is gonna punish you for the following 4 5 matches skill based match making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels if sbmm was really working the way it was supposed to then explain me why 90 of the matches i m playing my team is full of room temperature iq players and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level why is this happening literally 9 10 matches every single time it s the same scenario since the game got released also if there is a ranked playlist called call of duty league why is sbmm present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times isn t the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience why is it prioritizing k d and w l ratio for matchmaking instead of ping extra note for sbmm why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby m4a1 needs 4 bullets deals 28 damage but sometimes i m getting 4 hitmarkers and i need a fifth bullet while in close quarters what is this infinity ward for some reason on this cod you cannot disable crossplay yes you read that right you cannot opt out of playing with console players now why would you do that you ask i don t know maybe because on this cod the aim assist controller players have is absolutely and i can t emphasize it enough way too strong like i can t bother calling it aim assist anymore it s aimbot for real it s aimbot you ll see them having the worst type of movement and the moment you re slightly next to their crosshair you re done they don t even have to ads it works even when hip firing you simply cannot escape it press f to respawn because the way they lock on into you with 100 accuracy there s no way you can win the gunfight sometimes even if you shoot first i get it controller needs something to help players with the fact that they re using just their thumbs to aim but i don t want to be a part of this i don t want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he ll be able to get kills it s simply way too strong and there are plenty of videos exposing this what i find the most irritating is why could we turn off crossplay on previous cods and now it s not possible isn t the game having the most pc players ever on the franchise because of the steam battle net combo some tl dr for you pros good gunplay good animations weapon family trees for leveling up your weapons many weapon camos attachments to unlock amd s fsr works pretty wellcons sbmm no crossplay opt out choice inconsistent footsteps audio no stopping power as a perk no ninja dead silence as a perk matches feel rigged edit 18 08 2024 so after many extra hours and upon reaching max level the more time i spent playing this the more it reinforced what i and many others have already said before to sum it up i ll explain what happened in a random weekday night that is basically the experience i ve had with this game this one year and a half me and one of my friends are playing prisoner rescue for a two hour session in the night first hour goes fine we re both making good scores and we have a 7 game win streak we re seeing some new players and some old matches play fine with no problem nothing out of the ordinary happening now the second hour we re playing we re starting to both see a lot of irregularities with the game we re getting teammates that are acting like they re playing a shooter game for the first time in their lives while the enemy team is either a 4 stack a 5 stack or a full party of 6 going against me and my friend it s a 2vs6 situation and the moment both me and my teammate go down we know the round is over our weapons suddently have more recoil than usual hit registration is abusmal but only for me and my friend enemy weapons get such a fast ttk it feels like a single frame death meanwhile our weapons suddenly need more bullets than normal to finish someone i was using g3a3 and my friend was using scar h and both our guns took 3 hitmarkers and requiered a 4th shot from a battle rifle at medium range while both of us are using the extended barrels for more range also packet loss white color and packet burst orange color was appearing every few seconds for both of us but only for the 2nd half of our gaming session and of course let s not

48701,2022 to start off apparently i am one of the lucky ones who have only had the occasional crash but after a weekend of extensive play and early access to the campaign i feel like i can write about this game now if you like mw2019 or onwards you ll probably like this game but if you are a fan of the golden age of cod its time to stop buying these new cod games it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one they are pandering to us the old guard of cod haha and will continue to push this disgusting micro transaction live service model of modern gaming you probably don t need me to tell you it ain t like it used to be campaign was fine some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy multiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but ttk is fast possibly fastest we have seen graphics are great feels like it runs better than previous new cods regardless its more of the same safe new cod that you probably either already love or hate if i could give this a score out of 10 i would probably say 7 10 but it would score higher if there weren t so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers but loses points for predatory marketing practices why did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous cods on the chance that you are new to cod and have not purchased one before don t start here and avoid giving this company your money probably gonna keep playing but that s only really because of halo infinite and battlefield 2042 flopping hard yay modern aaa gaming,177.7,775.0,28,Not Recommended,"November 1, 2022",Call of Duty®,"GoldenJalapeno

48704,2023 at the launch of call of duty modern warfare 3 i had little to zero intentions of buying the title for a price tag as oblivious as 70 00 usd especially as someone who typically purchases call of duty titles for a specific game mode in this case i would have only bought it at first glance for the zombies mode i decided to purchase the title once the game had gone on sale for 48 00 the campaign for this year s release was overall subpar in my opinion the previous campaigns for the call of duty franchise had more elements of cinematic game play that truly made moments in the story more vibrant and intriguing to indulge into in addition to the lack of meaningful storytelling i would also have to agree when others and i myself say that the campaign was far too short contributing to the feeling of being shortchanged for the value of the game with a retail price of 70 00 bits and pieces of nostalgia arose when i played the multiplayer modes of the title the mechanics are spectacular as you feel a sensation of freedom being able to maneuver without the restrictions that were present in the previous title call of duty modern warfare ii i do not concur with the reviews for down voting the game due to the presence of skilled based matchmaking sbmm a lot of complaints i hear about video games having sbmm i just want to relax and casually win games against people that aren t sweats it s harder for me to get clips whether it is a content creator small time big time or someone that just wants to show off games like call of duty are supposed to be competitive in my opinion especially being an first person shooter fps title in my point of view if you are being placed against people that are just as good as you or even better that should be a motivating factor for you to improve be better it simply seems as if everyone nowadays just want handouts for subpar performance quality my first impressions were thrilling everything was new different levels of zones was in a way intimidating for a solid 10 15 matches it was great to catch on to little things i did not know about the game mode until i learned bits and pieces of information from someone else or through exploring being able to level up your weapons in not only multiplayer but also the zombies mode is a great selling point for me as i never have to worry about the feeling of missing out fomo and can simultaneously progress several portions of the game in one however it is important to note that at the current time of writing you can only progress your weapon s 10 levels in one match before you are capped i would definitely recommend this game mode to hardcore zombies fans of the franchise as yes i understand that it does not follow the traditional style of the franchises zombies but it is something new and a good new a refreshing experience for those who are looking for something different in zombies or burnt out on the previous franchises zombies i felt that it was a must that include this header for the topic of the game s mechanics and how they work as a lot of the functionality may affect if a certain demographic of players would find this to be a deterrent from their purchase as of writing in modern warfare 3 2023 there are a few changes in addition to how the overall aim and aiming down sights work a lot of the information i will be referencing is contributed by my firsthand experience as well as the points made from this video youtube video warzone why does aiming feel so bad in wz 3 mw3 16 fps games compared views 396 856 link to download our new tgd mobile app thank you all for the support and for whatever reason the game is moving towards a more realistic mil sim like game play which call of duty has never been known for the weapons reticles will never be centered when you aim down sights and will fly everywhere when you strafe jump prone and move your input mouse or right thumb stick i personally would not have much of a problem with this if it was not for the fact that controller players are not affected by this as much as mouse and keyboard players this is the unbalanced aim assist that people reference when they exclaim how excruciatingly unfair it is to play against controller players because i as a mouse and keyboard player myself must skillfully compensate for the little variables and factors to make my aim perfect when on the other hand a controller player has computer generated assistance to not have the same problems as a mouse and keyboard player does the point i am trying to convey here is that it really seems like as the call of duty franchise progresses there is a oblivious message being portrayed that message being more favoritism over controller players vs mouse and keyboard players on top of the fact that the title was retail priced at 70 00 consumers may opt to purchase the vault edition that came with the game for a total of 100 00 i am truly failing to see how anyone producing this title believed that this would be satisfactory to any and all consumers of the franchise it is clear that activision no longer wishes to hide from the criticisms of many consumers for being a poorly managed company built upon greed added bonus also being a company that has a history with tolerating sexual harassment sexual assault and inappropriate behavior in a workplace environment controller players once again have a oblivious advantage over mouse and keyboard players and i may be biased because i am a mouse and keyboard player myself but if you really stop to think about the amount of accommodations given to controller players it does not add up to the overall equal playing field between the two inputs i would not recommend this game simply because of the retail price of 70 00 because it does not meet the quality that deserves the preset amount the campaign is subpar everything within the game looks to be easily copied and pasted over and the greed displayed through heavy focus of micro transactions instead of focusing on the quality and originality of the game for a retail price of 30 00 this would have been a reasonable purchase,63.8,243.0,8,Not Recommended,"December 18, 2023",Call of

48738,2022 this is a reveiw literally the second day after the games full release ill be sure to change it as they improve and update the game there will be spoilers for the campaign first the game currently is a 3 5the campaign is fantastic lots of variety and levels that really suck you in as you pull covert operations or go guns blazing in crazy gunfights a bit disappointing that farah is mentioned for one level hadir or alex are never mentioned or seen questions and concerns from the first game arent really addressed in this game but overall it was a wonderful experience the multiplayeras of posting this 10 29 2022the multi is good most of the maps on release are actually not bad at all i really like the racewway and border checkpoint maps the guns feel good look good even pistols got a bit of love in terms of firepower and range which is nice all of the base ops are unlockable via challenges and theres a great amount of them providing players some personal customization which is great if some really dont want to spend the money of characters when theyre all just cosmetic i also really really like how camos are done know with each gun having four camos which when unlocked through a much simpler camo challenge are unlocked for all guns no longer having to grind every gun out for the same camos over and over and over doing mundane repetitive and sometimes frustrating challenges just to reach the mastery camos one of the biggest problems however is currently the game is having a bit of a glitchy release 1 the game is very prone to crashing i think if youre graphics settings cant meet a requirement sometimes the game just kills itself and i have to sit for up to 10 minutes just waiting for steam to verify the game files for the umpteenth time 2 camos are glitching out i spent all day grinding out the camo challenges excitedly to get the gold camo for the m4 just to see that i am unable to select any of the mastery camos to see if ive unlocked the gold camo challenge3 the voice channels is a very good idea it allows friends playing through crossplay to talk and play together in game so that all parties can still hear the game since things like discord and skype or pc and phone only problems is its broken there were so many times where we kept getting muted after loading into match no matter how we set our vc preference we couldnt hear one person but he could hear us and i was hoping that the vc would be prioritized whether you were loading in or in a match while your friend wasnt he has a ps4 so takes a bit longer to load in but i cant hear or talk to him until hes loading into the match 4 there is a severe lack of content im unsure if maybe iw is waiting until season one before releasing a bunch of content but we are missing quite a bit compared to the beta executions that were seen from most operators in the beta have been removed so that everyone all has the same one i unlocked the beta skin for horangi but am unable to access his base skin so far it seems only the milsim ops have customizable skins there was alot of hype and speculation that a few popular guns such as the honey badger was going to be added to the game but its not there think it was even usable in the campaign but i may have been confused but its likely they removed it from the start of the game to use it as a season 1 weapon so far the game is good but not great its prone to bugs and glitches and breaks and needs a bit more post release polish which i think we all hope to see within the coming weeks and hopefully not having to wait for fixes until nov 16th sorry for the awful review this is my first time writing a legitimate one and i had pretty much know clue how to convey everything clear and concise tell me im stupid if it helps,840.9,151.0,15,Recommended,"October 29, 2022",Call of Duty®,"Knights

48742,2022 i m going to split my review of call of duty modern warfare ii into a single player and multiplayer section i ll start with the campaign the campaign was an enjoyable filler experience emphasis on filler for me and nothing more than that i felt like at times the campaign went from awesome to cringe awesome to cringe over and over again some of the missions were super cool e g recon by fire whilst others were quite cringe e g violence and timing this mission especially felt like something taken out of a bollywood film felt quite unnatural and out of place to be honest this year there was clearly a heavy emphasis on stealth like missions which personally fell in good taste but some might dislike that alone on the hardest difficulty and doing the achievement that requires you to not fire a gun was one of the toughest challenges i have had in a long time the biggest selling point for me must be the sheer attention to detail in things like level design the amsterdam level is absolutely gorgeous gun animations etc and my personal favourite the sound design the sound of the guns impact of the grenades flash bangs in this game is truly art the guns and explosives genuinely feel powerful and effective compared to other years where they might sound more toy like tl dr decent campaign at best nothing mesmerising that will stick with you forgettable but good filler experience a good bonus to the multiplayer it is worth adding that the game ran beautifully on my 3070 i5 11400 pc and throughout a 7 5 hour campaign i experienced around 3 crashes which in my eyes is not that bad given how games are these days just 3 crashes is considered polished now for the part everyone really buys call of duty for the multiplayer as far as level design goes i am on the fence some of the maps are quite good like al bagra fortress farm 18 and el asilo where others leave more to be desired visually speaking they are all gorgeous to look at but some of them play horribly and i am not a fan personally though this is of course subjective honestly there is not much to say about the multiplayer aspect of the game as of right now if you enjoyed modern warfare 2019 you will most likely enjoy this game too and get a good few hours of fun from this game,501.4,485.0,20,Recommended,"October 28, 2022",Call of Duty®,"h8koN

48748,2022 comments off because i know the community edit how come when i shoot someone it s like i ve opened up a box of captain dunce oops all hitmarkers and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of times it just erases my existence i just cannot have fun on here even as a team anymore with the sbmm and eomm i get punished immediately if i do slightly good in a match by being thrown in matches with people that just on me the entire time people complain that movement is slow and terrible but it s not if it was then explain why sliding and shooting around corners or jumping and shooting is the strategy movement is still super fast and stupid just like before shields and knives are near impossible to counter their feet are covered can t flank because they will rush and kill you can t throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you thanks all i want is to jump into matches and have fun no not just stomp everyone that s not fun i want to have fun i want varied lobbies showing that people aren t just bots it doesn t help that the aim assist actually tracks for you with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not if your aim starts to move on it s own you just aim and fire and you re gonna get the kill i position myself better and shoot first doesn t matter enemy moves around causing me to have to manually track them with my mouse and eyes while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake while they can just slightly tilt r stick down and fire flinch damn right that i do but when you have aim assist the tracking pretty much counters it there s nothing fun about it i am only playing it for fear of missing out and since i already bought the damn thing the campaign was fun but that alone isn t worth what i paid i am not ok and this game is making worse it is infuriating by design i can t even get good games anymore what is the new good for me is if i am close to breaking even before i could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where i actually do good now it s just getting wrecked at spawn or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has uav that works through ghost or i shoot someone first hit them twice and they snap and melt me with their braindead controller aim assist,153.9,432.0,56,Not Recommended,"November 2, 2022",Call of Duty®,"Ahroovi

48761,2023 yeah i mean you already know what i m going to say i really can t recommend it even if it s to play with friends and hang out that s the reason i bought this game in the first place conclusion after putting in a good amount of time into this game i can safely say that the developers actively hate their community and the lack of respect for their player base is far too apparent this is doubly so from what it looks like a lack of meaningful updates for some time extremely disappointing i know indie games that put up more of an effort especially for a studio with this many employees and sub studios in tandem maybe if they increase the time it would take to release a game by 2 4 years it would at least give them some time to put quality into their work although i doubt it would help anyways ranting aside for your own sake don t buy this game especially for 70 usd campaign the story is nothing to write home about just revisiting characters from previous games although they left massive plot holes and controversies in the story and it s so weird playing through it it genuinely makes no sense at times the campaign has lot of petty lame bugs that force you to do a full restart of the mission the prison break one for starters as you get stuck on the rafters not able to rappel down wasting about 20 minutes of your time they did have some slower more methodical sections which i appreciated but they were too far between only time the campaign felt interesting end mission was pretty much a letdown for me nothing to write home about gameplay and internal systems comparing this game to 2019 it s really improved in some respects where i did not expect the gun customization was outstanding along with the tuning although it doesn t really do that much especially when the game first came out along with the refined gunplay feels good enough for a modern cod recoil feels balanced and harder to control for certain guns which are a nice touch the main menu design is disgustingly bad not a surprise though as it was designed by the same dudes who made the ui for hulu the spawns feel really unfair sometimes spawning you in front of enemies or behind them which leads to really cheap kills games frequently crash especially with parties overall the gameplay is decent but far too inconsistent to be enjoyable there are some new maps but there is not a lot of variety player skins and paid weapon skins do not transfer over a lot of content from the previous games are just forgotten about it s like their many internal teams don t learn game to game though the objectively worst part about this game easily is the sbmm it s so horribly predatory pitting whole stacked squads up against one good player and a whole bunch of casual or newer players simply isn t fair and you can really feel it when you solo queue into a 6v6 after having a really good game or even a decent game the matchmaking is purely based on this idiotic ranking system which you re not able to see because the game hides a massive amount of stats for you it doesn t even prioritize ping so you often go up against very laggy players out of your country cash shop works perfectly well as always and without fail about the only complete feature in this game,365.1,134.0,2,Not Recommended,"March 28, 2023",Call of Duty®,"Susono

48778,this is mostly a review for mwiii the campaign is short i played on the highest difficulty and completed it in about 5 hours this is the shortest campaign ever the story itself is fine but isn t good enough to compensate or justify the short length seems like just laziness or the devs don t have enough time because they need to meet a hard deadline the open combat missions are mid constantly switching between linear and open combat missions takes away from the story telling open combat doesn t even add much depth to the story they should just stop trying to add more warzone elements to modes that are not warzone if you played dmz from mwii you ll know that mwz is basically dmz cold war s zombies outbreak mode i enjoyed playing dmz a lot they added new content and features to dmz every season given that mwz is basically dmz zombies i expected the same treatment with the content roadmap after all cod is a live service game nowadays at launch the content is pretty packed there were lots of things to do great start but after that it became a content drought apparently treyarch stopped managing mwz to work on cod 2024 every single season so far 1 2 and 3 they drop these rifts which are basically reused assets from dmz it s the same formula where you go into a new rift and do the same contracts to get new schematics every single season the lack of content basically says that mwz is a dead mode given that zombies is not round based here without seasonal content updates there s no reason to play this mode i m a zombies fan so i m super disappointed here definitely got scammed by the zombies mode in my opinion mwz have a lot of potential if they gave it the dmz treatment as for multiplayer if you bought mwii mwiii definitely feels like a 70 dlc it s effectively the same game with some quality of life updates that make things more pleasant like movement updates there are also updates that make things in my opinion less pleasant like ttk is increased lobbies are sweaty like the usual they are doing weekly events every single week for free rewards which is nice for people who don t wanna pay to get items but some of these are way too grindy same issue with the battle pass where it takes 70 hours of game time to finish not everybody has the time to no life this game 24 7 certainly not me also the fact that they spend their resources pumping out cosmetic bundles every single week instead of producing new high quality content especially zombies is annoying we already have to pay for this game is it too much to ask them to not milk us further and focus on more quality content tldr don t waste your money on cod mwiii is my last cod game in the foreseeable future they need to stop this annual release cycle slow down this money machine and focus more on quality and content but like pokemon they re making too much money on the annual releases to break from the cycle any time soon,363.6,64.0,1,Not Recommended,March 28,Call of Duty®,"HK

48876,okay so usually i dont leave in depth reviews but for this game i really feel the need to i am late to the cod game played a little growing up but never got into it until mw3 so this review is only coming from someone who is new to it after 200 hours i honestly loved playing with friends especially multiplayer but recently have gotten more into zombies i really liked the open world grindy feel of this zombies never really had any issues with crashing or lagging until recent about a week ago they put out an update for the game which was for season 3 reloaded and i have crashed in zombies now 7 times since then full freeze and crash to desktop let me also mention that it isnt just happening to me twice now the entire server and players have crashed and lost everything as well as some party mates of ours who have also crashed since happening multiple of us have tried reinstalling the game changing our settings and priority nothing has worked 7 10 times we have gone into zombies full on crashed and lost everything and this game does not have a single backup plan for crashing mid game so you do not get to get anything back i have tried to check reddit and twitter for answers as well as ing them on twitter but nothing seems to help unless you want an answer from a bot i personally do not have experience with prior cod games but from my experience recently this is such a lazy put together of a game i spent 150 on this game for 3 of us to play as well as spending hundreds for skins in the game as well it really seems like a waste of money for the lack of effort they seem to have for this game anymore especially coming out with a new game every single damn year if you are going to scam your players out of a 70 game every year i would expect at least a little effort to keep your servers running and keep your players happy that being said most companies and games nowadays are just another money grab which it seems this game is also turning into sad to see i recommend for multiplayer but unfortunately the game has quite literally forced me to not be able to play zombies until they work on their game,271.5,58.0,4,Not Recommended,April 28,Call of Duty®,"Breezy

48899,2022 my review and experience of the game so far about 50 hours overall negative until more fixes are implemented ghost is currently useless and suppressors have even less appeal because you will show up on radar between sweeps when firing a weapon with ghost and a suppressor classic terrible call of duty spawns have returned in this game and i am so excited i love spawning in the enemy spawn and dying to someone right around the corner because i am on the other side of the map where my team is i have a clip of myself shooting an enemy in a corner and my teammate spawning on top of their dead corpse in the middle of the map if you are getting spawn trapped the game will keep spawning you in the same place allowing the enemy to feed kills off of your team either people are already wall hacking or smoke is client sided i have died a lot due to smoke after a kill streak clouding my view only to watch the kill cam and see my opponent look at my character as if it was a bright and sunny day out ui is terrible and buggy sometimes your are unable to edit your gun mid match and you have to select the gun back out of the gun selection and then click edit to edit your attachments and by then you have died 2 times to the enemy the game backs out of the gunsmith after every match several times causing you to have to navigate to the menu and wasting precious time between matches to equip a new weapon if you are in a party you can bet on someone either crashing or getting kicked out of the party randomly no one plays the objective in objective based game modes it is already over 1 week after release and i am being put in lobbies with everyone on the enemy team using meta weapons while i am struggling to upgrade the weapons that i have don t play invasion unless you are the rooftop camper if you are i hate you most guns are good stock adding all 5 attachments ruins most guns which defeats the purpose of the gunsmith battle hardened is useless against flash grenades and stuns unless you are the enemy because they are immune to your stuns and flash grenades controller aim assist extremely strong you can have maximum sensitivity and get a strong lock on your opponent a second later with precision aim and all of your shot landing unbind dolphin dive and slide keys they will get you killed more often than help your movement stuns and flash grenades don t work on controller players because their aim hacks will do the work for them if someone with a higher kd is in your party you will be matched into their skill bracket and get destroyed by adderall controller users playing core feels like i am playing hardcore i can t wait to get one shot by every weapon in hardcore update after another 90 hours overall negative until more fixes are implemented dmz restarts my entire computer if i start a match with two different tiers of objectives for example if i have a tier 2 objective and a tier 3 objective and i start to matchmake it will restart my computer the same thing happens if my team mate has a similar objective set up you can reliably crash if your team mate crashes mid dmz game warzone is filled with rooftop snipers and everyone and their mother is going after safe cracker and intel contracts thanks youtube sbmm is cranked up to 11 in multiplayer if your party does the objective and anyone goes positive you can expect to play against the next pro players in your matches we even had people wall hacking and aim hacking in some of our lobbies dmz is one of the only stress free modes that you can relax and have fun in you can even recruit up to a party of 6 random people the buggy ui is still persistent you still have issues using gunsmith mid multiplayer match and if you start a match your teammates will be kicked out of their loadout and gunsmith screens but hey they patched a harmless xp glitch that helps you level up your weapons a bit faster instead of fixing a broken ui since launch the battlepass tokens will sometimes never show up and you have to restart the game to see your total tokens sometimes the tokens wont even work when you try to use them tier 1 is a terrible replacement of hardcore you can t see the kill feed and you can t see your kill streaks and i have not seen anyone get punished for killing teammates to use double xp in dmz you have to back out and get into the warzone game mode or multiplayer game mode and then activate your double xp there is still no xp timer to see how much time you have left for your double xp tokens,222.6,44.0,4,Not Recommended,"November 6, 2022",Call of Duty®,Clever Dragon,False

48908,2023 so to put it bluntly matchmaking has basically made this game just un fun to play you can read a lot of these comments about how good the gunplay is or the graphics but the only people who approve the matchmaking is those that are unaware of how bad it is casual players who aren t actively trying to get a high k d or trolls who think it s funny the get people who are mad about the matchmaking even saltier old style matchmaking prioritized connection to ensure a good uninterrupted gameplay without too much of an issue with the sbmm stupidity however if you play too well say goodbye to playable gameplay as it actively keeps pushing for people around your exact or higher skill level this can hit casual players too if they got that one 30 4 k d as they suffer for 5 10 matches of sweaty lobbies with horrid connection from having played hundred of hours in mwii 2022 a few hours in warzone and a bit in dmz i ve honestly gotta applaud activi ion for absolutely ruining the name of the old mw2 and soon to be mw3 since they re reusing the same sbmm between them you sweat every match in mwii 2022 well expect the same in mwiii 2023 2024 from my first match to my 3rd i legit spend more of my time getting spawn trapped by sweaty players than actually enjoying a single match if it wasn t for the skin for playing the beta to lv30 i wouldn t even touch mwiii 2023 2024 i would also like to add that having this all tied to warzone having 3 games in one like with the previous bundle of games i thought it was pretty clear that not everyone has the storage space for holding 3 4 games 500gb in one edit to fix this a bit you can uninstall which ones you don t play but the fact you have to install all of them at once to start still should not be an issue honestly from seeing the beta in its current state just basically being an obvious dlc to the mwii 2022 just with another 70 price tag for like what a few features that should have been in mwii 2022 ya know perks that are all available at the start of a match when you equip them a working minimap rather than a sticker to use only until you re used to the map before gluing your eyes to a compass a working suppressor when using a ghost perk and dead silence as a usable perk rather than a field upgrade i understand the devs under activi ion are trying their hardest to applease both the community and the higher ups but at this point i m seeing call of duty becoming more like a sinking ship than anything salvageable as things progress when i played this kind of game back in cod4 and mw2 i was garbage at the game and got better over time by having my ass handed to me so many times that i got a handle of how certain places work and what angles were horrid to hold there was no overpowered sbmm protection for people back then nothing to keep sweaty players from just demolishing people but they were so few and far between because there are a lot less sweaty players than casuals and because of that you were more likely to get a match where things were even because people were all there specifically to have fun how high was my average back then and did i sweat like 15kills a match but just as many if not more deaths not going hard into trying to get kills nowadays i d be lucky to get 10 without 40 deaths because i had 1 match of 20 18 sbmm isn t something protecting players it s honestly doing more harm than good casual players can t learn tactics without getting swamped hard for 10 matches after doing well in 1 sweaty players legit act as if it s ranked mode 24 7 and those of us who got good overtime from learning well none of it means jack now because if we preform well once we get thrown into a blender and dumped down the garbage disposal for a week this is not call of duty just a stupid micro transaction hell copy of it,221.7,30.0,2,Not Recommended,"October 16, 2023",Call of Duty®,"Yanga

48946,2022 for context i played the campaign to finish on veteran and have played a few hours of mp overall graphics took a very nice leap forward character movement is smooth and fluid gun animations are somewhat realistic but the mechanics are great finding balance on different weapon platforms so far audio is outstanding again like mw 2019 campaign excellent imo is not better than the first mw campaign 2007 with some of those classic and reminiscent missions but it is good i have played every cod campaign and this is up there with some of the best this is also the first one where i felt like i had to watch the cut scenes very movie like and very cool they did an excellent job dropping them in there to piece the missions together and to make you feel really in and part of the story i will say veteran felt like the easiest its been on any campaign thus far don t know if i magically am smarter and better doubt it or they made things a tad easier more likely verdict play it watch the cut scenes enjoy the story you re being told you wont be disappointed multiplayer great very fun to play much different that mw 2019 so do not buy this with the expectation that it is the same or built upon this game went for a slower pace and more realistic feel read that again i personally love it i enjoy mil sims not this that is one but cod moved in that direction ever so slightly what do i mean by that the basics movement speed is slower ive always hated how for a majority of cod s movement speed reigned king oh your 15 years old and had 25 monsters energies in 2 hours awesome you can move around the map at the speed of light shredding players with your sub machine gun or melee weapon not in this cod it stops here grenades and snipers if you enjoy sniping youll be happy to hear that cod listened to the msga crowd make sniping great again 95 of the time its a 1 hit kill from what ive experienced grenades are now pretty useful and more realistic where you can get a decent amount of kills per match throwing them in hot lanes ones with a lot of enemy traffic maps so far so good they feel bigger and more complex that means more places to hide a campers dream but more places to surprise your enemy it feels weird being able to vault more things and do more climbing in this cod but its a nice change of pace will you use it more often to regular gameplay no probably not but it doesn t take away from the experience at all it only further adds to the realism cod mw2 is going for gunsmith absolutely amazing the best part of the the multiplayer experience so far there feels like an endless amount of attachments their basically is you start with the base gun in a weapons family tree for instance once the m4 assault rifle is leveled up enough you unlock a new marksmen rife and a new lmg you use these enough you unlock a new short smg m4 the honey badger for those who know and the finally the m16 this is a new spin on things much different then the hard unlock at x y z level up for the first time ever you are able to tweak the bonus s an attachment gives you this tuning tool is unlocked when a weapon level is maxed out this essentially provides infinite combinations of any given weapon don t like the ads lets boost it dont like how inaccurate it is we can fix that a very very big leap forward in cod weapon customization do i think some weapons will be cracked this way yes it always happens lets see what creative insane combos the community comes up with this time verdict real cod multiplayer is back baby none of this vanguard or black ops garbage its different its fun and its tuned more to your ability to get on target and hit accurate shots may the better gun fighter win is motto here if you are looking to dominate because you have your sensitivity turned all the way up and 18 red bulls in the system sorry this cod has essentially nerfed you final word buy this cod its the best in years and so far better than mw 2019 for a multitude of reasons,582.3,22.0,3,Recommended,"October 28, 2022",Call of Duty®,a 40 yr old black dude,False

48969,2023 after 521 hours of game play i have finally uninstalled this game in my humble opinion this game is a shameless money grab full of bugs useless and most of the time ugly bundles filled with mediocre skins and nothing but one of the worst hit detection software i have ever seen of course when the game actually launches and starts working properly it looks stunning the graphics are indeed amazing with beautiful realistic scenery and great character models but even then it is so badly optimised that it crashes almost every single week at least 7 or 8 times after that the campaign is bland and repetitive with very few exceptions and the plot is quite silly at that as for multiplayer and warzone 2 0 the multiplayer is filled with riot shield rocking shotgun using campers most of the maps are dreadful and the cherry on top is the newly implemented skill based hit detection so if you play really well instead of getting rewarded you get nothing but the most unbelievable ghost shots anyone has ever seen just great and at last warzone 2 0 i never expected to have fun playing a gamemode so unfulfilling as this all in all though even with all the campers and warzone 2 0 is really fun as long as you don t invest to much of your time in it and you appreciate it for what it is a mediocre battle royale game with texture loading issues unnecessary skill based matchmaking and latency variation that would make even the most well composed amongst us lose it this game was so promising and at the end i am ashamed that i wasted so much of my time buying and playing a game that is unfinished filled with errors and micro transactions that would even make companies such as ea and ubisoft vomit and still demands 70 euros for the standard edition why would you buy it sure it can be fun but when the trade off is 70 bucks for a game that is unfinished even after 11 months since the initial launch back in september last year and almost losing your mind after the first 100 hours of skilled based matchmaking in casual gamemodes such as resurgence in my opinion it is not worth it,727.8,23.0,0,Not Recommended,"July 30, 2023",Call of Duty®,Tandys_Hai,False

49028,2022 i won t talk about the easily 100 collective crashes my party of six had on launch night because i presume they ll get fixed so i ll start with the multiplayer the moment to moment gameplay is actually very fun and the gunplay feels amazing you just won t get to experience it your guns require 31 bullets and a permission slip to kill someone the exact same gun will delete you from existence with no time to respond the endless uavs that are unencumbered by perks like ghost unlocks at level 52 and doesn t enable until over halfway through a match mean that the enemy always knows where you are the weapon balance is all over the place the entire teams of people we encountered using a one shot kill bolt action rifle without a scope that has a faster fire rate than the any smg and will have you dead before you can even get your gun up certainly showcased the imbalance and while that all is happening to you you have to navigate the most unnecessarily complex unintuitive and inefficient ui of game i ve played in a long time that you can only use in a match or else it crashes the result of a drunken game of darts i presume which is surprising since there are 20 cod games with perfectly functional uis it could have learned from like maybe the previous modern warfare which leads me to the campaign mw19 had one of the most popular campaigns ever and was lauded as a true innovation in an otherwise stale formula excited to see how they follow that up you guessed it drunken game of darts the story at its core is nonsenses i mean that it literally makes no sense nothing any of the characters do is logical what about the slow paced gritty feel of missions like clean house and wolf s den from mw19 don t expect that here there s nothing of the sort maybe you want action packed sequences like the original mw2 well rest assured those are awful too maybe you like gimmicks such as ac 130 missions stealth missions or everyone s favorite from mw19 using a camera to direct someone else all fun all overstay their welcome significantly i played it on regular as i do all cod campaigns one my first play through and it was hard way harder than any other campaign at this difficulty i died in one or two shots a lot then i switched to recruit and nothing changed except the endless hordes of armored enemies instead of taking twelve shots to the head to kill they took eleven want to play a survival crafting game no well strap in because you ve got about an hour and a half of that for some reason the entire thing was a slog and there was no payoff it didn t follow up on the innovations of mw19 it reduced itself to the comforts of mediocrity i wouldn t recommend this game to anyone for the price p s ghost is a total goober,63.9,61.0,7,Not Recommended,"October 28, 2022",Call of Duty®,Sawyer,False

49066,2022 i am not going to lie and say that the game is no fun at all that s not true for me it is somewhat inevitable i always get cod every year but for those of you who wait and see i recommend you pass this one it is really disappointing negative points 1 calling cards basically hidden they exist and you can set them up on a profile page but unless someone specifically goes to examine you they don t see them they don t come up on the multiplayer screen anymore so what is the point of getting them anymore it was always a motivator to do cheevos and also interesting to see which ones other people had 2 terrible music and sound this is a big one to me and so important to making the games addictive the casino slot machine like sounds of past mw games is missing and so makes it feel very meh no adrenaline rush at all 3 game is poorly balanced though to be fair most cod games are when they release and that usually gets fixed4 game interface menus are horrendously bad and thus frustrating to use 5 what new things does the game offer to compensate for this absolutely nothing the whole game is just less than mw1 the single player campaign is pretty good though updates after more gameplay 6 weeks in and still constant crashes and fps drops after numerous patches and driver updatesmore updates 7 if you get disconnected from the multiplayer server it forces you to exit to desktop you cannot attempt to reconnect i m dead serious 8 we are now three months in while crashing had previously cased for about three of four weeks it has now been reintroduced with the latest patch at least once per hour without any error message,157.8,27.0,1,Not Recommended,"October 30, 2022",Call of Duty®,Cranjis McBasketball,False

49443,2022 i mean its exactly what it says on the tin its cod and its a very safe game the weapons feel pretty good to use games are fast paced and more importantly well paced there is a decent amount of content with the regular game modes on offer then you have groundwar invasion etc the maps are well meh not a lot to say again they re safe none of the maps have had me amazed and none have had me playing in disgust either the game seems pretty well optimised as well from my perspective i have an rtx 2080ti and the game runs smoothly at 60fps on high settings and in 9hrs of playtime it has only crashed on me once however few issues game does need better balancing most guns kill way to quickly the game needs hardcore introducing and that should have been there from the start also needs better matchmaking or a better way of dividing matchmaking i play these games pretty casual now i m not interested in the competitive scene whatsoever that divide needs to exist for people who want to play casual and competitively or with friends or whatever is it worth 60 probably not but how many aaa titles are these days just the market we re in unfortunately wait till the christmas sale and then buy it then overall though its safe nothing groundbreaking and it never will be but it is also fun 3 5,361.2,69.0,10,Recommended,"November 1, 2022",Call of Duty®,"Promotus™

50381,2022 a few points about the game s stages are really adrenaline the summary of the old characters is very mature and the story has a high tension the variety is very high from air support with a gunship to the chase to save one of the people who was arrested with the extremist isis there are many stealth stages and you can go in such a way that the siren goes off or you can go all undercover inserting yourself into the mexican cartels to penetrate their tunnels finding the trace of something that is lost the gameplay and shooting have a very very high depth and the artificial intelligence is like a dog he barks he becomes suspicious and they look around they find a dead body a few of them separate they look for you you get separated from the group in one step you have nothing you have to collect glue rope and scrap metal to make things get a special knife from moloto to open it like a list locks that don t open easily and you find weapons and other gadgets inside them throw a bottle at them to make an explosive trap it s not a pity to amputate the expression cutsin and music have nothing to do with vegetation and sound hey the design of every stage is great you can go into the water without being seen or fight with heavy armor enemies that really challenge you i mean in this case secretly planting flowers on the deal and many other things that i won t say more it s really one of the best campaigns in this series the stages of the game have this feature some of them you have to do the work differently but it is still bad there is even more interaction between the characters between soup and ghost there are different ways to reach the goal in some stages even 3 choices yes they work really well regarding the multiplayer section i must say that it is in an interesting situation although it is far from getting better most of the players report crashes and frame drops i personally did not have such cases while playing the variety of weapons and maps are excellent it is a very enjoyable experience i definitely recommend it to everyone especially if this version is going to be two years old,645.2,22.0,5,Recommended,"November 1, 2022",Call of Duty®,"Dragon 313

51929,2022 call of duty modern warfare ii by wholfsummary well well well where to start let s say after 30 hours of grinding playing and being ear blasted by the helicopters which are highly annoying i came to the point of writing a review describing all the things from my experience so far i m right now after 20 hours of playing fully leveled 55 which is the maximum how by finishing the daily tasks and grinding did i enjoy it in general yes and no let me explain in an informative way the weapons i have maxed out the first four assault rifles to gold and i m almost finished with my fifth one and yes you can max out a weapon in around 2 hours of playing leveling is very easy and getting gold camo is also very easy as the challenges don t make any sense very simple and has no real challenge and in general feel quite bland while playing with these weapons it felt really unbalanced the recoil and the balance aren t fitting to the weapon the damage is strange and the attachments also feel like they aren t doing anything overall if you are grinding for gold do it it s very easy but here comes the negative part about grinding for the xp hundreds and hundreds of players used an exploit or whatever it s called you had to play the ground war mode and have the mine forgot the name of it thrown on a light tank by doing this you will get thousands of xp in no time teaming up with a friend of yours on their other team made this very easy to grind for xp just throw the mine on the light tank wait wait wait and boommm a lot of xp this also counted for your weapon which in my opinion didn t make any sense now this got patched but those who abused it leveled every weapon mostly to the maximum already the best thing i like about all the weapons available is the sound effects to it while shooting feels detailed and perfectly fitting to the weapon the maps in general well well well the maps and i m going to talk about it in general not map specific the maps in general are nice well covered and nicely made with some nice hiding spots and exploits here and there and freerunning places where you can camp around if you are playing farm 18 taraq or zarqwa for example you ll most likely see people being in places that shouldn t be possible to get to now the crappiest map ever made is santa sena border a map filled with hundreds of exploding cars and people camping behind them with shotties or snipers in the spawn it s unbelievably terrible and i hope they ll fix this as everyone most of the time simply quits leaves when they see this map now breenburg hotel is a map in the netherlands where i live it s nicely made and kinda reminds me of this place when i went there a few years ago but from what i ve heard the owner of this hotel is mad that call of duty added this not quite sure though but i ve heard it overall some changes glitches and exploits here and there and we re good to go btw i love farm 18 easy peasy knife hunting the connection crashes yep this is a very annoying thing the game crashes randomly the game freezes randomly and when playing a game your game lags i even hit my toe against the wall due to a game freeze while i had 18 killstreaks and related i hope they ll fix this as i have probably received over 50 crashes by now in 30 hours of playing there are a few fixes here and there and i did all of them but they came coming back but you know the developers are aware of it and hopefully fixes this in one week from now overall the game has just been released so you can expect these things of course did i enjoy the cooperative game modes yes and no why because almost everyone is using the god mode exploit which is very easy to do rushing to the point no stealth nothing and when you are playing stealth the ai sees you anyway i have tried so many times that it s just a waste of time since the ai will see you anyway i even tried shooting those armored vehicles with rpgs and other launchers and they couldn t even be destroyed like what the apache helicopter is also a way to be overpowered once it comes it s hard to destroy unless you both focus on it with a launcher overall the cooperative game mode is fun besides what i ve mentioned you can even find intel but that ll take a huge amount of time to find all of them best part is you can get emblems backgrounds when you ve achieved enough stars did i enjoy the game in general yes i did enjoy it besides the crashes and the highly unfair skill based matchmaking not that it s a huge problem but you ll be killed loads of times by these people camping in corners with shotguns camping with snipers 200 meters away headshotting you or even killing you through walls i have encountered 3 hackers legit ones using wallhacks people screaming and shouting into their microphones and even being very toxic to the players in the matches uhm what else it s quite boring now and i ll take a break almost all my assault rifles are gold my riot shield is gold and my knife is gold what else i could continue but once you ve completed leveling to 55 and leveling your weapons it starts to simply get boring as of right now it feels like a game that you play when being bored since you ve achieved the most part of the game i hope they ll fix the game more add more content here and there fix the huge amount of problems and listen to their community and not their own minds is the price right now worth it no it s not it s way too high priced and you will get 20 30 hours of content unless you are a hardcore camo grinder in this game cause you know gold wow but in general do i recommend this game i wish i could vote neutral 50 50 but i ll go with a negative for now will update it in the future,720.4,16.0,1,Not Recommended,"November 2, 2022",Call of Duty®,"WHOLF ⚡

52706,2022 campaign 8 10 let s give it up to iw for making one of the most memorable campaigns in a long time for the call of duty games putting old classic memorable moments into the gameeven with dialogues to make the player feel like they still got you it s a big step up from 2019 s campaign characters feel more solid and tell their own stories setting up the plot for the next game very nicely mission variety 7 10 there is not much to explore but there are missions you do complete stealth and some you run and gun and be technical about your stuff at times of course you can do both but the veteran mode does not take kindly for running and gunning in stealth based missions i d say it s challenging than impossible even though we feel some missions inspired by the past there are certain places i feel that iw could have added a few missions or 2 that can be very unique to this game other than showcasing amsterdam graphics 9 10 the game doesn t feature any of the fancy raytracing implementation but does its job very well wow at the amsterdam mission alone in mexico it features almost everything we know about 2019 s mw and improves upon it on mw2 i will drop 1 point from this review just it would be nice to have raytracing in campaign mode at least to give the taste of realistic reflections on the gun scope ground surfaces and shadows it doesn t mean that game is doing a bad job at any of these it maximizes its all efforts on making the game more realistic to feel and look in every point you take sound design 10 10 in a surround system environment or stereo environment this game does absolute best to have peek your ear senses from where a bullet is coming or from where an enemy is approaching you absolute best if you are camping somewhere and you wanna listen to someone s coming up to you you can do it with sound and of course campaign bgms and sound effects not cutting any corners absolutely modern warfare we know and love guns mechanics 7 10 i love what it does with the guns and mechanics there s no super hero ing like what you do with 2019mw i may not have played a couple of hundred hours in 2019 s mw fairly around 20h and i get the idea but you can be pretty much a superhero sliding and shooting slide cancelling and stuff that is not a thing now you can t just go on running and gunning this time around like i specified in missions veteran mode mp doesn t take kindly to people who do running and gunning this time around for the majority of the maps there are certain maps in mp that you can do fast paced example the embassy map can be an example but most of the maps are focused to do tactical shooting perspective listen think and know where you are is the key to the win a game people who loved the fast running and gunning will feel this is absolute nonsense i m no pro if thats how the game is then adopting is what we have to do most of the time game hey change your gameplan this time around maybe multiplayer 7 10 following the comment from above as i feel like most of the maps are not fast pased its just feels like the maps are done mainly domination mode hardpoint games in mind mostly not tdm most of the maps don t give you enough spot to camp the camping areas are very much visible and to be honest a camper can t be staying in one position the entire time of the game that said i ve been playing the game for straight 40h timed as i m typing the review some maps feels more rewarding than you just go on running and killing whatever on your way with a powerful shotgun or with a sniper rilfe camped up somewhere overall i m glued to the game as much as i like to point out its goodness there are bad parts of its own since there are no slide cancelling and so on super hero ing in the game certain maps feels very useless to play with you get trashed if you are doing a different loadout or daily challenge that said santa sena border crossing map both fun and irritating at the same time you literally cant camp in certain games and you can camp entire game in certain games basically tdm you run around everywhere dominition specially taking when enemy captured is nearly impossible if there s a good camper defending the place and of course running in between the cars you get blown up with traps or whatever even by a aim noob shooting at the cars so ye there are those downsides as well overall it s pretty enjoyable i find the game fun and at times frustrating well it s a game after all overall 8 10 great for both campaign and multiplayer its fun chaotic and memorable campaign with a nostalgia around the corner there s a lot room for improvement more maps,350.4,17.0,1,Recommended,"November 1, 2022",Call of Duty®,"adelfrost

52851,2023 boycott activision hey can we discuss the recent issues with activision and voice our concerns i m disappointed with their decision to remove the nickmercs operator bundle from modern warfare 2 and warzone because of a post he made regarding an lgbt protest it feels like activision is supporting the indoctrination of kids with lgbt content which i find concerning their response about celebrating pride seems tone deaf especially considering the toxic environment often found in cod lobbies with racial slurs and profanity additionally the sexual assault allegations against activision are deeply troubling and their yearly release of overpriced games doesn t help i ve decided not to buy any more cod games and i recommend others to uninstall their existing games let s show activision that we won t support them financially anymore,249.1,19.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 14, 2023",Call of Duty®,"Coyote-RJ
