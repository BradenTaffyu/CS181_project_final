38553,2018 online play brokenlike many others i was banned from online play due to a faulty anticheat system that rockstar has denied accountability for and has failed to repair multiple months after its issues had first been brought to their attention considering the major scope of this issue and its consequences rockstar s public response has been incredibly irresponsible and incompetent auto denying ban appeals and failing to formally address the cause of the issue hopefully this issue will be erradicated in the near future and we many who have been affected can again enjoy the online features of this fantastic product i wish rockstar the best in resolving these issues,211.5,577.0,26,Not Recommended,"June 26, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,Henley

38598,after 11 years of rampant cheating they decided to add an anti cheat yesterday they picked on that is not compatible with linux unless they literally check a box which they did not do and said they will not do so all linux users including all steam decks now cant play the game just straight up locked out i will be trying to get my money back and you ll never catch me giving rockstar money ever again this is the last straw for me i do not reccoment this game or red dead or gta 6 this company will cheat you out of every cent they can,198.8,434.0,5,Not Recommended,September 17,Grand Theft Auto V,millerlifeguards
38599,2018 grand theft auto vi have never thought that i will write a negative review on game like gta v for a long time it was one of my favorite games but after last ban wave i reconsidered my opinion and i just can not recommend this game to anyone who is considering to buy it for multiplayer or is already playing if you still do not have this game and you just want to play singleplayer do not hesistate and go for it singleplayer alone is worth those money now about multiplayer grind here is bad it has lot of bugs so many endless loadings you need friends to really enjoy the game and even with them it will be frustrating experience there are not many things which you could do alone you can not do your businesses on your own private server so you are forced to play with random players because of that it is really frustrating and hard to make any money new updates are worse and worse they cost a lot of money and in the end most of those things are totally useless they do not care about old stuff which is already in the game for example titan could have functional loading bay or cargobob could have magnet rather than that useless hook ban waves which causes suspensions even for legit players yet there are still many moddersstill after all those things the biggest problem is r support i can say that i have never seen worse support it is like talking with robots they are using scripted phrases and in the end they will not help you as a player who got banned without any reason i was trying to get some answers at least i wanted to know what have i done but they will not tell you because you do not have permission to know that the only thing you get is their typical copy paste answer how their anticheat is flawless and you are the one who broke eula rules but which one who knows another thing is that with the ban they also delete your characters because of that i lost my 700h progress so if you are guilty you can prepare yourself that after the ban ends you probably get another one permanent because you can not prevent happening it again without knowing what it caused and if you are really innocent the only thing what you can do is wait after all of this i was just waitting for some statement from rockstar and you know what even though thousands of players were banned falsely after month rockstar did not do any statement they just act like nothing ever happend this is how rockstar appreciate their costumers,872.5,461.0,19,Not Recommended,"April 29, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Spreitty

38607,2018 tldr the game is fun but rockstar and take two provide no specific information regarding suspension or bans even if bans are final this information should be provided to the user so they can rectify the issue to make it clear my current temporary suspension is a false positive to my knowledge i requested further information regarding the eula violation from their support team they chose not to provide infomration on the eula violation nor did they provide evidence that my account had violated the eula i can not recommend this game because they do not make this information accessible until this week i would have recommended gta v as a great game it has an enjoyable single player and while the multiplayer is a grind to say the least rockstar have made it possible to perform the activities missions events with more than four players which is a common pitfall of most co operative games this has given the game replay value which led to the large number of hours i have played it whenever my friends and i needed a game we all were happy to play gta v was commonly the choice i will acknowledge that gta v itself is a great game to play with friends and alone however on monday whilst mid mission gta v s anti cheat engine handed me out a temporary suspension like a broken record i will say that i do not cheat exploit or mod the game nor do i have any program which is capable of tampering with the games code or memory at the time i summised that gta v s cheat engine works using a heurisitc system which looks at the behaviour of programs running in the background most likely it looks for programs attempting to inject code control window handles or view memory i am relatively sure that it was my as rock tuning utility which was monitoring sensory data that is the culprit i deduced this only from the fact that it was the only program that i had not run while running gta v over a long period of time however i can also deduce that this program would have in no way altered or hindered the gta v executable nor its online service i do not simply want to serve the 30 day suspension which i am quite happy to do understand that an anti cheat engine that analyzes behaviour is bound to misinterpret occasionally and then find that i am permanently banned the problem with this game isn t the anti cheat engine itself in software engineering of this nature there is always a tradeoff between false positives and limiting the number of cheats so many hackers were ruining the game that the developers had make the anti cheat engine more aggressive result more false positives the problem lies in their lack of support and the ignorance that they hold towards this potential tradeoff i sent a message to support not asking to appeal the ban explicitly telling them that i did not wish to appeal but rather asking for information regarding the violation so that i could determine what caused the issue the support message was viewed three times according to their latest activity timer over two days and then charles provided an automated message essentially copy and pasting the same content on their website regarding the issue this is the problem rockstar and take two s line is that everyone is banned for a reason and therefore bans are final if they enforce this then they should inform the user of the specific violation that occurred providing me with an automated message provides me with no information doesn t tell me what set it off your anti cheat engine more so it is an insult to your player base to not provide this information furthermore there is an issue regarding permanently banning accounts without providing proof of the offense in particular in the termination section they state that they will only terminate an accounts service if it violates the code of conduct or if the service itself is terminated by the licensor i e they stop online support for the game by permanently banning someone i e terminating online services to that registered account this directly implies that the user must have violated the code of conduct if they don t provide proof of the infraction then one should question whether there was even a violation of their services the burden of proof is on take two or rockstar to prove that you violated the eula if they can t provide the evidence then there is no proof of a license violation and therefore they are breaking their own eula since the eula is essentially a contract they are legally liable in this scenario if the game provided proof of the violation that the registered account made against the eula then i would recommend this game because then the game service or support would explicitly state the violation to the user and give the user a chance to seek remedy in the scenario that the grounds for the violation were false as it is rockstar take two nor their support channels make no attempt to provide this information furthermore the support channels they provide for eula violations i e bans provides no further assistance in the issue why have it at all just tell us that you don t answer questions on bans rather than wasting our time so as it stands i will not be utilising their online services until they do provide this information hence i do not recommend this game because at this time i can not fully utilise the product without risk of the licensor take two violating the conditions of their eula in the termination section i e permanently banning me and with no possiblity of the licensee me seeking appeal or remedy,989.6,424.0,18,Not

38608,2015 the pc version of gta v is definitely the best version we had to wait really long but the game finally came out in a fantastic state rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the pc port version i m usually against pre ordering games but i made one exception this year for gta and im happy with my decision i didn t do it for the pre order bonus because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat i did it just so i could preload all gb s in time for launch because the game is ridiculously big i m running it at 60 90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on high except for the advanced options which is something you should only use if your running sli or one really good card i have a nvidia gtx 680 which is a few years old now so im very impressed with how good i can get the game to run you can also use geforce experience with gta because nividia released a update for that day before launch you can play gta in first or third person mode and simply change between them on your controller all cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person some textures are a little blurry in first person but that is something to expect in a game of this size fighting swimming walking can also be done in first person so you can just pick what you like the best if you have an ssd drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for gta because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long it s one of the only complains i have with gta actually thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens singleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written you can swap between them in the open world but also in certain quests michael trevor and franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then gta iv s only character niko gta online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in i really just bought it for the single player experience but after playing a few hours with my friends i have to say that gta online is actually really fun i think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run but to play free roam with friends will never get old you also unlock heist in level 12 so that might refresh things even more i play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends i ve talked to is doing the same thing i strongly recommend it at least for the driving you can enable auto aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard or you can swap between your keyboard mouse in combat and use controller for driving when you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates which i think makes you feel more immersed in the game i tried the pc controls and i didn t like them at all for example you have to hit z to see how many players are on your server in online mode you can however rebind all keys on keyboard mouse and controller so thats really good but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid gta is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come i have already played it a lot and i feel like i have much more leveling to do in gta online much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come singleplayer was all i really needed so i will just see gta online as a plus well done rockstar this is the best pc version you have ever made and i can see that you put a lot of effort time and love into creating it strongly recommend this title to all my friends whether your the single or multiplayer guy you will have a ton of fun this will probably be one of the best games released this year,205.1,961.0,86,Recommended,"April 19, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Z0mBi3

38624,2018 i highly do not recommend gta v or gta online i like many others have had my account mistakingly suspended and reset recently due to a new anticheat script used by rockstar this is leading to the banning of innocent players with no reversal appeal follow up investigation or notice to the player of the offense i ve been playing grand theft auto online legit since gta iv in 2008 i have over 600 hrs of gametime if you include my time on xbox one i loved the whole series since top down but in 3d gta the pay2play is top of the line shark cards really leave you feeling like you were just taken by a shark i ve spent more money on this game than i d care to admit but i never cared to cheat hack mod whatever i played the game legit with my friends and just dabbled time to time after no one played anymore now i can t trust rockstar at all because i don t harrass other players or even play with old friends just by myself every once in a while but now i m banned for some mysterious offense without justification or human attention to the situation when requesting an explanation i like everyone else with this problem have been met with an automated reply hello sensisoulja thank you for contacting rockstar support gta online bans are triggered by a number of factors including modding in gta online exploiting or abusing game mechanics manipulating protected game data and code or otherwise interfering with other players gameplay experience all gta online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed for more information on the gta online suspension and ban policy please see regards rockstar support i was playing a game in gta online setting up my hanger because i haven t played for awhile and needed it for my akula i bought after selling a bunch of old cars my brother gets in the house from work so i went to talk to him for maybe 8 minutes came back to the game expecting to be kicked for being afk but this time it says i have been suspended til july 1 2018 if and when i come back my account will be reset i don t know what happened but i don t mod hack or do any other nefarious activities online at all after doing some research i find out apparently there is a newly implemented anticheat program that they claim is very accurate at detecting hackers modders manipulators and harrassers plenty of posts and videos have been put up on social media about people getting there accounts suspended and wiped or banned by mistake with zero appeal policy and no investigations or follow ups not only will not be buying another game from rockstar again but i highly do not recommend gta v because the chances of being banned and wiped fraudulently seems inevitable until they fix this glitch in the system,458.4,738.0,52,Not Recommended,"June 1, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"HiiiJedi

38639,2022 fun fact whenever your connected to the internet and playing this game you ip address is being globally broadcast through the rockstar launcher this means other players with mod menus can set alerts to notify them whenever you go online they can then force their way into your lobby even if private and troll you until they get bored rockstar is aware of this issue but for some reason wont address it do not play online without a vpn even if you can get past all that the state of pc online is so distraught that it makes the game unplayable there are modders in every public lobby so your either constantly getting spawn killed and cant get anything done or the lobby will be so glitchy that it will eventually crash and kick you or force close the game the only way this game is tolerable is in a private lobby doing this will cut out most in game content though as most content is only available for play if your in a public lobby playing in a private lobby in my opinion also defeats the purpose of playing an online game unless you are only playing with a set group and you are all only on at the same time i have close to 500 hrs in game if this helps for reference on my experience,621.9,699.0,40,Not Recommended,"February 24, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,Breazzamus

38649,2022 product received for free this review is for gta v online not the singleplayer gta v gta v s singleplayer is great for what it is but most people buying this game in 2022 will be purchasing it for the online experience gta v online has such an amazing groundwork a beautiful map tons of content and a plethora of things to do all of the above features are thrown out the window by the amount of modders and cheaters in the game while many people would argue that there aren t that many of them or that they don t affect the experience both of these statements are just untrue from my experience almost every public lobby has at least 1 2 modders in it these modders and the amount they can do outside the game s boundaries is absolutely unacceptable they can spawn unobtainable vehicles become invincible fly explode the entire map teleport become npcs such as animals lock you into a cage crash your game instantly and many other things if this wasn t enough they can violate your privacy they can force you to type things into chat and even see your ip address it s questionable if having a vpn will help this though many have said that it definitely will and i strongly advise using one if you do happen to be playing your first thought would be to report these people to rockstar correct well modders get alerts when you send a report through the game which allows them to delete them before they even reach rockstar that s right you can t even report these cheaters which can be an actual threat to your game experience your rockstar account and your real world well being on top of all this rockstar as a company is just completely awful they have taken most customer support down for the game so most email reports will not work to get any cheaters banned even with video proof however they do have ban waves in which they ban accounts of suspected cheaters every month or so hilariously my account was falsely banned for 30 days and my entire character reset all of the 95 4 hours you see at the time of writing this review was erased for existing in a lobby with a modder something out of my control and completely without my consent i had never received a warning nor committed any offense on my gta or social club account before this this game is outdated not supported by the developers and swarming with cheaters that can put you at risk do not buy this game for the online,95.4,420.0,19,Not Recommended,"June 14, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,"Lagohz

38663,2018 gta v online or how i learnt to stop worrying and love the hackz0rs tl dr single player game isn t as good as gta iv only play online if you re going to cheat read on to find out why long read i started playing this game in october 2017 i d just got my sweet gaming rig after using apple for years due to work obligations at the time i read the negative reviews saying that players who didn t cheat were getting banned for cheating and everything was being taken away i scoffed they must have done something wrong that wouldn t happen to me as someone working full time i spent around 150 on shark cards to unlock missions and the stuff i wanted to do a sweet ride a nice motorbike harrier jet i tend to just log on now and again and drive about maybe do some hangar missions my guy is at level 20 i only have driving and flying skills maxed out all the other skills aren t even at level 3 3 million in the bank not really the account of a hacker fast forward to may 8th and my account has been banned it s a temp ban but my character is reset and everything i have bought will be taken away from me when the account comes back online in july furthermore if i keep infracting on the games tos it ll be a full ban next time this leads to somewhat of a conundrum obviously if i was a cheater i would know exactly what i had done wrong however as a 100 legitimate player i have no idea what i did or what warranted this ban indeed if you play legitimately then how can you play more legitimately in the future all attempts to contact support have ended in failure all bans are final is parroted back at me no one can tell me why i was banned this account then is ruined if i know i have done nothing wrong and as such don t know why the account was banned what could i possibly do to prevent a ban in the future especially if rockstar have simply closed the door on me when i ask for help and clarification researching some more into this recent ban wave to see if there are other honest players banned like me i discover that used accounts can be bought for as little as 5 in addition to that there are apparently many free mods and cheats out there that can go relatively undetected online and unlock everything apparently there are also paid for cheats i don t know how much these cost yet but one gamer i came across seems to maintain that he was banned because he used cheats he d paid for if he d stuck to the free ones he claims he probably would have been ok so for 5 you can have access to everything in gta v online as well as apparently more max all skills max all unlocks no wanted level infinite ammo etc from personally using shark cards it s my estimate that to unlock everything legitimately you d probably need to pay somewhere between 4000 5000 as you can see you can pay 4000 5000 and get everything and probably have your account banned or 5 get everything and most probably have your account banned but then after it s banned just spend another 5 again from this i can conclude that there is absolutely no reason to play this game legitimately there is a high probability you will be banned for no reason and have everything taken away with no chance to appeal or find out what happened if you use the cheats you will also probably be banned but you ll have access to everything and may have a lot more fun with all the added extras therefore i highly recommend this game but only if you re going to cheat if you want to play this game legitimately i would buy something else also fuck rockstar,225.8,261.0,71,Recommended,"May 10, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,Raverbasher

38666,2017 when it comes to the campaign you are gonna enjoy it because it is really good but the main reason for people coming to play this game is gta online for sure and i can tell you that it s current state is terrible why i have 400 hours on pc plus another 400 on ps3 when it came out so i m gonna try to be as clear as possible gta online is about making money by playing missions heists doing jobs like stealing cars and selling them sell cocain from cocain lab selling weapons from bunker where they are made etc and you can spend that money on cool cars luxury appartements weapons private jets helicopters war vehicles etc sounds cool right well there is a problem at beggining when the game came out the prices for these things were reasonable but now in the last couple of new updates and with import export things the prices are just awful they keep getting higher and higher and it has become so much harder to buy cool things that you want and in that way they are trying to make you buy their shark cards which is really not worth even the 75 card that gives you 8 000 000 is not enough you are gonna need more than that to buy things here because when you buy something you still have to costumize it if you want it to look and be better which also really costs if you wanna get the money normally you can either repeat the heists or do the import export jobs since those ways are best for making money but they still don t give you the money that you really deserve nowadays and for import export jobs it really takes a lot of time to get the money that you need even friends that help you can t get the deserving money for example i still didn t even manage to sell the weapons from the bunker cause it really takes a lot of time for them to be ready for sale and btw the only way to get the stock ready for sale for either weapons drogs weed whatever is to be active in session only the stocks can t get full while you are for example playing heists or some missions or car races with your friends and when i want to sell a product for example two cars with my friend i will get 200 000 while my friend is only gonna get 20 000 that s how rockstar is trying to keep their players playing here by spending thousands of hours repeating the same things that are really not worth and they try to make you buy their shark cards and even that is still not worth your money at all please for the love of god don t fall in to a trap thinking that buying shark cards is gonna help you this really shows how rockstar became greedy you think yes there is new content coming and like every it s free but when you see how expensive the content is you just get really disappointed here is the best example of it when the first heists came out you only had to buy an appartement which had a specific room for that and the cheapest one was about 250 000 which was not that hard to get and now you can play 5 heists but with these new ones that just came out you have to buy a facility to play the heists and the facilities cost from 1 500 000 that it s faster to get bankrupt here then to be rich so what s the point if you wanna play this game because of the campaign go for it and i suggest you to get it on sale but if you wanna enjoy gta online you will maybe like it at beggining like i did when it came out but that was when prices were reasonable and when you figure out how expensive new content has become not to mention hackers and unfair bans you will see how horrible gta online really is yes you can also around with your friends and race but it s really not worth your time if you are gonna be doing only that even for that you need money especially if you wanna have fun with cool things,775.0,636.0,32,Not Recommended,"December 12, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,MR.F

38688,2019 put in a nutshell amazing game terrible community but first things first the single player campaign is one of the best i ever played the concept of playing three characters is a welcome addition to the gta formula and absolutely pays off as with all the previous gta s the npc are fantastic i thought that brucie from gta iv was the craziest character ever until rockstar introduced trevor in gta v character and mission design are top notch also the level of detail of the game world is incredible too bad that rockstar has never released any single player dlc s now to gta online the concept is amazing as well and the game is continuously updated with new content i like the heists especially the downside is that you definitely need other players for them and that it takes ages to find co op partners especially for the heist set up missions where money and reputation rewards are scarce when you finally find enough players people often drop out in the middle of the mission which leads to an instant fail and you have to find another team not to mention all the player killers in the open world and the long load times in general however if you happen to find decent people to play with or play with friends the game is an absolute blast a word on the rockstar launcher sure it is completely unnecessary that there is yet another launcher to torture pc players with after the launch in september 2019 the game crashed regularly thanks to the launcher as of november 2019 it seems like rockstar managed to solve these problems and the game is running stable most of the time all in all an amazing game but especially gta online could still be so much more,458.3,135.0,7,Recommended,"November 26, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"loonis

38702,2018 i will never buy another rockstar game again i simply can t because they don t give me any other option last year i got banned from online play no i m not a cheater or hacker which is why i m writing this negative review what i assume happened is the following i hadn t played gta since launch but came across the lspd mod on youtube it s a mod that allows you to play as police singleplayer i installed gta and the mod and had a couple days of fun i m sure i accidentally pressed online play with the mod loaded once but killed the game right away then i uninstalled gta via steam and didn t play for months the christmas holidays came around i had some spare time and installed gta again i played online for an hour and got a 30day ban i initially had no idea why and no idea to find out as there s zero response from support about bannings other than an automated response saying all bans are final and to be honest i didn t care too much as i had only played for an hour and didn t feel invested i considered gta5 online to simply be broken i uninstalled gta again via steam and didn t think about it but a couple weeks later my brother said he had gotten gta5 during the steam christmas sales so we waited for my 30day ban to be over and had a week of fun playing the game but then exactly 7 days to the dot after the 30 day ban was over i got a permaban i assume i got flagged for another ban the second i logged in again and simply had some kind of 7 day cooldown timer or perhaps they have had a weekly un banwave i was lucky enough to play in between again i tried to contact support again no response but the automated one i tried asking for help on the forums but there i got called a lying cheater and actually harrassed by people so gave up on that quickly while googling for answers i came across the lspd mod again which reminded me i had tried it before i had a eureka moment searched my computer and came across some residual lspd files from months and a couple of full game reinstalls ago i tried to contact support again but still no human response i gave up forward to now after getting constantly reminded on youtube about gta5 videos of clearly modded online play i m still pissed i got banned for what i can only assume were some residual files from a mod that didn t affect my online game at all and let s not forget anyone who has ever played gta5 online knows it s fulllll of real hackers cheaters constantly messing up everyone s game by teleporting them around killing whole servers even dropping hacked money ontop of you so i figured i d see if rockstar support had gotten any better since last year to my surprise there s now a i don t want to get banned support request option i m pretty sure that wasn t there last year so i at least got my hopes up on finally figuring out why i got banned what s a better purpose for the i don t want to get banned support request than someone who doesn t know why he was banned and wants to prevent it from happening again but no just another automated message saying all bans are final and cannot be appealed even though i wasn t asking for an appeal my second support request stating my first request wasn t a ban appeal but an inquiry with information about my first ban because i don t want to get banned again got the same automated message saying all bans are final listen don t get me wrong if the anticheat system detected those residual files as malicious i totally deserved the first ban but i reinstalled the game several times technically i didn t do anything to the new installs it did that to itself by not cleaning the folders it uses and not protecting itself from outside influences on a fresh install i had no way of figuring out why i got banned the first time so no way to prevent it from happening again i m still only guessing it were those files the only victims of not letting people know why they are getting banned by an anticheat system are people who have no idea why the anticheat singled them out because they weren t actually cheating i mean mister l33th4xx0r can hack as much as he wants till his first ban and then has a good idea what to do to not let it happen again support is nonexistant not for i want you guys to have a look at my ban nor can you at least help me to not get banned again despite having a specific ticket request option for it again both youtube and the game itself are full of real actual hackers cheaters and people using non malicious mods online seemingly for long periods of time with no risk or even sense of wrongdoing of getting banned during online play i think it s simple gta5 has so many players but also so many real hackers cheaters that they ban such an enormous amount of people every week with thousands of them making false ban appeals that they can t search and perhaps don t care to look for those few who deserve a second opinion because the banning is perhaps the result of an over zealous anticheat program on their side so i simply cannot buy another rockstar game again nor recommend it to anyone else if i can t get support to at least figure out why i got banned it may happen again in the future and it may happen to you,493.3,665.0,68,Not Recommended,"February 10, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,DutchFurnace

38708,2019 as most people who are familiar with the grand theft auto franchise i will not be reviewing the single player aspect of this game at all because there are countless reviews of that online instead i will be focusing on the cesspool known as gta online the online aspect of this game has always been one thing and that is promising i remember getting home excited on the 1st of october in 2013 crazy to think that that is 6 years ago almost and loading into gta online for the very first time making my at the time god awful character anybody who has played the old gen gta games can vouch that the character creator was even worse than it is now and being so excited at this new world of possibilities fast forward 2 weeks and this was all that myself and a bunch of my close friends would play we would sink days on end into just roaming around the map having fun the world to us was limitless and we never got bored i remember being the last one in my friend group to reach level 75 and unlocking rooftop rumble which we proceeded to grind until each of us was at least level 120 to unlock the last bit of content after that all my friends kind of lost interest in the game but not me i started a hobby of collecting unique cars and meeting people and we would have car meets by the los santos customs this was an amazing thing for the then 16 year old boy whom i was i still remember the excitement of the first christmas event when we woke up and the whole map was covered in snow it was like an entire new experience one of the first games i got on my brothers ps4 was also to no surprise gta v and again it was like a second wind to the game there were more features on making your character look unique and the big one bigger lobbies and more new content to come i played this on and off every time new content came out because i had my original character from my ps3 and they had a lot of money which i worked way too hard for so the moment the dlc came out i would go on experience it buy all the clothing cars and properties i wanted and then played for a few days before leaving the game again during the 2019 summer sale a few friends bought the game and i caved and got it as well this was after a 4 year hiatus from the game so there was a lot to take in i immediately got back to grinding away to get a high rank so i could unlock all that the game had to offer as well as to make money to again buy all the things i wanted this led to me being up until 2 am on most nights for a few weeks just getting the most progress that i could after making my way to rank 100 and being satisfied i ran into a griefer who also had a mod menu at his disposal he stated that everyone should make their way to the airport in game as he is going to be dropping money for people i told him that i am fine since it was 2 am for me and i did not need his money i was completely satisfied with working hard for my money this person then dropped 2 bags of cash on me using their mod menu then in game i saw my cash go up by 2 billion i decided to log off because i didn t know what to do and as i was attempting to write an email to rockstar support to ask if i could get this money removed from my account that s when i received the single most pathetic copy and paste email of my life stating that i have been banned for 30 days this definitely made me feel betrayed as i was wrongfully banned for something that a lot of other people also get wrongfully banned fast forward to the 12th of august and i got my access to gta online back and i did the one thing i knew would keep me happy i continued to grind with the free content i was given from buying the premium online edition of the game to anyone looking to play online this is a great purchase and i made my way back the where i was at least in rank withing 2 weeks again i was happy with helping friends with their import and export missions and just all round messing around in the game that was until today when i helped a friend deliver cargo for their business as they had just started out after the delivery i decided to modify a car that i had been looking to find for a very long time after i finished modifying my car and making my way to my friend to show him this car i got interrupted by a haunting message you have been permanently banned from gta online please return to gta v this was followed shortly by the aforementioned copy and paste email but this one changed to say permanently now i know that i was playing legitimately and i was not cheating so i do not know why i got banned however i do know one thing the people behind gta online do not care about people cheating in their games you will spend a lot of your time trying to escape people who have godmode or aimbots or just people who are caging you and all round stopping you from enjoying your game those people might never get banned and if they do they will just buy a new account off of sites like and get back to making money by modding peoples accounts but if you are a legit player who spends a lot of time grinding to get money you are more likely to get banned by them i will never be supporting rockstar games again and that is a shame because as many of the other people who grew up with games their games have always had a soft spot in my heart,258.3,424.0,33,Not Recommended,"September 6, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"Ninj

38734,2018 i need to get my opinion reccomendation out here fair warning this might seem like a huge review but i hope it helps out of all of the times and hours i have played gta v it s still a good and fun game to play i can t say too much about single player however on multiplayer online mode with all of these updates coming out it seems like everyone is getting banned online for doing nothing whether you are modding or innocent it doesnt matter at all innocent people are getting banned for something that another person has done that is out of their control example modder dropping tons of money to player even if you do the tiniest bit of grinding and pull out a shopping spree with friends rockstar will just think that you re hacking because they will think you somehow magically pulled out 3 6m out of your crotch to pay for a luxary apartment with nice decorations worst part about this is you are unable to appeal your ban because it s a final decision by them rockstar will rob you for your money customer support sucks because when i tried to get support from a legit person instead of getting an automatic message they just threw out deleted my support ticket like it was nothing when i just asked why bans are non appealable and pointed out to them that their eula policies are a little out of date that is not a way to treat customers seriously as of right now 10 30 2018 when i m typing this review they havent updated their tos for almost 1 year now rockstar will swallow your money just like any other gaming communities that do not give 2 about you rockstar expects you to call them a gaming business i will just call them a fraud company that produces pay to win video games just like ea for most people this was once a great game but nowdays it s just a huge disappointment with a big fan base i guess it s a good thing that i purchased this for cheap when it was on sale but do not pay for this game at full price i wish i can file for a refund but sadly i can t do that if you are looking for a fun game to play with friends that is similar to gta v play purchase garry s mod,387.8,252.0,19,Not Recommended,"October 30, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Newa Zusa

38738,2022 introductionthe embodiment of gaming s self irony mocking corporate greed until you start showcasing that precise trait in real life that is how grand theft auto 5 can be summarised at least as far as i m concerned out of sheer boredom rather than explicit intention i ve decided to review a title i still hold in high regard even if it s starting to feel more and more like an excruciating guilty pleasure with each passing year of its far prolonged shelf life you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain the catalyst for this article was reading recently that gta v has sold over 170 million units in nine years since release i played it since day one on the ps3 and 2013 now seems like a far cry from current world circumstances i would lie if i claimed that i didn t have a boatload of fun within this condensed open world yet i must warn you that i shall only write about the singleplayer component which i have completed several times by this point yes covering just the part that s been an afterthought for rockstar games since their dear cash cow is still being represented by grand theft auto online if you re looking for hate or praise in regards to shark cards and the organised chaos of multiplayer gta v this isn t the right place i have no desire to indulge in it even if i may have some strong feelings for the practice itself suffice to say i ve been a gta fan for almost 25 years which means i m one of those dinosaurs that enjoyed the series before it went 3d and left its mark upon the gaming industry out of respect for those countless hours of entertainment this franchise has provided me i shall allow it the benefit of doubt in regards to its uncertain future as a singleplayer experience i truly want rockstar to prove me wrong grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by un0w3n storyfrom a narrative perspective you ll either find gta v s story to be a step forward or a side step from the gritty realism of its predecessor my jury s still out yet i am certain of one thing i enjoyed the new approach encompassing multiple protagonists that was the right move in terms of finally bringing a novelty factor towards the same rags to riches pattern exhibited since gta iii not all our current anti heroes start poor and clueless this time around some are even likeable once you role play with them a bit while they still share law breaking proclivities their personalities are fairly fleshed out so they can no longer be boiled down to just thugs with ties to organised crime like in previous gta entries the 2013 renditions of los santos and blaine county are no longer linked to san fierro or las venturas like in 2004 s map of san andreas but it would be a mistake to consider the playground smaller it is in both larger and more condensed chock full of interesting locations and walking caricatures without a doubt the map is the fourth character and the one you ll interact with the most no matter how often you switch between the three official main characters hiking off the beaten path and into the wilderness should still be excercised with caution as cougars can spawn fast and they ll one shot kill more like tear you to pieces unless you spot them in time hunter becoming prey is a nice twist and this title is filled with occasions turning tropes upside down graphics the rockstar advanced game engine abbreviated as rage is state of the art and proprietary to its developer no surprise given the massive popularity of grand theft auto and the near limitless budgets which rockstar titles can enjoy while stability can t be guaranteed on launch day it s mostly smooth sailing after a patch or two by 2022 you can t expect any technical issues from gta v if you have a decent enough system adhering to the recommended specs grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by un0w3n a sight to behold if you can max it out and it s making my task very easy in terms of disabling the hud at will and going crazy with the screenshots still resumed myself to a number shy of 300 images for my official showcase but i surely archived twice as many pics by the time i had reached story progress and side activities to 100 never a dull moment trust me on that the vanilla textures and assets are still passable but if the system can handle it dip your toes into some visual mods first person perspective on pc was a delight coming from the ps3 version audiogta titles have been shining through their talented voice actors since 2001 with no exception whether we re talking hollywood actors past their prime or illustrious nobodies skyrocketing to fame and online harassment sometimes it sounds convincing and amusing even in situations when these games try to act all serious no cause for complaints and that can only be highlighted by stellar choices in terms of soundtrack my love for 80s music started with gta iii and reached maturity by the time vice city was all the rage i m forever grateful to this series for shaping my tastes in music gameplaythe true heist only takes place after you ve completed all the heist missions if you play your cards right and you should as gaming the stock market is highlighting a very real concern in regards to our society today the real crooks are sharply dressed and strolling around in their ivory tower skyscrapers manipulating the stock markets and banking system for their own selfish interests what you rob during the story s heist missions will be little more than peanuts in comparison to what you ll score once you gently push the markets in your favor save lester s assassination side missions until you ve finished the rest of the story you can then find guides on how to maximize your payout by the end of it all you ll have more cash than stuff to spend it on just be patient and don t go on a shopping spree prior to manipulating the stocks it may even open your eyes on how that world and ours truly operate only thing missing after that is a career in politics dlc or any sort of additional content for gta v in fact grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by un0w3n dlc plans were obviously scrapped to make way for the lucrative online modes still won t throw shade on them even if a single hour of multiplayer was enough in my case different strokes for different blokes more sp heists would have been nice you certainly don t need anyone telling you how to play a gta entry right obeying the traffic laws isn t a very high priority mission diversity is guaranteed and the cutscenes almost give the metal gear series a run for its money if only they d be just as lengthy verdictoverall i am not surprised that grand theft auto v has stood the test of time for nearly a decade the singleplayer component alone is superior to all open world competitors focusing on contemporary urban tales they don t call them gta clones without a good reason of course i ve played a lot of open world titles since it became a favorite genre of mine also thanks to gta some two decades ago much has changed even rockstar itself i won t be entirely pessimistic about what the future may hold and regardless of that make sure you enjoy gta v s story before heading to online and never looking back strong points steam achievements replay value overload excellent story characters gorgeous graphics and sounds weak points no steam trading cards this article was submitted for imperial reviews following my curator page will help me keep publishing new reviews as soon as i can thank you for

38746,2017 i hate to have to give this game a negative i really do flat out makes me tired of it having to do so it s a fun game great map wonderful level of detail amazing amount of things to do the single player story is awesome and if you plan on buying it for the single player i would recommend it played it during the ps3 era and really enjoyed it even online at the time it was fun but on to headache of why i have to give this a negative shark cards paying real money to get yourself in game currency i think it s trashed this game significantly i get it yea rockstar you somehow need to make money to keep this game active and for the free dlc you ve been providing thats available for all players first off the price of these shark cards and how much you get out of them 100 for 8 million come on really that buys you 2 3 top tier vehicles tops because you have everything inflated in the market making it practically a grind nightmare hell the megalagon gets you halfway to a yacht that s priced at 16 million literally 200 worth of shark cards for a single yacht that you can t even drive around from what i hear the things practically pointless and all you can do on it is change your clothes and sleep like if rockstar did this the standard way and sold their dlc it would literally be priced at a couple or even several hundred dollars in their world or hell 200 for a single thing that serves you literally no purpose and i m scared to even look up how amount of in game currency i have to even get in order to buy every vehicle that s released in these dlc s literally a massive grind nightmare which leads to my 2nd point on shark cards like lets say i magically have the money to afford and waste on a couple thousand dollars worth of shark cards rockstars wet dream than what as a 90 s gamer what in the hell is the point of doing anything like player missions heists cargo missions etc if i already have everything provided cause i paid real cash for it maybe have fun doing them all once with really nice stuff but that isn t really all that long to do and you have absolutely nothing to strive for in game cause you already have everything thirdly rockstar will do anything to this game and at all cost to get you to buy a shark card raise prices of new vehicles and really just about everything they add lower payouts on missions not to mention long cool off times so you re not making so much so fast increase costs of practically everything and make sure that it remains high for you and i ll continue on that and why i mentioned it their whole world revolves on whatever it takes to getting you to buy a friggin shark card it just sucks frankly now on to the ceo work ugh this system that they have going on here just doesn t work nobody in their right mind is going to be your associate or bodyguard with these payouts nobody maybe if you can trick a scrub into working for you a bit before they realize they can make more money doing their own thing seriously it isn t worth it there s absolutely no incentive for people to work for you but against you now that s when a bigger grind nightmare happens because every player in session is bound to screw you up like special cargo for example all it takes is one player in a fancy hydra and its over you ve lost tens if not hundreds of thousands on all this cargo that didn t make you jack in the end which leads to people especially us pc gamers to resource monitor the hell out of a full public session and play it absolutely alone and that sucks too to fill a 111 crate warehouse would take you days worth of gameplay if done alone and hell a week s worth doing one crate at a time to give you the better profit margin like what is this rockstar a job its supposed to be a game not everybody has that amount of free time like i do sadly but if you have 20 to spend on a shark card it will give you close to the amount you d make and that gives you really nothing that s going to help you grind vehicle cargo literally blows me away never have i felt so ripped off in a video game making on average 75k profit selling a supercar that markets for close to 3 million i m sorry what and what you have to go through to source a car with npc s left right and helicopters shooting and crashing into you to make sure the repair costs rack up you ll have a similar story doing vip work i find it so dumb that the only thing worth doing in all that is cocaine and that accounts for a small margin of what else you can do and their payouts literally are not worth the cost so thankfully i saw right through those shark cards and never bought one infact i m proud i never gave rockstar that satisfaction for the sake of gta6 and the future of gta online i have to give this a negative review this turn the gaming industry has taken the past few years is just depressing it s definitely not what it used to be but hell rockstar may never read this or even consider a thing if they did cause it s all about profit and statistics now guess i ve made my point,230.1,176.0,6,Not Recommended,"November 18, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Dr.Badass

38754,2023 my 18 year old ask me to reinstall the game and in doing so i noticed that i had yet to review the game we have at the time of this review over 320 hours play time on the pc with nearly double that on the ps4 funny thing is that we have never even completed the story campaign or played on the online portion the vast majority of the time was just my daughter and i making tons and tons of mayhem well more me making the mayhem and her going on joy rides for years now she has asked me when gtva 6 was coming out and she was so glad to hear that it was finally coming out in a couple more years i don t care what people say i am glad for her that she will finally have a female anti hero to play as in the past we have always modded the game just so she could play as a female character i tire of people saying a game is woke just because it has a female lead grow up and get with the current century is what i have to say and i am in my fifties so it isn t like i am a millennial or gen z saying this if you don t like the character being female do the opposite of what we did and mod the character to a male anyway it is amazing how much fun this game is just driving around and sightseeing even after all these years the game still holds up as a decent looking game rockstar put heart and soul into the game and it shows by the way if you ever get a chance to meet steven ogg voice of trevor in real life do it the dude is hundred kinds of funny and a cool dude all around,338.7,244.0,13,Recommended,"December 20, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,"Motivia

38755,2017 do you want an online gaming experience where you have to either grind for months or spend real money to have enough in game cash for the car house or even the gun you want do you want an online gaming experience where the entire playerbase only exists to prevent you from grinding effectively do you want an online gaming experience full of hackers who will randomly and illegally give you and everyone else free money just because they can do you want an online gaming experience where paranoia over said hackers causes the devs to randomly and without warning adjust read steal millions of dollars out of your in game account even if you earned it legitimately or bought it directly from them do you want an online gaming experience where confronting the devs on their forums about this leads to them blocking your account and banning you from the servers of course not because you re not a moron stay away from this mess edit okay so i feel like there s been a bit of confusion over what exactly happened so let me describe the situation to the best of my abilities i had 6 million dollars i didn t buy a shark card i didn t hack i didn t exploit i grinded for several hours using the methlab to get 6 million dollars legitimately i was going for 10 million so i could buy a yacht stupid investment i know but i really wanted that damn boat and i woke up one morning and got a message that said that rockstar noticed an anomalous cashflow pattern in my account and they had adjusted it accordingly all my money except for about 2000 was gone i got in contact with a customer service rep on the forums and she informed me that the server reported that i was earning way too much money way too quickly to be playing legitimately and told me that if i wanted my money back i should just buy a shark card she refused to give me back my money refused to transfer me to a superior and warned me that if i didn t drop the issue i would be banned for cheating admittedly at this point i started testing her so she left the chat and when i tried to contact another customer service rep i was unable to because as expected i was permanently banned from the rockstar forums i also received a 2 month ban from gta online i know the singleplayer s good i know the game is polished and i know that i m not the best player out there this isn t about any of that this is about a large game company using microtransactions to effectively hold hours worth of hard work for ransom rockstar has gone down the path of ea and ubisoft in how much they treat their customers like dirt and i don t want to just stand by and watch helplessly i know this review isn t going to do anything but it s better than doing nothing,204.2,626.0,68,Not Recommended,"October 29, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Toxi

38757,2017 steam says i have 352 hours on gtav gtao considering i ported my character over from xbox 360 it should be at least double that so lets say 700 hours i have spent aproximately 700 hours playing this video game yet i cannot recommend it yes i have had some of the best gaming i ve ever had with this game i thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign i played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside i even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card i was there for the dns glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur and i was there when they cut literally everyone s funds to 500 000 as a fix but one day i was playing and some guy joins the server forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him freezes us and makes bags of money rain from the sky don t get me wrong i m not stupid i know people hack and people give out money i ve seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc i ve generally ignored them but this guy didn t give me much of a choice regardless once i figured out what was happening i left the server i didn t want the money in my bank so i blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up a couple hours later i was temporarily banned and my character was reset i lost all of my cars including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched not to mention the majority of that 700 hours i d put into having a character i liked rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me my ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim there was no way for me to voice my displeasure to rockstar no appeals process for them to hear my case check the evidence and see my innocence that was several months ago i uninstalled the game and let it go i m only writing this now so that others can see what they re getting into yes as i ve said this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content from an objective standpoint its very good value for money and the free regular dlc is a nice touch what ruins all of that is the way rockstar treats its customers there s no consistency and no compassion i know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they ve never had any trouble yet it happens to me once without my consent and i get temp banned and lose literally everything what motivation is there to play legitimately then if people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision and those who don t can get away with it indefinitely hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience rockstar if you actually end up reading this please start treating your customers with some compassion don t assume we re all hackers,352.0,616.0,22,Not Recommended,"September 6, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Deacon Blues

38764,2023 product received for free the game is great i kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points the following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam people do that to trick you into giving you steam points the steam currency by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all lies and deceipt i am a 52 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now 16 my son recently started dinkum and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,295.5,195.0,23,Recommended,"February 14, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,"FanFiction

38784,2015 hey guys i don t usually write reviews but grand theft auto v is a game that is absolutely worth it a game that breaked most impressive records of guiness book best selling action adventure video game in 24 hours 12 milion copies best selling video game in 24 hours 564 milion fastest entertainment property to gross 1 billion fastest video game to gross 1 billion highest grossing video game in 24 hours highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours including hollywood movies most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game most viewed trailer of an action adventure video game 800 milion views graphics1 graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible the game runs smooth on any kind of gpu s and cpu s as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements by the way these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details 2 graphic details are the best i have seen especially in an open world game if i was to tell you all about this topic i would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours because boy there are lots to talk about i m just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me a day night cycle recreation sure this is not something new in its essence it has been done before and not just in gta but the way we see it here it s what s amazing the way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it s off the charts you don t even realize when the afternoon becomes evening the only way you can tell it s that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you b rain again not a new feature actually is quite an old one but the way it s been reproduced in gtav you can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact apart from the obvious what makes rain so special in gtav well the sound this is something that not many people talk about yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game the way rockstar games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain besides everything else c night time baby sure we had night in gta iv and even before that so why do i mention this well because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows i am not talking just about the graphics aspect what i m saying is that the night in gtav gives you the impression of actual liveliness the whole city comes to life it s just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever 3 cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we ve seen in previous gta s i m not talking about a direct comparison because of the obvious reason 2015 2010 but what i m trying to say is that i personally wasn t that impressed at the time by the cars helis planes in gta4 as i am now in gtav gameplay and featuresoh yea the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for gtav to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come 1 car control i feel like thanking rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter car control was preety much garbage in gta iv and for this reason alone i had no big expectations for this new series well i was wrong the car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing nfs mw back in the day besides the control there is the sound of the car s engine which is perfectly accurate 2 randomness now what in god s name i m talking about well have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help a woman s that was about to get raped a kid who s bike was stolen hitchhiker asking you to take her him home etc usually for a reward if you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal but baby this stuff gives gtav a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game 3 los santos customs again not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special have you tried modifying the car s suspension of course you did what am i saying but have you actually paid attention of it s realism after the change was made well for those who haven t and for the one s who dont own the game yet let me tell you that this feature is game making my favorite car in gtav is the grotti carbonizzare also known as the ferarri f12 now think how am i gonna drive that beast on the city s roads especially in areas like groove hilwood rockford these are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads so you cant really drive a ferarri in these parts of the town well you can modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn t just make for visual effects but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads turns hard turns btw if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings for me this is one of the best things i ve seen in this game 4 activities driving mission making robberies flying hunting diving piloting aircrafts submarines boats golf tennis cards smoke weed racing playing the stock market you will never get bored in this game not even in single player mode there are so many more things to talk about but the review would be monstruosly long so in a few words buy the game it will be the best investment you have done in a pc game for those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom i can tell you in short that this game excels in every aspect weapons look so realistic in first person mode cars have a mind blowing realistic control weather has never been better reproduced etc gl hf,944.5,218.0,34,Recommended,"April 25, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,Valkyrie.

38829,2018 usually i dont do reviews on steam about games but rockstars greed and rockstars support impotence made me unstoppable to not throw out my feelings so i remember first time gta v was announced to pc i was excited as huge gta franchise fan intrigued that finaly i would not need to dream about playstation to play one of best games ever that was huge pricy but huge loved it anyway ordered a pre order with some huge bonuses here in steam for quite a lot for that time for game enjoyed first i enjoyed game really much liked it loved it played it a lot but real life took my attention and gta v and especially gta v online hours reduced till i was legit to say im not playing it anymore so few weeks before i write this review i returned and was suprised that there is a lot things to upgrade purchase and amazing new content even got new friends since my old friends was not playing gta v anymore started to understand that it will take few weeks to get some of my mostly desired content that meant playing mc stuff selling bunker stuff researching bunker stuff playing heists and everything since my cars was so slow and not top notch couldnt afford compatable for racing so far so good yeah i always was aginst cheating public looby modders always f k things up bomb you remotely engage pvp with god mode or etc simply hated it till i found community to play with and who usually occupies public lobby and kicks anyone who is just cheating or creating cage around you perfect my return will be easier in such community i will need few less weeks to get desired items some members are rich and lets test me newest cars my best was zentorno and osiris t20 too but there wooow buggati chiron like car and it cost millions so community players see that i cannot afford even security on my mc businesses and in some heists they put me in clear advantage since they gave double digit millions in account i usually didnt have more than 1 5 million in game cash and put my reward for heist ridicilusly high 75 nice good heist time evenings and luckly selling some bunker stuff and woilaa got 3 7 millions in game cash tought about what to buy and since it was late evening went to sleep with idea that tomorrow i will choose what of desired content i will buy got really excited about community and game again fully returning to play it sounds too good yes today its evening of the day i wanted to choose what to buy i recieve email that ive been bad boy by violationg terms of service eula and i got suspended for 30 days and all my items will be deleted devasted at beginning not really even tought phe ive have done nothing bad didnt cheat whatever it must be error and usually that kind of stuff is repaired and all will be fine ive been heard that there is ban waves where innocent people been banned and tought that rockstar should be fixing that so with good willing made ticket in rockstar support about my suspension and warning to delete all achievments ive been earned so far some of them for example my first supercar zentorno more than few years old guess what they auto close this kind of ticket okay thought thats a bug so i got live chat with support and explained what halppened and first line of support just say he cant help me there is some factor that is reason for banning me and when asked about what he was not able to say just that its violation of tos eula as experienced customer support guy i understand first line guys problem and tell okay please escalate issue about bug to his supervisor if he really cant help so amazingly my live chat with support is taken to other guy which is less coming to me back and just closes conversation with same text i will not tell why you got banned its not without reason im shocked even angry i paid at that time 60 for game devasted support should not be so bad but then i started reading reviews and internet about everything and i see a lot complains about banning innocent players yet i remember how was going in random public lobby if not blown appart then caged with some modder and then me who hard work in game cash to get desired car and now this my gta v online character will be deleted all my cars will be deleted how i feel about it im devasted paid for game and i will be honest online part of game is last that im in there for since single player i have been 100 completed on xbox360 and now they take me from me without reason or because their ban bot is failure or mistaken or simply badly coded i keep asking why rockstar is doing this my only guess would be that 60 i have paid to them ofc steam takse some part so tehnicly a bit less is not enough or they want more you would ask how i become to this illuminati theory just keeped asking why ofc i have another steam accounts and by cs go items played that game for more thousands of hours i can sell i can easaly earn those 20 and not be about all unfairness of rockstar here but im man with principles and i can publicy tell no rockstar i will not pay you more to get content i already paid for long time ago overpriced amount of what to do next sue rockstar nah i readed tos eula and terms i have checked checkbox that i agree and it basicly removes any rights to me to go to court to say that rockstar is simply abusing me forget no im man of principle wait 30 days and start from zero probably at this point thats only thing i have left and apparently i will return to game but probably it will take for me more than 30 days for that just because my anger about unfair situation is too big but i still love this game yet i understand that developer company and support is softly saying bad at this point im really glad that i never bought any shark cards and i will never buy extra copy of gta v on other accounts to pay extra to rockstar over and dissapointed,988.6,343.0,29,Not Recommended,"September 6, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Veisterios

38838,2019 ok so this is a review strictly for gtao ok alright gtao is like an abusive relationship you get over by everything in this game every 5 minutes but you still keep playing because it s fun the game is constantly playing against you you want to deliver your 2 8 million car for merely 100k yeah yeah sure just let me spawn a couple of enemy npcs that can randomly spawn at any moment quite often literally in your way and drain your car s worth significantly ok don t want to export your super sport cars sure you can do some cargo missions maybe awesome enter your bigblacktruck and start a 3 box mission which is basically a 50 50 chance for a 20 minute deliver mission or a 5 minute delivery mission not that bad to be fair but as i said some of these can be completely cancerous to complete especially if you re new try to take down a valkyrie helicopter with your puny carbine rifle it s not that bad when you have a homing launcher or a sniper maybe but for someone who s new these cargo missions are for all types of players be it new or veteran it can be quite a hassle to complete one of these especially picking them each and deliverin up to 5 miles to your warehouse fine it s annoying but what about heists heists are the selling point for some people in this game yes you do get heist and they re actually great they re fun they re enjoyable though repetetive they are fun when they work unless you have 4 2 for some heists and doomsday ones people for best experience friends they work wonders it s really fun and challenging to go into a huge bunker shoot up some mercs and steal some delicous money but see you probably don t have friends and you try to complete a heist with some randoms well that s where the fun ends because in some way this game has attracted a lot of stupid people who can t even use a keyboard to play the game you could spend literal hours trying to get pass one heist and be amazed at how stupid people can be if you re new please stay away from heists for a while unless you have some friends yeah there are more ways to make money but who cares lol i do kinda freemode money making is a pain if you dont know how to make a solo public lobby i don t want to talk much about this so imagine it as vietnam war with jet bikes that shoot missiles cars that fly cars that shoot missiles and cars that have literally saws on them and you re a poor vietnamese farmer trying to tend to his field even though the game tells you to destroy people s business cargo and like that you get like 2 4k for destroying someone s 3 hours of work do not trust the game in my eyes this is just an advanced trick to tilt players into making them buying shark cards which are majorly overpriced i m just writing this to let people know what they re getting into you see a lot of reviews saying that there s a lot of kd warriors modders kids griefers although its true in my experience they aren t that common as long as you aren t in a 15 lobby you really shouldn t be afraid of people i ve truly met a lot of people who were bad but it wasn t always bad i had people come over and defend me from enemy spawns police or even other players rockstar honestly pleasantly surprised me with the new casino update to sum it up shortly quite a few ways to gamble they are actually quite fun to do i personally really like to play the different games and basically pray to rng gods for a blessing they added new cars a few new missions a penthouse highly customizable and my favourite feature a wheel of fortune where you can win lol this was really good content and a lot of people really did like it but what most didn t expect is rockstar throwing an unexpected curve ball and nerfing some pvp aspects like passive mode which is great,357.8,124.0,42,Recommended,"June 13, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"crone

38839,2020 i want to preface this with a note of how sad it makes me to write this i ve played this game with friends since it came out for xbox 360 and have had some really amazing memories while playing i even bought copies of this game for over 8 of my friends when it came out on pc because of how excited i was to play it on a quality system instead of a console with that said however i would never recommend buying a rockstar game of any kind both gta online and red dead redemption online have become utter and total garbage we are also committed to ensuring that our games are fun for everyone and as safe as possible from modders cheaters hackers and those who seek to harass other players the above statement from rockstar is a joke at best rockstar legitimately doesn t care at all about user experience or about being accountable to their promises or offers they allow players to mod and hack their game online and do nothing at all to enforce any kind of rules regarding this however they will punish players who haven t modded but have gotten cash from modders whether the player wanted that money or not they constantly add new game features that are either broken and don t work at all or just ruin the enjoyment available to game play oppressor mk2 rockstar will also punish players for using so called in game exploits that their poor programming and total lack of testing foresight created yet they refuse to do anything at all to rectify the untenable situation that modders have created in their games its honestly just pathetic and indicates that their programmers and project managers are either lazy amateurs or just plain dumb they will also constantly advertise bonus cash payouts for their shark cards that they literally never pay out check the rockstar support forums regarding this and you can find countless entries regarding players not being paid out the bonus cash for more than 6 years now you are better off buying a copy of fallout 76 or any ea game even at least that garbage is better supported and maintained than any rockstar game and speaking frankly i doubt that rockstar will ever change how they respond to player requests and their game being ruined by the select few who choose to cheat rip rd online and gta online you were both beautiful ideas that your creators simply saw for cash cows i pity any of the developers who were passionate about this because their passions have been treated with 0 respect and 0 care tl drgta online and rd online are so plagued with hacking modding and glitchy missions events they aren t playable rockstar gives 0 they will lie to you about offers and punish you for complaining or commenting you are wasting your money if you buy 0 10,844.1,167.0,9,Not Recommended,"September 9, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"Sir Winston The Steedless

38854,2023 i like how the other reviews sound like wikipedia articles here s an actual review from an actual person if you said that gta v is the best game of all time i wouldn t argue with you what rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated we re still playing it religiously 10 years after it came out one decade let that sink in the use of three protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways we ve never seen before getting three different perspectives on the same story is extremely interesting each of the protagonists holds their own trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever i love the al pacino vibe that michael gives off and franklin s journey is awesome to see the gameplay is top notch i love the gunplay and the driving is stellar it s much better than the boat steering from gta 4 the story is incredible there isn t much of an emotional attachment but it s still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs i replay this game once a year because i love it so much the map is one of the best out there and there s a reason it s used when judging the maps of new games online is a completely different story it s toxic and pay to win it s fun with friends but random lobbies are awful overall gta v is a 5 5 there s really nothing that can bring down the score,638.8,150.0,5,Recommended,"November 22, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,avarittia

38863,2017 grand theft auto v is the definition of a love hate relationship it s one of those games that would greatly benefit from a neutral recommendation this game does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong i ll be discussing the single player portion and the online portion in seperate sections as at this point they are nowhere near the same game anymore tl dr at bottom general the attention to detail throughout the game is absolutely stunning puddles are dynamic people comment on your car as you drive by cars will have their tires turned into the curb when downhill parking it s mad it s clear that significant amounts of effort when into creating a living breathing environment for los santos the game is gorgeous everywhere you turn there is a beautiful sunset impressive reflections and eye catching vibrant colors it s such a breath of fresh air compared to the generic brown grey colour palette luckily optimization allows gta v to run as smooth as butter i ve been running the game on a gtx 1060 6gb on ultra high settings and have been consistently getting a 60 70 fps with very few frame drops friends with lower end gpus have reported the same thing to me this game is widely playable across a lot of systems in my experience first person is a welcomed edition from the last gen edition of the game if anyone still plays those nearly the entire game can be played through in first person which offers an interesting and often times challenging perspective for races firefights and roaming the city single player the single player is and always has been an amazingly enjoyable experience it s a lovely blend of gritty twisted dark plotlines and absurd entertaining fun there are some scenes that were a bit too much for me the trevor torture scene still keeps me awake at night but this all ultimately comes down to personal preference the character dynamic between franklin micheal and trevor is fun to watch unfold throughout your time playing which could be a while it took me about 50 hours to finish the main story and 90 hours to 100 it however content is limited thanks to rockstars inability to hear the community s cry for solo content a lot of people wouldn t mind spending 10 20 on an expansion for the single player but rockstar continues to ignore half of it s game to continue to work on it s cash cow grand theft auto online gta online sings a tune very different from that of the single player online is at best a hugely entertaining passtime and at worst a horrible nightmare to play the game essentially revolves around completing missions jobs heists etc in order to acquire large sums of money you then use this money to buy vehicles weapons and property which often times unlocks new missions jobs and heists to play at your disposal the main problem with this model is that unless you re willing to grind your ass off you re not getting anything quick as more and more updates come out the prices of things go up and up all in a desperate attempt to push shark cards in game currency for real money what s even worse is that the value of shark cards has not kept up with the insane inflation that gta online has had over the years on launch 1 000 000 was an insane amount of money now it s chump change with every new update comes millions upon millions of dollars you need to spend in order to get anything the most expensive shark card in the game 99 99 usd gives you 8 000 000 in game you will burn through that quick so unless you re ready to spend a lot of money to get everything you want you ll be grinding what adds insult to injury is all of the hackers spawning themselves infinite amounts of money and all the bans that don t get applied you d be lucky not to have some sort of hacker in your lobby they run rampant with free rain to kill everyone and everything and spawn themselves and you money don t worry rockstar will just ban them right that d be nice most of the time they do ban waves they catch thousands of innocent players who have worked hard for their money and will either take their money or ban them completely from online it s entirely innapropriate and rockstar really needs to work on it so say you ve acquired your money you ve bought some nice things and now you re enjoying free roam prepare to be blasted to hell by one of the most toxic communities i ve ever experienced this game breeds toxicity people will blow up you your car your plane and your will to live low leveled players have little to no chance of fighting back as they don t have sticky bombs miniguns or any other of the strong anti grief weapons your only option after that is passive mode which is no fun whatsoever basically what i m getting at is online is a complete nightmare to play alone however if you and a couple buddies pick up the game and play together you re in for some of the most fun you ll ever have playing races and missions together away from public lobbies is the most entertaining thing i ve ever played the most recent update the doomsday heist reintroduced new pve content instead of the hollow pvp content they ve been pushing lately it s a huge step in the right direction for the future of this game and if they continue on the path of pve and co op i can see this game lasting a lot longer into the future i cannot stress it enough if you plan on getting this game for online get it with friends tl dr pros amazing single player experience extremely detailed world beautiful scenery and environments impressive optimizations stupid fun recent updates for online are a step in the right direction cons rest in peace single player content stupid hard push on shark cards one of the most toxic communities i ve ever seen hackers run rampant 24 7 grind to get anywherei want to be able to fully recommend this game 100 but i simply can t while i do fully recommend it if you plan on playing it with friends the downsides of playing online by yourself are staggering i repeat if you plan on playing the online play it with a couple of friends you will enjoy your experience exponentially more,615.5,186.0,19,Recommended,"December 17, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Fruit

38879,2017 gta series was one of my favorite franchises ever i ve been playing gta since the first one i loved these guys so much but with gta v they showed their true colors and how only money matters to them they showed you can crap on your fanbase because they re suckers that will still buy your games and content previously i wrote a bad review because of some big flaws in the game including how the game stopped working and support didn t want to help me and multiple complaints overall then two days later i got banned my characfter was reset all my money vehicles and my house were erased from history this is unacceptable behaviour the devs are greedy that never care about their customers and fans they mentioned cheating i never cheated in gta v not even in sp i never even had any shady software open at the same time as gta i did run into an incident with a cheater that kept killing me whilist being invulnerable after we got in some argument and he threatened to get me banned but it was quite a while before that i did have recording of everything but of course nobody from rockstar support cared cheaters can just steal your name and get you banned it s the simplest thing whether my ban and reset were because of my review or because some cheater used my name and people reported him while he was using my name it doesn t matter this isn t a company i will ever forgive a highly priced game with an noline system built to extort money from you if you want progression otherwise you will grind for dozens after dozens after dozens of hours to get some cool vehicles a nice house and whatever a system built on purpose to make you want to pay extra for stuff i never minded grinding much in games because it adds purpose but in this case it s total and rip off on top of the game price an 8 000 000 shark card costs 74 99 euros you know what that money will get you in game a nice car with mods that s all it might seem like a lot if you didn t play the game but no shark cards indeed because this company that many grew up with and loved ate their fans alive they re a shark tank themselves the game is also ridden with some nasty bugs optimized like hell cp2077 has graphics10 times better has a bigger world and advanced graphical technologies and works with 20 more fps than gta v a game released quite some years ago if rockstar ever wants to redeem themselves they will need to stop destroying their players hard work in their online game they will let people enjoy the game without intervening they owuld fix what s broken awful product awful company awful everything it s just a money siphon for them and as a reference 74 99 euros would be too much even for 8 billion in game cash not million because the money goes away fast the more expensive vehicles house you have the more you pay for in game daily fees and one day in gta v is not 24 hours either it s 48 minutes,939.2,51.0,2,Not Recommended,"March 29, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"sfarog [m0rph]

38888,2018 after todays new game update you guys said original story i feared gta online would die a slow death with the arrival of red dead redemption 2 s multiplayer mode on consoles but it doesn t look like that s going to be the case just yet just no gta online died when you morons decided to make it p2p peer to peer connection instead of dedicated servers where anyone can use mods and cheats without consequences you literally have around 10 20 of the people using mods who just mess with you when you try to do missions putting you in cages killing you over and over again with their godlike teleportation mode on etc i would have bought in game money for real money if it wasn t for the cheaters why would i spend one dollar more on this game where other players can just download cheats and give themselves infinite money gta online could have been one of the biggest if not the biggest online game if your management weren t absolutey morons happy you guys never became as big as fortnite you idiots don t deserve it at all edit to make things clear i hate fortnite lol i ve tried it twice uninstalled both times within 30 minutes you can go check twitch movies shows everyone is streaming talking about fortnite never said it was a good game but at least they try and they put out a lot of content and deal with cheaters which is why they ve had big success you can t argue against their success no matter what you think of their game rockstar pretends like nothing while so many cheaters are running rampart ruining everyones experience real shame because i really loved the game itself but i m tired of cheaters messing with you for no reason just for the attention because their life have no meaning and no one cares about them in real life,520.1,531.0,79,Not Recommended,"December 12, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,copyfox
38889,2017 if you want to buy it for the singleplayer only go ahead it is great diverse and has a lot to offer if you are looking for a good multiplayer experience skip this they have locked down the mp a lot to allow for the sale of their microtransaction cards it is a grindy mess goes against the theme of the game you don t steal cars you have to buy them to own them the expensive one everyone would want you get punished for killing and destroying players and their vehicle in mp price inflation because of the microtransaction is a constant issue and the game without paying is grindy as all get out there is no online mode that allows you to mess with the the game you can t for example have fun going on a rampage because the game actively punishes you both for setting you to be aggressive and also monetarily everything costs money weapons are locked behind a ranking system plus a cost so when you are new and try to get into online you will probably get killed by people that already have those unlocked with no recourse armored vehicles that cannot be destroyed without explosives will be the bane of your existance and of course they tried to kill off the modding community so no do not support them if you are interested in multiplayer you can buy it for mp if you have a lot of time and are completely bored out of your mind because it will take you forever to get things done,204.3,780.0,32,Not Recommended,"July 15, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,UsF

38904,grand theft auto v is that sandbox open world experience that keeps you busy for 200 hours in single player or 500 hours or more in multiplayer in single player mode you ll find a long and beautiful campaign with over 70 main missions and 3 endings that alone is going to take over 30 hours if you rush it but i advise to enjoy and explore everything because it s worth we used gta 5 as a benchmark for a reason for so many years being in the top games used in video cards testing for its almost perfect optimization visually the game still looks good even today and the voice and sound quality is on another level we often hear the gta clone comparisson when a similar title is released and unfortunately no other game in this genre got closet to the production value and overall quality of this game the strangers and freaks the side missions and side activities represent a huge chunk of the game it s amazing how much details and work they put into these there is also the multiplayer which received along the years many content updates i dare say the multiplayer missions are at the same level of quality as the campaign missions if you re afraid of cheaters you can create a session only for you and play it alone without some features but enough to finish everything by yourself of course bringing some friends makes everything better in a nutshell gta 5 s a complete game i dare say one of the best experience you can have in a virtual world let hope gta 6 will bring to the table the same level of quality pros amazing story with great voice acting huge amount of content multiplayer receive content updates even after 9 yearscons sometimes in multiplayer it s best to create a only friend invite session to avoid cheaters my review score story 10 gameplay 9graphics 8music 9 overall 9,169.5,83.0,2,Recommended,January 16,Grand Theft Auto V,Liviu

38912,2021 everybody and their mama knows about this game singleplayer is fun unique funny intense gripping the story isn t perfect or a masterpiece but it s still good it s a pretty old game at this point yet it still competes with anything released this year it looks great has great gameplay well it s the best gta there is couldn t really add anything more online is fun yet it could be improved so much in many different areas first of all the content itself could be much more diverse and less grindy i understand that rockstar games is making bread through microtransactions but still grinding for a hundred hours to buy expensive things can get stale really quick secondly many online mods in gta san andreas had better ideas for businesses and jobs in terms of their mechanics that make gta v slightly underwhelming in that regard next up are griefers damn so many of these stacked up high level kids with flying jet like bikes that can automatically lock on and shoot homing missiles and there goes your slow ass post office van stacked with cocaine that you ve been driving for the past 10 minutes to your destination and waited beforehand for an hour after paying for supplies to produce the product it s a very large gap between newbies and daily grinders it s also pretty overwhelming for a new player at first plenty of activities constant emails and messages no idea where to start or what to do besides the griefers the community itself is pretty good during missions and heists it s true they re mostly bad at their tasks or just can t cooperate properly but it seems that they always apologize for their mistakes and no one really starts insulting each other so that s pretty dope i also have to mention the hackers though i see them constantly the majority of them doesn t even bother me they re mostly just having fun on their own and don t disrupt the crowd lastly the glitches and crashes yes they re pretty common and it seems that rockstar doesn t really care much about the majority of them crashing and losing your valuable product glitching and getting stuck in the middle of the heist or just entering into an infinite loading screen is just another feature at this point though some glitches such as teleporting or playing in a solo lobby are almost necessary to ease your life a tad bit overall a 9 10 if online wasn t a thing i d give an 8 at most,185.9,105.0,5,Recommended,"December 18, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"Kuroi

38945,2019 got banned from gta online for 30 days by rockstar even though ive never modded hacked or griefed in this game so i am not recommending this is they are going to ban innocent people not only that they are going to reset my character acting as if i modded values also not recommending this as in private matches for gtao you cannot do much the game forces you to deal with the cancerous griefers in this online community and lastly the store is generic and boring online is the only thing worth playingbut after almost 100 hours and now i am getting banned for nothing when i know people who actually mod and either never get banned or only get a 2 week or less slap on the hand i think this game is really boring alonepayouts for jobs and missions online are terrible sometimes it feels like there are too many things to check on everytime im online other players can ruin your game by stealing your stuff in the online mode there are tons of things i really think suck about this game if i could id return it and spend my 20 spent on this on something else the only good thing is when i get friends and we can clear a public room and just do our things without having to worry about griefers the mk2 oppressor users and the orbital cannon users playing with friends can be the only redemption unless you like greifers and a terrible moderation system that bans you for being in a room with random modders who you report but inturn somehow are banned instead guess they dont know what the f ck they are doing so cheers good luck to you if you decide to buy it it was fun before i got banned for a month for playing the game legitly and grinding my off for little to no payout and i hope you dont run into any hackers and modders that cause you to meet the same fate as me unless rockstar changes their mind and removes my ban doesnt reset my account idk why they are in the first place i may change my review cause i did have some fun until the grinding became the only thing to do it is more fun with friends 7 10 for the game itself1 10 for their moderation service especially since i know modders who are still active and never banned but i get banned 2 10 for rockstar as they need to fix this game a lotbetter payouts more ways to pay associates without having to swapbeing able to use the motorcycle club and ceo stuff in private modes and without having to change between being a mc president and a ceo cause that is tedious and annoying and for a better moderation service that is why rockstar is receiving a 2 10 from me the game isnt terrible tho but if i am getting banned for being innocent i cannot recommend this game,98.9,275.0,61,Not Recommended,"August 15, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,SupremeChongus

38955,2018 first rule of gta v if you want to mod don t go online unless you clear the base game folder of any added files otherwise you get banned i learnt that the ban system works like that it sees any change in the base game folder and it triggers a ban so that s it if you mod make sure the base game folder is back to the original state nothing added nothing missing apart from that we all know how gta v and gta online is it s all good the online griindy but not much as day 1 since i come from the xbox 360 version which i played online from day 1 things have changed but its still damn fun,455.6,255.0,17,Recommended,"July 1, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"XamPac

38957,2020 this is one of the best games ever made and i m absolutely addicted to it but it doesn t deserve a positive review no i m not referring to campaign i m exclusively speaking about online i won t even write everything i think i ll just say this game is addictive as hell with the right people but the problem is that finding the right people in this game is like finding a needle in a haystack it s just hell the game is riddled with modders that always want to mess with everyone and it s a real pain if you want to mod for money go for it everything in this game is disgustingly overpriced and the payouts for things are garbage making money in the game is easier than ever but the problem is it takes too long and the payout ratio when compared with the prices of items is just ridiculous not everyone has the time to grind for days just to afford one super car or whatever they want to indulge in but when you mod in order to mess with other people s gameplay and hard work e g cargo you re just a worthless scumbag the sad thing is that rockstar don t do anything about it this has been a serious issue for years they don t seem to do much about the modder infestation and it s sad to acknowledge because this game is so amazing do i recommend it unlike what my review states yes i do it s fun and if you have friends it s even better but it doesn t deserve a positive review until rockstar show they care about their community it s that simple,895.7,535.0,86,Not Recommended,"March 7, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,Terpsichora
38960,2016 beautiful and awesome game especially when playing with friends but has non existant customer support hackers are everywhere and rockstar s system only seems to ban legit players furthermore they will not accept responsibility for this and will not unban you regardless if you have 100 s of hours in game and or have poured money into the p2w system it has one fo the most toxic communities out there you can t drive anywhere without being obliterated by some dude who s hacked in a tank the new update only encourages this by telling everyone in the session to kill anyone doing missions for minimal payout 8 8 was a ceo and lost money to random hackers greifers online then got banned because having your internet drop out whilst customising a car is an attempted money glitch all of rockstar s efforts and funds have been put into making money and trying to protect it with anti hacker systems so strict they ban regular players and not a decent support system or more interesting content editrockstar s 1 month ban is now over i contacted them multiple times through their ticket system and by phone to no avail so i waited it out they also decided to remove the 2 mil i grinded for hours to get,301.1,495.0,28,Not Recommended,"September 2, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,shroomer_jim

38986,2019 currently sitting at around 666 hours played so i figured now would be the time to leave this review i ve played this game since the 360 and xbox one on and off recently i switched over to pc however as character transferring was shutdown i was frustrated i would even have been fine with a 1 character account transfer it s obvious i ve been a long time member to summarize what i have learned in the past month or so of playing on pc i will list the pros and cons pros story is excellent modding single player is always fun online can be extremely fun open world especially with friends plenty of cars and customization for gearheads as well as a variety of different weapons to choose from both easy and challenging missions heists community can be go either way of being toxic or extremely fun cons modders if you play this game expect to run into some modders whether they re friendly or not is up to luck they can either spawn in vehicles and be fun or give everyone money and destroy cargo you re trying to sell for some odd 100s of thousands of dollars i meet one almost everyday my suggestion is to play in an invite only session when you can or if you need a public lobby with only you there are ways to make your own that google can help you find griefers when you aren t getting harassed by a modder you meet a griefer there are people who will blow you up over and over until you go into passive mode or that destroy your cargo note that these people don t get anything out of destroying it except to just be mean the excuse that the games tells them to doesn t make them less of an ding dong crashes i m not sure if this is due to modders or my own game but sometimes about once or twice a day i ll get the random crash and have to wait through the 10 minute loading screen note that modders can boot you out of a session and crash your game however edit i haven t crashed as of recently but i am still looking out for this one closely as i believe it is on rockstar s side game age while i admit i m surprised to see this game as lively as it is right now no game lasts forever if gta 6 has an online feature gta 5 online won t be getting as many if any updates and most of the playerbase will switch so if you re brand new it might not be worth the effort to get into a warzone as this especially in it s current state mk2 oppressor do you think missiles are bad enough what about jets now imagine making a jet and compacting it into bike form that s right you have the oppressor mk2 a flying jet bike that can shoot missiles one of the most adaptable pretty fast vehicles in the game is also used for griefing for obvious reasons anyone that plays gta should maybe if needs one of these while they are fun to move around in they can also be very annoying this concludes my review of the game as far as rating would go i have a decent amount of fun on this game when i m not being tormented by modders if it were free of modders i would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 in its current state however i would say a 5 or 6 if you can make your own public lobbies then it isn t too much of a problem though thanks for reading i would suggest getting the game if it is on sale and only if it is on sale and trying it for the time steam allows you to before you can t refund it,880.0,217.0,18,Not Recommended,"October 24, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"Glennmp

38987,2020 the singleplayer is great worth a try for me the best story rockstar managed to tell at this point singleplayer of gta v won everything it could win so there s not much to discuss about it however the multiplayer is just a mess there is definitely fun to have there with friends but every time i decided to join a game a full list of problems pops up most sessions are filled with cheaters they either will turn you into a giant orange bomb everybody on the server from an invincible flying submarine and once in a blue moon they will ignore you or even have fun with the game without annoying everybody on the server some people aren t necessarily cheating but buying these awful flying motorcycles that can spam rockets and kill basically anyone who isn t specifically prepared for encounter with these trolls i am baffled that rockstar provided them with a legit tool to harass everybody in the session everything is confusing starting from gathering a team of 4 players in 1 session to making a decision about what is worth buying or not for example i mistakenly bought a high level property thinking that it would give me access to heists but it turned out that it s basically useless until you pour into it 5x money that it s worth for it to return a noticable profit the motorcycle clubs vip and ceo as methods of creating groups are explained extremely poorly and i still don t see a reason why can t they function as clans in any standard mmo half the time me my friends have troubles logging into sessions or online at all every now and then somebody randomly disconnects or the whole session goes offline for no apparent reason game can hang during loading and mess up the mission progress for everybody else every time you login to session prepare for 3 9 voice calls from npcs nagging to you about uninteresting stuff side quests for killing npcs missions about selling cars and other busy work single player contained most of these but for some reason did not need to bother me every day with messages about them aside from heists and generic multiplayer stuff races deathmatches most of the time you wouldn t be actually playing the game for fun most of the time is spent doing busywork selling product from your businesses promoting your nightclub taking supplies to your businesses this is because heists require a significant amount of money to prepare for them buying property that gives access to it and most of the time you need to also pay initial price so the profit will be given after 3 6 missions depending on heist getting to a highlevel heist such as casino feels like playing a mobile city building game you have to log in each day to not miss the daily objectives to get 30k you have to spin the casino wheel for a chance of 10 50k you provide your businesses with stuff and sell stuff this will result in 3 5 trips around the city just riding bike or car nothing else the more you have stuff the more you have to ride it feels exhausting the impression from gta online is that of an old mmorpg but with a dozen disadvantages from a regular mmo the game is clearly designed to force you into the loop of unnecessary boring busywork padding out interesting content while forcing you to spend real money on shark cards that would free you up of this busywork it s a shame since i don t know any other game that gives you ability to do heists with this amount of choices by the mission design and by inherent fact that you are playing gta and can go off the rails most of the time,96.6,356.0,40,Not Recommended,"April 20, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"Dasd

38988,2016 gta v is a hit or miss game the greatness shines in the singleplayer with its amazing and flamboyant narrative good character development and well written dialogue i would certainly recommend buying the game purely for the story mode at a discount of course i don t think it s worth the 59 99 price tag as it is if you re a fan of a good crime narrative gta v is definitely the game for you perhaps the weakest element of gta v is the online mode most of the reviews here are complaining about the modders hackers false bans and griefing players who ruin the experience for other players which is quite true however let s dive into the more fundamental elements of the online mode s overall design structure this review will be mainly about the online experience as rockstar continues to update the game s online sessions with new adversary modes and dlc today if you re buying the game solely for the online experience exercise caution design in a nutshell gta v s online design is nothing short of awful the menus are incredibly cluttered with lists upon lists of jobs mission races stunt races to do and some of them don t show up if you want to do a mission you ll need to scroll through menus of needless tabs just to get to your specific mission unless you bookmark it if you want to do missions with your friends you ll need to go through multiple loading screens to start them loading back to free roam takes a few minutes matchmaking is some of the worst i ve seen in an online experience it can take anywhere from one to fifteen minutes to gather a group of 2 4 players together to do any mission when the game actually does pair you up with someone else assuming you don t have many friends who play the game it is with literally any player with any skill level the game will sometimes pair a high level player with most of the weapons and rewards unlocked with a low level player with most of the weapons locked often causing the job to fail due to player inexperience invites sometimes don t reach your friends glitches with menus occur and there are still many gamebreaking bugs that prevent the online mode from being a decent experience if you re a fresh player just joining gta v online good luck most of the weapons are locked behind a level requirement it will take you weeks to months to gain enough reputation to get the weapon you want rocket launchers grenade launchers explosives etc rockstar can also dish out permanent bans regardless of behavior and you cannot appeal them in summary don t anger rockstar ai very unforgiving at times the ai will be perfectly cunning dodging and weaving around obstacles to gun you down where you stand during missions and heists however most of them are unfair they never seem to miss they always have their reticles glued to you so the moment you pop your head out to return fire they quickly whittle away what little health you have you can restore health in combat with snacks purchased from convenience stores around los santos in free roam freemode if you want to heal when you re being gunned down by police mercenaries or gangsters you guessed it you need to open your interaction menu scroll down to inventory scroll down to snacks and spam the enter key to heal your character then exit the menu to resume combat run out of snacks or armor during a mission you will need to quit to freemode drive to another convenience store or ceo office and restock them buy too much and the convenience store will run out of snacks forcing you to drive to another convenience store to buy more how inconvenient the ai isn t easy at all online and requires precise movements well stocked equipment and health and pure luck to beat them down jobs some online jobs similar to quests in an rpg require you to have more than 2 players if you start a solo session or an invite only session most of the fun jobs are all closed off with rockstar prompting you to join a public session with other unpredictable players in the lobby because rockstar wants the playerbase to mingle in hindsight it might seem like a great way to connect with other players but with the hit or miss community of public lobby gta v online coupled with matchmaking flaws it s difficult to get anything done want to do a heist you are required to gather 4 players together to do them individual heist setups can take anywhere from 5 20 minutes if you fail a heist setup moreoften you may restart from a checkpoint and try it again if a player leaves the heist setup everyone fails the mission and the party leader will need to exit to freemode go back to their apartment re initiate the heist and find 4 new players rinse and repeat heist finales contain the highest payouts with rewards spanning from 80 000 to 200 000 depending on the heist and can range anywhere between 10 30 minutes to complete there are rarely checkpoints in heist finales players have team lives instead of individual lives if one player dies your team loses a life and in 99 of the heist finales only one team life is available therefore if one player continues to die and uses up your team s lives you will need to replay the entire heist finale from the beginning or checkpoint if one player leaves or disconnects while the heist is in progress you will need to gather another 4 players to do the heist finale from the start playerbase gta v online s playerbase is really a hit or miss though they should be somewhat feared there are some decent and friendly players who are looking to have fun with heists rewards and such but the majority of the time you ll be killed the moment you leave your apartment run over by cars sniped from afar etc this can be combatted with the game s passive mode a mode in which other players cannot attack you and you cannot attack other players or pedestrians the problem with this mode is that you can t rob stores take part in public lobby events or defend yourself when the cops begin pursuing you also there doesn t appear to much of a localization option with other players you are grouped together with players from around the world god forbid you get paired up in a serious heist where communication is next to impossible due to a language barrier 50 of the time you ll luckily encounter an english speaking player most of the other players are from other countries which makes coordinating missions and jobs frustrating if you or others don t speak a common language dlc business model the game s online items and cars are progressively getting more and more expensive super hypercars cost upwards of 1 000 000 to 6 000 000 there is a plane in game for 10 000 000 luxury yachts go from 6 000 000 to 10 000 000 ceo offices go from 1 000 000 to 6 000 000 apartments go anywhere from 40 000 to 2 000 000 if you re earning 10 000 per job and about 80 000 per heist in a great while you bet it will take a long time to buy the things you want rockstar releases free dlc every few

38989,2018 before i get swarmed by a horde of fanboys i don t think the game overall is bad the story mode is fantastic nothing wrong here but i ll be focusing on online sure the loading screens are a pain but if you re willing to partake in the content you actually like and dedicate yourself to a bit of grinding that shouldn t be an issue that s exactly what led me to this the game being so good that i m baffled by how they on it evidently the issue is rockstar itself it doesn t matter how long you ve played for or how much you ve earned over that period everything can and will be taken from you if r just so decides to indulge itself in randomly banning people no reason will be stated no justification and no way to appeal it s pretty much just r going you and if you ask why the answer is because you that s why,813.1,124.0,9,Not Recommended,"March 24, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,Nex

39007,2020 how this won labour of love is beyond me the devs add nothing new to single player only adding more and more products in the predatory online game mode which are made purely for the common schmuck to not afford so they will flock to shark cards they are only adding things to milk the playerbase which is now nothing but modders and hacks which r has made no effort to exterminate none of this new content is added to singleplayer the new vehicles customisation locations and mission are locked to online so to experience any of it one would have to sink more than 200 hours of grinding into the game while playing against money drains like literally paying the daily bills garage fees power bills for your house paying out insurance companies or one could give into r greasy pestering and fork out money to buy shark cards a classic example of create a problem sell the solution r have truly sank as a game developer even going as far to attempt to push these predatory tactics in the new read dead online if you re buying this for online you are doing nothing but paying for the opportunity to pay more money the online can basically be described as a paid for free to play game people created this false hype of gta v having endless possibilities with the pcs glorious ability to mod eveything but r seem to be fully against this by making it harder and harder for people to mod the game with every update for fear of them having fun by modding in the vehicles and items from gtao gta online into singleplayer without bleeding some money into r s purse the mods that are available for the game are bare basic and aren t anywhere near what we expected to be able to achieve for instance to the extent of skyrim however the single player is great fun despite lacking the hulk of paid for locked content for online but that may be remedied by installing one of the few mods available i recommend only the single player probably one of r s best works taking elements we all loved from the classic gta san andreas such as recreational activities like golfing tennis working out even yoga and combining that with the new updated gta style and gameplay it also has some of the best graphics and optimisation of recent years being a near perfect pc port in my opinion with ability to play perfectly with a controller or mouse and keyboard also a great game to play with the steam link,258.1,154.0,10,Recommended,"January 2, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"Zorn Mingus

39008,2015 grand theft auto v well i played gta v before on ps3 and i loved every moment of it i played it allot on ps3 about 75 hours on story mode and 80 hours on multiplayer it s not much but as i said i liked it a lot so the moment we have been waiting for grand theft auto v on pc i bought it again for pc because i want get the best experience that this game can giveand play with my best friends that have only pc i have gtx 780 ti and it runs well on it decent fps story mode is greatand characters are even better like in every r games in this game we will have 3 main character a bit of spoilers michael de santa a retired bank robber who after making a deal with the fib moves alongside his family to los santos where they live in a nice mansion franklin clinton a young man who dreams of becoming big time in los santos in a world where the glory days of street gangs has long passed he works as a repo man for a car dealership but his ambition makes him tired of the job trevor phillips is a mentally unstable guy and bank robber a former military pilot he based himself in sandy shores where he founded trevor philips enterprises which mainly deals with weapons and drugs he s my favourite character grand theft auto online multiplayer with a lot of stuff to do if it works game modes free mode my favourite thing to do in this game deathmatch race including standard gta and rally modes capture survival hold contend raid parachutingyou can have fun killing civilians or just chill and ride your car around beautiful places what i like to do heists are additional gta online missions that you can complete with your friends or with random people it s really cool and a lot of fun you will probably enjoy it so the conclusion isthat you must have this if you re a pc gamer as this game has almost everything killing to racing the verdict is a must have gamethat you will enjoy playing alone or with friends as i said thousands of times it is fun and epic enjoy and have fun my pc components if some one is intrested os 64 bit windows 7processor intel cpu core i5 4690k 3 50ghzmemory 8 gb ramgraphics nvidia gpu geforce gtx 780 timotherboard msi z97 gaming 5 ssd hyperx 240gb,358.8,674.0,90,Recommended,"April 14, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Bioshock

39011,2019 i enjoy gta5 quite a bit the singleplayer is fun the fivem servers can be really nice as well but this review isn t about those it s about the online aspect on rockstar s servers not any fivem server at all the online community is usually absolutely horrible either people using meta vehicles like the oppressors or using mods hacks to get what they want the online s community feels more like 1 good players 5 griefers 5 try hards and 89 hackers modders modders have far too much power in the game and rockstar does literally nothing about it no friends clan only lobbies to progress safely away from some modder who has the ability to lockup your controls crash your game and kill you with it claiming somebody else did it even worse things than just that the modders are the reason an entire discord server of 30 people stopped playing the game why we no longer care to actually progress and refuse to buy sharkcards when a modder can either just give you tons of money or reset your bank account and properties it makes me glad i got gta5 for like 5 because the modders don t make the game fun anymore all rockstar has to do to help entice at least some people to spend money on the game is alloy you to progress in friends clan lobbies even if it s at a small amount less like maybe 20 less income from anything unless there s more than maybe 8 people in the lobby if we get the ability to progress normally without being forced into public lobbies maybe than i ll give a positive review,597.0,95.0,6,Not Recommended,"June 23, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"Fluffy

39027,2019 great singleplayer story gta online has a large variety of things to do most which all ultimately fall short due to cheaters which are able to spawn practically any object want to put players in a cage sure get other players permanently banned by flooding them with cash drops and perform many other ridiculous things like kicking you from your own association completely removing the ability to use it until you restart the game griefers which are rewarded for their ruining whatever everyone else is doing playstyle and even given overpowered vehicles designed specifically for that purpose underprofitable activities and the requirements to spend millions of cash before you can access alternatives that offer a more reasonable reward intentionally overly difficult heists which will instantly fail once a crew member leaves to prevent you from claiming that reward phone calls that will harass you into spending cash on properties and block your firing abilities mid combat that you cannot turn off and many other greedy and unwarranted features,323.7,172.0,21,Not Recommended,"June 9, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"keerifox

39029,2018 i liked this game for a while when i first got into it it seemed like i could have a lot of fun doing the big missions and heists gradually getting cash for more and more exotic assets but unfortunatelty gradually can go a long way and this game proves that over my 400 hours i feel as if i ve accomplished nothing and that s the reason for some of the people who play this gaming having thousands upon thousands of hours on this game most of the missions have minimal rewards to them providing only a smlal amount of cash while 100 000 may seem like a lot of money given to you after doing an hour of cargo missions that s not even enough to buy most of the cars you d ever want to you have to spend more like 20 hours for that and that s made longer by the fact they put limits on how often you can do certain things and after you finally get that car you want it becomes boring pretty quickly after that and all of a sudden you re grinding for something else and with how broad the selection is and with them adding a new swath of cars every now and then it seems you can never truly be satisfied playing this game which is stupid because you re playing to feel satisfied but you can never be it s like cigarettes you can never have just a few you ve always gotta come back for more and more which is why i say this game is addicting but not candy crush addicting it s like heroin addicting sure they re both fun but at least candy crush isn t ruining your life and your family and you ll have to start telling your wife you spent that 50 on gas for the next few weeks when really it was for shark cards ultimately she ll become more and more suspcious but by the time she figures it out you re so far down the rabbit hole you re willing to put your kids up for adoption just so you can have more money to buy that new set of cars in this game this is of course made worse by the fact they have no anti cheat system it seems making just about every lobby a hacker lobby of which can get you banned relatively easily and takes away from the experience of the game considering most people who do hack are but some of the ones who do hack are doing it for money only because rockstar has their thumbs up their ass and expect all of their players to tryhard their lives away assuming they had one in the first place the elaborate review is to demonstrate how pissed off i am at this game i ve had great moments of fun and memories on this game but in the back of my mind i m always angry at rockstar for doing something bad to the game and i m not wrong for that i wish more people would protest them for all of this but nobody is for that this game will continue to be crap and when gta 6 rolls out that will also be crap since they ll be copying the gta 5 model ultimately i blame the community almost more than i do rockstar i can understand their capitalistic desires after all,426.1,383.0,117,Not Recommended,"December 19, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Mapple

39045,2016 had this since launch on ps3 have since owned it on ps4 and now pc only game i ve ever owned on three platforms managed to transfer all my progress houses cash etc from ps3 character game looks fantastic on pc no wonder it took so long this isn t your average pc port performance is generally around 60fps on high ultra mix with a gtx980ti and i7 config to the game personally i d say the campaign is worth the price alone you control three characters with varying degrees of likeability story is lengthy and fun lots of side missions great humour throughout solid script bank heists are great everything you expect from a classic gta game to the multiplayer where a total gem can be found a true open world title you can do as much or as little as you want in the multiplayer feel free to just explore or undertake in the endless number of missions available you can even play user created games or create your own online heists were added and although only 5 of them they are a huge amount of fun playing especially with friends each heist requires several setup missions all varied in nature heists are one of the best ways to build up currency for gtaonline why would you need currency online because there is literally a mountain of things to buy 100 s of cars planes helicopters yachts weapons properties you need a lot of cash if you want to live the los santos high life participating in jobs online also pays though not much this could be races team deathmatches stunt rides or contact missions pvp is also pretty well done with mayhem potential considering some people have purchased tanks jets and all sorts of advanced weaponry tip if you re low ranked think twice about starting trouble with any higher ranked players if you re fed up of players c4 ing you new hypercar there is a passive mode which means you can no longer be shot or shoot there doesn t appear to be any online level cap so you can keep advancing though the final unlocks for weapons happen around 120 minigun my only two negatives would be modders modding splits a community in two some people love it some hate it gtaonline is ravaged by modders my opinion is that modding is fine if on the single player or doing random jokey things online it can lead to hilarious moments shoutout to the guy who spawned a coffin around my waist and seagull on my head but equally ruins the game here s why some may have no intention of harming other players and instead throw endless money on people probably as two fingered salute to r s extortionate cash cards you can purchase with real s 60 for 8m credits great you say not really it s fine for those of you that just want to buy things with zero effort but it leaves mission lobbies as ghost zones noone does missions because it s easier to beg a modder for cash you see this in every lobby taking cash from modders can also get you banned from gtaonline so even the good modding is bad online why grind a 30 minute mission for 50k when a modder drops 2m in 5 minutes sadly this is now the mindset of most players now to the bad modders modders who use mods for pvp purposes this could be all your usual expected pc game hacks aimbots boosted health invincibility teleportation etc but it can also be so much more modders can literally wipe every single player with a push of a button they can set it so players spawn and instantly explode leaving it impossible to quit the server unless manually shut down gta in task manager they can change the rain to jumbo jets crashing pc s as they cannot cope with the strain 100 s of jumbos falling causes griefers can place giant blades outside apartments that destroy your vehicles the moment you leave your garage they can drop ufo s on you when you re trying to fight fire endless rockets out of their rocketproof cars it s literally an endless headache playing vs modders who want to agitate the server best option is to change servers but most the same currently second negative is just a general lack of cool details in los santos in san andreas if you saw a pinball machine or a pool table chances are you could use it in gtav this isn t the case not a massive issue just an observation there is so much more i could say about the game overall the amount of free dlc added since launch plus endless xp events and sales held weekly for in game items new game modes this is by far the best value for money game i ve ever bought 35 is almost incredible given the trend of charging for dlc etc rockstar have given it all for free,249.7,68.0,5,Recommended,"July 31, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"S–Ωagzy

39046,2016 i feel i can only write a review for gta online as grand theft auto v has been left in the dust since it launched on pc all of rockstar s attention goes into gta online now buying gta v is basically just a means of distribution for the online component i m level 99 or something like that i feel i ve played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it so let s begin base game hasn t recieved an update since the first weeks of launch they don t even port online cars to it anymore and they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer looks like they don t want you trying something before you spend half a million gtabucks on it only to find you don t like it very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes most of the time it s the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two a gun that no one wants like the antique pistol for example and some tacky clothing options for an online game that s technically been going for 3 years there s been very little innovation the whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys and once you ve got everything you want and once you get bored of the missions adversary modes and races and get tired of screwing around in freemode the game becomes pointless just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving chrome adders and sitting on golden yachts rockstar doesn t think when it comes to implementing game features the bad sport system is horribly abused more often than not i find myself getting bad sport points for doing nothing else but defending myself against an armoured kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight do that enough and all of a sudden you re broke and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters not that there s any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones and on the topic of cheating the cheating is just insane it s out of control rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game and usually it s not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co op mission more often than not it s just straight out griefing getting c130s dropped on you cars exploding for no reason having a gang of stripper npcs with miniguns spawned on you and then you ve also got people who spawn moneybags on others which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because rockstar rarely bans punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money just the one who spawned it they slap cheaters on the wrist often using a strike system the first 2 or 3 times you re caught you get banned for a week or two it should be permanent there is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys racists griefers hackers tryhards screamers and squeakers freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off and play with all the things you earned during your missions and you re extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn t full of hackers raging griefers with tanks or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice chat gta online is like one of the seven circles of hell it s a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half wits who get off to a toxic unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment it s a shame because gta v isn t that bad of a game i think gta iv was ahead of it s time and i still enjoy it even though it doesn t run too well anymore for some reason but gta v has largely been forgotten since it first launched because in this industry if an action game isn t an online game it s irrelevant gta v an impressive technical achievement hit some nails on the head missed some others compared to it s predecessors gta online a toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs,799.7,392.0,39,Not Recommended,"May 10, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"Kastrenzo

39048,2018 shark cardsedit ok i wrote the above review when i was really tired thinking nobody would ever see it and i found it funny at the time however upon people actually seeing it and criticizing a negative review of the game overall for the sole reason of shark cards let me provide a comprehensive review of how i feel about gta v skip to the end for a summary otherwise the review will be split into an introduction and three main sections detailing each issue i have with the state of this game intro gta v is a good single player game there is plenty of things to do an engaging campaign and a massive world to explore my issues with this game come with gta online first of all in my experience it is very hard to have fun in gta online unless you or a friend of yours has a significant amount of in game money sure there are heists that you can do with your friends and fun activities in the forms of online lobby tasks but this becomes bland and repetitive very quickly more on that later to get money people have taken to hacking and these hackers now populate online lobbies often the other way of getting money is the purchase of shark cards with your money this microtransaction method has always bothered me to an extent but more so recently the nature of gta online is by nature very cutthroat the game incentivizes you to sabotage other people which already promotes a toxic community atmosphere the people that are trying to make money legitimately through ceo work biker gang businesses etc rather than hacking will often be terrorized by people in the lobby with far superior gear and vehicles this toxicity in online lobbies has become the norm sure from time to time there will be people that leave you alone but more often there will be people that kill you for no reason and this isn t the worst part of the people in online lobbies hackers i haven t played gta online over the last month but before that and presumably still now there were hackers everywhere in half the online lobbies that i joined there was at least one blatant hacker there some hackers will just spawn money for them and their friends a practice that is still unethical and wrong since it is stealing rockstar s shark card revenue which does not affect any other players directly others however will take pleasure in blowing up everyone in the lobby their vehicles and ruining any opportunity for fun the hackers were one of the main things that drove me away from gta online why even play if there are people running around committed to ruining your fun this brings me to my final and largest issue the in game money situation and the optional microtransactions everything in the latest dlc additions is ridiculously expensive take for example the facilities in the new doomsday heist dlc the cheapest configuration costs 1 67 million and the most expensive is 5 74 million if you were to buy these with shark cards alone as i m sure many have it totals from 30 to 80 of real money for an in game bunker that is only one small part of the dlc additions some of the cars can cost 40 some of the warstock vehicles up to 90 with or without friends to play with getting this money without the use of hacks or shark cards is extremely repetitive and relatively slow and gets boring very quickly this is my largest issue with the state of this game s online without guns or vehicles it is very slow to make money and in my experience it is very hard to have fun without a vehicle in gta v online the only way to get these quickly without using hacks is to spend large amounts of money on shark cards which always has bothered me it bothers me more as of late because of how expensive the dlc has become it seems next to impossible to get any of it without the use of shark cards in conclusion the state of gta online is not a positive one if you are buying gta v for the single player go right ahead maybe wait for a sale but that is up to you but if you are buying gta for the online don t thanks for reading my review,523.4,100.0,6,Not Recommended,"January 26, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"me8916100448256

39054,2016 edit2 rockstar have now sent a cease and desist letter to the main modding program it disables itself online it has no effects for hackers it s just for modding sp they are trying to stop it to drive more people to online and microtransactions their reason was that openiv allows users to create malicious mods that allowe harassment of players and interfere with the gta online experience openiv does not touch online and immediately disables itself if you try why are people still supporting rockstar edit these problems seem to be ocurring less by now but i m leaving this review up as a warning to the scummy business practices of rockstar people are being banned for no reason and rockstar agrees with them yet they are still refusing to reverse the bans or do anything to help using discord fraps any third party framerate counter or any program that adds an overlay to your games will result in you getting banned and support will not reverse it heck if you buy shark cards and they don t work they won t even refund you for that do not support awful business practices like this their anti cheat is terrible and their support just wants your money edit a lot of people seem to be taking this as waaaah i got banned so let me clear things up i have not been banned i uninstalled the game myself as the hard drive space it took was massive and i didn t play it much for those who don t believe the large amount of people who have been falsely banned here are a few more reasons why you shouldn t support r there is a limitless amount of bugs for online ranging from everyone in your session suddenly leaving the game at once you being booted for no reason connections timing out randomly all of these are punctuated with the worst error screen i have ever seen instead of presenting you with a simple you have timed out the game instead spends much time loading up single player puts you into the world and then gives you an error message with an option to rejoin which how ludicrously long the load times in this game are that s a good 2 5 minutes waiting for an error to appear just so you can start waiting again to get back into the game it is incredibly easy to fix but rockstar still haven t because they do not care there is no server browser this means that with the endless adversary modes they add all are dead within a week the only options you have when in an adversary mode is to invite people of a similar level which almost never works and to invite everyone who was in your previous free roam session if you are playing free roam would you want to suddenly be pulled into a small mode which likely won t have many players i thought as much thus the modes die off extremely quickly and finally the anticheat is still terrible you can have people flying around the map spawning props locking you in place dropping money bags on everyone which in an amusing way can result in them getting banned and just generally causing havoc every attempt rockstar has made has resulted in false positives and an extremely intolerant system towards modders you remember how much rockstar said they loved the pc audience and their modders that s amusing considering they re filling the game with dummy code to confuse them and you will be instabanned if you go anywhere near online with the slightest hint of a modification to your game files in all do not support a developer who does not care about their audience they release modes the recent further adventures in finance and felony update is a great case for this that require either for you to grind an unreasonable amount of money or buy shark cards to make it all easier not to mention the adversary modes they throw out are easy to make and take little to no effort as again they ll be dead within a few weeks you will be better off supporting another company move on,67.3,757.0,30,Not Recommended,"September 27, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"Jackson =D

39055,2020 tl drthis review has taken on a life of its own so simply allow me to say that gta 5 story mode is expensive given how old it is but quite good however calling gta online trash would be an insult to trash the community is toxic it s poorly balanced and there seem to be as many cheaters called modders in gta yeah sure let s call it a community griefers as proper players gta 5 on story mode 5 years after release is pretty expensive but excellent however gta online is a swirling vortex of toxicity and excrement the amount of cheaters and griefers is astounding i have never seen the like in any game in fact i only have about 20 hours under my belt at the time of writing and i have already reported about 10 players for actively griefing flying around killing with missiles waiting for you to respawn rinse and repeat that seems very common or cheating being unkillable i got the unnatural selection achievement because one player couldn t be killed and killed all npcs on screen the rest of us just stood by and or died and killing every player in the session seems common the latter i just had 3 players do within 5 10 minutes of each other in the same session of 29 players ironically the cooldown on reporting players means that it wasn t possible to do before they had switched sessions to make gaming miserable for someone else gta focuses heavily on multiplayer so the vast majority of missions heists and basically everything that s interesting is multiplayer that can be great but for the most part if you aren t playing with friends it probably won t be you will usually either play with someone who seems incredibly overpowered due to gear and they ll just take care of everything while you wait or you ll get someone who is at a similar stage to yourself but somehow seems to always have a terrible understanding of the game i would say that if you have plenty of money then gta 5 story mode is worthwhile but don t waste your time on gta online it is horrible not because of the game although once you have played story mode the only pull in my view is playing with friends it s the toxic players and that no exploit seems to have been fixed at any point and the most toxic players also seem to be the people benefitting rockstar games indifference towards exploitation funny thing while i wrote this review there was another cheater who seemed to put everyone in cages certainly put me in one and then killed everybody once people started leaving the session he managed to kill everybody twice before i had time to leave the session update i can see i gave gta online a full 30 hours more since i wrote that review despite the repetitiveness of the quests to keep your factories going but that time has been spent mostly loading to be fair it s a massive world loading taking a while should be expected however i have been constantly loading because i have to leave the sessions prematurelyh due to the amount of bored griefing cheaters combined just in the last 15 20 hours or so i have been killed more than 70 times by 5 players those are just the biggest griefer i have encountered during that time all of whom where either unkillable or damn near it we re taking multiple rpgs to them nothing happening or very little losing about 10 percent health by getting an rpg to the chest the cooldown on reporting meant i had to let them keep killing me even when i ghosted their organizations they found ways to grief me out of the game giving me max wanted level and destroying every vehicle i attempted to use so i couldn t get away not that reporting does the slightest but i won t let r claim that they can t do anything about it if the players don t report it or something to that effect anyway game uninstalled amd i ll be seeking a refund cause this is the worst mmorpg experience i have had toxic gameplay and chat poorly balanced a bit repetitive expansions to the world doesn t seem to have been well planned out and worst of all an incredible amount of cheaters and griefers not necessarily two in one but was often the case sorry my response was too long for the comment section so i ll just leave it here crispychickenwings1stly ignoring trolls or generally people who decide to come with unconstructive and or inane comments is in my view counterproductive if i didn t rebuke xxxanatos comment it would implicitly validate both their opinion and the manner in which they expressed it indicating that it was well reasoned and or acceptable which i don t believe it was in this case therefore i rebuked them and i believe my comment at the very least was no more rude than the one i had received from xxxanatos you do realize that you can fly around and shoot missiles without cheating right i do which is why i used it to exemplify a common tactic that griefers use to surprise ruin the gaming experience for others as i already stated in my review base your review on the actual game and not your experiences i m just one big question mark with that statement while writing that sentence you should at some point have realized it makes no sense when talking about a multiplayer game i would argue that when reviewing anything unless it s overly technical like a cpu people tend to review the complete experience not just the technical aspects simply because it doesn t matter if gta were the best game ever created cause it is completely ruined by the players and how poorly rockstar games manage those players you can t give a detailed review with like 30 hours in the game how many of that is story mode since you insist although i hardly see the relevance you may also have notice that i stated that story mode is excellent so i provided both a review of the actual game and the elements that ruined it and i know story mode is excellent cause i completed in on console years ago i wanted to give gta online a shot i played about 60 hours before quitting gta and about 55 of those were in gta online you can do much more in a private online session or a session with chill people i had aircrafts helo offices warehouses 3 businesses a boat and i m guessing around 10 cars i ddn t have any yachts or an oppressor and i have no idea of how much of time was spent in sessions with chill people but i have done a few heists all unsuccesful and using the watered down private sessions specifically to avoid other players kind of defies the point of a multiplayer platform doesn t it it s like avoiding crashing your car by never driving it hopefully chill people were in every sessions and it was just 1 5 cheaters griefers that ruined the experience for one two or all the other players rather than every other player who wanted to ruin the gaming experiences of others while you seem to believe that the amount of time i have wasted being griefed out of gta online should somehow invalidate what i m saying which seems kind of ridiculous to me i would argue that the important part is that i played gta online for only around 60 hours and i spent what felt like the majority of that time switching sessions because of the constant griefers and cheaters you should be asking yourself how in just 60 hours my gta online gaming experience could be this bad i mean just the amount of different situations and types of cheats griefs i have described must indicate to you that i have experienced quite a bit of cheating griefing and i have experienced it all in less than 60 hours you shouldn t be trying to invalidate my review because i haven t played suffered for long enough you should be asking yourself what the hell is wrong with gta online since anyone could have that many as you said experiences in less than 60 hours sidenote yes i m indeed regretting enabling

39057,2017 stop buying shark cards rockstar has made over 3 billion dollars off gta 5 and at least half a billion is from shark cards with all that money they are still unwilling to put any real effort towards solving the hacking problem they can t find any safe guards against it and won t hire moderators for the sessions you can only report individual hackers and not a hacked session most of the time you won t know who is hacking the session and be warned this gta online hacking problem is not over exaggerated it is unbelievably rampant it s literally in nearly all sessions wanna do the new ceo or biker missions prepare to have a modder take control of your vehicle and kill you making the hours of work you did be for nothing you really need to prepare yourself for the reality that you will do hours of work and have it completely ruined by modders this will guarantee ably happen to you if you play gta online it s actually gotten so bad that hacker paranoia has set in everywhere people are calling each other hackers everywhere you go in the game rockstar does not deserve anymore money until they make some progress with this huge problem,209.3,938.0,33,Not Recommended,"January 19, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,guerin277

39094,2015 while the pc version of this outstanding game is new it s been out long enough on consoles that i don t need to go into every single thing about the game so i ll just sum up what i personally like alot and don t like not too much likes the environmentan insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of l a l s to near perfection having been to the actual city several times i could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game the viper roorm ripley s believe it or not museum the scientology center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same when the sun sets and rises all of the lighting is accurate and at times absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around mt chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities it s some of the best weather fx i ve seen in a game because it feels real roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes it truly feels like a living world the satirewhat i feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that s so prevalent in l a across all social classes the rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way it s never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto the signage and radio commercials are also perfect knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself this can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations the charactersthere are many who dislike the characters especially trevor and i can see why but i liked them because of how they played off of one another michael the would be retiree who s juggling family problems franklin a young man growing up in the hood doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle trevor the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey none of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they re all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them the voice actors do an a job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life the first person modenot only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made it s also one of the best fps s in years being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes the radio stationsthere s nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking we built this city by starship or heartbeat by don johnson if you like pop rock country rap trance or even talk radio there s something here for anyone to like dislikes the policethey seem overly aggresive and i don t know if that s a play on the lapd or not but there have been time that i ve simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds also while in a car i ve been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot i could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me the storefrontsi just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but i also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world i d be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games the sub and the helicopterfor me the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode the model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few the helicopter while fun could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets thankfully rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this real time destructionagain like the storefronts i know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we d probably be lucky to get 10 30 frames per second with phys x cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments extra activitiesgiven the sun and sand vibe of l s l a i wish that you could surf and skateboard seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth that s not to say they couldn t add these things in a dlc pack fingers crossed but i just find theior absence strange and overlooked those nitpicks aside this is still one of the best games i ve played in a very long time and with so much to do i ll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time overall score 9 out of

39107,2022 this review is about gta v onlinei don t even know where to start while the game has so much potential to provide a good gaming experience it somehow manages to fail at almost every aspect that makes a game enjoyable the community is the worst i have ever seen and i ve been playing games for over 25 years there is not a single lobby where there aren t any cheaters hackers and yes i purposely call em that be it the guy that just uses a mod menu to have fun with the game those are not healthy for the game but somewhat tolerable or the guy that teleports across the map to other players having god mode on and randomly killing anyone they come across just to forcefully exit crash your game when you give them a hard time doing that it is actually unplayable in most public lobbies due to the insane amount of disturbed and sad souls out there it s just a perfect example of what happens when anyone can have power even if there is no hacker trying way too hard to make your experience the worst there are still unbelievably many people griefing randomly killing anyone they come across and the best part sarcasm about all that is that the game entitles you to do that if someone tries to deliver products to get a little bit of money which they can spend on 1 5 of a car the whole lobby gets a message about what you are doing and that they should kill you and take those products the game tells you to be a toxic person and since the game is catering to kids at least as much as to adults lets not forget that this game is rated m 17 rockstar is creating a prototype of gamers that are out of anyone s control it is a widely known fact that rockstar does not listen to their community at all if you can even call it a community because it contains the word unity r has made over 6 billion dollars from this game yet they leave the game in such an unbelievably bad shape riddled with bugs no anti cheat precautions extremely out of touch additions vehicles and stories very bad controls balancing ai obsolete features damn the list doesnt even stop there that is has nothing to do with what they got known for this is a game that feels like it is halfway through developement they are milking their players with an insane amount of ignorance and everyone who buys shark cards ingame money for actual money is actively supporting what they do how did this happen well money money is the answer here the developers take awards smile at the cameras bathe in money ignore those that made them who they are and they are getting away with everything some pros would be that it is a pretty decent looking game for such an old game and the driving has improved quite alot also you definitely can have a good laugh from playing this game i wish i could add more to this list but it gets tainted by everything bad about it way too much would i recommend this to anyone well no maybe play the single player game if you can pick it up from a sale but if you think you will get that good ol gta vibe but with friends this time be prepared for a hell of a surprise rockstar has lost hundrets of thousands or even millions of potential buyers that liked to play what r made them who they are or at least who they were if you could sell your soul to the devil be sure they did not only sell their soul they happily ripped it out of their bodies took a piss on it have it go through all circles of hell and laughed maniacally while getting a molten gold injection in their liveless bodies edit oh and please take a look at those reviews anyone with a working brain should realize it s mostly children and trolls writing those reviews like come on,576.2,245.0,21,Not Recommended,"May 22, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,Rezley Snipes

39114,8 years later the gta series is by far hands down one of the best series in the video game industry its sales speak for itself this game s scale is pretty massive and runs fairly well on a decent pc rockstar has really gone all out on this game it s practically endless to the things you can do in this game you ll have hundreds of hours sunk into this masterpiece and still find things to laugh at things to learn secrets and memorable moments just exploring the entire map is something in and of itself i ve done it all on foot now the story is something you d see in the movie theaters micheal franklin trevor and almost every side character is absolutely perfect aaa just blockbuster stuff micheal is a washed up bank robber now family man clinging onto stories of his criminal mastermind ways franklin is a young loyal earner who wants to be bigger than just some gang banger in the hood and trevor trevor trevor is something truly special honestly i ve played the game so much and all the other games in the series that i understand how r pushes the satire of current events and pop culture to the extreme in ways that some would see as going too far trevor is all that and more in one person the dialog between these guys in and out of missions heists is one of the pillars of what makes this game s campaign so strong you are able to switch between all three pretty much at your leisure as the game progresses the graphics are stunning and hold up to this day with mods it goes even further beyond from the busy city life of los santos to the vast rural area of blaine county it s truly something to see both during the day and at night characters cars animals and environments are all worthy of greatness for detail gameplay wise i d say it s the most fluid and versatile in the series gta iv felt like you were a tank and to an extent it feels like that in gta v as well but it s better i do miss the ragdoll effects gta iv did have however also the vehicle body damage was far better in the previous title rather than having one weapon of each type like before you have a wheel that has every weapon in every category available to you if you re able to obtain them there is an abundance of weapons to be used vehicles too you can also customize both weapons and cars pretty in depth music well gta is known for having probably the best soundtracks of all time ever nothing really needs to be said there online is really something else entirely you basically level up and fight your way to being a notorious kingpin overlord super god you can buy bunkers facilities offices drug factories nightclubs casinos submarines to satellites that shoot lasers you can do just about everything you could do in the main story and more and you can do it with like 30 other people online it s just never ending mayhem and provides for a truly great and unique experience every time you go to play it the only thing that really does suck is the amount of modder hackers in the game r says they do but it s evident that they do not the only real question is why aren t you playing this game,181.6,99.0,7,Recommended,March 23,Grand Theft Auto V,Mormesk

39128,2016 great game awesome concept there s so much you can do in both multiplayer and singplayer in this game it s simply amazing it s not all rainbows and sunshine tough pros graphics one word astonishing fps the game runs very smoothly if your pc can handle it if not i don t recommend you buy the game buy a better pc instead gameplay it s the classic gta run over people get chased by cops rob stores etc very nice storyline great storyline very interesting since you have three main characters you can switch with all the time the missions are smooth and i have not encountered many bugs heists and missions multiplayer i absolutely loved the heists same goes for the missions except for the loading screens it s all very smooth cons modders since the last patch in multiplayer i rarely encounter modders anymore be careful though price although this game is so great i think that it s still a little overpriced for normal people like me or i m greedy i recommend buying it on sales if you can loading screens the game is basically a loading simulator you have to wait a long time for basically everything you do in game changing lobbies starting a mission heist starting a race the loading screens can take up to several minutes of waiting which in my opinion is bans this hasn t happened to me or my friends yet but there s a lot of stories of people getting banned for apparently no reason sometimes it s because they modded in singleplayer or joined a hacked lobby i don t know any more about this topic than the stories i ve heard though grinding to get a cool car you have to get a lot of money how you either grind missions for money like the last heist or you buy shark cards for real money i think that it s fun to do a heist two times but after the fifth time for just one item you want that costs a lot is just boring and bad flying with mouse if you re a greedy like i am and you don t want to pay for a controller you might find out that controlling planes with you mouse is hard as but that s just my opinion maybe i m just bad conclusion it s a great game if it s on sales and you have a pc that s good enough i definitely recommend this game be careful with modders in multiplayer and modding in singleplayer though since people get banned for that lately i give it a solid 8 5 10,599.5,80.0,14,Recommended,"July 23, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"Iberium

39138,2022 the game is almost 10 years old but i just played it for the first time considering how delighted i was discovering gtaiv details physics lightning i was already sitting down to v with a certain standard in my head i perfectly remember a similar feeling when i sat down to vc after iii style and feelings grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by lux i won t elaborate the game tastes like a really well cooked spiced dish served just the way i wanted it but damn i didn t define it before i remember a scene from the movie coffee and cigarettes watch the lady is sitting in a pub drinking coffee the way she likes it the waiter comes up supposedly asking whether to refill but without waiting for an answer he pours more annoyed she points out to him that she already had the perfect color and temperature and it was great the coffee now was the physics in gta iv better yes it was i noticed but was it that much better wink not until i looked at those videos like why gtaiv is better than v are missions in v absurd and unrealistic because that s what i was told strangely enough no there are some unusual ones but nowhere near the level of san andreas is the plot worse incoherent no because this game is one big sandbox in which the creators skillfully entwined a lot of allusions the plot isn t like one signature christmas dish like in vc or iv it s like a great feast buffet where i leave full and having tasted everything and at the end someone next to me asked have you tried this works for me in iii and iv i missed wild extra urban areas so i liked playing mafia for instance however i will never forget the first time in sa i drove from san fierro to las venturas through those desert hills in bone country i felt the same when i jumped in trevor s shoes for the first time the difference between the possibilities in vc and sa was huge in the latter the latter there was too much of everything and it was overwhelming here it s fine lots of mini games golf tennis yoga etc enough clothes plus jet ski planes car tuning i am filled not overfed characters and plot heat 1995 community created artwork for grand theft auto v by lux vincent hanna which one s slick interestingly i ve managed to avoid spoilers over the years i knew that the game bows to movies among others heat 1995 but i didn t know it was that much i dressed the characters in the screen above on purpose because they are waingro donald breedan and neil mccauley respectively michaelmichael started out as my favorite character and ended up being the most irritating and a bit grossed out his attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the a final surviving is winning franklin everything else is fairy tales spun by people too afraid to look life in the eye whatever it takes kid survive keyword survival trevorwhen trevor killed john in the beginning i thought it was an exaggerated attempt to show how dangerous and unpredictable he is but since then he s only gotten better definitely the most coherent and deep character despite the apparent madness his attitude and character can be summed up in his final words in the b final well i can t you re turning on him i ve had enough traitors in my life keyword authenticity franklinfranklin franklin everything and nothing fun and boredom i enjoyed playing it the least but ended up losing the most hours with him because he is practical he has the most useful skill funny dialogue a bit like beating the fourth wall in style the least interesting character from the viewer point of view but the most necessary from the player point of view keyword i don t know maybe the fourth wall gameplayi like immersing in the presented world the most and with the enormity and variety of ls and blaine country and the possibility of playing from the fpp view gtav is a great pleasure grand theft auto v a screenshot of grand theft auto v by lux random encounters are surprising the biggest wtf i had was when i met two old men on the road trying to rape a girl i laughed when i picked up a drunk couple and they started banging in the back of the car definitely an adult game i reminded myself when i saw the short film the loneliest robot in great britain at the cinema i would love to release a series in which i play without radar hud in fpp and roleplay the only thing missing is the physics from iv on the other hand it s gta after all and you can really have fun with v post scriptumi forgot about the muuusic countless stations i didn t have time to listen to everything yet but the absolute number 1 is the track when we pause the game listen my gallery on steam story world 10 video 10 audio 9 gameplay 10 overall 10,197.2,58.0,8,Recommended,"December 17, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,"Lux

39139,2015 this is the home gta v always deserved but never got until now welcome home we ve all been waiting for you edit after playing for a while i can attach a more informative review will update further when enough time is spent with the story and online portion performance wise the game runs relatively well on my gtx 680 i have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size look it up on the internet aside from that the launch has been relatively smooth for me the game world is full of detail put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it it s really the kind of benchmark setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless in my opinion the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in gta iv driving is a little bit better hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so but to me it feels more responsive shooting can feel clumsy especially in first person and the guns don t feel all that special but it s still fun in addition to the updated graphics the other pc exclusive features include a custom radio station and the rockstar editor custom radio station is pretty simple add music files to a folder in the documents and you ve got a self radio station in game it works nothing more to add as for the rockstar editor it s really simple and fun to use you mainly use markers to change cameras apply effects slow motion et cetera i tested it for a bit and the end result is this youtube video will do views 400 thanks rockstar this will do i m planning to make longer and better videos in the near future the online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first since it lacks direction but you ll get it haven t played it too much to comment further but it s fun to play jobs with friends although the progression feels half baked thanks for reading my review i m planning to report on narrative and more of gta online soon,109.3,612.0,178,Recommended,"April 15, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Filippus

39144,2017 this is my 600 hour review i ll break this down between single player and online because i have different opinions on both first is single player because its easy single player is a near perfect masterpiece probabaly the absolute best single player game of all time if you are looking into this game for sp then its a no brainer however next we have gta online its a mixed review i have a lot of hours into online and i will continue to put a lot of additional hours into online pros it gets constant content added several times a year the release free dlc sthere really is a lot to do if you wish you can really role play the most corrupt criminal to the fullest extent cons i ll just start out with the biggest con the game has clearly taken a big turn in the last couple years and its intesifying toward micro transactions its pretty obvious the keep raising the prices of items you purchase in game compared to the amount of money you earn unless you are dedicating your life to this game its pretty hard to obtain the in game items and if you are starting out as a new player the amount of money you need to catch up is really a huge obstacle i am not one of those people who are defiantly against micro transactions but these aren t even fair micro transactions rockstar keeps raisning the price of the in game items but the amount of money given out on a shark card has never been adjusted here is an example a 8 million dollar shark card unless on sale costs 99 always has it use to be that most items were under 1 million with the extremely high dollar things around 2 million so for 99 you could typically buy say 5 15 items for 99 fast forward to today most items are over 1 million closer to 2 million on average and the most expensive items are 4 million with a yet to be released item that is going to be 6 5 million rockstar is really going for a money grab here and they aren t even attempting to hide it not to mention that the latest dlc the amount of money you can earn per hour has actually gone down from the previuous ones so higher prices to buy stuff lower income from doing work so you are forced to not really play the new dlc but the old ones for cash which is a shame because the new missions are actually very fun they just dont pay well so if you are new and want to ever come close to catching up to current players you have 3 choices 1 buy shark cards and alot of them several hundred dollars worth 2 play an insane amount of hours quit life and play this game every day all day long 3 cheat find mods or a modder and get modded money warning you can actually get banned for this i cant even beleive i am giving this advice out i use to depise money modders but given the greed coming out of rockstar now days i really understand why new players would do it and i dont frankly care anymore so you might ask why do i have this game as recommmened still when it comes down to the game itself single player and even online it s fun there is a lot of varitey i can do missions i can race cars i can pvp i can play mini games and there are dozens of varietys of games i ve played 600 hours and honeslty still to this day havent even played 1 2 the things you can do there is a massive amount of content the game is fun the politics behind the scenes is horrible the comminity is toxic and the micro tranactions are getting out of control but at the core its still fun and i still enjoy it after all this time but on the other hand we probabbaly wouldnt get all these updates without the microtransactions so there is that factor too i rate gta 5single player gameplay 10 10online gameplay 8 10 2 for community variety of things to do 10 10game updates 8 10microtranactions 0 10,762.9,162.0,7,Recommended,"September 5, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Jace

39148,2021 you have to be an absolute masochist to want to play this game from a bunch of money grubbing sociopaths who apparently don t care at all about pc players the game has been out over five years now and despite numerous content updates that are aimed at enticing you to pay real cash for in game dollars they have done all to address the rampant cheating and modding in the game modders can literally kill you and kick you out of the game for even trying to file a report against them what kind of stupid ass system is that and there are no viable means to report a player outside the game for the average non recording user i realized that rockstar could make even more money if they just sold an official first party modding menu that just gave you protection against other modders,536.8,324.0,61,Not Recommended,"April 3, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"‚ò† Asasin ‚ò†

39155,2021 even 8 years later this game is easily one of the best that you can buy whilst gta online has gone in a direction i don t like and wouldn t really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage i can t ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities there s something for everyone in gta online and it will also make them money whilst they re at it single player is also undeniably a brilliant experience even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story there s really no excuse for not playing it through at least once a lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it s original release but from an objective point of view even if this game released for the very first time this year it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away the driving is much easier than gta 4 literally anyone can be a decent driver in gta 5 unless you have brain damage but i guess it makes it more accessible lol shooting is also much improved and is high quality and those two elements combined with many others including but not limited to the excellent map make this game a perfect sandbox my only concern is there s too much cheater in online mode and they are so really annoying i hope rockstar improves there anti cheat program if there s one so the players can really enjoy what gta online can offer,978.5,101.0,10,Recommended,"October 22, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"Jesse Purpleman

39159,2017 rockstar should not present a game to you that is so aggressively in favor of either grinding or microtransactions while doing absolutely nothing at all to stop the people who can freely mod the game to allow them to destroy the only method of getting the high level multiplayer items without paying for them that s the second time in a row that i ve tried to sell vehicle cargo to get money to even dip into gunrunning that i ve been stopped by a player i could ve easily taken down except for the fact that they were invinicible rockstar is attempting to sell you a multiplayer experience that forces you to spend money on mictrotransactions not only with the only items that are worth anything being near prohibited by tremendous amounts of grinding time but by a hacking player base that will destroy every attempt at that grinding that they are seemingly willfully ignoring if you want this for the singleplayer buy it though with the way rockstar and yes take two is more involved but once again rockstar doesn t care to defend its playerbase from threats to their enjoyment handles the modding scene i don t know if that s a particularly good idea either so i ll amend that statement too don t buy this show rockstar they need to actually pay attention to the playerbase they so enjoy ignoring by ignoring them the same way they do,720.0,432.0,16,Not Recommended,"August 6, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,mittensbro

39168,2023 the single player campaign of grand theft auto v is an absolute masterpiece offering players a rich and immersive narrative that is full of memorable characters exciting missions and stunning visuals the game s three main characters michael franklin and trevor are all unique and interesting in their own way and players will find themselves invested in their stories from the very beginning however the multiplayer aspect of the game leaves much to be desired the rampant cheating and abuse of micro transactions has made it difficult for players to enjoy the game s online modes and many have been driven away as a result it s disappointing to see such a great game undermined by these issues and it s clear that the developers need to do more to address them another point of frustration for many players is the lack of dlc campaigns for the game while there have been some updates and additions to the multiplayer modes there have been no new single player campaigns released since the game s initial launch this is a shame as there is so much potential for new stories and characters in the game s rich and expansive world despite these issues the single player campaign of grand theft auto v remains one of the best gaming experiences of all time the game s attention to detail engaging storyline and immersive world make it a must play for any fan of action games if you re looking for a thrilling and unforgettable single player experience grand theft auto v is an absolute must play however if you re primarily interested in the game s multiplayer modes you may want to think twice before jumping in,150.6,35.0,0,Recommended,"March 14, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,"Ramen Bellic

39195,2016 gta v is a great game a real achievement for the gaming industry one of those games that deserves to be recorded saved and displayed on a museum for all humanity this is definitely the best version of the game best graphics fps option mods and etc but and this is a big but the new anti cheating mechanism which was long overdue since cheating is rampant is now generating a lot of false positives that is players that don t cheat or engage in illegal activities are being banned for one month without a specific reason no one is really certain on what triggers this ban some say discord xplit obs and even windows 10 recording might be the culprit as if that was not enough the worst part is the response from rockstar after the ban and you try to open a ticket to resolve the issue they have already placed an automated response denying any form of contest like dont even try no one is ever going to read your claim this is completely ridiculous and a shame and probably an unethical consumer stance the game is really amazing and gta online is getting better content every month unfortunately the customer service and the anti cheating is a big stain on rockstar s track record if you buy this game now you are running a big risk on getting a ban out of blue and not being able to play it online i would avoid it for the time being,96.0,352.0,11,Not Recommended,"November 11, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,BM

39199,2017 this was fun for a long time beautiful game you can probably see from my profile that i have a lot of hours logged so i hope it is telling on how much fun i used to have playing this game i pretty much only played online though i heard that the campaign solo was great problem is that it became a game where grinding was more important than enjoying the environment the vehicles story etc most of the new vehicles that are being released by these updates arent available in solo play so online play is the only way to use them you can use them in missions and if you really like them then shell out millions for them if you dont have the time to grind and make money then there is no way you ll get them and even if you do everything costs so much that you ll have to do more grinding to get that next overly priced vehicle rockstar knows this and that some people with money will pay to get these things so they became all about the shark cards for 100 you would receive 8mil in in game cash and it wouldnt be enough to purchase the two most expensive vehicles in the game the bombushka alone is nearly 6mil or 64 98 in real cash the mammoth tula and the molotok are about the same you are paying the price of a whole new game for one plane that you can store in your 1 5 3mil hangar which you barely had money to pay for after buying the dang plane i am uncertain if they made any changes to purchasing military vehicles but last i checked you could not sell them back for some fraction of the original cost so if you decide later that you don t like the vehicle you ve just wasted a lot of time and possibly a lot of real cash i m tired of doing the same missions over and over to get poor returns then spending it all on one thing i just wanted to have fun and not get bored after doing the 20th resupply or cargo theft run for whatever business im operating stop giving rockstar your money and make them do something that isn t all about rockstar bottom line i cannot recommend this game to anyone that doesn t have a lot of time on their handsedit amputator thanks page wouldn t load will try again no i can t recommend it anymore it was tons of fun before but now they arent adding anything new no new concepts each of their last additions are the same spend at least 1mil on a new place get packages which have a timer bewteen runs finally get enough to sell and walk away with maybe another mil after 12 hours of doing the same missions over and over if this were an rpg their additions would actually add a variety of content that lasted more than an hour or two instead i have to do the same bs for hours to get half way to purchasing one item but they know the user base is stupid enough to puchase a shark card and use it to buy a plane worth 65 more than the game was to begin with rhyathymia says the guy who spends too much time playing fo4 that was the worst one by far you really have no idea what a good rpg is to begin with online has no rpg basis that is the solo campaign smh online has no decision making no character development and no narrative other than a half assed conversations with ron the whole plot is making money so you can buy the next expensive car that rockstar inevitably releases that may make you slightly better at doing the same thing you always do like terrorizing other players hell they even have mods and modded servers for rpg style game play,729.1,232.0,4,Not Recommended,"October 9, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Glinn Tantis

39222,2015 my history with the grand theft auto games goes all the way back to gta2 on the ps1 that game blew me away when i first played it i honestly thought the freedom it offered you was an illusion and that the game would spontaniously end but it never did and i kept playing it over and over again nowadays sandbox games are a dime a dozen but rockstar has remained top dog in the fight since the ps2 why unlike volition who make excuses as to why they couldn t provide features everyone liked rockstar takes risks and gives you things you never thought you wanted gta5 takes place in los santos which was previously featured in gta san andreas los santos by far is the most detailed single location in the entire series the game features things like industrial ghettos vast mountains with wilderness and expansive oceans you can swim through and uncover secrets while dodging sharks it lets you seamlessly switch between three protagonists who are not only just as detailed as any of the previous ones but are also completely distinguishable from each one with individual sidequests and unique gameplay modes gta5 looks great plays great feels distinctive and most importantly took risks that paid off immensly in a world of botched launches underwhelming overhyped titles and a desire for a game the developers actually cared about making gta5 goes above and beyond the call of duty it is hard to describe any one flaw with this game without comparing the 2000 things it does well what other modern game can you say the same the woods a screenshot of grand theft auto v by bluebeak,157.6,36.0,4,Recommended,"April 26, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Bluebeak

39223,2021 all filler no killer gtav is probably the pinnacle of rockstar s game design game design where the smallest details are included just for the sake of it yet the general gameplay is stuck somewhere in the 00 s game design where side content is jammed into the game for no good reason has barely any gameplay no reward and exists purely to waste your time game design where lots of mechanics are introduced and then get no use throughout the game the ultimate sandbox wide as an ocean and deep as a bath in an attempt to be the biggest sandbox game of all time gtav completely disregards the fact that all content should have a place in a game and be as satisying to play as the main course just like gta san andreas its direct inspiration gtav is filled to the brim with activites and sidequests which are as bleak as writing a retrospective review to an aaa game released almost a decade ago have absolutely zero action and or interesting mechanics and have no rewards because in fact this game has no progression whatsoever the thing is san andreas was released back in 2004 when the sandbox genre was still being figured out and the mere concept of sidecontent was novel gtav was unleashed into a world where saints row and many action rpgs exist where sidecontent is often as important as the main campaign and also provides a meaningful reward well of course you don t have to do side content so what about the main storyline it s well bumpy gtav provides an interesting set up for a criminal drama and sometimes delivers but in a truly rockstar fashion with lots of unnecessary clutter along the way it can deliver some truly awesome moments but between those moments you ll be stuck with unnecessary arcs boring dialogue and narrative that can t figure out if it wants to be serious or wacky resulting in jarring mood jumps the whole scenario feels like it was cobbled together from many completely different arcs which especially shows during the final mission since it was the 2010 s of course the game had to provide you with a completely reduntant choice literally do you suddenly want to work for antagonists who screwed you throughout the game or get a good ending the good ending itself is and then they got fed up with all the and killed all the antagonists including those who have no bearing at the story anymore this is especially jarring cause every other gta protagonist had to earn their ending meanwhile v s ending feels like eh i think we wrote enough let s end it here the gameplay side is also hurt by the kitchen sink approach the game does a lot of things at once and none of them are good the shooting is unresponsive the guns feel weak and there s literally zero interesting mechanics tied to guns ammo doesn t matter upgrades don t matter anything dies in a single headshot anyway and vehicles go in a single grenade rocket the cover system is still a sluggish mess it was in iv and combat as a whole feels unimpactful as for the missions themselves they suffer massively from awful pacing the game knows no restraint when it comes to bore you you ll be doing things that would have been a cutscene in literally any other game oh and the game just loves to do 5 10 minute drives with zero action whatsoever the thing is when gtav is great it s truly great it was made with lots of experience a huge budget and sometimes it shows the problem is you ll have to earn your great moments by grinding through literal hours of filler naturally all this needs be taken into account with the sequel right take a smaller and more condensed map gtavice city hype fill it with sidecontent that is actually engaging maybe introduce deeper mechanics so doing said content actually affects your playthrough write a storyline full of action but nah instead gtav was turned into a soulless life service by take two and is gonna be milked till the heat death of the universe the fact that the biggest videogame franchise of all time was turned into a that constantly asks you to buy 100 shark cards shows just how up the current game industry is gtav is a swan song of what used to be one of the definitive videogames whatever gtavi would be it would be a product of corporate greed and a new set of writers that would most likely misunderstand what makes gta s satire work gta as we knew and loved it died and not with a bang but with a long and rather dull whimper although nevermind all that the last line of the story provides a perfectly clear explanation on why gtav the mess it is i m getting too old for this nonsense dan houser ending grand theft auto as we know it forever,217.6,95.0,3,Not Recommended,"September 13, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"Marshie

39227,2018 single playeri ve played gta iv for the 3rd time 6 months ago and now i ve finally played its successor 3 years after its release on pc and 5 after consoles i ve seen several people saying they prefer iv and i suppose it s mostly because of the narrative besides some inconsistencies niko continues to be the best protagonist in the series and his story is way more dramatic than franklin s michael s and trevor s the same goes for cj in the original san andreas title still v is a bigger game took me over 150 hours to get to the end against 55 to finish iv more 37 hours for its 2 expansions and has a way greater mission variety one thing that bugged me is how easier this new installment is escaping the police is a cakewalk health quickly regenerates so i ve never bought armor something that was indispensable in iv and not only your car doesn t explode anymore when it rolls over but it magically turns back on its wheels like it was a turtle with supernatural powers another big letdown is the original music not as memorable as iv s having 3 main characters may have weakened the drama but i enjoyed changing from one to another quickly going to different parts of the map and catching them going about their routines franklin could have been way more interesting never rising above the clich of being the smarter guy from the hood the one who knows that being in a gang in his 30s is pathetic but still failing to move on to an honest living although he tries at the beginning michael is interesting especially because he s so despicable and has a very dysfunctional family but also doesn t stray too far from being a parody of tony soprano and trevor the mentally ill canadian is the star and could have been the sole protagonist because he s the one who manages to be more than a stereotype with an interesting and dramatic backstory his introductory sequence involving an old acquaintance from iv is mind blowing literally and what he does to an apartment he inhabits for a while in vespucci beach is a riot again the sense of humor is one of the greatest things about a rockstar game particularly on the internet you better check your phone after every mission thank god we don t have to drive to a cyber caf anymore to follow the news bleeter and life invader besides the websites they re hilarious very well written and you ll be missing out big time if you ignore them tv content is also amazing as the talk radio stations the best program is chakra attack with the great comic j b smoove gta still is a great satire of the usa the tennis minigame disappointed me because it is very simple but the golf one is great in almost every session i had to play it there are a lot of other activities including triathlon the last of them is so big that it takes over 30 minutes hunting is nice but it s hard to go very far those damn mountain lions and although i liked chop i didn t care about walking him out especially after franklin moves from his aunt s house there are several references to iv and san andreas one cool easter egg is og loc s gold record on franklin s wall so i strongly recommend that you play at least these two before enjoying this one onlinei m about rank 18 now so i m still far from having experienced all that the online portion of gta v has to offer but differently than red dead redemption s online mode this one is very co op oriented so you ll need good friends to really enjoy yourself i haven t noticed any hackers or cheaters yet and that was a pleasant surprise because i read so many horror stories about that what i usually meet are players that are reckless or not very good during missions others that kick you out of jobs because you re still low leveled a few that think it s funny to kill you while you re going about your business and some cool players too the occasional bugs and crashes the constant phone calls of npcs that ask me to buy expensive stuff whenever i enter a session and the fact that the weapons i collect ingame disappear after a while i guess you only keep what you buy are very bothersome but the online game can be great if played with a group of friends that take the fun seriously although i don t think i ll play this for the same amount of time i spent in single player i ll probably return only when there are good discounts on property and money prizes for logging in if you wish to play it here s my advice forget about grinding just have fun and the money to buy stuff will come naturally edit january 2019 i m now at rank 28 made some money and bought some property a nightclub and a motorcycle club with a cocaine lab the businesses unlock additional missions and it s all great but also very daunting because every little upgrade costs a fortune and it will take a long time until i can access all that the game has to offer i guess i ll keep playing for longer than i thought which can be a good thing as long as it keeps being fun instead of a grindfest in the meantime i had an encounter with my first hacker who threw bags of money at me i left the session right away the next day i played again and everything was normal,257.6,58.0,3,Recommended,"September 19, 2018",Grand

39247,2022 it s fun to play offline mode with mods after finishing the main story it could have been better if the online vehicles and weapons were included so i wouldn t have to download a lot of mods but after a while it can get quite repetitive so why not hop on to online well online is better played with your friends than alone because of trolls griefers and quitters it s really hard to start the apartment heists or most heists in general with randoms or trolls who would quit halfway or waste your time in the prep phase with no repercussions since these heist are very vital for beginners considering how expensive some items in this game can be it really is a turn off for new players to continue playing in this kind of environment yes there are other options to earn money like the mc and ceo businesses but again you really have to play with friends or trust that no one in your public session is gonna gang up and grief you in those sell missions what s most annoying however are the locked items you can only get by leveling up in these dead game modes where your only chance of playing it is if you invite a friend i mean i could purchase some of them the arena war upgrades but it costs a lot of money just for 1 locked item whats worse is that it takes a lot of time to level up in these game modes and i don t have the time and patience to spam play that mode with my friend if the max payout per game is just a bar in that respective game mode arena war or tuners and don t get me started at the locked color modifications i mean you can buy an autoshop and modify them there but that s only reserved for non warstock vehicles i get the performance upgrades but why the heck do i need to level up in order to unlock a specific color its not like that color does anything other than being an aesthetic feature overall if you have friends to play this game with then by all means buy this game and play with them otherwise the climb to the top will be rough depressing and not worth the effort just play story mode with mods and have fun gta story mode 8 10gta online 5 10,473.8,33.0,2,Recommended,"January 31, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,Ropongo

39257,2015 hello community i have decided to write a review about gta v first of all i love the game series sooo much and i have played them all since gta 1 so i hope that my review will be quite objectively please feel free to leave a comment or discuss issues with me after playing gta v more than 300 hours i think now it s time to discuss buisness pros the singleplayer in this game is awesom there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more the storry from singleplayer is great good redline through the game with lot s of fun missions and great heists graphics on high end pc are quite nice could have been better d fantastic ambience throughout the whole world amazing masterpiece of soundtrack the radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect tv and internet all thumbs up dcons the multiplayer i have waited sooo long to play a gta game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people but it is impossible permanent laggy gamesessions connection errors all the time friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently hours of loading screens i m running this game on high end pc with ssd drive and still loading for hours very low payout rate of money a friend played gta v on ps3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever which takes me to my next point hackers the damn game is full with hackers everywhere rockstar doesn t seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time jumped through 5 puplic lobbies encountered 7 hackers breaking the whole realm shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons teleporting with godmode screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker i m sick of them i also am sick of players joining the lobbies first question asked is there a hacker here i need money wtf such a holes should be banned too right from the moment they typed in this question don t missunderstand me here i have a 0 tolerance policy for hackers they ruin everybodys game expierience and people who abuse hacking methods for their own good are the same scum in my opinion last words i really love the game and i will continue to play it but i m not sure if i will give the multiplayer another chance i will also give the game a good review because the game itself is a fantastic masterpiece of game design the multiplayer will get all thumbs down from me drockstar please solve the hacker problem i would totally recommend gta v to everybody but be aware of the multiplayer maybe wait a year or so until it will be on a steam sale for half of the actual price you will totally not regret buying it then best regardsboudewijn ijzenarm,816.0,109.0,16,Recommended,"June 22, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,Rainer M√ºll

39267,2023 grand theft auto online has rampant hacking modding issues which rockstar has done little to address this includes among other things the ability for modders to tamper with and ban your online account crash the game outright obtain your ip address and even maliciously modify files and execute code on your pc the latter making the game malware see the national vulnerability database report which rates it 7 3 high severity and states grand theft auto v for pc allows attackers to achieve partial remote code execution or modify files on a pc as exploited in the wild in january 2023 rockstar s cyber security practices are laughable they are aware of the exploits but simply do not care be aware that you are essentially downloading malware by purchasing this game and playing online this game should be taken down until these issues are fully addressed feel free to copy the above if you choose to report the game on steam as i have,76.9,182.0,7,Not Recommended,"November 29, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,ThankBach

39276,2015 a very good game i am a fan of grand theft auto since gta 3 and each time it is a good surprise they do not release one game per year but it is better because the games comes out polished you will rediscover that caustic humor mixed with preposterous stories of gta s universe solo mode is approximately 30 hours if you focus the main storyline but after that you will still be at 60 in your overall game progression cinematics mix really well with the gameplay and the fact that you are allowed to change characters almost whenever you want is a refreshing option i had a lot of fun as well in multiplayer with my friends,166.6,48.0,16,Recommended,"April 29, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,*TBC* YRI16

39288,2017 this review is about singleplay only i m not a multiplayer guy and were it up to me i d separated gta v solo and gta online completely but anyway that s not an issue and i m just talking of the single player game rockstar finally released on the pc despite their ugly maximize profits policy and i really think that gta v is hugely overrated a little spoiler up ahead it s not even a spoiler technically at the end of the game michael says i m too old for this and that s i think the words of sam hauser you see technically gta v kicks asses alright it is still the best gta like game on the market you have cars bikes boats jets a helluva lot of activities and stuff to make your play a unique one an unforgettable experience but it fails in the most major aspect for what so many people loved vice city and san andreas titles the attractiveness of the story the compassion thing i ve blamed the gta iv for it and it s the same and somehow even worse with the gta v just like the mafia 2 3 where the main characters are so boring and unpleasant people i d kill them myself were it an option the case of gta v is worse than gta iv and a lot worse than san andreas by the originality option as well let s take trevor for instance for he s obviously the most noticeable guy of the whole trio he s all kinds of a bad dude sure but i ve played the game with just the same character a decade ago it was the scarface and even the special the rage mode was the same for tony montana as it is for trevor scarface game was quite a mediocre one somewhere on the level of true crime maybe and by the time of san andreas it would be a joke to copy something into rockstar game what was done in some wannabe competitors title today it s a major issue now gta v is still a quite good gta like game it s still making shots and all but it s just one in a row it s not an overmighty king it was once oh i m sure that 10 years old who now plays and streams gta online like mad are not gonna agree with me and some middle to old aged creeps like sam hauser itself would point me at the more realistic world around that was made in gta iv and v i know i know i m myself a middle aged creep who likes realistic stuff much more than some phantasy elves and ponies but there is still a compassion thing a mood after playing san andreas or saints row 2 is better in my case than the mood from gta 4 5 or saints row 3 4 those late games provide less than pretends and sometimes even hollowing your emotions rather than provide you with some new and strong ones so let s come to the mark thing i ll give gta v a 7 5 10 for the amount of work they made minus point is for hollowing unlikely characters minus point for an overall creepy atmosphere gta v providing even the radio was worse than usual oh mate that s a disaster,257.3,129.0,6,Recommended,"March 30, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Whiteswart

39344,2021 gta5 story mode is very much worth to be played the story presented is interesting and fun to play if you can catch a sale on this and get it for 15 i would highly recommend giving it a try if you liked previous gta s it is worth those 15 however as much as i like gta5 s story mode gta online is a total different story i guess you now expect me to talk about all the evil hackers and cheaters that roam online but that is not the main reason i would not recommend to get gta5 only for the gta online part gta online is extremely repetitive what you do in gta o early on is run some missions for paltry money trying to save up enough to finally buy a business all that said business then is for is adding more missions that can be grinded the worst part is most missions have one version of them so it feels like you play the same thing over and over and over like if you do the grand perico heist as example the prep missions you need to do are always the exact same in the heist itself then the enemy placement is always the same if you would program a bot well he could play and replay the same stuff to a t since there is no variance to it to shake up the gameplay if you like games where all you do is grind the same thing non stop give it a shot especially if you play it with 3 or more friends so as usual everything is better with friends even grind trash like gta o,331.7,25.0,1,Recommended,"February 3, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,Bongoboy
39345,2019 up front before the big rant the story mode is pretty nice but my main focus is gta v online which is a hot pile of garbage i never played a game with so many bugs problems and crashes in 2015 i started playing the game lets start with the obvious to find and join a session takes ages and can often result in errors or landing in singleplayer it has the longest loading screens ever only money related glitches getting fixed by rockstar modders are in 1 3 lobbys they are not only disturbing you by killing you or are doing other crazy but also by changing the weather in a way that your screen goes black flickers is just suddenly stutters frezzes and then crashes out of the blue sometimes wasd suddenly does not work anymore in chat are the keys still usable heists some take ages with setups and preparation not enough money for the time spend and compared to the prices of vehicles buildings if some part of mission fails it takes ages to restart you drive fly 5 years to get to your misson some heist dommsday are way to hard you lose the items you used in a failed try round 1 5x bombs restart round 2 4x bombs business not realy possible solo if played with friends no payout for the people who help playing with friends and not being the head of command brings no benefit or any real money stupid timer for crates or cars when you try to source or sell them need to wait until you can source a new crate if for some mystical reason the game crashes while delivering something it is obviously gone it makes no sense to restock the business in the slightes sense vehicles if you buy e g the rim x and want now the rim y and after that switch back to x you need to rebuy the same rim again pay2win no matter what it is too expensive to get somewhere you need to grind to your death sharkcards are a stupid idea and are also far to expensive compared what you can get for themin the time the game was out for pc i feel like there where next to non perfomance upgrades or real problem solving fixes for the huge obvious problems the only updates the game got where content updates which where atleast free however the ingame content is way too overpriced should you buy the game when is is on sale for the singleplayer yes for the multiplayer no,465.8,106.0,18,Not Recommended,"November 8, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"Space

39365,2017 note i am actually going to review the game not the 3rd party extras for it since you putting your review under gta v not insertname mod so first of all i was extremely late to hop on board the band wagon for this game i was never allowed to play it before i moved out of my mom s a year ago so generally speaking my reviews are on the game as it stands now summary an open world crime sandbox game with a detailed well scripted although short story mode and full featured online mode with a full fledged online mode singleplayer follow the story of franklin an up and coming thug from the hood with strong ties michael an ex criminal who is trying to stay on the downlow with a faked death coverup by the government a slutty daughter a loser son and a b h wife and trevor unique phyco who litterally is not able to stop suprising you as they go to pull of their greatest heists online full featured open world with a light weight immersive story that is designed for multiplayer gaming where you custom make yout character pros detailed graphics a online mode that is constantly getting updates and new features highly advanced online character creator comercial and shows that are more honest and real than real life mock internet that is amazing tons of comunity created as well as first party missons that expand every day well developed protagonists that each one has many things that make them unique heists in online mode and singleplay that give you multiple outcomes and payouts depending on the crew and way you chose to do itcons ever since the introduction to shark card the payouts for online mode over all is terrible with the exceptions of heists which has been planned and developed before the game released online hacking is terrible because of ileagle mods which is why take 2 took drastic mesures in the first place it is good as long as you stick to playing with friends and don t join open freemodes generally does not integrate well with discord this is actually just a con of personal prefrence and as long as you don t care about game overlay is not a problem despite requirments for the game this game will run okay on most of your current everyday pcs modern and with optimization netural cops are extremly unrealistic it makes the game playable and beatable but really flipping the bird to a cop sitting on the side of the road causes same outcome as robbing a bank terrible flying controls when playing with keyboard mouse controller fixes this overall an amazing game and well reccomended,521.0,249.0,24,Recommended,"June 27, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Simply Robert

39371,let me preface this that my review is mostly towards gta online gta v single player is a well made game and probably worth the price despite it being 10 years old and having received zero updates or improvements gta online is still a buggy mess after a decade i think the coding that made this game in 2013 was a shaky foundation at best and complete spaghetti code so convoluted nothing fundamental can be improved or fixed at worst it has been 10 years and i still get loading screens as if i m on xbox 360 with a hdd it s 2024 and more times than i can count i enter a building and am greeted with loading screens for 3 minutes before i give up and alt f4 the inventory interaction menu is unbelievably unintuitive and frustrating to use you have to go through 10 different options fumbling around to heal yourself the phone call system is still obnoxious as ever constantly berated with calls emails texts and notifications from characters begging me to do or buy something where is the do not disturb function my mechanic takes about 30 seconds to pickup his phone and half the time can t get my car to me this was an issue in 2013 matchmaking is a joke if you load into a job you will rarely get to play a full match you have to start the match in a public lobby to actually be able to invite anyone the awful pay for the jobs contributes to the problem as why would anyone want to play this race for 5k when there are better ways to make money the money you earned is directly tied to how long you played so it s better to just afk the mission than play original heists still require 4 people and force end the mission if someone leaves i cannot tell you how many times i ve had an error loading into gta online and get sent back to storymode why can t you requeue me rockstar loathes its player base zero communication ever programming cars to swerve into while driving nerf payouts of everything force players to glitch desired outfits like police uniforms and then blacklist and remove them we can buy police cars now but not uniforms i cannot believe it took a decade to add police cars you can keep players have been asking for cops and crooks dlc for years and get only some half baked police cars they even made the police suv a console exclusive arbitrary limits to the number of ceos in an online session you need to be one to do any mission add blatantly overpowered vehicles for players to grief you encourages players to grief you by making you a target on the map when selling stuff you can do sell missions in solo lobbies now only took 5 years to add but still you have to install rockstar launcher to play horribly unoptimized for online tanks your fps going online from singleplayer poor vehicle diversity max like 5 different car spawns sell missions forcing you to use 4 of the slowest vehicles in existence and drive across the map back die on a mission and need to retry any snacks and armor you used will not be reset so back out and restock or good luck playing with some people and you exit the lobby good luck finding them you are put into a different lobby not fun just bad game design the economy is still inflated beyond belief 5 million dollars for a police car 2 million for a mustang 400k for a rifle they have made strides in improving money making capabilities with solo heists and improved business payouts but you have to be experienced and willing to grind you need millions of dollars in properties to be able to make any significant money which is why they have a starter pack you practically need this to play if you are new shark cards give you a pitiful amount of money for how much you spend please don t give rockstar money buy a 100 billion dollar account from modders for like 5 dollars this game has somehow been kept alive and milked for a decade from casual players and whales giving in to micro transactions you think csgo or rust has a cheater problem you wouldn t believe the number of cheaters on pc it s basically in the tos that rockstar doesn t care if you use a mod menu they even reward them because they don t ever ban them but will ban you if you do a money glitch god mode glitches never get patched or banned there is zero punishment for cheating every other person is cheating maybe not overtly spawning spaceships and putting you in a death loop but casually playing in god mode grinding abysmal security for online where modders can get everyone s ip you played a heist and the money was never paid support will tell you to go yourself there isn t even an option for missing money on support they couldn t care less they treat pc like last gen consoles by locking pc out of content on new gen consoles they removed 200 vehicles for purchase and made them available on a subscription service gta animals have been added into online for consoles only pc has the best hardware and doesn t get the animals something that should ve been in the game to begin with they just keep adding dlc with more bloat they add so many vehicles that nobody ever uses and just keep adding more and more the missions and heists they do add are pretty good although a lot of them require multiple people to play if rockstar had any competition we would have had gta vi years ago and a much better gta v instead we get this show cautiously optimistic for gta vi rockstar is a shell of its former self the

39377,2017 its a shame you can only give one review per game as this really does need two firstly single player there is not much to say about it that hasnt already been said it is one of the best i have ever played i am not new to the gta franchise and have always held san andreas on a ridiculously high pedastal but i would say that this game has exceeded everything san andreas held for me the story is immersive the characters are unique insane and well built there is plenty to do and more than enough to keep you coming back way after the final heist is complete it is one of the best games of all time and every gamer should have this in their library i somehow own it over 2 consoles plus pc however i also have to include a review of online play in here too which is where i become torn i have spent many hours online doing various heists with friends completed cm grinding ceo mc bunkers hangers grinding endlessly the problem is that everything in the game is now so expensive that its becoming obvious rockstar are trying to push people into buying shark cards to be able to afford everything the game has to offer without spending days weeks months killing your soul with grinds or cheat leading me on to issue number two with online play other people hackers cheaters trolls idiots everywhere and with the introduction of the new prep missions for the new heists involving running around in free mode fully visable to all of the above you have to luck out and find yourself in a session with some reasonable and quiet people if not some idiot with a tank hydra other form of destruction will float in and mess up your day or cost you all the supplies youve spent hours grinding did i mention grinding oh or hit you with the unavoidable death ray from his her facility i love playing the heists with my friends i enjoy the odd supply run to kill time and dont get me wrong online play is ok but sigh i want to both thumbs up and down this game for different reason however in the end i do think there is enjoyment to online if youre lucky but the overall near perfection of the single player mode means i cant not recommend gta v,337.8,57.0,6,Recommended,"December 18, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Pinkie

39408,2016 pre ordered this game straight away when it first came to steam been playing it back and forth for 330 hours total i had a ton of fun playing with friends and just doing stuffs online then all of a sudden i got a ban after i got the x80 prot car or whatever it s called a 1 week ban i made a ticket and got a automatic bot reply waited for the ban to disappear to go in again then i notice all my money is gone they wipe your account when you get a ban so i started playing a heist with my brother and some friends on the last part of the heist i got another ban for 1 month i still don t know what it is i am doing that s against their rules i make 4 tickets in hope of getting a reason for my ban and all i get are bot replies after a while i manage to do a ticket with the title connectivity issues and explained that i was afraid to log in cus i didn t want another ban and this time i get a reply from a person this person said we do not know the reason since it s a bot that s banning people and calmly said but you shouldn t be afraid to log in i trusted this guy so i logged in after my 1 month ban and managed to play for a day however on the next day i started playing i got a permanent ban and i still have no clue whatsoever what i got banned for talked with some guys in a gta group and they said i will most likely not get unbanned note i was not modding cheating or abusing anything in the game at all pure vanilla version of the game end note the game is very fun to play with friends but their anti cheat system bans people for nothing and the support gives no whatsoever to help or explain what might be the issue if you can look past the risk of getting randomly banned and having cheaters nuking you anywhere in the world then you might have a good time i don t recommend it cus i think rockstar don t deserve the money when they clearly don t give a about their community,330.0,302.0,27,Not Recommended,"September 18, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,Novoc

39417,2017 grand theft auto v a fun open world game just what you d expect from gta the story is quite good and the characters are memorable driving around los santos is amazing and it has a lot of stuff for you to do those were the positives now onto the negatives pretty much everything in online mode is absolutely overpriced to the point where you have to either farm for cash for several hours if not even days for that one thing you really want or just pay up yes microtransactions a decent ingame sports car that would be about 10 to 15 real life bucks sir in addition i m experiencing many crashes the game apparently can t run for 2 hours without crashing no this can not be attributed to my bad pc xd it s simply poor optimisation on rockstar s part many newer features anything that has to do with being ceo of a company or part of a group of bikers probably more features as well are only accessible in a public lobby meaning you ll have to deal with griefers cheaters and in general every time you start the online mode you will be drowned in text messages and phone calls that are basically rockstar s way of nagging you to pay for their microtransactions in addition the singleplayer mode has and will not recieve any of the new weapons and cars as far as i know all in all i would recommend you don t play the game rockstar already have enough whales to make microtransacion money off,179.9,202.0,6,Not Recommended,"October 23, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"P4099

39439,2015 such a beautiful game a game of such depth and scale it overwhelms ones mind to even attempt to think of the development complexities involved one that is the product of years of slowly but surely tweaking and refining the wildly successful gta open world formula it once again pushes the envelope of what an open world game can and should be all to be ruined by hackers rockstar you should be embarassed by your blatant failure at even pretending to handle the hacking epidemic that is the gta 5 multiplayer they are everywhere do something about this and i ll edit my review to positive a company that devotes almost two additional years of development to a pc port obviously cares about the platform so please do not abandon us now clean up the hackers update well over a year later and rockstar continues to ignore the problem and ban legitimate players again stop calling them mods and modders if you are referring to playing the single player by yourself and altering the game then yes that term is correct however in multiplayer running a program that directly effects and disturbs the gameplay for all users in a multiplayer environment is not a mod it is a cheat exploit hack mods are meant to alter or improve a single person s experience customize skins and textures add features to the game that the devs didn t think about etc they are not meant to disrupt online players and their experience that is called cheating calling them modders makes it sound less insidious and more innocent then what is happening in this game a single hacker cheater exploite will quickly demolish a server or fill everyone with cash so they get banned blindly by rockstar immediately the joy of playing such a brilliantly crafted game with your friends and strangers alike goes right out the window calling what people do in this game a mod when referring to the multiplayer game would be the equivilant to calling a counter strike aim bot or wall hack a mod the reason it is not is because it gives a single player a distinct and completely overpowered advantage against others in a sandbox environment where everybody is supposed to have a chance to work their way up so a year and a half later and rockstar doesn t give a damn i ve been a life long rockstar customer but if they don t get this together by gta6 then rockstar will never see another dime of my money ever,65.1,128.0,16,Not Recommended,"December 28, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Meticulous Tech

39443,2023 any discussion of grand theft auto 5 has to start with scale not with the size of the world or the weapons vehicles and people in it but with the sales figures since its initial release in 2013 gta 5 has sold about 165 million copies worldwide on all platforms that s an elusive number california is home to a little less than 40 million people if copies of gta 5 were people the total number of copies sold would equal the population of bangladesh the game is unimaginably large in its impact and reach that number will only increase after grand theft auto 5 is released on the latest consoles and now that new details about gta 6 have reportedly surfaced after all it s an artifact the grand theft auto series has always been a commentary that drew directly on elements of mass culture taking the plots of various crime films and eras relying on heroic melodrama and spicing up those worlds with silly violence vice city played on the nostalgia of the early 2000s for the coke soaked party scene of the 1980s and its visual and musical industries gta 4 followed the story of an immigrant into a deeply commercialized culture of grifters and schemers both games spoke to both their time and place in specific ways parodying the mass culture of those eras while becoming the dominant mass culture of the early 2000s we find ourselves here and it becomes clear that grand theft auto 5 wrestles with this paradox what does it mean to stick it to the man when you are the man how can you flip the monoculture the bird when you re the standard by which every other open world action game is measured the solution gta 5 found to this problem which i think has something to do with its decade long staying power as both a single player and multiplayer game was to create an extremely robust driving and shooting game skeleton and infuse it with every interesting idea you can think of what s striking about playing gta 5 in 2023 is how unfocused it is how willing the game is to take the player on a strange route of heists train hijackings cargo plane heists and a full torture mini game more on that in a moment in both online multiplayer and story mode this willingness to engage in any idea is always backed up by the game s willingness to return to that safe solid core the player knows that there is always something in the middle waiting to catch him that the aaa game s 30 second loop of driving and shooting under new circumstances will eventually return everything is solved by killing your way out of a dicey situation,619.6,38.0,5,Recommended,"February 25, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,HoriGoDaiChakowa

39469,2016 my experience with rockstar support well as you may pick up from the title anybody posting about experience with support is most likely posting something negative this is most definitely true i begin my story 2 days ago playing gta 5 online and having some fun with friends since i m slightly impatient i decided to purchase a 10 shark card to assist me in getting me started up purchased some weapons vehicle upgrades all that jazz the next day i start up the game only to see that i have been banned with no explanation as to why i have been banned of course i move onto the support website i submit a support ticket explaining my issue and get a response back within minutes of posting the ticket i was impressed such fast response times just kidding it was just an automated response explaining that bans are automated and they can t do anything about it so then i decided to call 51 calls just to get into the waiting line 47 minute hold brief explanation of myself and another 7 minute hold all to be told the same the automated system on the website told me i still have no idea as to why i was banned never hacked never modded never abused anybody thank you support for literally wasting my time other than the stupid banning of innocent people including a friend of mine who has been temp banned twice now and will be perma banned on the next one it s fun with friends verdict would i recommend it if you can avoid being perma banned by a broken automated system sure i would but i can t say that is possible ijustneededtovent endrantedit this was originally a reddit post when i state 2 days ago i really mean a while ago edit 2 to all those saying just shut up you cheated admit it stop lying you clearly either haven t played long enough or consistent enough to have the broken automated system touch you in inappropriate places or you are just that one special snowflake that is so ignorant to all the evidence of false positives seriously,100.7,410.0,41,Not Recommended,"August 6, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,SirSoda

39508,2016 great game horrible company i ve been banned twice now the first time for tv remotes in my apartment that were duplicating themselves and the second time for apparently jumping out of an airplane this is all me guessing the most plausible cause since you are given no reason and as per usual rockstar support refuses to be cooperative even to the point of completely closing down their phone line to avoid having to speak to any frustrated player submitting a support ticket even with evidence of your innocence results in the same bot response and an immediate closing of the ticket you should essentially expect to be banned at some point if you buy this game update after my 30 day ban ended i decided i would play the game once more just to enjoy it before my inevitable permanent ban and i was entirely correct because after the entirety of one evening i wake up to be perma banned based on when i got the violation notice e mail it banned me when i was logging off when i still had a three star wanted level oddly enough my friend who did the exact same thing but has no bans on his record can still play the game amusing to say the least,267.5,249.0,28,Not Recommended,"August 5, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,Kirkjub√¶jarklaustur

39544,2021 of course this is a good game an amazing game on playstation and xbox and could have also been as good and sick on pc the campaign is one of the best campaigns that i ve ever played it is hands down in my top 3 campaign experiences however the multiplayer had the golden ticket with an almost perfect world for a mmo the best circumstances for the human reflection on crime murder drugs taboo and money but why work and grind towards anything in this game when you stay in any lobby long enough you encounter a game breaking hacker and that s the blatant ones there are many more modding and abusing the game without your sight as somebody who has played his fair share of multiplayer games i do not understand what rockstar is doing they could easily have fixed most of the problems before they launched the game for example making it so that money is tracked so nobody can hack in money in world of warcraft there are no money hackers there are bots on markets and chinese people farming money but money can t simply be modded in the game you sit there spending hours farming grinding and for what money that could have been modded in seconds and hundred of thousands in this game have some modded money might be from the early anarchy days or later this game has given me some of my favourites gaming experiences with my gaming library not being the same without it it is the perfect scenario for a game and it deliveries in plenty of departments nevertheless i cannot enjoy this game at the level of other games anymore every single lobby which has some players in it will get a modder in an hour or two a lot times much faster than that essential game for my library and i do recommend the game but know what you are buying they don t care about pc gamers and this is a much better experience on consoles 7 10,562.1,49.0,2,Recommended,"January 31, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"malo

39545,2020 literally the worst game you can ever pick upif you re buying this for online play let me say this it can be fun with friends and i mean you can spend hours on here having fun with mini games and even just fighting each other for the heck of it but lets get this straight loading times for online play take ages to load and if you tab out you will add 5 minutes to your waiting time if you want to play with a friend then get on your knees and start praying cause sometimes it s nearly impossible if you and your friend happen to get into a match then it s all fun and games until the hacker comes in i ve seen hackers come into matches and either attempt to leak my ip spawn gigantic stuff on my character so it s just impossible to play and i have to restart my game to get rid of it do some sort of glitch where i have infinite loading after getting invited to some dudes apartment use godmode and destroy my cars spawn kill me or they ll do the worst thing of all which is mess with the brightness of the sky textures or something and cause the game to get extremely bright or have a bunch of colors spazz out on my screen which has almost caused me to go into a seizure twice most hackers are usually not that bad cause most just use hacks to just get money but when you start making it so that you physically cannot play the game at all you re a gigantic problem not only that but a lot of people who i used to play with are banned for literally no reason after a gigantic random banwave hit and just knocked so many people out of the game 3 10 can be decent but hackers make it,147.4,169.0,23,Not Recommended,"June 19, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,‚Ä† Beebo ‚Ä†

39551,2016 product received for free alright boys and girls super salty rant time this game is not worth the money if you want it for online only i repeat if you are only interested in online do not purchase this game there have been a lot of false bans being issued recently and r does not care if you were falsely banned i have been banned for 4 days now and i have written 4 tickets to support three of which have recieved the same response two were from a bot the third was a real person but still the same response i don t have a clue why i was banned because ive never modded never exploited and never even recieved money from any other players the only thing ive done in the game is cuss some guy out because he called me a f aggot after i said he was salty supposedly you can be banned for being overly racist homophobic or disrespectful towards a religion i cussed someone out for using homophobic slurs i defended homosexuals while he bashed them so if that warrants a ban me right ive done everything i could to contact r support including the 4 support tickets as mentioned above a forum post tweets and dm s to both their support and games accounts and ive even called the support line over 100 times only to never talk to a human all ive asked for in my tickets dms posts whatever is a reason for being banned or a removal of the ban yet im still no closer to understanding why i was banned if and only if i hear back from support before my ban is automatically lifted i will alter this review to reflect upon it but as of right now i cannot recommend this game for anyone only interested in the online feature as of this particular point in time i wont be playing online until i get a response from r support telling me why i was banned in the first place because ive read many a post about people being banned not knowing why then getting banned again after attempting to play online again go ahead and say what you want im sure i ll get lots of you cheated you got caught deal with it comments but i know that i havent broken any rules and i could honestly care less what people assume of me edit they never got back to me but i would like to say that a few of the known programs that can trigger a false ban are things like teamspeak discord and skype as well as possibly steams fps counter or recording software like bandicam and fraps,121.7,213.0,35,Not Recommended,"July 15, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"Richard G.

39554,2018 if you like the gta series as a whole you probably already have this game if you re considering it singleplayer is great with dozens of missions to play and a decent story if you re interested in online consider it carefully while it is fun building up your crime career the game is absolutely teeming with modders who won t think for a second on ruining your day only thing worse than this is rockstar s seeming ineptitude of dealing with the situation correctly e g the great ban hammer of 2017 or even at all makes me second guess my review i d only get it if you have more than one friend who plays it and can help you around missions or defend you with high level gear also rockstar s negligence of pc releases in general make this the last and only game i will buy from them looking at you rdr2 it s a shame because i love their world building but poor management of their games is inexcusable only recommending the game because it s fun with friends despite modders,67.8,24.0,2,Recommended,"October 2, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,Tyrannic Feline

39566,2016 hi this is about my first serious review and i ll try to advise you if it s worth it or not to buy the game based on my personal opinion as you probably know gta has two kind of game modes online and story mode and i ll judge both please remember this is my personal opinion and everything is based on what i feel about the game and i ll undersand and respect yours aswell story mode catchy story mode somewhat fun and dynamic questline some nostalgic feels balanced prices and easy fun huge map but feels somewhat empty my opinion it s pretty standard same grab this kill that race this kind of missions but is it good from my point of view it can be fun though it lacks the gta san andreas vibes but hey it s a new game if you came for the ol gangbanging drive by feel it will let you down mostly it s big game moves stealing banks and others but apart from that and that you can t get all the online perks and dlc stuff it s a pretty fun single player online huge open world tho some of it lacks content huge grind to get money almost everything overpriced community imagine cod s and minecraft community togheter yeah free dlc s but really expensive in game content hackers and modded accounts bad servers with huge loading times and frequent lost connections weak ui somewhat challenging to get around game modes feel straight up pushed into the game just to add content races are fun kinda i understand that my views towards the online mode are mostly money centered but without cash you can t get around really you need money for bullets money for cars money for houses money for almost everything it s the lifeblood of the game so in my opinion the online feels like a massive grind you ll get around but it just feels like you ll never enjoy the game to it s fullest without money the community is just random either they wont ever bother to talk to you or straight up blow up everything you love and care about it really feels like a pay to win game did i mention the hackers and modded accounts that will make you feel poor new dlc out great what new content will i try oh i can t really afford any alright i got really side tracked there sorry i used to love gta but it feels that they ve went way to greedy on everything and basic things that could be done to fix the game or improve it are shunned upon by the creators and instead we are given ever more expensive content to either buy shark cards or grind for 4 hours straight to get one car it s just not the kind of game i wouldn t buy and yes i regret buying it thank you for stopping by i hope this helped you in anyway take your time to read other reviews and don t stick with just one remember this is my opinion and yours might differ from mine good luck and cheers,956.2,258.0,16,Not Recommended,"June 25, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,Big Bad Wolf

39578,2017 i had to give this a no if you are getting this to play gta online most of the servers i join is swarming with modders and cheaters sure its good if they re on your side speeding up missions and giving their cut in the final heist but modders do game breaking like spawning obstacles in free mode so you get trapped in one spot with now way of getting out other than quitting the game spawing a guitar within your character that takes you to the sky and kills you and being immortal in every adversary mode will make you want to quit the game every item in game is expensive and takes you forever to enjoy it fully unless you have friends who will grind every mission with you shark cards are expensive but if you can afford it then goodif you re getting this for the single player experience then good because every part of the game is flawless for me i have nothing bad to say about it i just wished that rockstar focused on making a single player dlc like in gta4 that dream is gone now,385.5,134.0,9,Not Recommended,"October 30, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Eska

39587,2018 this is a game that seems fun when you first look at it you can play through a story by yourself or play online with friends i rarely touched the story mode since i was in it for the online gameplay i had friends to play with and i convinced two of my friends to buy it because they wanted to play it with me i was on my best behavior in the game i tended to play with just my friends in public sessions because so much of the community is toxic waste this is worsened by the game having absolutely garbage pvp you start off without good armor and the best armor is still trash low health and weak weapons if you have noone to play with early on this game is brutal you will be destroyed by people with either more time and progress in the game people with more real life money and or the endless supply of modders godmodding trapping and killing people this problem tends to not end even when you get better weapons armor and vehicles because no matter what explosive bullets will forever be broken as all hell a hydra the game s version of the harrior with explosive bullets will destory anything armored vehicles are nothing against a barrage even the tankiest vehicles including tanks will be destroyed within a few seconds or less thus it is really pointless to try and make money outside of heists if you don t know the trick to empty out sessions also whenever i encountered a modder i would do my best to report them in hopes that it would help stop the rampant modding that happens i really did have fun playing but rockstar decided that i shouldn t be allowed to have fun without any explaination nor reason i was banned from gta online with nearly 500 hours of time and effort invested in the game gone to waste i try to contact rockstar because surely i can prove i m innocent and maybe just maybe i could get everything back and enjoy this game with my friends again nope rockstar support is just a pile of they automatically closed my ticket where i asked them to review my gameplay and tell me what i did wrong i am still confident that if they did that instead of relying on their garbage automated system which the rampant modding clearly shows how badly it fails to work they would see that no violation occurred but they are too busy rolling in their money to give a care about the consumer stay far far away from rockstar and anything they make this is a company that deserves nothing but bankruptcy they will take your money time and energy then punch you in the stomach without warning nor reason while walking away with everything you put into the game please for the love of all that is good put your money elsewhere never spend a single cent on rockstar i hope that their actions one day give them the consequences they deserve edit i have been unbanned and my progress was kept as is however i m not going easy on rockstar the way they handled the situation not publically admitting an issue and having no communication with users on social media was poor and i was not even notified my ban was removed while i will return to the game once i know the false positive issue is completely resolved my trust is something that has to be earned if rockstar goes above and beyond with how they treat us their customers then i will be more than happy to give them a positive review and sing of their praise until then i will continue to warn people of how they treat customers,970.2,40.0,1,Not Recommended,"March 23, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Lara

39598,2016 gta 5 is a bit of a conundrum for me because i can t really review the whole thing as one game gta 5 s campaign and gta online are two very different things and deserve two completely different reviews i also want to note i ve also played this on ps3 pretty much since it came out and have played way too many hours on it on console first off is gta 5 s single player campaign which is in my opinion really really good there s not much more to say other than that the characters are all pretty damn fun to play as the game is just good and the attention to detail is surprising in some areas you wouldn t think that a group developing a sandbox crime heist em up would spend too much time on the little things like golf or tennis but both of them play really well the golf in particular probably plays better than some games that are completely dedicated exclusively to golf from gta 4 the driving shooting and melee attacks are all vastly improved aswell now the tumorous microtransaction riddled elephant in the room gta online simply put it s a massive grind apartments that you can set up heists from are so expensive you won t be buying one for a pretty long time new cars are similarly overpriced the newest super car in the game costs 2 million vehicle modifications such as armor engine tune ups suspension and so on are many times more expensive than they are in single player and completely uncustomizable vehicles like planes helicopters and boats tend to cost even more than apartments do because logic i guess all of this seems to have been done solely for the purpose of selling shark cards rockstar s overpriced means of aquiring money with no effort you can buy these cards at prices ranging from 2 99 which i believe only gets you a hundred thousand not enough to buy and upgrade 1 single gun with full ammo to 99 99 which gives you 8 million looking back at their newest super car at 2 million that means that if you want to avoid the grind it will cost you around 50 real life dollars of real money to fully upgrade a fake car that only exists in a video game leaving you with just a little spending money even more ludicrous are the new yachts which act as big floating player homes in the ocean these start just shy of 5 million to put it plainly according to rockstar they seem to think that a fake yacht in a game is worth roughly 60 to 70 dollars in real life money this is more than the retail price of gta itself and is just aweful to sum up this half rant half praise of a review it almost seems as though gta 5 was designed and developed by a group of dedicated professional game developers who cared about what they were doing and wanted to make a genuinely good game and they did just that the game that is gta 5 is still a very good game and the campaign has a fair bit of replayability to it the city of los santos is colorful and fun and even out in the country side there s an astonishing amount of detail however it s like this team of good game designers were just sort of set aside when it came to gta online at which point rockstar decided to have a group of accountants design just about everything everything about gta online exists to make money from the painful grind to the overpriced useless tat it s really a shame because once you ve played the heists which reward you with almost nothing but more cars boats planes etc to buy there s no more reason to play the game if you just like pvp combat there are better games out there dedicated solely to pvp if you just like to race fast cars there s better experiences to be had it s because of gta online that i can t reccomend buying gta 5 all together especially when rockstar seems determined not to focus any effort on any new single player content this is all coming from someone who has been playing gta 5 since release and it s sad to see this happen to a game that so many had high hopes for,373.8,163.0,13,Not Recommended,"May 11, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"Comrade

39622,2017 just to get one point out of the way i am reviewing this game as a single player experience i haven t really experienced the online part more than playing through the introduction but there are a lot of other steam reviews mentioning online play and according to some of them and some youtubers rockstar has been banning a lot of innocent players so yeah if you want info on the online experience check out other comments and reviews as for gta 5 s story mode and single player experience i feel it is a great gta game and certainly worth a buy for those that are a fan of the feel and gameplay of the series though there are some things i wish would have been a bit different that scene the torture scene now i am not against extreme and uncomfortable scenes in games if they serve a proper purpose however this didn t really serve any purpose for me i already knew at this point in the game that the character was deranged and a despicable human being controlling him as he tortured someone for information couldn t possibly lower my opinion of him any further i feel like this scene was simply put in to generate controversy about the game and get people talking so more people would buy the game because of the controversy which in truth it did get a lot of people talking when the game first came out so yay didn t really do anything for the story you already knew the agencies in gta were corrupt you knew trevor was the evilest character in the game nothing was really achieved other than making the player torture someone the charactersthen there are the three main characters themselves which i feel was a mistake i much prefer just playing as one character especially with michael being the most interesting gta protagonist i have played so far the most interesting supporting cast is also closely related to michael mainly his dysfunctional family i would have preferred the game focusing more on him possibly just making franklin a heist member and turning trevor into the main antagonist of the game franklin suffers from the same problem that cj had in gta san andreas he is just really boring unlike cj though most of the characters around franklin are boring too mostly just coming into the story to remind him that he isn t black enough and giving up on the hood because he is trying to get out of there and move up in the world cj at least had the best antagonists i have seen in the series and an insane but also hilariously over the top girlfriend ex girlfriend franklin he has a special ability that makes racing easier other than that he can be easily replaced by every other character plus switching between other characters franklin will often switch to ugly baggy clothes like some teenager trying to be cool so i constantly have to run back home to change his outfit to something that makes him look half decent as for trevor it is really weird playing as the most messed up and psychotic character in a gta game usually you play a guy like franklin or michael clearly both guys doing bad things but they are the kind of bad guys you send in to deal with the even worse guys trevor is as close as you get to a bad guy and i can best describe him as the joker of the gta universe for sake we are introduced to him killing a guy because the guy is upset that trevor is his girlfriend note the guy does not take the first hostile action trevor does when the guy doesn t instantly off trevor has no real redeeming qualities and by all accounts he should be the main bad guy at the end of the game because he is often the main cause of conflict then there are the villains with three main characters all switching between the spotlight there aren t much time left to let any villain shine which results in a series of smaller forgettable bad guys especially since trevor is often just on the verge of being a full on villain to michael which is a shame seeing as san andreas had amazing villains and a great climax the gta 5 climax is more meh a great thing is that you can give all of the protagonists glorious beards which really helps improve their ugly faces stay positiveokay so that was the negatives out of the way now for the more positive the gameplay feels much more smooth to me than it has in previous titles everything is nice and easy to control once you get the hang of it well possibly except for helicopters but i will never learn to properly fly and land those things in gta p i also like the skills of the various characters such as driving and shooting and that certain ones of them are relatively fast to level up especially flying at the flying school it is nice that they haven t brought back annoying stats like fat so the core of the gameplay is very enjoyable and the other drivers have improved a lot too in previous games if i tried to drive normal waiting on traffic lights driving in the correct lanes matching the speed of the other cars which i often do in missions where the characters are having conversations i would often get slammed into by cars deciding to make a sudden turn in about 60 hours of gta 5 i didn t experience that happening even once to myself though i did see a few others driving into other cars but not into me by accident there are also several random encounters which spice up the city and make it feel alive some are just people wanting to get driven places and give a few bucks but some are more interesting or funny for example i suddenly saw hostiles on the map and decided to check it out because i hadn t really done anything to warrant hostiles at that time after shooting them it turned out i saved a girl from being murdered over her dad s criminal past and after driving her home i was later contacted getting 60 000 put into the character s account which i felt was a lot for a random encounter there are also some great songs mixed into the different radio stations since i have been watching archer a lot lately i was really excited when i suddenly heard they were playing danger zone by kenny loggins a lot of the minigames are also fun side distractions personally i found playing tennis as michael to be very relaxing end remarksso yeah two out of three protagonists suck the antagonists aren t very fleshed out or memorable the core of the game is great the city feels more alive and the radio has good songs mixed in,109.5,27.0,1,Recommended,"March 9, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Wolfhowl

39635,2017 in my opinion the online portion of the game has just gone to in the past year of more with updates that introduce insanely expensive vehicles that are totally unbalanced and practically force you to either waste your money on shark cards or spend hours on end completing the most boring and bland delivery missions ever which cost millions to buy anyway it s great if you either have the money to buy shark cards an unlimited amount of friends that don t bore you after repeating the same for 5 hours now or if you are a new innocent player who can still buy the cheap cars it would be better if there were more heists where the game actually interacts with you and give you the only fun way of getting money although if you play solo it s still as the online community don t communicate or frankly even know how to play on the level you do and keep bringing you down rockstar you need to bring the game back to the basics which used to make it fun and enjoyable and stop being the scummy money you are this is all coming from a long lasting player all the way from xbox 360 with around 600 total hours in the game,294.1,190.0,2,Not Recommended,"July 9, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Steve from the chippy

39638,2020 grand theft auto v is like a wild ride through a crazy world where anything goes the game is like a mix of action drama and comedy all wrapped up into one giant sandbox of mayhem the city of los santos looks like a living breathing world with each character having their own unique personality and story to tell the attention to detail is impressive from the way the cars handle to the random events that happen around you but let s be real the best part of gta v is causing chaos whether it s robbing a bank hijacking a helicopter or just running over pedestrians the game gives you the freedom to do whatever you want and the police will come after you oh boy will they it s like a game within a game trying to escape the cops while causing as much destruction as possible but there s also a serious side to the game the storyline is well written and engaging with each character having their own motivations and arcs you ll find yourself invested in their lives and choices even if they re not always the best people one thing that can be frustrating about the game is the online mode it can be difficult to find players to join your game and when you do they may not always be the most cooperative but when you do find a group of players who are all on the same page it s a blast to work together to pull off heists and other missions overall grand theft auto v is a must play for anyone who enjoys open world games with a healthy dose of chaos just don t forget to take a break every once in a while or you might find yourself getting lost in the game for hours on end,718.8,17.0,1,Recommended,"January 2, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"ukiyo

39644,2015 yesthis is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of rp roleplaying and the perfected multiplayer that is in gta v personally in these games i go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and i enjoy playing gta before so gta iv hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic i think in these kind of reviews it s important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come gta iv was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that rp aspect as i saw it pros alot more to do in the terms of role playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why skyrim and such are still so played the multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in skyrim there is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and i love it the asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots friends if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games don t do the game literally is just for and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play the story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that aren t heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse online and singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc the ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60 feeling to a game such as this pc master race console beta testingcons public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you non stop get killed and robbed etc and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server when you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking the damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it in about like 100 levels which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you this drags away from the initial feel of gta in my opinion the loading there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation the game is the most demanding game i ve played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points game invites there are so many of them and that little ding that you get when you are playing sucks ass cause its so damn frequent and sucks i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you can t from my experience when playing with friendswith all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you won t most of the time this all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends mods and gameplay enjoyment with so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect this is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun,287.7,149.0,20,Recommended,"April 16, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"YumYann

39656,2023 surprisingly i never reviewed this game so here we go years ago i would have recommended this game but years have past and the rockstar i knew and loved is dead gone are the days of san andrea s and vice city rockstar sold out rockstar censored their games rockstar refuses to innovate or maintain the gta experience this game was fun at first and gta online was ahead of it s time but not anymore it s just filled with micro transactions want a new car micro transaction want a property micro transaction want to play the new update micro transaction want to play the game normally without spending money guess what hours of work will be lost after a child with mommy s credit card buys an oppressor and blows up supplies that you are trying to sale because you enjoy the game and want to actually play it point is this game forces you to buy things to make the game enjoyable i played this game by grinding for a long time but rockstar intentionally limits how much money you can make online on purpose so you will buy their in game currency it s just a giant online vending machine that s the game why make a story why continue the campaign and why release dlc when you can just put more micro transactions in the multiplayer the campaign was enjoyable and funny i grew to like the character progression and missions but after you beat the campaign there is no real reason to play it and while yes you can mod it the reality is why why is it always up to us to make the games better just to have our mods become features in the next installments or worse be banned because mods make a superior product it s just sad how far gta has fallen in my opinion it s no different than other games like fallout 76 they don t release any content except their version of content and it s always the in game store or micro transactions if you want to waste a lot of money on things that could just be modded in if the game had mod support and servers on rockstar s behalf then by all means buy it i don t want to play it anymore,408.1,76.0,7,Not Recommended,"April 5, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,"Tac Tyger

39717,2020 grand theft auto v is a game that exceeded all of my expectations from the moment i started playing i was hooked the open world map of los santos is massive and filled with a wide variety of activities to keep players engaged for hours on end whether you re driving around the city causing chaos participating in high stakes heists or just taking in the sights and sounds of the game s many neighborhoods there s always something to do the graphics in the game are top notch and the attention to detail is impressive the city feels alive with traffic and pedestrians going about their business and the lighting and weather effects add a realism that immerses you in the game the character models and animations are also incredibly well done making the game feel like a living breathing world one of the things that sets gta v apart from other open world games is the level of freedom it gives players you can choose to play as one of three characters each with their own unique story and abilities and you can switch between them at any time this adds a level of replayability to the game that is unmatched the heist missions are also a standout feature of the game planning and executing large scale robberies with your crew is incredibly satisfying and the game s cover based shooting mechanics make for some intense and exciting action in short grand theft auto v is a masterpiece of a game it has something for everyone whether you re looking for a sandbox to cause chaos in a story to follow or just a beautiful open world to explore the level of freedom and replayability is unmatched and the attention to detail is stunning it s a game that i will keep coming back to for years to come,63.4,25.0,1,Recommended,"February 6, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"Excrescence

39746,this game is close to 9 years old i m pretty sure everyone played it who wanted to or saw a video about it except me i finished the story today and i played online back in the days gta v has probably the most well designed game elements in all of gta games new vehicles types heist missions different free roam activities special vehicles different scenarios in missions and so on the story is also interesting following 3 protagonists around los santos and in it s state and even though there are not many big twists in the story it s enjoyable for sure graphics is pretty nice sound design and soundtrack is well made online modes are much more expanded comparing to older gta games this game is definitely and improvement on most parts however for me it has too many game elements to follow either in single or multiplayer but multiplayer is much more complex it s just really hard to wrap this game around my head without knowing what to do or what should i do not even mentioning the controls they are not bad but difficult to get used since you have so many functions for many buttons for me it s quite to task to play this game about multiplayer i still don t understand what i should bother with it or avoid guys who would take me out all the time difficult to understand and more difficult to play it alone or without any help this is definitely one of the most well known games on earth lots of people favorite game but for me it s just hard to get used to it i admire the different and new elements which it has but gta v feels a bit too much and overwhelming on the new things or on content feels like it s drawn out but still for a single player standpoint it s pretty fun and lengthy and overall a good game but not my favorite for sure 30 is a bit too much even though you would get stuff for the online mode so i would get it around 10 15 depending on your preferences with the online bonuses,60.5,30.0,1,Recommended,April 13,Grand Theft Auto V,"[ME] etneveL

39777,2020 grand theft auto 5 part shooter part open world with lots of side activities and with a story to tell the game focuses on three characters franklin who s trying to make a name for himself in the town michael a retired criminal with short temper and trevor his old heisting mate with downright psychopathic tendencies the main story is about how they meet up and end up as partners in a lot of let s just say illegal operations which is to be expected given this is gta graphically you can tell this is more than a couple years old i would say it aged relatively well you can see most of the details on objects or especially characters with good draw distance and maybe some textures being kinda blurry overall it s the typical gta experience go through story missions do side activities like races or parachuting or just go on the good ol rampage with rocket launchers and miniguns the game plays primarily like a cover shooter with most headshots being instantly lethal and regenerating health up to a certain point what makes the game a bit more interesting than an average cover shooter is characters special abilities well a little bit more interesting as they re not particularly special franklin gets slow mo superdriving michael has bullet time when shooting and trevor well let s just say he goes nuts tanks bullets like they re nothing and the ones he fires tend to explode enemy body parts rather violently besides that you can use the in game money you earn to buy properties whether for storing vehicles or making more money despite how solid singleplayer is it ain t making up for how horrible online is the general gist of online is pretty obvious do stuff with friends that you would normally do by yourself in this type of game you can also play various multiplayer activities like pvp shootouts battle royale or races to earn cash and experience to level up and unlock buy more stuff and here s actually the first flaw of the thing you need amounts close to a million to buy just one major property than isn t a simple apartment for you to stay in or a single vehicle more expensive weaponized vehicles have a base price of 3 4 milion with even more if you wanna customize them sometimes requiring another one or two purchases worth a seven digit figure each just to be able to even fully customize them in the first place and a lot of the stuff you buy is mostly just so you can have an easier time making more money the most recent piece of content casino heist will likely get you and your buddies a bit over half a milion per head after about two hours worth of setup and running the heist itself if split evenly it takes quite a lot of grinding especially with no income to even be able to afford one major thing well that or what rockstar wants you to do buy shark cards another major problem is how easy it is to grief in online everyone who played it knows the flying terror made of highly concentrated bullcrap the oppresor mk2 a jet powered bike with homing rockets countermeasures to avoid enemy firepower tiny size fairly high speed and in contrast with all the other aircraft the ability to be used at almost full effectiveness by potatoes it s the griefer s favorite tool and it makes the job extremely easy it s hard to really get anything done when every session you re guaranteed to have at least one of these guys blowing hundreds of thousands of in game currency worth of stuff you re trying to sell it does have counters given it s made out of paper and doesn t protect its user from enemy bullets but when you re new and don t own anything or you re stuck driving a slow ass garbage truck that s basically a sitting duck kiss your potential money goodbye of course it s to the benefit of rockstar making life hell for people trying to earn money just drives up shark card sales which is their bottom line also their anti cheat is basically nonexistant it s extremely easy to use some kind of modding overlay to do all kinds of crazy stuff so cheaters are extremely common in this game if you re lucky they will at most meme on you while being rather harmless at worst make everything explode in the world nuke the entire session from orbit or force crash your game the majority of heist prep objectives usually boil down to three things getting something from point a to point b losing cops it won t let you actually finish much if you re on the radar or getting killed over and over with one shots to the head until you can actually get whatever you wanna get done well done in heists themselves you have usually a spare life on normal and none on hard which has 25 higher payout anybody dying when there are no lives remaining means automatic failure and restart from the last checkpoint which is usually start of the actual activity after driving there or if the game s feeling merciful the halfway point in general it frequently feels like it jumps from sleep inducing driving to extremely frustrating cycle of dying and respawning over and over again with hardly anything in between and on a technical level online s one giant amusing glitch at best a complete and utter joke at worst it takes between 5 10 minutes just to join an online session loading time wise on start up still a few minutes when you re switching sessions afterwards besides that there are tons and tons of bugs so i m just going list the ones i personally experienced constant issues with joining any friends sessions or their heists inability to join them outright due to having to complete the tutorial first this being after i have already joined them that session meaning it s definitely completed already otherwise it wouldn t let me do that in the first place textures just straight up disappearing to reveal the void beneath the city constant desync issues during heists which cause illogical things like cameras surveiling walls or doing 360 turn arounds purchasing clothes only for them to be magically un purchased next time you check on them on multiple occassions heist cuts resetting to default where the host takes lion s share of the cash and everyone else is left with piddling amounts on two occassions and softlocking the game while doing something as simple as buying ammo i have absolutely no idea how this mess of a game can be rockstar s cash cow unless their idea of making money is to keep it in a laughable state to frustrate the players to the point of buying shark cards in order to skip the dysfunctional grind that s both the only logical solution to it and also something that makes me wonder just how much longer this industry or humanity itself for that matter can even function if this is what people are actually spending money on en masse so overall my recommendation is no just due to how insultingly poor online is since i m judging the whole package here however if you re not interested in online it s a fairly decent and sometimes good game to have a few tens of hours worth of fun with even if it s nothing special in which case i would say pick it up on a sale,506.2,31.0,6,Not Recommended,"February 24, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"Vallinek

39806,do not play or buy this game as of sep 17 2024 rockstar has decided that they are going to lock out anyone using linux by installing anti cheat their official reply from a support ticket is this we certainly understand that you are unable to login to gta online through steam deck after the update we would like to inform you that the primary goal of incorporating battleye into gta online is to enhance the overall gaming experience by actively scanning for cheats and exploits and preventing players with cheats and mods from entering online the steam deck players will not be able to join gta online but should be able to launch single player without any issues we appreciate your understanding in this matter if you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to let us know we are here to assist you so their idea of enhancing the gaming experience is to basically just cut off a portion of their players which i very much doubt were the ones causing the cheating to begin with instead of writing code that was much more robust and had some kind of checks and balances to prevent this type of hacking they just decided that it would be easier to drop in some third party code and wash their hands of it well congratulations rockstar you have just cut off your own nose to spite your face i don t want to play single player as i purchased this to play with my friends online which i am now unable to do i cannot recommend this game,824.8,71.0,1,Not Recommended,September 17,Grand Theft Auto V,indavis

39808,2022 i can no longer recommend this game in good faith with the gta online portion after being suspended after 300 hours of playing the game and grinding away at the agency auto shop and heists and just enjoying the game with a band of friends losing my character with all the progress i made when i have done nothing wrong except literally going to bed one day and waking up to see i ve been suspended now i outright fear even going onto the game even after the suspension is gone in a month along with my other friends and never being able to play again the policy that is in place where one is not allowed to appeal a suspension or a ban is absolutely insane and i know there are other innocent players that have been getting false flagged by their overly zealous anti cheat but due to their policy anyone who plays legit and gets flagged or even sabotaged by a modder cannot do anything about it but accept their fate of losing all their progress the first time and than condemned to just never play again the second time they get flagged one can go onto youtube reddit or even check other reviews here on steam on this matter they ve basically shut down the customer service over the phone and if you respond on their support questioning your suspension you just get the same copy pasted message and your requests locked even speaking to a live service rep via their website just results in you immediately getting the same thing and them closing out the chat you won t even get to know why you were suspended banned as they stated they will not release any information on why action was taken against you,504.0,22.0,0,Not Recommended,"May 26, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,"Hadai Magis

39818,2016 i waited a while to write this mainly because i wanted to find quite a bit to write about nevertheless after 100 hours i feel this game can be thoughtfully and precisely judged more inportantly on all aspects of the game i ll be dividing this review into two categories single player and multiplayer let s begin single player single player starts off with the characters michael and trevor finishing a heist job from the north yankton bank they decide this is the last and final score yet not all good things end well they end up getting caught and one of their crew members die trevor escapes and that s where the story begins next and final playable character is introduced named franklin franklin is a petty thief who is hired by simeon a local car dealsman to reposess cars at the owners expense although the reposession is not so to speak authorised one day franklin gets the order to repo the car of a teenager and upon arrival franklin is met with a seemingly rich family after successfully lifting the car franklin drives away cheerfully not knowing michael is in the back seat after pursuading franklin to drive through simeons shop michael makes a deal with him to make some real cash thus involving franklin in a series of robberies and other heists once word gets out michael is back in the scene his old colleague trevor finds out who is furious because he thought micheal died all those years back that s pretty much the story you rob a few banks make some cash the story is quite well and fun i found no aspects to complain about and even had hours of enjoyment playing through it i actually wish it was longer or a single player dlc was introduced which involved the main characters after the robberies even though side missions and such could count as this i wanted more along the lines of the main story all in all the game is pretty much in it s current state only worth it for the story the reason why is in multiplayer multiplayer jesus christ multiplayer is a mess just to name a few problems hackers the will infinitely shoot rockets at everyone until their dead or at least until you want to turn on passive mode and ruin your experience dlc with the addition of some well planned dlc cash cards or microtransactions of in game currency became available the only reason i have a problem with this is that the ones that are worth anything at all meaning the money from the card can t be made in 20 minutes time are more than what the game is actually sold for yes that s right the developers are selling in game money for 50 or even 100 real money not to mention this was the spawn of their genius summer sale idea to innitially discount the game 40 only to remove the listing add a shark card to it and stick it up as 40 off but still cost the regular 60 move rockstar foreigners i myself find me to be a very multicultured person i don t mind at all anyone of a different nationality only when it hinders my gameplay example i m still sort of new to the whole online mode of this game so i often ask for hints during team modes such as heists so i was put into a lobby of non english speakers for a heist so i thought okay i can do this i just have to fly a plane i get the plane go to the area now i have to evade jets no big deal after flying around for 20 minutes with literally nothing happening the team finally gets their together and i can pick them up i fly off and we are supposed to lose the cops my other pilot who has the missles to shoot down the cops helicopters so we can get away faster decides he s going to take a break and lands at the beach i fly around for maybe 20 more minutes trying desperately to get these cops to go away and even when there were none around for miles they somehow still found me after i finally get them to go away i now just have to drop them off somehow my experienced skills did not tell me i have to stall my plane in the sky about 200 meters up just do drop the off so i spent about another 10 minutes flying around screaming what the is going on then my genius teammates start screaming at me fly tall any english speaker will not know what the that means so when someone says fly tall that literally sounds like nonsense so other helicopter guy decides his 15 minute break is up starts flying upwards into the air so i decided to follow the game goes to the cutscene and we all jump out after 2 seconds screen comes up the guy we broke out died i left the game don t get me wrong online can be some fun and by that i mean if you have passive mode enabled or are in a solo session multiplayer is literally cancer just avoid it at all costs,169.8,124.0,24,Not Recommended,"January 1, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,serious mode

39867,2020 introgrand theft auto 5 is the current latest game from the gta franchise after the monumental success of grand theft auto rockstar games decided to make a sequel to the hd universe in sunny los santos inspired by los angeles the game was released on september 17th 2013 and is to date the most successful piece of entertainment media just to mention in this review i won t mention gta 5 online because that it a game on it s own gameplaythe gameplay for gta 5 is a great example of perfection everything is brilliantly paced nothing feels that it was shallow or rushed missions end with you finding new things out about the game and its lore gunplay is very satisfying aiming to feel so fluid and responsive the variety of weapons and their addons is massive there are 30 weapons all with customizability shotguns have a loud and powerful punch pistols having that firm grip and the snipers having that shrouded effect graphicsthe gta 5 graphics were in 2013 groundbreaking almost 7 years later that claim still stands the graphics are absolutely stunning rockstar games really are known for their level of detail every piece of shrubbery is unique in its own way it s amazing how they managed to stuff a world that big in a game storybefore i start spoiler warning ahead in gta 5 you play as 3 main protagonists franklin clinton a 25 year old guy trying to escape gang life and trying to actually do something influential in his life a newcomer to the criminal life he is also a talent for driving michael desanta townley a 48 year old trying to live a good life after being a full time criminal in the late 90s and early 2000s during a heist in ludendorff the united states michael and one of his partners in crime brad snider both were shot after fleeing the police brad didn t survive the shot but michael did michael made a deal with the fib to fake his own death during that time he tried to cut contacts with his other partner in crime trevor phillips which is are next character trevor phillips a close contact of michael desanta who in 9 years met new people in the outskirts of san andreas and founded his own company with ron jakowski called trevor philips enterprises an uprising drug smuggling company trying to get a bigger sponsor to make his company larger he is also a psychopath and he s talented in aiming and killing the story feels very good it all fits together nicely and in the singleplayer campaign you meet a lot of unique characteristics which you would never probably meet in real life the idea of having 3 protagonists is genius in my opinion mainly because you are able to see certain aspects in the game from different perspectives level designgta 5 s level design is of most rockstar s games linear and innovative in every mission you re given tasks which reap the main goal the recreation of los angeles is spot on having been in la i knew exactly where i was going most of the time some parts are of course fictional and don t exist in real life but it s executed so well that it might as well be in real life contentgrand theft auto 5 is a big game period it features over 60 innovative and diverse missions besides that there are a lot of little small quests that don t affect the main story the game took me over 40 hours to beat the first time and i enjoyed every single moment of it i ve even become fond of the mission fails controls and movementthe controls are fluid responsive and free movement by foot is a bit sluggish but that s to be expected because you have so many vehicles to chose from and walking is only used when necessary fun fact there are currently 464 vehicles in gta 5 including gta 5 online difficultythe difficulty of gta 5 missions isn t hard most missions are easy and are fun although saying that i can say i ve failed a mission more than 1000 times musicthe music in gta 5 is amazing for me it is up there with gta san andreas soundtrack the diversity of the radio stations is nice and it adds a bit of depth the main theme song for gta 5 is iconic it recreates la so well i can t describe it in words it s popularity shows that youtube video gta v welcome to los santos soundtrack intro

39905,2015 mine aint nothin special but it gets the job done trevorwhere to begin let s start out with the hype around this game while no game can truely live up to it all this game certainly comes close the single player sorry story mode is what you d expect from a gta game these days long fun and somewhat captivating there s some silly moments in it not quite san andreas level but pretty close that keeps the more boring bits interesting and some great chase scenes while i haven t even came close to completing the game at the time of this review i still feel the game was worth the 39 99 i payed now gta online oh boy it s hard to explain or even define but there s something about online that makes it addictive much like your skyrims you re constantly wanting to get better stuff be that cars boats helicopters jets weapons or clothes you re always after something new yes there are lobbies with much higher level players in there destroying us newer players but they re not that frequent even when in one you ll have some enjoyment getting your revenge or go into passive mode while i brought the game for the story mode i m finding myself focusing more on the online play there s some issues with lobbies randomly being emptied in short you are moved into your own empty lobby due to the rockstar servers claiming your rig or connection can t handle the current lobby but you can still join jobs with others no problem in short i d highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone it s great fun has humour and is excellent value for money,765.1,22.0,6,Recommended,"April 20, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"InsaneMatt

39913,2021 tldr if you re buying this game buy it for the story mode online isn t worth it pros good graphics decent performance story is fairly fun and varied has many in depth aspects character clothing customization vehicle customization businesses etc multiplayer is fun to an extent cons multiplayer plagued by cheaters playerbase highly toxic multiplayer poorly moderated in general if at all intransparent and insufficient rule enforcement requires you to be online to start the game even for story mode yet another game that force installs their own launcher for no reason horrible load times especially for multiplayer although they have improved multiplayer unstable in general random disconnects and crashes the pause menu is not easy to use with mouse keyboard and laggy,253.8,32.0,0,Not Recommended,"November 12, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,Saphir

39928,2022 i think grand theft auto v is already a timeless game despite almost 10 years in the market and it still impresses with its graphics great driving model frequent updates and many more i ve spent over 1000h in the game and there s still something to do about storymodei completed the whole story every story missions side missions and side activities in around 60h an interesting fact is gta v allows you to play as 3 characters during one play through as a young gangster franklin retired thief michael and psychopathic trevor an amazing combination that lets you play various missions and side activities aspecially designed for the character the story has wacky humor and engaging with a dramatic or very satisfying ending in addition there are many side activities that allow you to get even more involved in the gangster world i highly recommend this game about onlinealmost 95 of the game time i spent in online mode of the gta v gta online gta online allows you to play with your friends there are countless activities you can play solo or in co op as well as many different types of vehicles such as helicopters boats cars motorcycles etc which combined with the excellent arcade driving model creates an interesting alternative to other racing games such as nfss or grid by regular updates this game tries to keep your attention and engagement at the highest level possible,467.9,34.0,4,Recommended,"June 24, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,"Strzelec¬Æ

39938,2016 so when i bought this game on the xbox 360 at launch and then later pc at launch i loved this game until somehow at rockstar decided that the grind isnt hard already and make it even more harder for people to get new content oh let me release a new car that costs almost the retail price of this game if we look to ea s starwars game they got so many backlashes on the community but rockster is getting away with this i feel that rockster destroyed their own master piece after years if you look in a buisness way this is a great way for making an money printer also because servers are expensive but sadly i started to get fustraded and decided to glitching money in the game what ofcourse resulted to a ban and purging 3 4 years of gameplay sure this is my own fault but their anti cheat system is not perfect forexample i ve heard alot of storys that innocent people got banned and their account purged and customer support gave a big middle finger to you this did happen to some of my friends even cheaters have an way to get you banned and rockstar wipes your account so this is my honest review after rewriting it after a rage attack 2 years ago i still cannot recommend this game at all maybe the singleplayer content yes but online no stay far away from this game now even with the new free dlc it feels like they re no longer put much efford into the game sure its a 5 year old game but still rockstar trys you to milk you from your monney and i feel that gta online is there to milk you from money until you re bone dry oh dont let me started if you didnt bought for example an nightclub moterclub company etc if you dont you re getting constantly nagged with phonecalls you cannot deny that says that you need to buy one,236.3,57.0,2,Not Recommended,"December 21, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"Marf

39984,2017 i have now formally uninstalled gta v for a few reasons primarily i uninstalled the game due to the take two modding debacle currently ongoing this was the final culmination in the online section of the game which has been for a while a micro transaction hell hole of hackers cheaters and people with wallets so big they can afford the 100 needed to buy everything you could possibly want in a game you bought for 60 the micro transactions have now made the online near enough unplayable if you want to win races you need a car that can only really be gained by purchasing in game currency if not you have a very very long and repetitive grind ahead it s ridiculous if paying 60 for the game three times xbox 360 and one and for pc isn t giving the company enough money they ask for 50 every time you might fancy having a new appartment or clubhouse office or warehouse for the latest dlc packages which are now clearly for nothing other than financial gain i can not recommend buying the game if you want to play single player as a modded version and only play the online mode if you are either a stupidly wealthy or b lacking in anything else to do other than vegetate over a grind for not enough money to progress,269.7,50.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 16, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Das Fruddster

40026,2015 update rockstar and take two interactive have now officially established themselves as fundamental anti consumers v is one of the most profound and mind numbing examples on how you can take the most recognized video game franchise on earth and turn it into a cancerous clusterf ck of hideously moronic design decisions that have no equal in terms of the sheer stupidity and broken functionality that currently plagues this depressingly messed up title as the faults with this game are numerous and require their own individual attention i am simply going to list them one by one while providing proof of their existence 1 online functionality putting aside the current average load times of getting into the online game being 1 6 3 minutes for people with top tier gaming pc s that have ssd s the state of the gta servers as of right now are a horrendous mess as anyone that played the game on console or even watched videos of others doing so for more than 3 hours can attest to the problems from there has not been dealt with for the pc version disconnect after network failure after server outage after connection issues after time outs after server overloads rockstar continues their behavior of not knowing how to host proper servers even after delaying the pc release a multiple times for several months and perhaps more importantly giving out fat bonuses to people who pre order weeks before release to massively help them gain a better idea of the incoming traffic they still fail horrendously to offer any kind of steady service when the online aspect of the game is concerned it is however made much worse by how the multiplayer is constructed around clumsy lobby systems with zero flexibility go through the effort of creating a heist and wait for players to fill the lobby play 95 of the mission and have someone disconnect mission cancelled lobby closed down create a new game manually and wait for players to re join to start at square 1 again let someone join mid game to replace him pause the heist itself and give the disconnected player time to rejoin create an ai partner to take his place nope back to the 2 minute loading screens with you over and over and over again youtube video gta v pc vs xb1 loading times views 10 489 follow me link link link i livestream everyday follow me on my twitch tv channel 2 system functionality memory leaks physics glitches that causes crashes black screens fps spikes blue screens graphic driver crashes and cases of just plain bad optimization where laptops would have the game run off their integrated gpu s first before checking for any external ones gta v has them all and it is a very depressing fact to face after all those months upon months of waiting for the game to be and i quote as polished as possible cheaters on both offline and online the number of cheaters have been routinely going up in terms of being spotted by the community and they show little to no signs of slowing down youtube video gta online this is a cheater views 15 484 also contains me getting rid of the money he dropped on me because no thanks watch live at due to the manner that rockstar handles hackers by slowly detecting them and putting them in queue to only be in games with other cheaters they can cause massive amounts of havoc most of which end up being beyond repair and going outside the control of rockstar themselves due to the dynamic nature of the game the most acute symptom of this very serious issue is the server stability for where these hackers roam as seen in the video the hacker spammed ufo s and caused insane amounts of lag to happen due to flooding the host with collission data vehicle spawns and teleports while also flooding other players with money drops the much more chronic results are perhaps more damaging as money can trade hands in so many ways be it being dropped on the street have someone get mugged spend it on cars other items and re sell give them away the list goes on and most of these things rockstar can t reliably keep record of and this isn t even where the issues stop either there are also other more logistical things to keep track of for example they have to dedicate a number of their servers to actually put hackers on meaning they are redirecting company resources to let hackers roam around instead of focusing these efforts on contributing to a more positive experience for the non offending players even then hackers are allowed to purchase new accounts and keep on creating massive amounts of havoc as punishment is lingering at best and there are no immediate counter measures to deal with these situations 4 system design if you were to ask me what personally disgusts me the most about this game it has to be without the shadow of a doubt the bad sport system how does it work it bans you from the regular multiplayer including private sessions with your friends separating you from everyone else if you blow up other player s cars leave online games early or simply get reports sounds like a necessary thing on paper with gta being what it is but oh the cancer that can be find if you observe it more closely here are 4 scenarios where the game will punish you and cut out your ability to play online a defend yourself from someone trying to drive by you in an armored kuruma by blowing them up with a grenade you re a bad sport b stay afk in a tank or some other heavy vehicle and have people drive under you with their own cars and explode as a result you re a bad sport c have your game crash during a multiplayer session due to gta v s notorious memory leak you re a bad sport d own a couple of guys in fair death matches or similar over the thousands of hours you spent in gta v and have them spam reports against you with no legitimacy to them whatsoever you re a bad sport i thought this was a beta thing at first perhaps a myth or something exclusively on the console but one faithful day when i just finished a mission and was outside my apartment fiddling with my settings a guy rams into my car from behind using an armored kuruma and proceeds to try and mow me down with an smg i pull out a sticky bomb slap it onto his windshield drive away and proceed to detonate the bomb as he continues trying to kill me boom he dies along with his armored kuruma which is nigh impossible to only kill the players within using guns and you have been flagged as a bad sport bye bye playing with friends bye bye actual multiplayer as everyone who is a bad sport just waits their time out or jumps onto another account plays offline bye bye gta online as a whole the first ban you ll get will be 2 3 days 48 72 hours that cannot be reduced used to be possible by getting awards etc not anymore next one will be weeks then months then years and they will be that much more easy to get after your first one the timer can be extended if you continue being a bad sport by blowing up people s cars and it will very frequently get stuck as well sometimes even resetting if you do certain jobs missions or activities it is one of the most hated functions of gta v online and rockstar does absolutely nothing about it it is even a walking contradiction itself as the design goal of it is to dissuade people from doing and i quote here doing unsanctioned mayhem the problem here is that there is no system or detection method in place to even remotely determine if a certain mayhem was sanctioned or not in the game now rockstar have also recently broken the game even further with fps killing patches just ugh,471.8,625.0,70,Not

40027,2015 it s the good ol gta what could go wrong exactly noticereview is only for the solo mode not the online gameplay a good cover system realistic movement and more guns are solid as you bet they hit and boy do they hit good shooting from vehicle s has been improved on driving and physics isn t bad personally i like them gps and map has been very improved a i has been improved on vast they will even flip you off lol many activities to do on tennis strip club lol golf cenima hang out marathons race events hunting and alot more many side quests and random missions many online mode only vehicles can be purchased from the internet vehicle customization is top notch amazingly detailed from cars to bikes each story mission is replayable from start to finish first person view makes shooting easier no difficulty options i love it makes it so that everyone haves the same challenges cool transition between switching characters it always shows what they were doing a moment before frist person fov is changeable smooth animations alot improved many many vehicles weapons and much more it s just enjoyable fun and really just impressive at times some deaths feel very unrealistically cheap the game may punish you for using different tactics in missions not all missions where you can enable that first person collusion s can get odd and bugged at times many mission s have poor briefing introduction with little or no info no access to eating food except just sodas and liquids air craft controls are odd and unsatisfying the a i can get wierd and bugged at times where a teamate will just be circling around each time a mission starts it sets the currently equipped weapon to whatever it feels like to thus adding a bit o frustration all your clothing and eyeware gets reset each time you start the game thus requiring to change them every time story amazingly directed funny serious amusing at times overall a great story it just keeps you wanting to play immersion due to it being realistic on many points of society very just detailed behind each missions there are belieble reasons it gave me many emotions some sad at times to what the characters do but i believe this was done on purpose and they made it right it shed alot of light on our society great great dialogue and voice actinggraphics very detailed environments objects and much more best lens flare and sun i have seen great skybox just so pleasing to look at beautiful beautiful scenery water wave s are just done right the best wide scale of options biggest yet i have seen explosion effects and more have been improved on option for benchmark greatly optimized no fps drops smooth 60 fps textures on low look like really ass now it s on low of course but hey come on when the system requirements are decently high wouldn t you expect more better textures many updates do tend to bring many stutter and fps problems design menu is simple as it could be and responsive in game art works are fully macthing and gta style death screens and alot more have been improved on map design is actually great while many generic buildings but overall big and beautiful just not many interiors as you would expect only buildings where you can do a activity are open while all the others are just pure dead sounds ost all environmental and effects sounds are a job well done from guns to vehicles from walking to riding a bike you can listen to your own music sound track is overall just amazing it builds up the mood from boredness to just pure action many radio stations and funny commercials plus commentry in total many many radio songs a big variety and good to listen while many just bad songs some even just made me laugh overall thoughts and points sound overall just pleasing from guns to vehicles many variety in songs 16 stations and good commentary while many just bad songs some being even just laughable design great design overall from map to menu while just not many accessible interiors story just amazingly well directed funny serious sad at times and a a notice on many points of our society graphics amazingly detailed environment and a great skybox plus over all effects great port smooth while bad textures on low and bad fps due to some updates gameplay overall improved upon just every aspect and many new stuff most just welly executed while some little problems but nothing game breaking a bit just pure fun as always the game has many many graphic torture disturbing or even offensive scenes violence is in many amounts here due to many loads of realism from nudity to well alot more online mode has script kiddies problem syou can get banned even with having solo mods on online some users have reported crash to desktop and such issues rockstar social club is required and it is glitched as hell many issues you must have internet connection to even start the game just dont expect a completely different game cause it s really as gta has been but with a heck load of tweaks and overhauls conclusionjust buy it already man and stop looking at me face in all seriousness i fully recommend this game it is down right fully worth that 60 dollar just heck load of improvements and new stuff great execution solid gameplay good optimization and beautiful graphics and scenery and alot alot more while some problems but not game breaking at all

40035,2015 i can t recommend this right now because of the scummy business practices that rockstar are currently employing as you have probably read it is impossible to get a real discount on the game as they have decided to instead bunch it together with a shark card leaving the game with no real discount not only does mean that the game isn t really on a discount it also means that you probably won t be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it i preorded this game before it came out but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it i would probably wait until this is over hopefully rockstar will see how angry the steam community is about this and sort it out until then i would suggest waiting the game itself is enjoyable for the most however but i can t suggest it until rockstar sort this out,265.6,105.0,3,Not Recommended,"June 12, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,Signus
40039,2015 the game itself is a masterpiece every server seems to have someone modding though to make the experience cancerous though tbh they tend to kill everyone and make it look like other people are doing the modding so that they get banned sometimes they ll give you money which is good or bad depending on if you want to play legit or not the company itself y know it s cool that the dlc is free and everything however the game was much better optimized at release when gotten gains started it started causing many if not everyone performance issues also rockstar was originally banning people for using singleplayer mods which was a move by rockstar in fact i believe most negative reviews on this game is because people have been banned for using singleplayer mods such as the fov mod grand theft auto v itself is easily a 8 9 or even 10 10 game in most reviews the ai is amazing esspecially the cops in this game the visuals of this game are incredible it has a good story and unlike past grand theft autos three main characters each with there own unique personality the voice acting is great it has a good story and it s so fun to playthrough it however that s the game itself multiplayer lobbies as i said are trash with hackers and poor optimization most of the games community is very aggresive and modders hackers everywhere the fun in missions heists races etc can easily be spoiled in some way such as doing a heist and somebody decides to leave it s over the heist will end and you ll have to find someone else this game is very difficult for me to review because this is one of my favorite games it s just due to rockstar and some of the community to make the experience annoying i feel that because after everyone beats grand theft auto v and goes to gta online though i d have to give it a negative review considering that is what everyone is going to be doing aside from singleplayer modding or whatever they ll be doing so negative review from me,575.7,30.0,2,Not Recommended,"August 22, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Gaberini

40052,2023 predatory business i love this game from the bottom of my heart and have played for almost a decade with thousands of hours across consoles so it aches me to say this but they have just published an update that removed almost 200 vehicles worth of content from the game for no reason it was thinly veiled under an attempt to better the browsing experience however no changes to the browsing experience were made at all still no search bar still no filter by alphabet or vehicle class nothing the sad truth is likely they simply wanted to remove cheaper older vehicles to encourage purchasing of in game currency or to bring them back in a special manner where they can drip feed to create artificial demand increase old prices again potentially costing players more even worse is they could be added to the gta subscription thing for consoles which is disgusting and slightly pay to win in itself considering hsw this is unacceptable predatory towards their own fan base and downright atrocious behaviour from a game company please follow suit and leave a bad review of your own complain to rock themselves,469.0,18.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 19, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,"Bean

40058,2016 really wish there was a recommend but to keep it simple if you re buying it for single player go for it it s fun it s a good visually stunning well optimised gta game with a decent story and plenty to do i still find gta vc is better for setting soundtrack story and gta sa the most fun gameplay wise but that could just be nostalgia looks like the singleplayer expansion dlc is never coming large areas like the casino race track prison etc are all well modeled but they remain unused and inaccessable buying for multiplayer give it a miss as many have already said it s a total show online load times are absurdly long and frequent ui is crap theres no server browser and no modded server support the key element of the game it s the title for christ sake is stealing cars but guess what you cant keep them in online they must be purchased items worth having online require ridiculous amounts of grinding due to low rewards for missions and any new cars boats planes are added at extremely high prices to sell shark cards there isnt enough to do or enough fun to be had to justify the time required to buy said items without microtransactions the games anti cheat system is pretty much non existant cheaters hackers run rampant killing players and or spewing cash seems kind of baron of things to do online with friends once you ve completed the heists i really don t care about mp in a gta game a token mode allowing friends to jump in and do co op in single player would have been much better you already have 3 protagonists doing missions together i sincerely hope mp s influence is minimal on the development of future titles bully 2 gta vi rdr 3 but unfortunately that s highly unlikely,229.9,32.0,3,Not Recommended,"April 11, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,Hank

40067,2017 while single player mode is enjoyable multiplayer is plagued by rockstar s attempts to empty your wallet the methods to make money in multiplayer are tedious and not very rewarding for the work you do the worst thing about multiplayer is that they ve recently adopted some new terms for playing which basically say that they ll delete your multiplayer accounts without need for explanation which is basically what happened to me a few years worth of progress completely deleted with no explanation so yeah if you really want to play it then do so but don t buy any shark cards it isn t worth it and you can t get refunds for them either,441.6,125.0,1,Not Recommended,"February 21, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"D4RK1

40086,2018 first of all i m not new to this game so i would love to write a review as i ve played gta v on multiple platformsbut i do genuinely love this game i loved to play it on xbox with friends and it s just as fun now with even more stuff to do and more ways to earn money it just has great replay abilityunfortunately this game is really ruined when it comes to public lobbies being modded and when you come across cheaters it does ruin the experience for most new players but if you bypass all the modders and cheaters you can t really say much bad about this game as long as your with friends this game is a lot of fun but even without friends i ve come to realise that playing with randoms is just as fun definitely would recommend plus if you re into a grind type of game i would say this requires quite a bit of grind to get everything you want,201.2,23.0,4,Recommended,"August 21, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Dami

40087,2018 unlike the majority of the negative reviewers i bought gta v not gta online the game gta v is a lot of fun the world is big and colourful the characters are ok i really didn t care about any of their lives much and the story is enough to keep me going the radio is not as good as earlier ones too much stupid music not enough legitimately funny ads shows etc the tv was ok in this but kind of bland i play gta for the rpg experience of a deeply satirical and sarcastic world view of the one we live in and this one simply didn t deliver as before beautiful graphics fun to play it s worth the price especially on sale to obtain and enjoy gta v i can t review gta online because i didn t care about it i tried it didn t really enjoy the mini games and heists i think it s made for a niche crowd probably the kind who get aggressive over nothing hits on someone s sister coldly rebuffed which he deals with as an emotionally stunted individual then demands the blunt hurry up and be passed this person also vows that people on x box live will be dealt with in real life because they don t know him this person is probably also going to rage at me because i don t know how evil rockstar is for taking his money by making it hard to free play online but that s because i only gave them enough money to play the game i wanted gta v,108.8,92.0,25,Recommended,"March 22, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,a horrible doody

40097,2019 grand theft auto v is probably one of the greatest games i have ever played just due to all the fun i ve had on it whether it was on xbox or pc didn t even matter i always have fun playing it sure there is a lot of modders and tryhards who are out there to make things much harder but you can just leave or go passive then i will admit that something annoying about the game is the fact that it is very obviously a p2w type of situation especially with some of the cars and planes alongside other features like the orbital strike that demolishes whoever it hits the new casino update however is a very easy way to make those who don t want to pay for shark cards have a chance at getting rich one thing i found so much fun on the pc version is that you have access to singleplayer mods i m not talking mod menu wise i mean stuff like the zombie apocalypse mod or the superhero mods which are pretty fun to play around with overall though grand theft auto v is a masterpiece of a game and i hope that the next gta can be even better,209.4,35.0,7,Recommended,"July 31, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,EX0Enforcer

40107,2015 very fun game with a great an amazing gameplay pretty decent missions and length graphics stepped up and the story was great and enjoyable but in my opinion it could have been improved the charactes are well made and the story of each of them is well written small things are important and gta 5 has a lot of them and you are not getting bored that fast a lot of mini games and missions to play alone or also with friends one of the better things are the heists you need to cooperate with your mates to succeed gta 5 has also a beautiful expertly realised open world who despite appearances isn t that small at all a lot of things to do and areas to explore one of the things that annoys you in gta 5 is the amount of hackers you have to face every day in most encountered sessions but at the end of the day you can live with that pros fun enjoyable and well written story a lot of missions to play either with friends or alone beautiful graphics gorgeous open world heists good customization for cars characters are awesome impressive degree of freedom first person camera cons not that great mm large number of hackers character customization could be better not enough choices that affect the gameplay further on the story mode in few words gta 5 it s an amazing and fun game without doubt it s like a next gen remaster of what we have experienced and played so far you can spend a large amount of hours playing with friends and you still will find new things to do every day it begs to be played all over again especially when you have company it s a must for everyone to try out those who didn t play that masterpiece yet they definitely should i recommend this game to anyone without remorse cheers,177.9,23.0,22,Recommended,"December 5, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Baliks

40128,2017 i like this game i like to load up gta o and cruise around do the occasional mission and on the blue moon where three of my buddies are also on maybe we will do some missions i can t recommend this game because it s rockstar s magnum opus ii it is them telling everybody exactly how they will develop their future projects there was no single player expansions there was no addition of new towns or map changes there are barely no interiors or fast food i believe this game might have as many in door areas as gta 2 a top down isometric game which almost entirely due to the perspective takes place outside on the streets its comedy was already dated when it came out it felt much like rockstar as a company old and tired rockstar stripped everything out of max payne 3 which made it max payne an intriguing story good characters dark comedy and a very dark satire on film noir similarly with their own ip rockstar has managed to strip out of gta what made it fun shark cards are disgusting lack of sp additions and updates are appaling load times server latency etc are so awful that you ll spend as much time loading as you are playing i am also playing this with a 1070gtx at only 1080p so it is not an issue of poor hardware every weapon in a category feels the same and the ones that feel unique only do so because of how stupidly underpowered and weak they are rewards for completing heists jobs etc are not scaled to the new content there have been no new heist missions or series since its initial heist update this game upon its release was shabby and i was eager to give it lots of breathing time to update and polish after a couple of years now it s clear rockstar decided to take a very poor direction this game is anti consumer,423.2,20.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 18, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Kwisatz Quakerach
40129,2015 coming from someone who has played the pc port of gta iv believe me this is a great port for the next instalment the price is still pretty expensive and i would recommend buying it when it drops lower unless you can t wait to hijack a military jet or you are a hardcore gta fan i would also suggest playing this with a gamepad instead of a mouse except in some instances of shooting in moving vehicles ok now time for the pros and cons pros good balance in gameplay time and character development between the 3 characters graphics is very good and i would strongly recommend playing it at at least high settings try limiting the drop to normal settings as it can really make a whole lot of difference story is great and interesting except for a few loophole plots nonetheless it really got my attention most of the time and future dlcs will definitely make it better voice acting is superb i love the voice casts in this they really suit their own characters bravo r director mode is pretty fun its a pc exclusive and it enables the players to create their own settings there are limitations though such as dialogues etc and place characters that can be unlocked during story mode i usually use it to wreck havoc in the game lolcons online as with many others i find it hard to play an online mission without meeting someone who uses cheat sometimes you will spend so much time looking for a party to play in and the missions ends in a blink of an eye garage bug yup i am one of the many victims who lost their heavily upgraded vehicles in their own garage after exiting the game it doesn t happen all the time but you do get the fear of when this bug will strike next on your beloved carsall in all this game is still great on its own i would suggest gta fans to get this for neutrals maybe get at a lower price,153.5,25.0,2,Recommended,"June 20, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,Maverick

40143,2021 first the cheating aka modding is out of control in gta online modding goes way beyond spawning rare vehicles or even god mode due to the dated peer to peer connections used in online play modders are able to crash other players games rockstar seems unwilling or unable to fix this i can only recommend this game if you are solely interested in gta v story mode,537.6,27.0,0,Not Recommended,"March 6, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,Mike_Hancho
40144,2015 many people usually ask if gta v is worth it well if your pc is decent and you know for sure that your pc can handle this game then it s definetely worth it i started single player thought that this is great then i tried online before even getting 3rd character in sp and i don t want to go back to single player game anymore i can t comment about pros and cons but i personally think this game is worth the money to play online,149.6,26.0,3,Recommended,"April 18, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"lemonwave

40145,2020 has become the most boring tedious grind ever the sole purpose left is to sell shark cards to naiv players with decent pc hardware and a 100mbit connection the loading time and server stability is unacceptable from what i can tell you spent at least 25 of your time on stupid load screens which basically show adds for shark cards once you managed to join a lobby you ll usually find a a mix of people who should not engage in a pvp focused online game at all autoaim tryhards with all their noobbike deluxo cancer modders and cheaters good lord what happens here is mind numbing while other people pay real money for ingame cash a single lucky session with the right cheater can easily bring you the equivalent of a few hundret bucks and thats not even talking about the common unlock all offers and the over 9000 money glitches you can find on youtube this is straight up fraud to everyone who ever paid a single doller for ingame currency in this respect this is by far the worst i ve seen yet in the pay to win department try to start a new account from scratch no buying cards no using glitches no help from cheaters it s not fun it s an unplayable steaming pile of bu sh which everybody at rockstar should be ashame of nohopeforgta6,277.2,52.0,5,Not Recommended,"June 7, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"Toni

40154,2017 wouldn t recommend simply due to the fact take two has sent a cease and desist to openiv one of the most important mods for gta v one of the main reasons for buying gta v on pc is now gone on june 5th 2017 we had received an official cease and desist letter it clearly says that with openiv we allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation take two s rights yes this letter is illiterate both technically and grammatically really they don t even bothered with proof reading the text yes we can go to court and yet again prove that modding is fair use and our actions are legal yes we could but we decided not to going to court will take at least few months of our time and huge amount of efforts and at best we ll get absolutely nothing spending time just to restore status quo is really unproductive and all the money in the world can t compensate the loss of time so we decided to agree with their claims and we re stopping distribution of openiv it was a hard decision but when any modding activity has been declared illegal we can t see any possibilities to continue this process unless top management of take two company makes an official statement about modding which can be used in court probably due to the fact that singleplayer is better than online and take two want to push people to online to they can sell their microtransactions so them,121.9,16.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 15, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Gorgeous Freeman

40176,2016 gta v is a massive game massive budget massive open world massive replay ability and massively terrible devs pr singleplayer is fun and probably worth buying all on its own although chances are the real reason you re looking at this game is for gta online do not buy this game solely for the online play in game currency is unreliable and disappears at random bans are handed out to innocent players while game ruining hackers run rampant the servers still feel like a day one release with extremely long loading screens rockstar has some of the worst customer support ever and they use scummy business practices like claiming the game is on sale shortly after artificially inflating the price gta online is a whole new format of pay2win even moderately decent guns and vehicles are reserved for people who hack or use their mother s credit card to buy in game currency to achieve anything legit without spending a fortune you ll have to waste enough hours grinding repetitive races and linear heists to make a mmo player squeamish i ve had tons of fun playing with friends and the single player experience is one of the best i ve ever seen just know what you re getting into before handing your money over to these scumbags for the record i m not salty over a ban or anything i ve had innocent friends get banned unpleasant run ins with rockstar support and one instance where all of my in game money vanished without a trace but this review isn t the result of anything recent or sudden rockstar just sucks in general,257.9,94.0,4,Not Recommended,"September 23, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"MuffinMare

40188,2017 grand theft auto 5 in my opinion is the best open world game ever made just cause 3 is a close second i think the gta series as a whole is fantastic but i have to give this game a negative review for the following reasons 1 the online mode is a micro transaction hell but if you avoid paying for anything with real money online is still very fun for doing races stunt races and heists with friends 2 rockstar did a great job making the pc port of this game but any issues that alot of people are still having have never been fixed since day 1 they really don t give a about fixing the technical problems for pc 3 taketwo interactive the company that owns rockstar has sent a cease desist to the creators of openiv the backbone for modding in gta v and gta iv so if you re looking to mod the singleplayer you re basically out of luck unless you already have it see this video for more information youtube video nerd breaking news rip gta mods 1997 2017 views 398 735 an extra point to add that i forgot to mention is that of course this letter may be a fake however coming from the recent statements of take two ceo which jim sterling covers over here 4 there have been an increasing number of people getting banned in online for no reason whatsoever and when you get banned from online that s it there s like a 0 01 chance you ll get unbannedi personally don t really care for mods apart from the mods that improve the graphics but until the state of modding the single player is back to normal i cannot reccomend this game in the slightest,279.1,68.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 15, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Puppet

40205,2017 this game is great there s a reason why it s one of the best selling games on earth there s really nothing else like this and anything that is like this will never live up to this a lot of people on steam are whiny entitled babies here s a few things i d like to debunk from playing this game for 500 hours 1 hackers are common ones are rare it happens if you don t enjoy it just switch sessions or play jobs i literally never see any hackers when i am out doing races deathmatches survivals etc they all frolic in free mode 2 anyone down here crying that they were banned for literally no reason saying i ground so hard for all that money is probably lying trying to get un banned for their stupid ass cheating i ve played this game for years and really the only way to get banned is dropping money for yourself others or getting so many reports that rockstar actually does something about it i have been friends with countless modders and hackers and they are pretty power drunk people most of the time if i m honest but sometimes they can make the session better if you re not a baby if you start telling modders to off and that you re reporting them they are going to ruin your fun if you don t like it that much find a new session easy as pause online find new session or easy as one two three 3 you can legitimately afford the stuff rockstar markets you want a luxor delux buy a hangar buy regular luxor paint it gold badda bing badda boom back in my days on ps3 i could probably make 200 grand a night grinding missions all you need to get started is to buy a bunker i say the bunker because you don t need to also buy a warehouse like the ceo offices normally people don t mess with gunrinning shipments 90 of the time they destroy your stuff it s just for the sake of destroying your stuff to piss you off because people are like that whenever you want to sell mass amounts of goods you re gonna need a few friends and there s plenty of guides on how to get a solo public session you can just invite your friends back to then sell your stuff before anyone joins 4 there s a lot to do in this game i find myself patrolling free mode basically allll the time and i have personally gotten bored doing it many people do this and then get mad that they can t go inside perticular buildings and do this and that and give it a review me and my friend were bored in free roam one time and i asked him if he wanted to play from versus missions and races and stuff so we went and tried it out and we actually had a lot of fun the rockstar created job lists are massive and there s even a creator to make your own stuff which i have utilized many a times over the years 5 you don t need to buy everything that isn t the goal to say there s an end goal to gta online would be like saying there s a specific end goal for everyone in life after you reach the max level 120 you just keep leveling i am like level probably 230 something now i have everything i could ever want in gta online however i find myself never using a lot of it some things are annoying to not have in gta online like a lot of guns ammo i have all the guns and tons of ammo for them all and i sort of feel very vaulnerable when i play on my alternate character which is only like level 70 back when he was level 20 it was hard fending off rocket spamming 3 kdr players that stat pat gta is just basically an open world crime game where the only objective is gaining a higher net worth 6 if you like cars it s a pretty good game open world you re not limited to sports race cars like some racing games if you like pickup trucks or suv s there s plenty of those for you to own you can own up to 120 some cars and you have the freedom to do with them as you wish be it racing drifting or wrap the son of around a tree you do you man but as a car enthusiast gta v is my favorite game the guns and the planes and the boats and everything else is just a huge bonus when i don t feel like doing car stuff 7 the developers are active they kind of have to be though so it s not a surprise but i find a lot of good games on steam develop very slowly and updates are few and far between but rockstar keeps it pretty up to date with new content although it would be nice to see that content in singleplayer like you guys used to cough and uh singleplayer god it s been years since i played the story but it s good that s what all the hype and all the love came from in the first place and we can t forget what a great game this was when it was released it was the benchmark for computer performance can i run gta v gta v budget pc builds this is really a classic game that i believe lived up and beyond it s predisessors and don t give me that oh but gta iv had better ai and better car damage and it was more realistic because yes gta iv did have some details left out from gta v but overall this really didn t ruin the game and probably wasn t even noticed by most people until that guy on youtube made that gta iv is better than gta v video which has 10 million views and people are making reaction videos to it but i can understand that they basically re made the game from scratch unlike the saints row transition from iii to iv if you re going to copy and paste a game i am going to be upset that you removed details but if you re make the game from scratch and it s bigger better i can ignore some missing details like how pedestrians stumble when they re pushed everyone is comparing their experince to value i don t care about the money if i enjoyed this if i randomly get banned i d buy it again honestly rockstar has a lot on their hands to turn heads with gta vi and honestly i expect a heatwave similar to call of duty advanced warfare upon it s trailer release because pc gamers are spoiled and hop on mob mentality band wagons like bad dragon products for example when they banished openiv there was an influx of over 40 000 negative reviews in like 3 days people just came to on gta v and rockstar because everyone else was doing it and it was cool if you ask me hackers make the game more fun in online you really just have to be creative before you leave a negative review think about if this is a game you d really enjoy in the first place because it s not just a shooter you wanna play gta v multiplayer with mods online get fivem it s great and probably exactly what you want,815.5,107.0,10,Recommended,"November 9, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"üñ§ùîäùîíùîó‚Ñåüñ§

40218,2018 it happened i ve heard stories of people getting banned from gta online for seemingly no reason but i never ever thought i d ever be subject to this treatment been playing since i got the big collectors edition for the ps3 before heists were even released eventually i transferred my character over to the pc once i had managed to build one for years i ve been playing this game on and off and never even once have i accepted help from any hackers or modders never even once have i used any hacks or mods whether it s in singleplayer or multiplayer but today i got my account suspended and while i ll be able to play again in a month it won t be worth it as my characters progress inventory and property will all have been reset for absolutely no reason i have submitted a ticket to rockstar support surrounding this issue but i doubt it ll show any form of results if their support would manage to sort this out i ll edit this review hell i d recommend this game with a word of warning beware the incompetence of the ones in charge here tl dr don t buy this game if you plan on playing online not even legitimate play goes unpunished edit despite having been unbanned as rockstar indeed did realise they had made a mistake i ll leave this as a negative review due to the absolutely toxic playerbase which you can see below in my comment section,872.7,86.0,3,Not Recommended,"March 24, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Zip Zoobity Zoop!

40224,2018 story mode great multiplayer where to begin loading screensgta online is loading screen s hell not short ones also and u constantly wonder if u gonna stuck in loading screen connection problemsjust when u start enjoying the game u face several connection problems u either get disconnected from online or everyone else leaves your session and when this happenes during a mission it drives you mad u open your ports set firewall rules etc still no solution cheatersu encounter cheaters almost everyday it s not unsuai to have cheaters in online games but even a level 1 000 guy cheats he would not risk his buildup character if rockstar was really capable of prevent cheating right bad communityit all depends on who you meet 95 of high level players are toxic they just wanna show off to newcomers but when u meet some nice ppl it s delightful everyone left the session during a fun time then stuck in loading screen just closed the game and writing this review this might give u my point stay way from gta online unless you join with your friends and have nerves,515.4,20.0,2,Not Recommended,"January 29, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"Berkin

40226,2021 gta5 itself is okay gta online is designed specifically to be not quite fun you ll have fun but the game will seemingly trip itself up at every opportunity to make itself less fun with the aid of players who can and will constantly kill you or attempt to if you respawn next to someone and they kill you they can continue to kill you indefinitely as the game will strive to spawn you as close to where you died as possible which also means right next to the person who killed you who is probably looking at the area you ll spawn in and in cover while you spawn out in the open with no cover and likely facing away from the person killing you that is just one of the many ways gta online is not quite fun,340.2,46.0,2,Not Recommended,"July 4, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"The Napper

40227,2017 gta 5 has got to be one of my favorite games of the past few years i could care less about the stupid shark cards however what really has me writing a negative review is the recent action take two interactive rockstar s parent company has taken against mods open iv was something i came across fairly recently and i must say it is an excellent fix to getting around the hard to get files from gta s core game one thing to note is that many single player mods from which i have used specifically don t let the user boot into their online persona thus returning the player back to story mode i have to admit that i ve had trouble with r in the past but they should definitly take a second thought about take two and where it ll land their personal reputation thanks for taking the time to read this m9 and like a shark i think this whole thing is a bad idea and for that reason i m out update thank you r for slobbing on that windows knob,286.7,24.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 23, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,TheHaterNaderCrusader

40236,2016 updated review with so many more hours this game deserves another review oh boy where to begin i wish rockstar would ve stopped developing their game after last review but sadly they ve added more content that speaks to me they really hate their own game and how so your average opponent online is using flying cars and scooters with infinite homing rockets the cheaters are also still part of the content and it s a bit funny that they are no longer the biggest problem recent popular cheats include occasionally everyone in a session getting teleported to a random players house where they blow up the street is covered with random game models or a player with level 8000 that doesn t take any damage spawn kills you repeatedly until you quit the game because passive mode does nothing with them which is of course great fun i have to say if you are planning to coop all the online heists with your friends don t with casino heist you are forced to play prep missions in an online session just so that you can experience the great homing rockets that annihilate that garbage truck you need to slowly drive from point a to b the amount of underestimation of players is also amazing casino heist starts by you driving all they way to the opposite side of the map and once you get there the objective was stolen and you have to drive all the way back to where you started from the money grind in online is also so disgustingly slow that you probably have more fun just taking extra hours at work instead the grind is also balanced like so a daily random wheel of fortune can give you more money than grinding 3 hours of activities where other players can blow you up and you then earn nothing rockstar has also made it very clear that grind is all an online game should be until they find that point where they could get you spend more actual money on shark cards don t waste your time play something else don t buy the next online old review gta v is a solid single player experience and i have had lots of fun in both single player and multiplayer but today i cannot recommend it to anyone if they are planning to play multiplayer when it comes to multiplayer rockstars ability to create working multiplayer systems is very amateurish i tolerated the bad net code and awful connect logics just because the content of the game was awesome with the free dlc updates it could be even better could be recently the amount of cheaters online makes it downright unplayable be warned they do not cheat to get money or items they use whatever they can to ruin your online session rockstar has clearly shown what the companys view is on the subject of this trolling they dont care as long as they still make money its all fine next time rockstar publishes a game its your turn to show how much you care if you do buy this game make sure you have friends who play it and never ever stay in open sessions longer than you have to use private sessions and play coop with your friends,793.2,22.0,2,Not Recommended,"January 19, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,LeoLiuos

40249,2018 i have had this game for a long time now and due to recent events in gta online i have decided to finally write a review after some 250 hours of gameplay spanning several years i was as many others have been struck wrongly by the fateful hand of one of rockstars banning sweeps i recieved thankfully only a temporary suspention from gta online however what was more infuriating was that my gta online character something that i have probably spent the best part of 200 hours or more playing was to be reset completely these online bans or suspentions may not be appeald so if like myself you are wrongfully banned you do not even get the chance to fight your corner their decision is final however wrong it may be it is for this reason the fact that i will no longer be able to play my well worked gta online character that i can no longer reccomend this game purchace at your own risk,293.4,27.0,2,Not Recommended,"July 18, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,"not__stealthy

40264,2015 this game is great until you go to play online it takes waaay to long to load online close to 5 minutes on a high end pc like mine and once you get there it is miserable to play nearly every session i have joined the past 2 weeks has at least one hacker either giving everyone money or just running around with invincibility killing everyone what finally pushed me over the edge is when i was playing online with a friend doing our own thing and then all of a sudden everyone on the server dies because they are crushed by falling rocks then there is a clone of the character stuck to my body and even after killing it and myself it just stayed it only gets worse my friend and i didn t mind it to much and it was a bit comical at times but then we are all killed again except this time blown up which destroyed my car that i had to make the claim on and drained all cash and removed all guns about 30 seconds after that it was flooded literally i did what a responsible person would do and reported the hacker as i have to most of the other hackers that i pass by and what does rockstar do nothing absolutely ing nothing to the point where i saw the same hacker a week later doing the same thing in a different server it has gotten to the point where i don t even bother playing online anymore because you simply can t tl dr version rockstar needs to get it together with banning hackers and until then do not buy this game if you plan on playing online or it will be miserable for you,604.1,206.0,0,Not Recommended,"May 31, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Tactical Hotdog

40266,2023 as an avid player and longtime fan of gta this hurts the game undoubtedly offers an immersive open world experience i can t help but feel dismayed by the sheer number of vehicles that have been locked behind paywalls this decision seems to prioritize monetization over the enjoyment of the players leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of players like myself a staggering number of cars motorcycles planes and other vehicles were made only accessible through a paid subscription it felt like a slap in the face to realize that the game s true potential was held hostage behind a paywall forcing players to open their wallets wide those who are unwilling or unable to spend extra money on in game purchases find themselves at a disadvantage unable to access the same level of content as their paying counterparts this creates an unfair imbalance and fosters a sense of exclusion among players ultimately damaging the overall gaming experience,508.2,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 16, 2023",Grand Theft Auto V,"CRY

40273,2018 this game is so much fun on the single player mode however on the online mode you d think you will enjoy gaming with the comunity and making friends etc but that s not the case this is a negative review so here are the negative things i really hate about gta online 1 you cant add players from the session through steam like you could do on say tf2 or counter strike you have to add them on social club and text them through there and hope they actually see it its bull crap 2 rockstar made gta online for hackers and cheaters to be born the game is not for the average player i have been playing gta online for about 2 weeks now and i was offered free money like ten times already and i declined cuz i enjoyed making my way to the top but now that i realized that i m just grinding money doing brainless joyless work over and over and over for little money i actually concidered accepting the hacked money late at night when i was on the helicopter flying for the 10th time to get supplies for my bunker i didnt get any hacked money btw yet and this is just my second week playing the game i totally get why people cheat and use hacks its makes 100 sense i d be surprised if people didnt 3 you will spend most of your time on loading screens than playing the game online you will crash alot due to connection loss or screen freezes which is something you wont experience on any other game screen freezes for a couple seconds and you re out of the session or heist or whatever so if you have blood pressure problems stay away from gta online 4 public sessions are toxic people will kill you they will destroy your supplies they will go out of their way to piss you off and make things even harder for you bottom line if you are buying the game in hope for a nice online experience i would strongly recommand you dont buy it you wont be missing out on anything on the contrary you will dodge so much headache and fraustration well done greedy r,368.8,28.0,2,Not Recommended,"December 25, 2018",Grand Theft Auto V,.Moldy Lunch Box

40356,2020 i really wished there was a neutral review option since that s my review atmbasically speaking my review is going to be focusing on gta online instead of the singleplayer so look away if that s what you re more interested ingta online is fun don t get me wrong with randoms it can be a bit bad and hectic but if you have some friends to play with or with people you know it can be an absolutely fun experience either doing jobs together or just doing random stuff in free roam as a groupfun is a good big part of the positives but now i m going to share the two major downsides it has1 the grind is obnoxiously hard and rough if you want to get basically anything you have to basically play jobs events constantly to even get to an acceptable enough level where you unlock enough stuff and the second part just makes it worse2 the networking is absolutely horrible sure you can go say your internet is just trash but that wouldn t be much of an issue if gta online didn t use a horrible peer to peer system where it relies on everyone s connection to work properly instead of needing per user connection like a regular dedicated server this causes massive issues with gta online when you re trying to load connect to anything and it wouldn t be so bad if the actual rockstar servers would actually be stable and not constantly make it so you can sometimes can t buy anything due to connection issues,499.1,17.0,1,Not Recommended,"April 12, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"Dewa

40359,2015 don t buy this game until rockstar gets off their asses and fixes the ridiculous amount of bugs they still haven t touched since launch the game takes 12 hours to download on a good machine and crashes ten or twenty minutes for no reason the online mode is full of hackers who kill everyone repeatedly and will even try to get you banned from the game by spawning you money i don t have access to half of the map because the game will crash if you drive too far north don t bother reporting any bugs to rockstar they have some of the worst customer service i ve ever seen take the crashes for example i ve seen hundreds of posts about this problem and rockstar either ignores them or tells the poster to buy a better computer this is obviously a huge problem that happens to many players and rockstar hasn t even touched it yet don t get me wrong this is a good game when it works a really good game but the fact that rockstar has ignored so many game breaking issues experienced by such a huge portion of their fanbase makes me think that rockstar just doesn t give two by the way nice thing you pulled with the summer sale rockstar,244.5,166.0,4,Not Recommended,"June 11, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,Cake64

40364,2017 i ve always loved the grand theft auto series but this thing they got going with gta v has got to stop singleplayer has been completely neglected while online is getting turned into a hacker infested pay to win game why well here s why everything is expensive while every job gives you nothing but still take two recently said they weren t getting enough money out of their players you re actually able to see how some of the first cars introduced where at a fair price you can then go look at the recent dlc s and see a price of 10x the first vehicles hackers are everywhere and none are really getting detected and banned atleast not enough for the game to be playable without hackers everywhere they recently banned modding in singleplayer in hopes of making sp players go to mp instead allegedly it was to stop hackers in mp even though this ain t how it works so now the only thing that s getting updated with new stuff is the mp part some of all the stuff you can do to make money can t be done without being in a session with other players which means you re kinda forced to be with hackers and rich people with big jets casual players like me stands no chance against that russians loading screens are waaay too long it s time to stop being greedy you re destroying the title along with rockstar games i hate you take two,352.6,35.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 18, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Stenmann

40589,2016 while single player is masterfully tailored for an immersive and entertaining experience albeit somewhat brief i find myself unable to give the game a thumbs up unfortunately cons outweigh pros generally speaking loading times in gta online are outrageous i find myself spending far more time staring at loading screens than actually playing the game sadly this isn t an overstatement you will actually spend more time twiddling your thumbs in lobbies and in front of loading screens waiting for sessions to find players and maps to load you ll also be frequently confronted by cheaters i have witnessed players using godmode spawning all weapons giving me all weapons shooting money at me spawning mountain lions on top of me spawning tanks everywhere spawning police with rocket launchers monkeys and pigs driving cars ufo s rammed into the road a mannequin prop positioned on top of my head etc etc simply allow your imagination to go rampant don t even get me started on heists you ll find trolls people bailing mid game commiting suicide blowing up objectives etc this simply leads to frustration and needless to say a never ending chain of lobby load screens which will inevitably lead you to give this game the finger at least as far as online goes if you don t hate yourself just stick to story mode and try to appreciate the steps tecnology has taken within the gaming world you might think a downvote isn t warranted in this case well frankly i don t care what you think with the money the have they could and had to have done better,368.4,38.0,4,Not Recommended,"February 3, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,Zeb89

40774,2015 sandbox game with a take it or leave it storyline and lots of city to explore it departed from the locked areas of the map that that previous games had everything is explorable from the minute you are able to walk the streets the storyline is very impressive you have three very distinct personalities involved in the form of trevor a sociopath with anger issuesmichael the professional bank robber with family issuesfranklin the illiterate gang banger trying to make it biggreat visuals and graphics if your rig can handle it there were some folks having issues along with butter smooth gameplay and 60 fps throughout the entire game again depends on your rig of course sound the usual station selections are here along with some new ones the absence of the funny commercials is really obvious to me but i actually liked them gameplay the only issue i can say i had with the gameplay was the fact that the driving engine still needs some work it s worlds better than gta iv but still nothing compared to the sr series sometimes you hit a curb and keep your grip othertimes you hit the same curb and end up getting rolled 20 times there doesn t seem to be much consistency with it shooting it s not what i would say tight unless you re using the mouse and keyboard i found it to be very forgiving as far as distance shots and headshots probably to compensate for the fact that most people use a gamepad for a game like this some cons in a game that revolves around driving you d think there would be an easier way to get your cars or at least be able to use them but if you do any mission that you drove up to in your custom vehicle it s gone it might some of the time end up in the impound but about half the time it s just plain gone the only real vehicle you have that is consistent is the default one so don t waste your money at the beginning of the game souping up an infernus you jacked there s really no point even when you get a place to store your vehicles you still have to take a cab to get them out of the garage and if you lose it in the water or get it blown up it s gone for good also the other thing i didn t quite understand was the fact that the hang out function of the game seemed to be just thrown together and didn t really have a purpose nor does it integrate into the storyline i was at a portion of the game where michael and trevor hated each other one of the many and yet i called him to hang out and took him to a bar played tennis etc and they acted like best buddies all in all it s a good game i wouldn t say there is lots to do beyond the main missions the focus seems to be just getting through the game and then trying out the online version of the game there aren t even any end game unlocks or interesting things to do beyond one mission for trevor so i d give it 9 10 for the game overall9 5 10 for the graphics and attention to detail for small things you may never notice but do appreciate when you see them and once you win the game for the first time you owe it to yourself to replay the first few missions to see how the three of them had their stories intertwined even before you really knew who they were,65.9,71.0,5,Recommended,"May 6, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"Bacon Overlord¬Æ

40802,2015 welcome to 2015 where cops just spawn in front of you from thin air first of all i enjoyed the game both single and online but there are just some so dumb things in the game that makes me so sad it could ve been a so much better experience with more caring about the little things nice delays tho cons online p2p servers in itself it wouldn t be a problem but for some reason me and my buddies always get thrown in a horribly lagging session with a guy being host with horrible connection the cop system is extremly dumb just randomly appear in the nowhere i was in front of a mountain then i saw a cop just spawn there and continue to chase me aight a one star chase can be longer then a five star one that s pretty legit you get banned for using mods any mods basically fov adjuster because you can set your fov to 70 75 at max that s you get banned if you use mods single or online so there goes that because of p2p servers most of the times you can empty a magazine into a person and take a whole zero damage and then all you can see is he hits you once and you re dead basically until the mod ban thing there were no anti cheat system because of p2p servers sometimes mechanic doesn t seem to care about you shatting on your head even if he had his payment singleplayer i feel like the graphics options on itself is useless just like in watch dogs i get the same fps on 800x600 lowest settings then on 1920x1080 everything high how is that possible even the vehicles you buy you have to take care of them otherwise you just lose them afaik there s no option like online to get it back sadly sometimes random events one npc stole money from another etc are just straight up not working you return the stuff the npc that got robbed just despawns though it s rare cons that are common in both single and online you can t aim straight up that is really dumb the fps mode because of the low fov can easily cause motion sickness first game that caused me motion sickness in 10 years that i played on the other hand pros online fun online if you re getting paired with a good host different races land bike sea plane theft protection and insurance this is what the singplayer is missing if your vehicle gets destroyed you can just call mmi and they ll provide you with the same car usually other players blow up your car in that case if it has both protection and insurance they ll pay some money 1 of the car s price and you can call mmi to get it back free mechanic brings you a selected car from your garage if you give him a call and decides to not be lazy pretty neat character creation you can create unique characters with it payout is quite good for the effort reward system heists are fun with pretty good payout depending on difficulty and on host how he sets the payout on the last day of the heist in heists it gives you the feel that everyone is equally needed if you have no team lives left and someone dies the three can t clutch it because the heist will fail single loveable characters hateable kids i m looking at you jimmy the story mode is pretty fun it has it s own moments you can chose out of a three possible ending two of them affects the endgame assasination missions with franklin let s you play stock market in your favour it is quite op actually but hey it s single so it could be either con or pro depending on which side of you are the autosave function in missions are quite casual friendly usually if you do something in a mission and you happen to die or fail with the objective you ll be booted back to that part or a bit earlier after you done the main story there s still a lot stuff to do if you haven t done it while playing the story already and have chosen the third option as of the ending mission if i were to press myself i could still write a lot to the pro con side i think they even themselves out though the fov and the cop system is a really big downer overall i d say i m recommending the game and at the same time not it s fun but it has a dark side that can really screw you over if you d just like to hop in and play a few contact missions or heists for tl dr people buy this game at your own risk don t expect high quality online servers it s fun if you get lucky with a host isn t worth 60 euros in my eyes though as of being already an almost 2 years old game and it s painfully obvious flaws cheers,143.0,20.0,0,Not Recommended,"May 4, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,awn.

40856,2021 when gta v came out i had heard that although rockstar refused to fix all the issues with gta iv their mistake which everyone had been complaining about effectively tarnishing the entire series they had instead had focussed on making gta v better by by bringing back some of the fun while retaining the storyline aspects of gta iv sounded great so when i was given gta v as a xmas present i immediately started downloading it and started playing six weeks later after it had finished the download at 1 megabit a week after that i d given up the beginning of gta v feels similar to gta iv unlikeable protagonist living with relative giant city with nothing to do no rampages rubbish cars everything too expensive and grind grind grind grind grind the first 20 to 40 hours of gta v are painful to go through scarred with fun parts the cutscenes are droll and sometimes downright funny but the missions pay squat you ve no idea where you re going and you just seem to be spending your time following the gps doing odd jobs for nobodies there s very little boosting cars for profit no cool rampages to get points and perks just plod plod plod if you go into a shop you can barely afford the cheapest clothes and don t even start with trying to beef up your car 30 or so hours later having just transferred to the second main character who also seemed unlikeable and living in a horrid situation i gave up it really annoyed me that even though i had some money the ammu nations still had no good weapons and armour was obscenely expensive making me either penniless or fragile some jobs were very irritating to perform because of the difficulty plus i just seemed to be spending my time driving for 20 minutes to get to one side of the island to spend 20 minutes driving back with zero other things inbetween than listening to the radio a few years later i realised over 70 gigs of my expensive raid1 hard drive was being taken up by this game i wasn t playing so decided to go back to it and give it one more try so i did i explored the city still no rampages very little fun to do random encounters were disappointingly few and far between no hare krishnas to run over just more plodding low paying jobs and then trevor happened i hated trevor he was vile and everything i disliked about redneck life slowly i thought that he had some good points to make those crazy anti establishment anti society rants of his those offhand comments those crass little expletives all started to make sense and i started to i hate to say understand him the backstory all slotted together the way michael is the way trevor is it all made sense trevor s unhinged because of what he s been through underneath it is a genius who just doesn t care any more he s already dead in his own head and just waiting for biology to catch up ranting and railing at society disaffected and disenfranchised by his own criminal actions being the ultimate a hole but at no point in the game does anything he do turn out badly he finds love of a sort he finds riches he finds a new home he runs a business he can travel anywhere and do anything staying literally and metaphorically under the radar no spoilers he knows precisely how to game the system to stay outside of society and be overlooked ignored nobody wants to be him or be with him everyone just wants him to go away and the only people other than michael who realise how dangerous he is are the fib agents aware of his existence i must say that trevor is the disgusting sh t covered p ss stained foul smelling hairy redneck jewel in this game michael and franklin are extremely stereotypical and provide a great counterbalance to him but in the same way billy bob thornton s character in bad santa is a clever but heinous person so is trevor and i d be tempted to think one was based loosely on the other after trevor joins the game things start to get interesting the jobs get marginally more lucrative although unless you cheat and look online for how to make money doing the lester missions you ll never be rolling in dosh until it s too late and that s the achilles heel of games like this just at the point where the credits are about to roll is when the game goes ta daa the big gun and you re left thinking this whole game would have been way more fun if i d had that about 50 hours ago the big problem with gta v is that there s not enough ways to make money unless you look at guides online the store robberies make you a little but a single visit to hospital wipes out all your cash unless you invest in the fickle and largely broken stock market security vans pop up with such irregularity you can spend hours waiting for owe they make a bit more cash but again one death and the whole effort is undone there are a few set pieces that earn 25k to 50k but a single property costs way more than that as are a couple of upgrades on a car some nice outfits or a few unwanted trips to hospital if you put your money into the stock market it s so random you stand more chance of losing money than making it i followed online hints about watching the curves and when i saw a stock hit the lowest price it had ever been i invested and it just went lower and stayed there wasn t one of the lester mission stocks either lost about 50k leaving the stock alone for weeks of game time to see if it went back tried hitting the vans of a stock to force its rival s price up nothing just could not get the stock market to be affected by any of the tricks online and property revenue is a joke what also annoyed me was the way cars just vanish if you look the wrong way i had a really cool armoured car i found in the city i tricked it out and took it back to my garage parked it and poof it was gone i thought parking cars in your garage would store them but no then i stole a plane and parked it in the hangar left came back gone because the hangar was owned by a different protagonist and the plane was just deleted so i ended up giving up trying to steal nice cars and trick them out i simply couldn t keep them and that is a fundamental mistake in gta v if you take a car and park it in your garage it should stay in your garage just like gta iv i tried to get it back from the police pound but no it wasn t there either so yeah gta v is bloody amazing the radio stations are good although vice city was better the story is good once all three protagonists are on the scene the graphics are just in freaking sanely good flying into the city on a misty morning is just jaw dropping but it s a grindy slog to make any money and you ll probably end up either looking up cheats tricks online or compromising with crappy stuff until almost the end of the game uipgraded npc cars seem to vanish occasionally and i tried to store one in my safe house garage but it vanished with no explanation i tricked one out took it on a mission and halfway through need to chase someone on foot come back car s gone losing me about 15k of upgrades physics glitches too can kill cars and aircraft that are otherwise just sitting there so yeah gta v is absolutely amazing game and you definitely play it but rockstar still haven t figured out how to get back to that sweet spot of gta3 they ve got the world building down to a fine art storytelling character design is top notch but the fun level could be better if there s ever a gta vi i really hope they remember to cut back on the online style grinding for cash with obtuse stocks and shares and replace the money making with fun stuff like rampages and challenges giving decent cash,155.7,20.0,1,Recommended,"November 14, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"Dark Blue Monkey

40884,2017 first i d like to say i bought this game three times once for ps3 on release then ps4 and again here on steam when i finally decided to build a gaming pc this should be a testament to the overall quality of this game s single player alone as i have no real interest in the multiplayer component due to rockstar s and take two s business model and their priorities however that said i have had this game s social club render itself defunct for no reason multiple times every week no matter how many times i reinstall the game and the social club it eventually re breaks for no reason within the week while this doesn t impact the quality of the game itself when it works it very clearly shows how inept rockstar is at making sure this sort of issue doesn t happen 150 aaa games installed on my pc and one has this issue gta5 the music is on point and fits the game and the story very well and each of the three main characters are all well written the story while good feels a bit all over the place at first but i genuinely feel it is due to how much the story seems to just rush what i mean by that is that it seems like things just keep escalating and escalating for the main characters rushing from one crazy event to another to another while it was enjoyable the entire way through that pacing of the story made it feel a little disjointed for me at times despite making perfect sense the ending was also a bit lackluster and felt rushed in a bad way to me an arbitrary a b and c choice with one being a very obvious right choice two choices lead to less satisfying endings and the other leads to an ending that is very clearly a tie up loose ends mission both literally and narratively you kill all of the antagonists you run into in the game in a mission that simply screams we had to wrap it up somehow that said it should be noted i ve beaten the main story four times while it has some very glaring flaws narratively it s still a fun time now on to the multiplayer the reason i m not into it is actually not due to me being primarily a single player focused gamer but also because of how the entire thing is set up i played red dead redemptions free roam multiplayer for hours upon hours and enjoyed it despite it being fairly empty gta online it s even emptier than red dead redemption in order to have any fun whatsoever you need to make in game money you do this by playing deathmatches heists races and various other game modes the problem is that the payouts are so incredibly low that you will need to grind for countless hundreds of hours to get enough money to keep up with the updates and this game while fun is nowhere near good enough to warrant that type of dedication the reason for this is so they can get you to spend literally hundreds of dollars on microtransactions in fact when gtao launched the payouts were actually reasonable and balanced only to be nerfed to insane degrees just to make their shark card sales not only more enticing but make it damn near the only way to legitimately have fun in this game this turns people to script mods that give them hundreds of millions of in game money to circumvent this unethical business model many modders however go further by making themselves invincible invisible can insta kill anyone and do anything you can think of to ruin your fun in response take two put an end to openiv which is literally only used for single player mods like graphics mods that don t even work on multiplayer eventually take two reversed that decision and began allowing openiv to be used again for single player modding however just a couple short months later has take 2 and r stripping a very large number of players of their in game currency they started up an event where warehouse missions which are the best way to make money in the game despite still being abysmally lower than they should be yielded twice as much money people grinded those things from the event s start to finish when the smugglers run dlc hits a large number of them see all of their money whiped everyone who contacts r about this then just gets sent automated cookie cutter responses from their automated system and then ignored seriously and then people wonder why this game has such a severe problem with modders online maybe it s because r actively goes out of its way to screw everyone and as a result gives everyone a valid reason to say your microtransactions i m going to pay a modder 15 for 100m rather than pay r 1 250 for 100m then there s the fact that the only bug fixes r does are gtao money glitches there are still many bugs left over from the ps3 360 release and how r never began work on the three expansions they claimed gta5 s single player was going to get because gtao padding their wallets was more important it s very easy for me to say that i can recommend gta5 s single player but i cannot in good concience recommend gtao if i rated the two parts seperately the single player is a solid 8 10 with the multiplayer being a 4 10 6 10 when with friends at the very most even when you ignore the ethics behind r and take two s decisions,368.5,29.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 17,

40919,2015 would have easily recommended this game before steam s 2015 summer sale fantastic game incredibly immersive tons of fun but sadly i won t be recommending any rockstar games anymore the company essentially bundled in game cash dlc with the base game raised the price of the bundle to 80 and marked the bundle 25 off so that it sold on sale for the regular base price of 60 on top of this rockstar initially pulled the base game from their store page which made it seem like the cash card bundle was the only version of the game you could purchase effectively hiding the fact that the base game is not actually on sale to top everything off though purchasing the cash card bundle is basically rockstar s way of skirting around steam s new refund policy buying the bundle and starting up the game immediately ties the cash card to your account which disqualifies you from requesting a refund even if you play the game for less than two hours it s a move i m just disappointed i ve already given rockstar my money wish i could get it back won t be buying another rockstar game anytime soon,158.5,107.0,2,Not Recommended,"June 12, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,Capra Irata

40975,2017 grand theft auto v the greatest example of how to release an absolutely stunning fantastic game on launch day and then completely muck it up with miserable post launch decisions and greedy marketing when your parent company flat out wants to squeeze every last dime out of it s daily player base as possible gta v is one of my favorite open world games of all time it s a beautiful well crafted world with interesting sp missions and a functional hic online that said i bought this game knowing it would be modded like every gta game has been for like 15 years i also bought it on the basis of gta online being something i could play regularly and have decent progression and have a vain hope of unlocking content in without devoting my 24 7 life to grinding for money with the shoe horning of shark cards and an endless stream of supremely overpriced content online with little actual fun content added to it that makes me actually want to play it for fun rather than feel like i m grinding for cash every waking minute it completely ruined the experience of gta online who really wants to farm cash to blow 10m on an in game car or plane for reference that s more than 100 usd real world money worth of premium micro transaction shark cards if you wanted to just skip the time and buy a plane pair that with the fact that there has not once been an update to gta v s single player mode more importantly you can never get the premium online vehicles in single player to mess around with and enjoy the vtol hydra nope all those amazing super cars nope low riders and super bikes with boost nope rolling tank military suvs delivered to your doorstep nope none of it that was until the glorious modding community came around and added all the best features and content of gta online back into single player for all of us to use that was great i could play the game the way i wanted access all the content i ve paid for and i don t have to deal with online players destroying my vehicles if i don t want to that is however until the corporate overlords at take two interactive decided to file a cease and desist claim against openiv the primary crew that made modding gta iv and gta v possible the best tool available to make all other mods compatible and the very backbone of single player mods in gta v yes single player despite their claims that openiv is allowing exploits into the gta online world it is not openiv has nothing to do with online it it a closed source software so no one can exploit the reverse engineered software to hack the game illegitimately and it even disables itself if you go online so none of your mods will carry over they purposely built the utility to tick all the boxes and keep the software for single player use only but that doesn t stop tti from shutting them down on the basis of it being harmful to their online community well sorry to tell you but the online in gta v is already a vile hell with a plethora of third party hacks that have nothing to do with openiv those are the people that need to be getting cease and desist orders not the one team that did everything in their power to keep their tool on the up and up and appeal to take two rockstar s wishes for online to be their property with no outside mods update june 23 2017 as of writing it appears that take two have stepped down at least to a degree and that openiv is back in action and being updated so potential for modding may have returned that said this review will remain negative due to the fact they not only tried to pull a massively anti consumer practice and only turned around after massive backlash but also the fact that the last two years since the game s release on pc have been nothing but endless efforts to add more and more costly updates to gta online but they also have done nothing to support the single player and as this recent debacle shows they are actively trying to get people away from the single player and into gta o because the sp doesn t net them a constant stream of microtransaction money frankly gta online is one of the worst grinds for content i ve come across in recent years modding things into sp is the only way for many like myself who have actual day jobs and responsibilities to even access half of gta 5 s content in a reasonable time frame,299.7,27.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 16, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Cody48er

41197,2017 dont buy this game if you plan on modding it because you cant now now i love the game dont get me wrong but the only reason i bought it on pc was for the mods i even had to upgrade my computer for it and now i cant play it how i want to even though rockstar has openly embrassed mods so i guess if youre fine with playing the game vanilla go ahead the game itself is fantastic but for us who want to play the rediculous or immersive or whatever mods you need to stay away because you are not allowed to now aperently its a damn shamerip open iv edit 7 7 2017 take two realised that they were shooting themselves in the head with the whole mod thing and they rectracted their cease and desist on open ivhowever i still can t recomend it because after playing the new gunrunning update this game has become a grind its among the ranks of clash of clans levels of grinding it takes forever to get anything done in this game now but the game is still fun if you dont have to do all that but of course youre gonna want the new toys who wouldnt if so prepare to grind my friend,440.8,34.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 16, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Geezus97

41277,2017 i played gta v since shortly after its release i bought it on ps3 ps4 and i bought it on pc just recently just because of the modabillity i already beat the story mode on ps3 and 4 so whats the point of me playing it on pc any more they pretty much modding the single player hasn t had any new additions in 4 years and the multiplayer has just turned into a grinding charlie foxtrot for people with a lot of time to do mission after mission and the people who spend hundreds on fake cash just to get the newest bike club enterprise or military arms buisness and each getting exceedingly more expensive also if you look at the vehicles in the game with each update the vehicles when from in vanilla being like 200 00 for a nice sporty super car to spending probably millions just trying to get the car like in the gunrunning dlc having to spend up to 2 5 million just to have a chance to buy the new cars,177.1,16.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 23, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"‚ôø___/‚õü‚õü‚õü\___

41305,2019 i m sure rockstar had the best intentions while making this game and singleplayer is good but the multiplayer is basically just a money milking machine for taketwo so many gamemodes and potential all balanced around basically being a frustration simulator everything costs loads of money and making money is nigh impossible on your own you can t even make money by stealing and selling cars is that really what you d call grand theft auto and god help you if you get a motorcycle club or organisation or anything like that because the only way to make money is by joining public sessions full of hackers yes they still dont have that nailed cause they dont care enough as it basically still makes them money and getting all your product destroyed by 9 year olds that never even heard of an age restriction just because it earns them rp to do so which is yet another choice they made to make sure people get so frustrated they just buy shark cards for only a mere 47 euros worth sharkcards you get an oppressor flying motorcycle with explosive machineguns and homing missiles which basically just makes you a god of destruction in this game guess what all the 9 year olds with hacked money are using if i d have to buy it again i m not sure i would i d give about 15 20 euros for the singleplayer story the multiplayer just makes me want to cut whoever s responsible for sharkcards open with sharkcards,125.5,18.0,1,Not Recommended,"January 29, 2019",Grand Theft Auto V,"a

41445,2015 your typical grand theft template new storyline new characters same fun im leaving this review to address its online gameplay when not being subject to a modder s or hacker s myriad of exploits online gameplay can start off as fun you ll learn quickly however that the many necessary team oriented missions that are part of the online story can become a ridiculously repetitive nuisance this is mostly because the missions can be challenging and the people you play with can be mentally challenged and unfortunately if any member of the team fails any part of the mission you ll be restarting the mission or if any member leaves you ll be restarting the team building altogether and then of course the mission in its entirety doesn t sound bad factor in the load times between every fail restart or regroup and you ll think twice to avoid having a bad gaming experience because of other people you may try to vet the heist members in your lobby which has proven to take a minimum of 30 minutes per heist another option is to setup an all star team of just your friends but you may very likely run into a plethora of technical obstacles that will completely prevent you from playing altogether be it session time outs when you try to start a session member disconnection for whatever ridiculous bug that rockstar can t iron out or the painfully long load times between freeworld and heist sessions we all must endure when beginning concluding or all too commonly repeating any mission or heist simply put the online facet of gta seems to be forced and needs a lot more work from its seemingly non existent support to make the end user happy as it stands gta online is a huge waste of my entertainment time,219.5,28.0,2,Not Recommended,"November 6, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,Brodor

42027,2015 single player is fantastic so why the thumbs down gta online it turns the game into a way over regulated sandbox i m going to start with modding because it s the sole reason that a large number of fans prefer to play gta on pc as opposed to console private modders motivated solely by wanting to do crazy things in this big open sandbox would do just that create tools sometimes even scripting languages and such to expand previous installments to way beyond what they were as of late may the relationship between rockstar and modders is tumultuous at best rockstar realizes that the modding community is a huge aspect of the success of pc releases but they didn t really prepare for the modding community and it has ended up clashing with their regulated sandbox and business model which is a hodgepodge of things that companies have been doing in the last 5 years that have worked so what is this regulated sandbox that i keep going on about and why is it so flawed lets start with the reputation experience point and currency systems ironic coming from someone who used to be a rabid rpg fan but experience points in an online game are a bald faced skinner box system that gives a game artificial longevity and is essentially a mechanism for compulsion it takes somewhere between 150 and 250 hours to hit level 120 which is where you ve maxed out everything except the maximum number of armor you can carry to get there you can go through hastily assembled missions that don t even have voice acting heists which get old after awhile various deathmatches parachuting races and a bunch of activities that most people don t enjoy doing like tennis and golf there are daily objectives that help speed up this leveling process but it s just another compulsion loyalty element as it must be performed every day the problem with this system and much of it stems from the fact it takes so long to max out everything is how imbalanced it makes the game if you re a level 8 in a deathmatch against a level 110 you re probably going to be annihilated because the level 110 has twice as much health as you and more armor capacity not to mention faster reload speed and less recoil if the deathmatch is allowing inventory weapons the imbalance gets much worse with weapons like rpg and heavy sniper to contend with races are no better you cannot win a bicycle race if you lack max stamina which allows you to pedal furiously forever versus about 15 20 seconds with sub max handling and other aspects are affected by driving skill and of course unlocked weapons affect the outcome of a gta race custom vehicles also imbalance races so basically rockstar made all this regulated pvp and yet it s completely imbalanced and thus can t be taken seriously it s no wonder that so many deathmatches are made simply for farming rp and cash i go back to my artificial longevity point to mention that most people are going to pick a few things that they like however no one wants to repeat the same mission over and over nor will most people want to get trounced in pvp by people who have no life irony intended what is especially hard to stomach about all of this is that the game itself openly mocks the majority of what they re doing with their call of duty parody named righteous slaughter 7 xp persistent upgrades and pay to win are among the things they mock all sins that gta online commit even though this compulsion system is highly flawed rockstar is hard at work protecting it against the evil modders how dare people not earn level 120 by shaving weeks off their lives how dare people get money from some other source than rockstar to purchase roughly 30 million worth of goods that are exclusive to the online stores there was a mass banning in early may 2015 over this reason rockstar wants you to buy their imaginary money with micropayments much like zynga in fact with price points almost lifted directly from zynga s catalog the highest price point is even you guessed it 99 99 for the whales and let me put this into perspective rockstar has made roughly 3 billion from game sales alone it s the most profitable single game ever made and they re alienating an important part of the fan base for what surely amounts to less than 1 100th of that now it s worth noting that rockstar is trying to figure out how to handle the modder issue but it s a bit too late the port needed to be made modder friendly from the ground up they could have released server software and automatically have stat changes on private servers not be reflected on rockstar servers however because they didn t it s going to be some time probably not until gta vi that these issues are resolved so what about their own creation tools i ll start with the video editor it s less flawed than the creator but it s only good for artsy videos if you need to make any kind of tutorial style video don t even bother the caption length is too short the caption placement handling is awkward and the text editor for captions lacks basic features like clicking between letters and having the cursor go there the creator is very flawed in overhead mode it can be very difficult to place checkpoints on hills if you want to place any objects in midair you need to spend many hours manipulating the very fine time space windows allowed for this kind of placement even though some of the most popular community maps use this rockstar hasn t embraced it and has kept it limited there s also a profanity filter that s so poorly written that words like sniper and skyscraper get filtered out of descriptions it s virtually impossible to promote your maps and there s a glut of maps due to there being mini achievements for publishing a map and having it played it s possible for maps to be viewed as corrupted and need to be made from scratch it s happened to two of my crew finally once you publish a map any time you go to update it you can t save a local copy without making a brand new duplicate it won t update for anyone who has bookmarked the old version and the editor will crash a lot even on low settings this aspect didn t fit in anywhere else but the online loading times are terrible it can take over a minute to load into a freemode game with all the complaining in this review which might be viewed as unfair i need to contrast this game with tf2 valve has embraced the modding community with all its source games including tf2 rockstar is struggling with it in gta v in tf2 players pay real world money for cosmetics that don t affect gameplay while in gta v real world money is used for an in game advantage tf2 does charge for weapons but these weapons are easily acquired via trading or random drops far easier than in gta v but it s only fair to point out tf2 s one sin tf2 s hammer tool is frankly superior to rockstar s creator though i can only fairly compare the interface speed and how much potential time is lost due to errors with the software alliedmodders a fan made company handles all the other aspects of tf2 modding and they do it well because they care tf2 lets fans run servers and valve only very lightly interferes with the management of these servers entirely related to paid cosmetics which is fair gta v isn t there yet and may never be there tf2 has balanced pvp gta v does not gta v has artificial longevity through skinner box methods while tf2 s longevity is a product of a solid base along with the company working along side its community it should be no wonder that gta s been slowly losing players and will soon be overtaken by the aging tf2 i write this scathing review not to bash gta v but in the hopes that it will be read and will influence the development of gta vi gta s overall fan base is enormous hopefully rockstar will get it right in the next installment,358.7,196.0,9,Not Recommended,"May 31, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,A Tree

42072,2017 used to be a great game filled with online money glitches an expansive world and an enjoyable single player experience but after shark cards became a major part of the game take two and rockstar have been pushing them more and more since the online currency is so painfully hard to come by and requires countless hours of grinding just to be able to afford a base level super car that s not including full upgrades which can run you over 50 the original value now with the legal removal of mods we see how much the company wants to push their own agenda and forcing the players to obey to their awful system of pay to win taking away mods from gta iv and gta v royally screws the mod creators and the people who enjoyed playing with the mods themselves this isn t nearly as bad as when mods were removed from minecraft or when mods became pay to win for skyrim fix this soon take two or your game and reputation as being one of the better game publishers is going down the trash,169.3,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 21, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"Tron Javolta

42285,2015 gta v has been reviewed and played by many and for the vast majority of gamers it has worked smoothly and given them a great single and multiplayer experience however not all is well and good i have found my game absoloutly riddled with bugs framerate issus login errors the game not even being recognizeed as downloaded not too recently i own a fairly high end gpu and a moderatly strong cpu and i still experience drops from 50 60 fps all the way down to 1 5 on a constant basis e mailing rockstar support with this issue only ended up with them apologising for my problems not offering any support or fixes at the time of writing i m really unhappy with the game i ve spent hours searching through youtube videos online forums asking friends advice but not no avail my current issue is that rockstar s social club failed to update even after me re installing the program i know i m just a tiny minority of the huge amount of people playing the game with significant problems like mine but somethiing really needs to be done you probably won t experience the same issues i know many people in my friends list don t but for me the game is pretty much unplayable,99.3,35.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 13, 2015",Grand Theft Auto V,"hjzo

42426,2017 well gta this review is actually more about gta online and not about the whole game because i havent really played the sp i ve owned this game for quite a while now and enjoyed it frequently but the recent events made me change my mind somehow and so i decided to turn one of my forum posts into this review that post was refering to the fact topic that rockstar seems to be unable to control their automated systems which are responsible for clearing ilegitimately aquired money out of the games economy well same happened to me but with a ridiculous amount of money compared to what others players have i wanted to purchase a bunker since the moment that dlc went live because i don t have any real means of making bigger amounts of money besides an mc i grinded for hours over the past few weeks and i wasn t even at the 1 4 million that i needed for the bunker i logged in last saturday and wanted to grind the rest of it just to be confronted with the message in the loading screen that my account was adjusted with 602000 i never cheated anywhere and didn t even think of it why should i even playing a game and cheating seems like an utterly useless waste of time i also always avoided most public lobbies because i knew of the danger of getting modded against your will and simply getting exploded in your favorite car all the time by bored twelve year olds doesn t really fit my definition of relaxation over a game after a hard day at work anyway so i spent the biggest amount of time in private lobbies or with friends in very empty public lobbies because i enjoy the classic way of gta running around blowing up and having fun with your friends instead of screwing other people over to enlarge my e peen statboard all of the stuff i own was scraped together from the few sources of income i have my stats checkout in every regard around 13k of shared money due to the fact that i robbed a few stores with friendes and we split the amount afterwards more than 2 years ago the amount of money i got and the amount of money i spent are also nearly identical but still all of that didn t help to be treatet in a fair way they just took more than half of what i had away from me i opened a ticket and got the standard response and it seems like that will be the last thing i heard from the so called support they also didn t specify what i did wrong well dear support do you even realize what that word means because it doesn t seem so basically you don t deserve to earn any money for your work because you are technically not working yes i realize that in the modern world screwing people over is also considered work so maybe i am just wrong or too old fashioned or maybe i am just wrong because i thought that i was supposed to play the game to earn money but it seems instead that cheating and griefing is the way to success but i won t do that instead i will just refrain from supporting an apparently broken system and will spend my free time in games which are actually thanking me for spending my time with them instead of punishing me for it but hey i played well over 250 hours and i had fun in that time i spent 59 euro on the game so that amounts to around 0 2 euro per hour thats much cheaper than other ways of entertainment so thank you rockstar for creating a great game that made me smile many times but now you can shove it up your because it seems that you don t care to treat your customers with respect and that i cant stand neither in real life nor anywhere else but hey 60 gigabyte cost also around 10 euro these days and that sorta amounts to what you took from me according to the prices of the shark cards so it seems to be fair for both of us so i certainly can t recommend the game in its current state it was a great experience in the first place and maybe the sp still is but the mp and therefore the part i have seen just isn t anymore what it used to be because reviews are about a games current state and not the historic state there is only one way of putting it don t buy this game if you expect a real product with support and customer satisfaction unless useless grind and being treated like a mindless source of cash grab is what makes you satisfied have a nice life everyone and thanks for reading,283.8,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 29, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Spartaaaa!!!!!!!

42657,a huge selling point for the steamdeck was that it can run gtav perfectly and i was able to play online with friends on invite only session without cheaters and or modders now i cannot do that because off battle eye great job r the solution would be really easy enable proton support to battle eye so i hope you do that quickly so i can change this negative review to a positive one,897.0,17.0,0,Not Recommended,September 18,Grand Theft Auto V,"Dutch Flander

42669,2017 i m sorry this game was great until the final update came and ruined it from both the multiplayer and singleplayer the snigle player is no longer moddable and modding was the reason people went crazy for the game when it was released for pc the multiplayer where can i begin rockstar decided it was a good idea to force people into joining public sessions so they can try the new content not only that the community is the worst at this time the players are waiting for the others to approach their property so they can destroy their supplies and it s getting more digusting than ever this game was great was,563.4,18.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 30, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,Raiser
42680,2022 i can t even play the game because it s asking for some random activation code after going through the headache of setting up the social club account that i couldnt care less about i just want to play the game i paid for this was fun back in the day on xbox 360update once i had the game activated i really started enjoying it again i got into online play and became hooked but about every other time i try to get online i get an error via the rockstar social club it is beyond frustrating to perpetually troubleshooting launching the game why does the rockstar launcher have to be its own app it doesn t integrate well at all with all the updates and evolution of this game you think they could focus on a seamless launch this is the best game in the world but unfortunately i can t currently play it i ve tried 10 times to get online today already,415.9,23.0,6,Not Recommended,"November 23, 2022",Grand Theft Auto V,trout406

42690,2021 product received for free tldr don t play online but allow me to elaborate thank me for playing the game to write this for you allow me to begin throughout my almost 100 hours playing the game i ve already seen a lot and the majority is bad constant griefers modders are a dime a dozen literally never found a single session without atleast 1 2 they can be nice occasionally but the majority of them i ve seen were malicious either they spawn stuff attached to your character that prevents you from doing most if not all forms of movement exploding everyone and using a mod to blame a specific person with it affects the victims stats and at one point i was completely hit offline for hours if you can struck by the luck gods and not get into a session with a cheater you will either run into someone who ruins the fun for everyone else for entertainment or the occasional person who is in godmode via glitch but not cheating there is a small bit of fun that can be found in public session but nothing how it was when i played on 360 in 2015 the game has changed to whoever has the most amount of money will be the victor in any fight since literal flying bikes with missiles exist or the ability to instantly kill anyone from anywhere from a secure location orbital cannon now if you have friends to play with you could always go to a invite only session to enjoy it and have the chance to experience the fun of gta online but sadly a lot of stuff requires you to be in a public session just for them to work the majority of which being sources of making money if you skipped to the end and want the short answer here it is gta online has been completely ruined by the lack of communication between rockstar and it s community you can practically get away with modding nowadays hell even i did for the entire 100 hours i used it to avoid griefers and used it for self enjoyment never killed anyone the pvp aspect takes skill and throws it out the window 2 10,96.1,17.0,1,Not Recommended,"December 5, 2021",Grand Theft Auto V,"Type2

42804,2020 do not buy this game unless you love loading screensboth the singleplayer and online have loading screens that lasts almost 3 hours before you could join a match or worse it finally gives you an error message and keep in mind rockstar hasnt even updated the game s performance at least from what i ve searched up they keep adding dlcs that doesnt even contribute in the game s ability to even be played and the only bugs they would fix is bugs that allow players to earn money faster in gtao not to mention gtao is just filled with cheaters griefers and contains the most repetitive and annoying grind just to get a crumb of proper content and if you got the game and is interested in the heists good luck playing anything cause the only fun you will get is from this rm300 overglorified loading screen simulator that disconnects freezes you after youre loaded in or if youre lucky you will be frozen in place for the next 5 minutes after you and your squad has readied up adding to this rockstar keeps adding in pointless additions of vehicles or weapons that contributes to griefers which will usually you up the moment you step out of your apartment mainly and especially the loser s pride that is the orbital cannon and the oppressor mk2 did i mention gtao is ridiculously p2w when it comes to weapons and vehicles or even business property upgrades unless you spent your life on this game as if it s a second job or pay almost 3000 for shark cards singleplayer on the other hand although i ve spoilt myself with the story before i even bought this game its just the same as gtao but the only plus i can see this is the fact that you can mod cheat however you like without harming other people s fun but thats all gunplay is fun at first but after awhile it might get repetitive and the scripted events doesnt seem fun after a few hours in however if you people would still want to buy this game i highly suggest getting it on a high discount this game is not worth the high price for these existing problems and i really hope youre patient enough to wait through minutes and even hours of just loading though i do agree the races are fun there are better racing games than gta5,299.6,21.0,1,Not Recommended,"April 12, 2020",Grand Theft Auto V,"AlphaWolf | #PTFO

42818,2017 tell me did you ever dream of a game called simulator of life in your dreams no it s not about glamorous sima are you dreaming about a game that would be a copy of real life with all its capabilities and freedoms where you can wake up watch a couple of minutes of tv then put on a suit and go to work then go to the bar skip one by one and finish the day with a beauty company and tomorrow everything will turn completely differently surely yes gta5 a fundamental continuation of the series which is a perfect example of joint creative work of designers scriptwriters and programmers obviously the task of the authors was to transfer the user on the other side of the screen where the player gets so involved in the role of the character that he does not distinguish himself from it gta5 put everything in its place once again demonstrating to everyone a real sign of quality developers from rockstar unconditional leaders and real geniuses in the field of the concept created by them each new part of the series raises the bar to a new level is it really that after gta5 there will still be unconquered heights to describe this masterpiece can be infinitely long so we advise you to buy this wonderful game it is better to see once than hear a hundred times youtube video gta iv is better than gta v views 17 612 854 comparison about gameplay value not realism physics gunfight ai melee combat controls interiors multiplayer freedom a screenshot of grand theft auto v by fr0sent 3,577.7,39.0,9,Recommended,"November 23, 2017",Grand Theft Auto V,"fr0sent <3

42963,2016 with this review i m focussing on the gta online mode the story mode is pretty good but the multiplayer has a lot of problems which i will address in this review first off all rockstars ban policy gta online bans are the result of automated analysis related to modding in gta online exploiting or abusing game mechanics or otherwise interfering with other players gameplay experience you can be literally banned for griefing or glitching instead of fixing the existing problems with gta online that could prefent people from griefing glitching they push out another supercar worth 3 milion so that people buy there stupid sharkcards now lets go on to there servers i have one word for them they dont properly you lose connection to them constantly and the are so slow it takes around 40 seconds or so to connect to them which is ridiculous and finally the community it is so toxic and because of this i try to join the least populated servers possible this is possibly the reason rockstar is trying to ban griefers but even if that is the reason then i still don t think that that is reasonable,86.6,17.0,2,Not Recommended,"June 28, 2016",Grand Theft Auto V,"Donar

43318,i recently jumped back into online mostly private lobbies cause i dont like dealing with people and was enjoying some new content working towards maybe getting myself a fancy new helicopter imagine rockstar greeting me with a giant middle finger of course representing the 1 69 update not only did they add an anti cheat people have already found ways around but in doing so they have removed linux support you may think hey its not their fault linux has no anti cheat support thing is we do its as simple as checking add linux proton support saying we can no longer support linux is simply 100 a straight up lie theres no world in which they can in good faith say this it s sad to say goodbye to a game i played with all my friends but since most of them can t play them too anyways due to this i ll have to find new games to fill the 112 gb hole in my sd card heck you rockstar even when you decide to release gta6 on pc because let s be honest you will i will not be getting it i won t even accept gift copies and even if you reverse this no linux decision i will likely not be returning do better,300.8,16.0,0,Not Recommended,September 18,Grand Theft Auto V,"Juliana
