7252,2022 cs go came out over 3 500 days ago almost 10 years since 2014 cs go has never had less than 250 000 concurrent players many games in the last decade which are considered cornerstones of pc gaming possibly even cornerstones of fps games in general never even achieved that many concurrent players at their absolute peak in 2020 cs go hit its all time peak of over a million concurrent players playing all at the same time an achievement that is likely only shared with truly earth shatteringly popular games like lol and wow this is all to say that somehow despite being almost a decade old cs go remains one of the most popular titles on pc as a whole beating out such rivals as apex legends valorant warzone pubg rainbow six siege and pretty much every other fps game you can let roll off the tongue and likely any non shooter title you can think of as well i would venture to say that no game aside from minecraft and pong has had even remotely close to the staying power of cs go all that said the game blows modern cs go looks dated sounds dated and plays like valve s 1998 half life source has completely knee capped any opportunity for growth and innovation and with a few minor meta changes and the introduction of new gamemodes and weapons cs go is the same game now that it was 3 500 days ago some would argue that this is a sign of perfection of effortless staying power but i would argue that it is a sign of a lazy cash grab let s be honest in comparison to modern competitors cs go s movement is incredibly clunky you can draw a direct lineage between crouch jumping mid doors on dust ii to completing puzzles in black mesa in half life cs go is likely the only game about using firearms that does not allow you to ads and more or less guarantees the user that the bullets coming from their firearm will not hit what they are looking at unless they have perfect movement aim and spray pattern knowledge very few weapons have been added in the last decade and those that have been added are generally worse in every measurable way to those that they replace dust ii remains the most popular map and has itself only seen a light graphical upgrade with only a small handful of map design changes new maps are introduced regularly complained about and removed from the current map pool if you are reading this in 2032 dust ii is likely still the most popular map and likely remains un upgraded socially the game is terrible the vast majority of the user base is either incredibly toxic racist cheating or a combination of all three the way that matchmaking works it is easy to come across smurf after smurf after smurf losing game after game after game to players who s real skill is likely 10x higher than cs go placed them i cannot begin to count the number of games in which i was subjected to player s profile pictures that were outright pornographic or i was called racial or homophobic slurs toxic does not even begin to describe how inhumane the cs go community can be at times so thus far i have established that cs go is one of the most popular games on pc that has time and time again outlasted better competitors i have dogpiled the game for looking sounding and playing like a game from 1998 and i have called all of the userbase toxic cheaters if i believe all of these things how can i possibly recommend the game easy i only play cs go with friends i play for fun and to collect skins many an hour has been spent three or four beers deep just chatting and joking with friends with cs go on in the background three four or even five stacking pub matches is incredible fun playing the game in a public lobby where you and your friends work through elaborate practiced routines of memes and jokes with poor unsuspecting randoms is easily one of the funniest things you can do with a microphone and pc stupendous fun can be had when you find a player who has a sense of humor who will joke around with you as much as you with them every game is a win when you play with friends you either lose the game so that your skill rating drops and you get to pub stomp the next lobby or you win the game and your skill rating increases so that you can get pub stomped next game thus setting you up for your own pub stomp this circuitous motion is what keeps the game fun and fresh you either get dumpstered on dumpster a team or the cs go matchmaking works for once and you have to fight for your life to get that 15 15 cs go sucks as a game and you will never ever see me playing it alone but as a medium by which you can interact with your friends cs go is unbeatable put a 30 rack in the fridge get some t bell delivered and get four friends who cannot hit the accept button with their aim and i guarantee you will make a life long meme between the five of you,753.1,252.0,50,Recommended,"April 30, 2022",Counter-Strike 2,Cooliodude223

7368,2016 apart from being primarily a game made for entertainment and competitive purposes cs go is also a powerful personal development tool aside from arguably improving reaction times and hand eye coordination it teaches valuable life lessons including the following it teaches you not to pay attention to other people s insults opinions dude you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake it teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores it improves your judgment decision making and learning process because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions welp shouldn t have peeked against that guy in the middle it teaches you to take responsibility in most game situations you can only blame yourself when things go wrong it teaches you to enjoy the game even if you aren t winning you can t win in life you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while of course as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members none of this will happen on its own unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit,828.5,63.0,22,Recommended,"February 3, 2016",Counter-Strike 2,"gwarlek

7397,2020 my thoughts and opinions on cs gocs go is one of those games that has a really dedicated and rabid fanbase thanks to incredible success of counter strike 1 6 released in 2012 and eight years later the fast paced pc game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles partly because of its established core gameplay and huge active community a big part of its success is due to its massive esports following it s always talked about in streaming sites whether its twitch and mixer the game even includes its own watch a match section so you can follow and spectate live tournaments and competitive matches cs go is also very easily accessible it s free and all you need is a potato with a fine keyboard and mouse and maybe a headset with a mic it runs on basically any pc with decent frames rate a high end pc should give you over 300fps at ultra details you don t need anything fancy or powerful to enjoy which is another reason why there s so big player base pros valve has done everything it can to evolve the game and keep it fresh by staying true to the series one of the greatest competitive first person shooters you can play on steam massive player base and a game that refuses to die includes several maps and nine game modes types including the standard team based pvp casual modes competitive deathmatch arms race community made maps and servers and even a 16 player battle royale mode but you shouldn t really play it for battle royale as its mostly barebones and ugly 100 skill based gameplay and no casual power ups like seen in halos and call of duty cs go relies heavily on reaction time and twitchy movements thus line of sight is one of the biggest advantages you can create excellent sound design but very unrealistic at the same time bullet physics and explosions are still impressive for an engine that is now 16 years old excellent performance runs well even on potatoes and 10 year old pcs and laptops an example of games as a service done well cons well you ll often find some gamers helpful and tolerable to newbies the mass playerbase is unwelcoming and very toxic playing without friends is not recommended negative behavior includes trolls in the team chats people who scream into their mics and people who simply can t keep quiet d some of them might even vote to kick you out because you re new to cs plenty of hackers and cheaters that ruin the fun and fair play for everyone vac engine is mostly automated and not moderated by valve s employees unless during a few rare cases the anti cheat is okay but not any better than other anti cheat solutions seen on pc so yeah cheating exist nearly everywhere these days technically cs go looks very dated and mediocre it hasn t changed a lot from cs source the graphics are mediocre and 2008ish graphics haven t improved relatively much since 2004 s half life 2 aggressive monetization to the point it s become a live gambling show players can choose to spend real money on items and cosmetic material like weapon skins winning and completing tasks rewards you loot boxes that can be unlocked by purchasing keys with real money too much trading could even lead to online gambling addiction the bottom linecs go is one of the most fine tuned first person shooters to date sure while it may look like a 15 year old game and there might be major issues but the fact that the community is thriving speaks volumes this means that this game will constantly be tweaked towards perfection my rating 8 10 very good,720.3,165.0,27,Recommended,"April 8, 2020",Counter-Strike 2,"Charged Dreamer

7398,when cheaters aren t a factor this game is the exemplary competitive fps movement and shooting mechanics are stable functional and above all responsive whilst providing a limitless skill ceiling that ensures that cs2 is an excellent outlet for improving your skills and progressing towards mastery the meta and mechanics remaining as stable as they do is a rare sight for the genre but is perhaps the most major contributor to why counter strike is such a rewarding outlet for moment to moment gameplay improvement and mastery when approached with a healthy mindset which can be difficult or impossible for some to maintain for me personally who is at an intermediate level of skill the shooting mechanics of cs2 manage to be an engaging satisfying and at times extremely difficult system and yet never feeling like an unfair or insurmountable obstacle the movement mechanics have surprising depth without intimidating or overly punishing new or intermediate players busy grappling with the shooting mechanics maps and especially utility is where the game makes available the full extent of potential skill growth through theory and knowledge where the other aspects of the game are largely tried to the mechanical ability of the player maps and utility largely reverses this and is the main factor which makes or breaks performances at higher levels of play counter strike can be a frustrating mix of reliance on teammates and reliance on yourself the game ensures that your performance has an impact and in order to win games against opponents of similar skill you must be able to lean on teamwork this means for many the game can be tilting through the failings of the self or your teammates but if you are able to develop an environment where you re able to lean on your team and develop your skills in conjunction with them then you will more often than not reap the rewards of satisfaction and hard earned achievement that counter strike has to offer,307.9,132.0,13,Recommended,May 29,Counter-Strike 2,"AlpineSnow

7583,title a disheartened player s goodbye to counter strike 2as someone who s been playing counter strike since 1 6 i ve spent countless hours immersed in its gameplay but now it s time to say goodbye to counter strike 2 the reason cheaters and toxic players have taken over ruining the experience for everyone else i ve seen the game s integrity decline over time cheaters run rampant and toxic behavior especially from certain regions has become the norm matches are often ruined by hackers or players who kick others or grief just for fun despite my love for counter strike i can t ignore these issues it s disappointing to see the developers focus on superficial additions like new skins instead of tackling the game s core problems features like dynamic smoke feel like distractions from the real issues so i ve uninstalled counter strike 2 it s tough to let go of a game i used to enjoy so much but i can t keep subjecting myself to this toxic environment maybe if the developers start taking cheating and toxicity seriously i ll come back until then it s goodbye to a game that used to bring me joy,996.6,61.0,1,Not Recommended,April 1,Counter-Strike 2,Eli
7584,2023 i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single farther to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,389.9,630.0,68,Recommended,"April 22, 2023",Counter-Strike 2,"Spicy Beef

7598,2017 rating good 7 10 introduction counter strike global offensive is a first person shooter set in a comptetetive scene where two teams battle for an objective it is a stand alone follow up to the famous counter strike mod from half life where terrorists battle the counter terrorists on different locations gameplay story 6 10 the gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents easier said than done actually since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some ai programmed to shoot you first cs go is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years since it offers great weapon balance tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day the story behind the game is based on the oldschool counter strike game where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being counter terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at terrorist base combat challenge 8 10 the combat is absolutely fluid in cs go and there are barely any moments that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying people tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps weapons or programming of the game however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market the challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french i am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if i did not win the match no matter the team stacks reaching global elite rank after around 200 hours i can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you graphic interface 7 10 the graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable like certain grapphiti on some maps the interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration progress mini games 8 10 it is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing cs go in any form there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market so different ways to progress in and outside of the game the biggest progress for me was improving my hand to eye coordination by playing it competetively audio immersion 8 10 each weapon sound is unique for itself and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from cs go fulfills its task really well the music is played only in menues and during the highlights the game music is nothing special but since you can get buy music kits to fit your music taste valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves side notes this game offers single player multiplayer and co op modes that can be played either against other players or ai this game offers different modes some of that are just for fun for example gun mode while others are played in e sports this game contains steam achievements this game offers great optimization and updates to technology with time updating their network code updating the hit boxes balancing the weapons summary cs go has its reasons to be the number one fps in the esl scene and its popularity is currently only rising it is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state but still keeps getting updated i would recommend trying cs go to every game just to know what this game is that defines the global fps market so much and while fps fans might love it some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna bes i hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it forestwolf,344.0,158.0,23,Recommended,"December 13, 2017",Counter-Strike 2,"ForestWolf

7631,2014 both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire steam library cs go has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly as i ve enjoyed over hundreds of hours playing this joyous game from the teamwork player rankings campaigns competitive gameplay music replay value and much more this game is a king amongst most modern multi player fps games and still going strong even over just a measly three years just like its predecessors the player assumes the role of either a counter terrorist or a terrorist both with their own unique missions depending on the campaign in general the newly added campaigns deathmatch and arms race is a great exclusive extra if you re just a casual player whereas there s the competitive session for the more experienced intense and determined players out there with every match starting you re brought into freeze time where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal just ready to be bought either with the money you ve earned by killing opponents or indeed losing a match respectively still giving the losing team a winning chance while with your team you could stick together as there are power in numbers or go alone to face your opposing enemies i wouldn t talk for every individual player out there as i ve seen power in experienced players trust me i have witnessed a russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents all in the same vicinity and yes he was a rageful one indeed i also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments definitely pushing the source engine to its absolute limits but doesn t go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game the gameplay the gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect as you can easily navigate along with the controls are fast and sometimes responsive on the other hand the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious numbered team just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming as it does help much more the original music used is also a big step up as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match each time around from the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is and with an added bonus with the steam music player at its peak in popularity the update with the musical kit useable in game was a great move as you can listen to classic music as you slaughter your opponents joyfully i ve also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real life history and origin in a very formal informative and creative way the statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second hand pistols when reloading your main gun that takes precious time along with how they flesh out damage with a great controlled accuracy as you can tell this game serves many different ideas strategies preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other and yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple yet fast updates the homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest cs go news such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe or special deal offers on those elusive cases if you re ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins you can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back but my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be the community yes a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional but i m not talking about those great people i m talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning kruger affect where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players in a much more biased fashion it gets annoying pretty quickly so i would usually block the most revolting swines who do this all in all this game is a big big big recommendation from me and if you think i m lying just check top selling games list at the start of the steam page there s a reason why this game is on the high ranking list and that s due to its high and successful popularity,403.0,103.0,4,Recommended,"October 17, 2014",Counter-Strike 2,"BigSchmoes

7667,2023 there comes a time in every man s life when he needs to take a look at himself in the mirror and wonder how exactly he reached such a place you have to truly ponder what decisions you have made along the way that brought you to the place of your final reckoning it is still unclear even to me why i purchased csgo there isn t anything wrong with it with those nudity scenes throughout it s perfectly stellar but when you look at it as a choice you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is what drove me to purchase such a game what part of my soul felt so empty that i thought a virtual girl could fill it when i look into the boundless depths of my own loneliness i see a pool of reflection my face isn t there there is no face there are only tears in that pool tears of shame and loss and confusion if it were up to me again i know i would purchase it in a heartbeat i know i would load it up and skip through the countless window prompts so i can have a single morsel of pornographic images which are readily available online yet despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere i still chose to purchase this game and devote hours of my life to it that time will never return to me it is lost just like my soul and just like the time i fear i may never find it again there is something broken within me something that desires sensation beyond my reach something that whimpers every single night with the knowledge that there is no true princess it is a merely an illusion in my pursuit to find meaning in this long life i sought the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop up window on my computer i am unsure what the moral of this review is i am unsure about my place within the universe all i know is that no amount of virtual girls can cure the vast rot that has overtaken me,742.2,60.0,30,Recommended,"May 30, 2023",Counter-Strike 2,"Desu

7687,2017 let me preface this just a bit i love counter strike i ve met so many cool people over the years i ve played had so many laughs and good times it s been a blast however i d say about 95 of that was purely through casual so after 500 hours in the game i decided to try and get into the competitive scene i got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks i know call me bad etc and we were having good fun we d win 3 lose 1 but the point was that it was fun however as we got higher and higher up it stopped being fun the reason absolutely piss poor matchmaking and security from valve s end i can understand one bad game or 2 but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible at this point i had stopped queing with less than a full lobby me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots they d leave and then its a 3v5 for the entire match experiences like this are not fun at all the worst part though is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game vac is the poorest excuse for an anti cheat system i ve ever seen one hacker will basically carry an entire team and 9 10 times the enemy team won t have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker because he ll carry them to the next rank the most you can do is report them but with how cheap this game is it s no problem for people to make another account and rinse repeat valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti cheat system it is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a about their community that i can think of in the gaming industry say what you want about ea being a money hungry company that hates their fans i guarantee you that you won t run into as many hackers on official dice battlefield servers than you will an official csgo server that s just sad again i love this game if you want to play casual or community or what have you you ll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game learning the maps and engaging with the goofy ass community i ve come to love hate however the competitive scene is pure cancer i do hope that valve reads these even though i highly doubt it because i truly want what s best for this game tks for reading sen,600.8,436.0,39,Not Recommended,"February 21, 2017",Counter-Strike 2,"Senarin

7689,2017 product received for free after playing the game for roughly 500 hours i have come to a point that i should express my opinion about the game s current state counter strike global offensive is a highly competitive game that focuses on team wo really you really think im going to describe this game as the perfect cut gem of an e sports title well you came to the wrong review comrade in essence cs go in its current state has some things you really wouldn t want in a game of this type cheaters vac most of them obviously have been cheating for a long time but what does valve care the only thing useful they do is milk their games for money until they are bone dry and deserted i just can t get over that fact that valve hasn t actually noticed that their anti cheat has flaws but instead they keep releasing more useless items than bug fixing updates for the game itself griefers they are not really common nowadays but back in the day every 5 10 6 10 competitive matches i went would have atleast 1 griefer that didn t do anything but insult generally discriminate or just flat out do absolutely nothing to help the team win a single round these individuals are most commonly found on the lower ranks from my experience smurfs i have seen more smurfs in cs go matchmaking than in the actual cartoon itself basically this ruins the game for new players by giving them the appearance that cs go just isn t worth playing if you don t know how the saltening begins do you want to experience more highly concentrated amounts of salt in one match than in a salt mine followed by a community of 12 year olds more cancerous than the radiation levels at chernobyl well my friend cs go is the game for you warranty for broken mice keyboards screens headsets desks windows and possibly hands from hitting your desk too hard not included servers when i mean servers i don t intend to talk about the ping lag but instead about how most of the time i get matched against with people from the other side of the damn galaxy this is good if you want to learn how everyone has had sexual intercourse with your family members pets in diverse languages while you simultaneously proceed to lose the match tl dr cs go is a game that gives everybody a different experience unless you are playing in russia then it s always b rushed every round cringy jokes aside i think this game is somewhat addicting and pleasant in the long run despite the initial steep learning curve if valve ever decides to actually update their anti cheat system i will be more than happy to play this game more often cheers james,841.6,331.0,60,Not Recommended,"August 31, 2017",Counter-Strike 2,"James_Rafael

7837,2014 i ve held this view of csgo for quite some time but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts i ve been playing cs for many many years starting in the early 2000 s through to present day this time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages enjoying leveling my character in wc3 mods smashing heads in deathmatch surfing backwards long jumping bhopping played in quals for wcg competed in cevo and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments i ve enjoyed cs from 1 1 to 1 6 cz css and also csgo no this does not make me a better player than you and no this does not mean i know everything it simply means that i have spent a lot of time playing different titles of counter strike have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases there are a handful of things that really upset me with csgo and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after i have first played the game these issues i consider to be game breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play i enjoy cs because there is a skill curve if you want to be the best at the game you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent this was certainly true in all other cs games i have played but not csgo csgo feels like it is a game of luck and chance as the game stands it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or mm is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game hitboxes are not lag compensated to follow the model of a player when jumpinghitboxes are not lag compensated to follow the model of a player when crouchinghitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bombaimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag compensatedif you are on 70ms ping in a 64tick server this is how most events will play out you see an enemy jump you shoot the enemy and get no hits you see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle you shoot thin air blood appears and you get a headshot killyou see an enemy standing there you shoot his chest you get no hit and then he crouches instantly you see an enemy standing there you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot because he was crouching on the server you see an enemy shoot first die and get no hits watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof you are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb you crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times slowly one by one you get no hits and die all of these aspects of the game i consider extremely game breaking the fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves yeah that has happened to me on a number of occasions just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed in it s current state the game rewards people for not aiming aka good players in the game need only aim at the ground run and shoot and they ll likely get a headshot because as long as you don t aim at the model that you see there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit the only one of these bugs that existed in counter strike source pre 2010 ob update was the hitboxes on the planting animation an example of a bug that i do not consider game breaking but extremely frustrating is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player for some reason after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this a feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch that is a huge disappointment people standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them but the player s screen will be completely black this was an unintentional meta change when trying to fix one way smokes and this new issue has existed for months now the game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them throw a smoke down wait until it starts to fade teammate resmokes rinse repeat and run down the timer retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can t capitalise on the blind criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible what a horrible meta change why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago 3d sound is non existent in csgo it is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind this game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny i find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems i see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable it d be nice if people were able to draw the dev s attention to these issues and press for a resolution,519.4,64.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 27, 2014",Counter-Strike 2,SWAG.Brownie

7871,2023 a sad unfinished game with no reason to lose access to the originalas a long time fan of counter strike global offensive i ve observed the changes that accompanied the release of counter strike 2 0 with a mix of disappointment and nostalgia rather than feeling like a natural evolution the game seems to have taken a step back leaving it massively diminished compared to its predecessor the removal of what feels like over 60 percent of the content and maps is a decision that has left many loyal players feeling baffled and frustrated those who have been part of the community for years miss the variety that characterized the counter strike experience the reduction in game modes and maps has contributed to a sense of monotony detracting from the diverse and engaging fps experiences the game used to offer the limitations on game modes and maps are particularly perplexing as they seem to undercut the essence of counter strike the game s charm was rooted in the myriad possibilities and unpredictability across various game modes and maps unfortunately the current state of affairs is marred by monotony exacerbated by the prevalence of hackers and a dismal peekers advantage the compromised anti cheat systems are a letdown for players who have invested time and passion into the game the rise of hacking has shifted the once competitive and skill based environment into a less savory space detracting from the integrity of the game counter strike 2 0 in its current state can be described as unpolished the potential for a great game is there but it is overshadowed by poor decisions and neglect it s disheartening to see a beloved game reduced to a source of frustration and disappointment it s clear that there is muchmuch work to be done valve has a responsibility to address these issues and reinvigorate the game ensuring that it lives up to its legacy and provides a positive gaming experience for its dedicated community if they cannot do that then there is no reason to just bring back csgo,528.0,46.0,0,Not Recommended,"November 28, 2023",Counter-Strike 2,"jcbolt

7899,2020 first things first i don t recommend you play the free version oh no paid version sure the game is great really competitive so i would suggest you play it with friends less rage more fun encountering hackers ruin the game i see a lot of positive reviews that read great game but get rid of the hackers that should not be a positive review how can such a big game with such big events have so many cheaters it s like valve doesn t care anymore or even ever cared if you want the game to be free just make it really hard for those who just started to play competitive ranked make someone play at least 20 hours or 15 or maybe even 10 but do something i love playing with my friends who don t own the game and can t actually buy it but one match with a hacker ruins our night and we just end it there and no no you should not have to buy a free game so you don t find hackers that is retarded valve i am just starting to think that you want hackers in the game so people are forced to buy it guess what all the advancements all the progress and all the accomplishments you will ever have mean a lot less to the people you are mistreating now just care a little bit until the day this game will change this review will be negative thanks for reading,280.8,78.0,10,Not Recommended,"April 20, 2020",Counter-Strike 2,Captain Sneakers

7911,2015 community is ruining this game i live in russia and happen to play on russian servers this is incredibly awful experience i must say russians are the cancer of this game they are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others i wish csgo would cost like 30 50 on steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of in it i wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn t help because russians are everywhere it saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting csgo because of it i can t enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40 60 minutes despite the outcome of the match i still feel because they trashtalk 24 7 and rarely able to play this game ps i must notice that there is like 5 of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot not all of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others these guys are a huge minority and this is truly sad,512.9,655.0,96,Not Recommended,"August 10, 2015",Counter-Strike 2,Nomus

7915,2018 a solid game very good shooter mechanics very little support from valve all valve cares about is d o t a 2 only if valve focused on it s anti cheat the community is pretty toxic in csgo i still remember getting kicked from the game for being noob when i was new at the game and getting cheaters in opponent this really leaves a bad taste to the mouth of new players and casual players since they just wanna have a good game many people will say go to esea or faceit but 60 of the playerbase doesn t even know what they do so it s not really a solution to cheaters people like me just wanna get back from school work and have a fun game or two with friends hackers just ruin the game and the worst thing is people don t even kick them they wanna get boosted by hackers but don t understand that getting boosted will do them nothing good let alone by a cheater since if the cheater gets banned they get banned only 50 of the time they will lose their boosted wins thus deranking and cheaters omg where do i start valve please f i x your broken game there are literally threads on the csgo reddit spoonfeeding and showing how to fix certain things v a l v e still wont fix it the fact that there is even an hvh community itself puts valve to shame t h e fact that after almost 6 years valve still can t fix the chear issue in their 2nd most popular game itself is a shame what are you doing valve you guys aren t making a new game hl3 is a m e m e itself no support for tf2 just what the actual are you guys doing this game is like an abusive relationship hate it while you re in it but miss it when you re gone v o l v o p l e a s e f i x y o u r b r o k e n g a m e,604.1,305.0,71,Not Recommended,"June 18, 2018",Counter-Strike 2,"Kissezer

7955,despite counter strike having a prestigious storied history as a competitive multiplayer game the current crowd community difficulty level means that the game is not entirely welcoming to players who aren t optimised towards taking a pre aimed headshot kills mostly 95 of the time this can lead to a very frustrating experience this is made worse with lack of map knowledge requiring a lot of trial error without guidance till you successfully figure out higher success rate pixel peeks and seemingly repeat the same scenario again again it s nice to play with friends but the unforgiving nature of the game means you re probably better playing deathmatch mode than even casual mode any frustrating map elements maps aren t like the cs 1 6 or source days that much more experienced players know how to utilise will only compound any pre existing frustrations,224.8,37.0,3,Not Recommended,August 16,Counter-Strike 2,Liquidus Talon

7968,2013 the third game in the critically acclaimed first person shooter series that have shaped the pc gaming industry for years originally a mod for half life turned into a stand alone had a soruce sequel and now global offensive counter strike 1 6 has long been one of the most played steam titles seeing as the entire steam platform was created with counter strike in mind today global offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base something that counter strike source failed to achieve i was never a hardcore counter strike fan i always had a buddy or two that were better than me therefore i can t tell you the perspective from a experienced cs player a lot of players were disappointed in counter strike source because it did change too much of the core mechanics others were disappointed that the game did not change enough global offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way some core 1 6 players like it and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1 6 or even css better counter strike global offensive offers the same team based versus mode where you spawn buy items and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players the maps are never too big and you always spawn in the same area the main objective is to kill all enemy opponents but there s also the classic objective of planting the bomb or saving the hostages depending on the map once you die you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn classic maps such as de dust and cs office have found their ways into this title as well same goes for most of the classic weapons awp m4a4 ak 47 etc beside the classic competetive team vs team there s arms race and demolition arms race is a adoption of the classic gun game game mode from the original counter strike where the players are in a team deathmatch and each kill will level up your weapon to the better demolition is a cross between arms race and classic plant the bomb objective just on smaller maps there are also time specific events such as operation payback and bravo where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators just like any other modern valve title this game comes with all the steam features including steam workshop where people can share their created weapon skins and maps just like dota 2 the items does not change the gameplay in any way only cosmetic stuff there is also weapon drops in game that players can get with different range of rarities to bring the team fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive as well as casual multiplayer only first person shooter there is plenty of room yet to learn this game even if it seems hard at first,397.9,281.0,0,Recommended,"August 24, 2013",Counter-Strike 2,"Mendozacheers

8018,2023 why would you erase history of the game cs go and nuke the entirety of the community hosting fan made custom content in favor of a match making system you re in the wrong industry if you think gambling algorithms belong in video games it was clear the day match makers were implemented but i think people are finally starting to realize just how detrimental algorithms are compared to the more natural meet and frequent system the server browsers of the old days provided you won t convince me that adding support for the community after the launch is any sort of appeasement as it s been made clear the priority here is algorithms generational changes are inevitable but swapping out systems that were proven to generate the success of the industry in the late 90s early 2000s is nothing but tom foolery it isn t a matter of nostalgia it is the destruction of the very same communities that perpetuate the popularity and strength of the game how could a company built by its fan base making mods some of which turned into full fledged titles become so unfathomably blinded by trash technology designed purely to increase engagement based on fomo principles while directly competing with the fans that want to host their own servers forget the ground breaking engine that has mostly just improved visuals on the surface the implementation of this was perhaps one of the worst launches valve has ever pushed out the store front page was merged with cs go making reviews obsolete this update removed access to a plethora of official maps and modes effectively making this upgrade a downgrade achievements were wiped and added nothing new screw the old days i guess the library logo still displays the cs go logo the store front jargon still mentions cs go rubbing the salt in the eyes everything on the workshop was nuked custom maps game modes the community server browser empty af because no launch warning prior support packages was downgraded to a listing displayed through the steam client as opposed to in game get alt tabbed lmfao what happened to the original ct t models making room for more agent models like cod snoop dog and if we look at the oh so futuristic tech behind the match making ranks were reset entirely have fun playing in algorithmic clusterf matches with no balance whatsoever algorithms still can t determine if a player connecting to the server is actually willing to participate with the team or just play solo in their down time after a long day at work ever seen two dogs on either side of a chain link fence algorithms have mastered the replication of this with humans undisclosed tech offering a competitive environment is bound to have mysterious filters and punishments applied ya ll know what blizzard s overwatch mm does as with any algorithm numbers is the game quantity over quality so long are the days valve waits to release until completion,110.1,40.0,0,Not Recommended,"September 30, 2023",Counter-Strike 2,explosivedeer

8115,2021 counter strike global offensive thankfully remains as counter strike as ever none of what made the series what it is today are absent on the release of course more hardcore players might find something to complain about stuff as absurd as the m4a1 carbine rifle doesn t feel as powerful as it did in previous versions but that expected from people who have way too much time on their hands the truth is counter strike global offensive is a worthy addition to the franchise and for the price tag it s been sold mere 15 dollars it s basically a steal gabe newell raises his hand every time someone buys global offensive and you should go ahead and do it,819.9,54.0,6,Recommended,"September 10, 2021",Counter-Strike 2,Pink Chaddi

8188,2017 the basic concept of competive counter strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years 5 terrorists and 5 counter terrorists fight each other in order to detonate defuse bomb or eliminate entire enemy team to win same old story but everything is polished to a perfection you usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes when playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly cs go servers are really stable and i have never experienced a server or game crash if one players happens to quit drop crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot this is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100 sure lost there are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive i strongly suggest atleast trying arms race and demoliton modes they offer far more easy going less stressful and quicker game sessions counter strike has always been all about teamplay playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast paced you get most out of this game when you are playing with friends most of the cs go community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing bullying insulting and bad sense of humor pretty much in every single game with strangers i have played counter strike since 1999 and playing cs has never been as easy smooth as it is today with cs go easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans history lesson just to point out how easy competive match making is made in cs go i tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000 s first you had to gather 5 friends to play sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players because everyone had to be part of the same clan team you couldn t play with strangers after that you had to go to a specific irc chat channel to find your opponents 5 mins if you had a server of your own up to an hour if you didn t then you confirmed the match with your opponents at clanbase a site that keep track with clans teams wins and losses finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server use console command to start recording your gameplay in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating and start playing after the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning history 10 perfect game9 excelent game best of the genre8 good game worth your time7 average game nothing really special6 bad game avoid5 painful to play completely waste of time4 failed game unpayable,223.6,33.0,4,Recommended,"January 12, 2017",Counter-Strike 2,"Farre

8198,2016 review counter strike global offensive gameplay the game mechanics are in my opinion pretty simple yet extremely effective aiming feels almost flawless no weapons are overpowered if you have enough experience game isnt really trying to be realistic its more of a skillset shooter spraypatterns prefire common spots when to use each weapon economy and blah blah blah 1 taps cs go has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp oriented shooter multiplayer sadly there is the problem as we all know vac isnt the smartest anti cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players wh aim 2000 gaming chair only way to really get past this problem is my using esea or another 3rd party client never used sadly which needs a monthly fee probably other than that the game is pretty fun the community is pretty toxic as it is in almost every competitive multiplayer game there are obviously some mature players but not everyone is 1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages malaka cy ka bly at kur wa ich fick deine mutter youre g ay blo ody bas tard kardashian some examples graphics game looks ok for a 2004 source engine nothing amazing performance runs on a german potato like a charm price its cheap but i personally would pay a premium price for less cheaters recommended if you want to die because of cancer,822.3,17.0,1,Recommended,"September 19, 2016",Counter-Strike 2,"Sermike

8199,2017 this game gives you raging for no reason it doesn t matter you are a peaceful person or not comes with a tumorous disease caused by huge amounts of sodium chloride deafness because children under 10 yell at you with their tesco microphone about your mother who makes sexual intercourse with you or with the kid the child or kid is a too mild expression for these creatures fear when you hear a language which sounds slavic by a person whose weapon is an almighty french smg and they usually want to get to point beta fastly more raging because smurfs but not the blue ones with white hats and unfortunately they rarely go on a vacation doubt in your aiming skills stay calm this is not your fault the hitbox and recoil is a joke tears of pure sadness because the hope of hl2 portal 3 l4d3 and an enjoyable cs lost because the valve swims in the money of the clever people who always buys 100 new cases just to gamble it away and here is other wonders like dota 2 and artifact and here is other goodies like awp spray drops rank system irritating music through mic high ping gloves knives and this is just the tip of the iceberg seriously do not buy this game do not feed the valve buy r6s or pubg instead because of the trinity of the cs go the next update always will be a new case just buy it and you will be the new king gamble it away and buy more and spend more money nobody will help you in the team honestly what do you expect from a russian a 9 years old an afk and a 800 ping guy and the enemy team will contain a smurf an aimbotter a global elite a wallhacker and the guy who only uses aug p90 autosniper or awp and will always insult you you can aim any rank but you will never get it you will stuck in silver forever frankly you will not receive anything from this game it will just suck away your time your money and your neurons it s a shame valve doesn t give a about kids who became gambling addicts because of the skin sitesedit after 1 year i re downloaded the game because i wanted to try out the new mp5sd after some r6s gameplay the shot pattern is just ridiculous and unreal siege has lucky shots too but this game has like 3 4 times more and no my aim not sucks i can use all weapons in the game i ve mastered ak one tapping and awp flickshot guys there is a thousand times better fps shooters on the market insurgency r6s verdun squad arma overwatch etc just dont buy this game you will get mad of it,193.2,235.0,118,Not Recommended,"October 20, 2017",Counter-Strike 2,"Chabitu

8228,2019 i m start by saying that this was a great game for the longest time super simple fun in comp causals or in the arcade type modes i ve spent a many a nights with a couple of cold ones and freinds gathered around the appartment living room just playing on dust 2 for hours and have had a great time doing it however this game is the absolute worst when it comes to people using aimbots wallhacks etc it used to be that you d get one every now and then and you just report him and hope he gets banned and join a new lobby since they made the game free getting banned doesnt matter any more they just start up a new steam account and jump back in i mentioned earlier that finding someone who is actually botting would be a rare ish occurance but tonight i attempted to get some new friends into the game and in the first 3 lobbys 1 casual dustii 2 arms race there where botters just one taping everyone from lundicris angles and distances i know botting is gonna happen but like dang calm down are you so frustrated that the only thing you can do to release that is to boot up a program and no skill your way through matches so after my friends got killed over and over again but some resentful basement dewller i suggested we play a round of competitve surely there wont be as many hackers there right nope had some guy boosting his friends with an aim bot the guy had like a 90 headshot ratio by half time and could hit just about everyone no matter what was going on his account was permently banned by the end of the match but does it matter his friends accounts that were being destroyed by my new to game friends got a comp win due to a series of aimbot aces the guy who was aimboting has probably already created a new account and is back in comp right now boosting his proabally silver 4 friends and now i have 4 friends who dont want to play this game simply because of this experience this may seem like a rant cause it kinda is but i m just tired of it no one wants to play a game with no chance to win the games community will die down evenutally to where there are only devout cs fans botters and the passing interested gamer making this game free to play was a big mistake that i dont believe can be ratified if you have a counterpoint or dissagree with what i said then let me know,217.3,37.0,1,Not Recommended,"January 1, 2019",Counter-Strike 2,"Naptime

8355,2023 to be honest cs2 s performance is completely below expectations after such a long polishing process the outcome is quite disappointing ignoring the existing bugs which i assume will be fixed in future updates the main issues for me are the strange feel of the weapons and odd feedback on headshots giving a waxy sensation the game s visuals perhaps due to my unfamiliarity seem tiring with overly bright brightness despite expecting to adapt quickly to lower graphics settings as in cs go it s evident that the experience lacks the satisfying feeling of the go era lastly it feels like cs2 is leaning towards cf and while some added features like throwable monitoring aren t necessarily bad they seem unnecessary adding an extra layer that might be considered superfluous ultimately having spent my entire university period with this game i hope cs2 can carry the legacy and i trust valve to refine it we ve seen the significant improvements brought by source 2 and i believe cs2 has substantial untapped potential,491.0,34.0,0,Not Recommended,"December 23, 2023",Counter-Strike 2,"FizzzzzyEvens

8388,2021 after putting a decent amount of time into this game i have come to find that is all in all an enjoyable game to play especially so with friends as far as playing games go i have always liked playing competitive fps as i find they are fun to learn and it is satisfying to do well as much as it is fun to win in ranked the skill threshold for this game is sufficiently high while you can still play it casually and enjoy it if you don t mind getting destroyed by the occasional smurf every now and then if you want to improve however this is the easiest way to do so learn recoils for different weapons workshop maps are amazing for this learn nades pop flashes smoke and molly lineups etc up to preference but as i m still learning all the maps i stick to one or two maps when i play before switching to another once i m confident on that map and can remember smokes and where to play watch pro league watching better people play can help you learn how to play youtube videos on how to play are good but i mainly just recommend watching them for nade lineups and good positions to play as good as trying to play like a pro like stewie2k sounds just make sure to remember what works for pros might not necessarily work for you as you probably don t have the game knowledge or aim that they have i e as cool as being like the smoke criminal may sound rushing through t smoke when you re ct probably isn t the greatest idea unless you have really good aim in which case who knows it might work out for you solid 10 10 game if you have good trust factor and time to sink into it,441.7,19.0,3,Recommended,"June 19, 2021",Counter-Strike 2,"Deadeye

8424,2021 game is overall a great game depending on many factors which i will go over in this review to start with this isn t a game you can just jump into and be 1 it takes a lot of practice time and commitment overall i ve played this game for 2 400 hours combined between my multiple accounts i have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game mode and the genre of the game i will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions i will admit this game isn t for the light hearted as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community i have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game you will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people there are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are team work communication skill knowledge and memory team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing it s a lot harder to win when you aren t playing as a team any great team requires great communication communication is an important part as well as knowing what to call and when to call it this game requires some skill at the higher levels a lot more skill this doesn t necessarily mean you need to be the best as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game knowledge and memory go together can t have one without the other in this game you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek where to peek how to peek together and more similar situations to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke how to smoke certain positions as well as flashbangs and other utilities in saying that that is mainly only the competitive side of this game there are many other amazing features offered in this game those being community servers arms races demolition casual and other gamemodes this game has a lot to offer in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers you have surf servers and game servers making it a game for everyone if you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game there are many leagues to join i e faceit and similar there is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards this game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime which is totally worth it there are skins but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing now i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below the negatives 1 the community this will be featured in both areas as it is a downfall and a positive the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming 2 learning curve there is a learning curve for this game so don t expect to jump in and be rambo 3 the cheaters this comes with any game but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently the positives 1 amazing game this game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that 2 requires co operation this game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team 3 fun combat the guns have recoil patterns to learn getting a good one tap is quite fun overall combat is a great aspect of this game 4 top selling game this game is a top selling game for a reason allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing fps thats the good and bad quickly summed up i will be updating this review as time goes on i hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and i will get to you as soon as i can if you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you aslong as you know what your in for hope you all have a lovely day and keep on fragging,724.2,29.0,4,Recommended,"September 4, 2021",Counter-Strike 2,"Makarni

8556,2013 counter strike global offensive is probably the most balanced fps game in all existence i personally started playing counter strike when source had been out for 2 3 years or so i ve always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat and the fact that the game is all skill the re are no unlockables the only things you can earn by playing are stats and skins a pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer that s new to the series other than his skill great engine great servers balanced gameplay smooth gameplay excellently constructed maps stays true to the franchise cheap no unlockables except skins ingame purchases with real moneycounter strike global offensive is the best competition style first person shooter valve has ever made so far theres nothing else to the game than multiplayer and the braindead bots this is a must have for all pc gamers if you dont already have the game pick it up now or get it on the christmas sale in a couple of weeks 9 5 10,236.1,60.0,0,Recommended,"December 14, 2013",Counter-Strike 2,DOOMSD4YY

8649,2021 how to charge for a game and noone complains1 allow cheaters and do nothing about it2 charge for prime account3 profit the crowd not only doesnt complain but applauds for the anti cheating measuresso out of nowhere you make everyone who is bellow rank 21 to have to pay 15 to get prime if someone is rank 20 and needs only few games to reach the free prime i saw a guy who just needed 100 exp thats ridiculous gets literally nothing but someone that got the rank just before the update gets a free 15 prime thats some weird logic the least they could do is give a discount to the ranks that were close to 21 according to how close they were another thing is to make everyone who got their prime without paying to have to buy it but since it was your policy to give a free prime you should give the discount otherwise the game is actually nice if you mute the mostly toxic chat and get used to finding games without cheaters but hey now you can pay 15 and you get decent matches without cheaters at least not so much that we previously didnt care about and they probably still dont they just hope they will buy multiple accounts more profit,152.2,54.0,5,Not Recommended,"June 5, 2021",Counter-Strike 2,Porditsos

8701,2016 note this is a temporary review i m still pretty new to the game so i ll write another one when i invest waste more hours on it my first gamei remember it really well because it was a game that summed up csgo almost perfectly dust 2 a micspammer named martin shkreli playing mlp at earrape volume 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from rush b i had no idea what i was doing no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned not surprisingly i went 1 and 13 or something like that gamemodescasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good kd ratio 60 of the time dust 2 30 mirage and 10 another map such as cache or cobblestone however these maps you most likely will play in competitive so you can sharpen your skills and map knowledge here pretty easily competitive can be amazing and it can be terrible it all depends on how good your team is and how good the opposing team is i strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don t get a team full of bogans russians idiots whatever if i solo queue my team will look something like this at it s worst some solo queue games can be cool meamerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensangry australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseanother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuessomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team or a 12vieother team uber smurfsomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiessomeone in a partysomeone else in the same party who says ez every time they win a roundanime enthusiast who always runs awp and scoutuh i haven t actually tried out any other gamemodes like arms race and deathmatch but from youtube they look pretty cool weapons and strategy silver style terrorists assuming they win each round round one tec 9 rush b cyka blyat idi nahui round two some smg round three aks round four and onwards someone buys an awp rest buy aks and armorcounter terrorists assuming they win each round round one five seven or armor plus decoy round two some smg round three p90 or m4 m4a1 s round four and onwards someone buys an awp rest buy m4 m4a1 s or p90 and armoreco round doesn t exist in low silver xdsave doesn t really happenstrategy b rush b blyat long a short a a split and that s about it you will get yelled at if you use the autosnipers p90 camp with an awp or accidentally teamkill rank up systemcs go has 2 rank systems one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with against having a separate rank system for competitive is a great idea as it encourages players to play more and work as a team however this can be abused and valve can t really do anything about it smurfinga smurf is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and creates buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level you can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles if they have few friends low hours in other games etc if you manage to kill a smurf rub it in their face you killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically sure its a dirty tactic but who really cares in this game vac system overwatchyeah not much of an expert on this one since i can t really detect subtle hackers etc however i think it s a little better than the tf2 vac system since players in the community can review evidence sent to them if they have overwatch and make the decision communityi ve heard many times that the cs go community is toxic and cancer because of the people that play the game it s true if you play this game you will meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die but thats what makes cs go stand out from other games it s much more than a game for millions of players many people basically spend all their time playing this game and i don t blame them personally i can t get bored of this game there is always something new you can do without the toxic community cs go probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently but that s just my opinion in game the community is very vocal with about half the players using a mic to yell call strats communicate good or bad stereotypical cs go players in australia nz sweaty nerds who play basically nonstopunmarried adult males who yell at their teammates yo this guy is literally a 20 year old male guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they re not cuties and hotties right here rich kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game here again australian bogans basically russians here anime profile pic who is really good at the gamepeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers jeez there a lot of themgrill gamerspeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them youtube presence mlg cs gothere are a ton of amazing cs go youtubers out there i recommend you check out warowl mojoonpc sparkles nick bunyun 3kliksphillip etc the tutorials can be pretty helpful and give you some game sense i know nothing about mlg cs go but it seems pretty big i basically chose a team at random envyus and supported them pashabiceps will always be my favorite player though since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit cs go skins and casesi ve already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins i want hey it s better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites also i wouldn t recommend unboxing cs go cases as you should just buy off the community market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit however if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife glove valve game developerseh i ve seen many reviews saying that cs go is dying valve pays no attention to the game anymore omg valve is ditching us for dota and this possibly could be true valve just wants money like any business would however i don t really any need for valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly unlike tf2 which has a 5 man development team note again that this is just my current opinion since i m still a newbie to the game friendly aspect to the game knife fights mid don t really count and the only friendly game i played was on cache with people spraying on the wall i left that one what a surprise cs go is a very competitive game so i wouldn t reccomend going friendly as you ll most likely get killed and kicked stick to hightower overall opinionit s an amazingly good game it could do with a little bit more attention from valve but has a huge player base constantly second most played on steam and will not die anytime soon the community is very diverse but don t take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay the game is played across the globe hence the name global offensive and will be for many years to come dayum that was a long review its just that cs go has so much in it to cover it s pretty good,414.2,26.0,7,Recommended,"December 30, 2016",Counter-Strike 2,"Scootie

8816,2017 the procces of playing csgo the high valve have managed to copy the exact contents of pur heroine and put it into a game thats what this is you love it while it lasts and you feel great running around shooting people and then you start to tripthe trip there is a smurf in the enemies team who has 4 games and 50 hours but regardless will ace you silvers as you rush b without even realoding his gun then the trip gets worse ands you start to find hackers who trace you through the wall and have snapaim in 0 001 seconds and then the worst part the 8 year old kid who slept with your mother in small doses they are annoying but manageable however they come in swarms of thousands found in every game on every server 80 are russian and they will find your house rehab then you eventually see what this is doing to you you have become salty and toxic you got a microphone just so you could scream abuse at your teammates who missed and got one tapped so you decide to uninstall the game and do something with your life at first you might find something to do maybe your gardening or learning to cook or even some work which you have never before tried finishing withdrawal symptoms but then you start to feel depressed everything around you is grey there are no bomb sights or noobs who will rush out for you to shoulder peek you feel empty you log on to your computer and boot up steam and you see it sitting there just sitting there you just think to yourself well what can be the harm so you decide to reinstall it and as its redownloading you just look through all your screenshots at your amazing k ds which you can never repeat and that time you knifed a guy and teabagged him before getting shot in the side of the head you start to impatiant you want it it calls to you you need it then after you sat there watching the whole download its done you race to get it on your hands moving almost by their own accord and your back on only this time you cant leave you had your chanc you are addicted moral of the story dont play this gamer get pubg and possably even a proper life to come with it hell you might even make some friends whos faces you actually have seen before,923.7,17.0,4,Not Recommended,"August 28, 2017",Counter-Strike 2,"The Christopherous

8817,2014 counter strike global offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend it s a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the source engine to new players csgo may feel a little back to the basics as this game does not have aiming down the sight unlocks attachments perks and killstreaks so it s heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks this game does have a ranking system but it s different from all the other shooters which i ll explain later on but the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked it s also a tactical teamplay based shooter so don t even think about buying it if you don t like teamplay only a good team can lead you to victory not a highly skilled lone wolf csgo offers a small variety of game modes those are deathmatch arms race demolition classic casual and classic competitive for those of you who are familiar with cod arms race is called gun game in cod you start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you ll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game what s rather interesting about arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins demolition is a combination between classic i ll explain classic later in the review and arms race the goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you ll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs in my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because i never really feel the need to play them there s also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual team deathmatch it s played 5v5 and all weapons are available except for grenades you play in a team but it s every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins what s also interesting about deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points in my opinion deathmatch shouldn t be taken to serious it s a good gamemode to improve your aim and i know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that s in my opinion not the way counter strike is supposed to be played so that leaves classic casual and classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes therefore i ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes classic consists of the two original counter strike game modes defuse mission and hostage mission in hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists in defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it s planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system you ll receive money for all sorts of things playing a round of course the winning team receives more in most cases completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills the kill reward depends on the weapon a rifle or pistol will give you 1 kill reward while an smg except for p90 gives you 2 kill reward a shotgun gives 3 kill reward and a knife gives 5 kill reward while the awp gives only 0 5 kill reward at the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don t spend will carry over to the next round so now the differences between casual and competitive in casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins in casual you ll receive more money if you lose a round less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300 the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual competitive is played 5v5 and casual can be played 10v10 in competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual in casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you re not supposed to leave until the game is finished because if you do you ll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and i ve seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown this is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you ll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair if you play casual you ll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win lose ratio and you ll play with people of the same skill level as you there s also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules use community maps or even have completely different game modes i don t spend a lot of time on community servers so i can t tell you more than this in my opinion competitive is the way to play csgo i spend by far most of my time playing competitive casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive if you re new though i advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge why should you do this in casual well competitive is way more serious there s also an option to play against bots if you re new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players the only negative points i can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn t always works as it is supposed to work and the ranking system has to be improved at the time of writing i am silver elite master fifth rank but some silver elites fourth rank are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players seventh rank are much worse and they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in cs s are way harder than expert bots in csgo making bot practice less useful over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter i even watch csgo e sport it s a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks i give csgo a 10 10 this doesn t mean the game is perfect of course it can be improved but it s based on the fun factor and even though i sometimes hate this game out of pure frustration i ll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it,848.8,17.0,0,Recommended,"January 31, 2014",Counter-Strike 2,"Cor Pornosnor

8826,i really love counter strike i loved cs go and i love the idea of cs 2 why is this review bad because valve up the execution of this idea so bad that it s kinda hard to believe 1 the anti cheat it is literally not existent there are cheaters everywhere in higher ranks at launch there were tons of false bans which is what leads me to believe that valve disabled the ac until they can make sure that no one is getting falsely banned anymore unfortunately this results in spinbotters aimhackers wallhackers and bhop scripters going absolutely wild in comp premiere and wingman there are people spraying the awp and teleporting to the second bomb site in wingman how is that even possible 2 the net code it s bad really bad there is rubber banding faulty hit reg the tagging teleports you back from behind cover movement feels off and i m sure there is more that i missed 3 the servers they re now hardcoded to 64 tick afaik they lag badly sometimes i ve had people just teleporting all over the place this was visible to everyone not just me there is constant package loss downloading demos is buggy sometimes the subtick system doesn t solve in fact the gameplay feels so much worse than in any other shooter 4 the linux build valve is known to care a lot about linux support and so do i to say that i was disappointed when i first fired up cs 2 on my linux powered gaming pc would be an understatement cs go s linux build was flawless it was better than the windows build especially when it comes to performance but cs 2 sound didn t work performance is still unacceptable sound will sometimes vanish in the middle of a game and for some people the game didn t even start up another fun one is that on certain mesa versions smokes are invisible free and undetectable wallhacks for everyone with and intel or amd gpu oh wait the game doesn t work properly on intel gpus i believe this is also the case on windows so screw arc users i guess 5 the windows build you thought valve wouldn t up the windows build apparently you re wrong i don t run the windows built myself so i can only speak for some of my friends who are running windows apparently it s really unstable a friend of mine constantly experienced crashes others had awful performance just like i have on the linux build and radeon users had a really bad time with shader stutter at least valve fixed that one now 6 content i m not gonna make a detailed list here basically cs 2 is missing 60 of cs go s content i m talking maps player models modes even features and console commands rip cl righthand 0 note left handed view models are back game still sux tho 7 the discontinuation of cs go i wouldn t be so mad if valve just gave us the option to continue to play the better cs cs go unfortunately they don t give us this option match making is gone and community servers are almost always completely empty if you can even find a working one the server browser if because it shows both cs go and cs 2 servers and setting up a community server yourself requires an obscure sourcemods plugin to un the lobby system otherwise no one can join the server if you disable lan mode the plugin is called nolobbyreservation i know why valve did it but i honestly do not care if cs 2 is so bad that nobody will play it if they have the option then it should not be released stop forcing this garbage onto us and let us play cs go again until you managed to make cs 2 as playable as the other counter strike titles,972.5,19.0,0,Not Recommended,April 10,Counter-Strike 2,CNR_07

9098,2020 yeah no this game is full of cheaters i regret buying it in the past only to find out it became such a sausage fest entire communities of cheaters people posting videos on x platform showcasing gameplay with cheats account trading this is a thing now to have skins while cheating because nobody cheats with skins overwatch sucks as apparently big game cheaters avoid it easily i don t know man maybe i m too frustrated over cheaters but this is the truth many of your games will feature at least one so good luck winning while having your fun ruined oh and one more thing don t think you can just kick the cheater if they are on your team and restore the fun this ain t happening since most of them are partied up with at least one of your teammates and to all the people who work on cheats for games like this one and sell them i know this is your work and maybe you need the money but sincerely f k you with the knowledge you have you could do honest work to earn your living not feed off a toxic community of people who can t use their mouse to aim and prefer ruining other people s fun out of rage and or boredom i m throwing this game in the garbage can until it hopefully gets better,228.5,22.0,5,Not Recommended,"August 21, 2020",Counter-Strike 2,Mista

9528,2018 amazingly enough this game keeps making you more and more furious about how it is it starts with hackers a lot of them so much so that until you cross the silver barrier the servers will be crawling with hackers second is servers they re soo bad sometimes that neither you or the opposite team are able to play and both teams keep spamming the chat with rage comments on srevers now with panorama you cannot even report servers if they re taking it to a whole new level third worst updates possible i don t get it if they re trying to fix the game with updates or ruin it specially with the latest panorama update which has crippled everyone s performance whether it be ping loss or fps everything is just went downhill since then fourth worst customer support remember if you re facing an issue with the game its your hardware and your internet not the valve they re perfect they literally take the apple approach to performance issues with the game instead of helping you optimize the game they ll recommend going to a technician to help optimize the game and spend money there coz the money you give to buy the game doesn t include tech support fifth though this can be included in performance issue but there s times when the game will straight up freeze upon seeing an enemy or wont register hits even if you empty the whole magzine on their faces only get the game if it is a gift or it s on sale it doesn t worth the full price review update right after i wrote the review i got some hacks which would help me aim and wall and played till i got vac ban which is for 250hrs and going from sem to lem being a waller myself i can gaurantee upon that atleast 50 people have vision assist of some kind and atleast 30 have some kind of trigger aim assist i wanted to prove that anyone can hack easily in this game even with free hacks which i used and can play for longer periods of time undetected i got overwatch ban just because i got bored of it and started raging if it weren t for that i could have reached to ge very easily,655.7,18.0,0,Not Recommended,"September 2, 2018",Counter-Strike 2,Anonymoose

9558,2015 i have played this game since october of 2013 and nothing has been fixed they continue to add broken weapons and being unable to properly balance weapons the tec9 is still op it took them months to fix the cz the m4a1 s is still the king of ct weapons due to its lowered spread recoil and higher damage at ranges the hitboxes are still awful because of how animations are blended and not snapped into place you need to be rank 3 to play competitive even if you re a global elite or legendary eagle master meaning you have to play with silvers for 6 hours if you want to play competitive it s especially bad considering you have to buy an operation bloodhound pass to get xp faster they should ve just kept it the same as it was in january of 2013 without the flash boosting the c4 planting and jumping hitboxes were still messed up but it was generally just a better game i refuse to play this game until they fix the hitboxes which has no eta currently but valve has acknowledged it so basically they said screw you we re not fixing the hitboxes thanks for the money what a joke of a game developed by a joke of a company i can t believe that they have let the game get to this state and valve s support is a joke in general enjoy waiting 2 weeks to get a reply edit i know all the dumb and blinded fanboys are going to dislike this review but believe me you will feel this way when you actually look at the technical aspects of this game and believe it or not there is a game beyond betting and skins i know hard to believe,363.5,73.0,10,Not Recommended,"June 28, 2015",Counter-Strike 2,alvy

10012,2016 tldr game with full potential 7 5 10 game with community on most days 3 10what is cs go it is a game that uses mechanics that were last common around the year 2000 or rather around then some mechanics were absent in most big shooter titles that are still absent in cs go no aiming down the sights or zooming in for most weapons no sprinting no leaning around corners no weapon bashing rng plays somewhat a role while firing that is how i explain how i have not killed some people at point blank range but i have scored headshots while jumping around spraying in peoples general directions what is good about it i like the basic idea short and sweet rounds that require a plan to win one team needs to secure an objective most commonly plant and detonate a bomb in one of two possible locations while the other team succeeds by preventing the former team from reaching their goal you need to hide well and rotate around the map in a timely fashion map knowledge and tactics theoretically get rewarded this is a game that rests upon a good idea that gets better when playing with co operative people a thing you may not enjoy are this game s microtransactions in the form of weapon skins and operation passes temporary access to maps and more skins be aware most of the community seems to be obsessed about these purely cosmetic skins and there are still a few elitists around who hate on people for not owning nice skins just a tip on what to expect from the community more follows 2020 update this game s microtransactions should have been its first major red flag to steer clear of it what is critically bad about it valve do not appear to care about the state of the game not the least about the community or do not appear capable to solve its rampant issues in the many years i have owned the game little has changed except for the fact that assault rifles seem to be harder to stabilise nerfed a major competitive map that got reworked came out worse than before and at some point valve thought it was a great idea to add a fully unbalanced revolver that behaves like a one handed one shot kill sniper rifle except easier to handle also even in competitive matches i see players with high ping who lag matchmaking in general seems to be off in my own unranked matches i have faced players with almost a thousand hours of experience more drastically instead of finding an effective way to keep problematic players out they have added next to the competitive ranks new xp ranks and a system of cooldowns so during your first dozens of hours of playing you will often run into the game telling you you cannot play not being allowed to play a game which you have payed for is a feature a bit peculiar how that works a better solution this game really needs in my opinion is a more thorough reputation system that separates the wheat from the chaff i e ban the riff raff even if they re 99 of the player base i have mentioned the basic idea of this game is very good and it becomes better while playing with co operative players however these players are becoming increasingly harder to find which lowers the enjoyment found in this game immensely when i start insurgency arma or verdun i expect to find well behaved and polite people in each session queuing for a match in cs go by contrast feels like playing russian roulette playing cs go on a regular basis requires you to become callous or unpleasant yourself to deal with other players a match should routinely start with locating the problematic ones and muting and or reporting b lol valve don t care b these people in the vast majority of matches you should expect to encounter at least one of these categories a cheater using easily available and applicable hacks a smurf intentionally playing on a lower level than his actual skill group and hereby denying the chance to other people of having a fair match and ranking up themselves a deranker or group of derankers who intentionally make their team lose the match with or without the full agreement of the team and finally a troll griefer or other general kind of person who behaves clinically mentally underdeveloped only once have i seen someone who i d reported get a vac ban these cheaters and derankers organise themselves in steam groups of sometimes tens of thousands of people and valve do not seem interested in banning or removing these in general policing the community is nowhere on valve s task list according to my experiences this poses a major problem for players who cannot rank up due to being defeated by cheaters smurfs and griefing team mates hence being stuck in the lower ranks or silver hell before i summarise this review a few anecdotes of what concrete behaviour to expect from the community all experienced over the course of one week on a daily basis players from the same few language groups of preteen to adolescent age that keep spamming the same expletives and curses in their native languages to you and never share useful information in a mutually comprehensible language after a while and some googling you recognise the pattern that they are continuously expressing the desire to commit various sorts of rape upon your female family members and so on also randomly vote kicked by these bigoted groups even if one is the best player of the team me very nice people speak english please them rude refusal followed by a whole match of shouting torturing my eardrums instead we could have used sharing information and planning to win the match derankers throwing mollies at themselves in spawn reducing the length of each round to five seconds two people claimed to be smurfs they played with pistols only and when we were miraculously salvaging the match they started committing team kills tried to get team killed obstructed team members initiated random vote kicks demanded we would abandon our weapons and more such trolling from a certain bunch mother mary is a pig isis attack brussels haha armenian genocide is big lie suck a my brown male organ a twitch streamer with a vac ban on a three months old acount upon learning i had two friends with me who were new to the game gtfo they re feces noob noob izi noob noob number of truly pleasant matches in one week while regularly playing one to state the blunt truth if you get stereotypical russian or other eastern euro gopniks intolerant middle easterners of whatever persuasion crass chavs others more rarely as well especially when adolescents teens or even younger virtually every match you re f cked 9 10 times i became interested in cs go by watching youtubers like anderzel however now i feel a bit cheated and i realise these people only upload the one in twenty matches or so that runs its course without problems in conclusion the game itself in theory is easily worth 7 10 at least which is why some well meaning people such as i want to keep playing in practice this score gets cut in half or worse be aware if you want to play and especially pay for this game you are agreeing that you purchase an experience where you undergo abuse from the socially unadapted in all kinds of languages from all over the world revealing the true meaning of the game s name global ly offensive some people say it takes over a thousand hours to become truly competent at this game this game only shines if you play with trustworthy people if you are not yet committed to this game and you have no four mates to play along decide for yourself if you want to play something else go cycling have dinner dates play with your children for a thousand hours instead of listening most of that time to overly disrespectful screaming pre teens who do not wish to cooperate 2020 minor content and layout

10079,2019 yea cheaters suck not the biggest problem though smurfs are ridiculous literally the same as cheaters to lower level players and yet no plans to do anything about them that one guy who got 50 kills and 2 deaths in your last game he was just having a good game totally nothing wrong with putting you up against that oh also we re gonna do it again next game honestly the game is ok casual sucks but competitive is a occasionally good time especially with friends though i only keep playing because i have an unhealthy video game addiction tearing my life apart but that s beside the point the game as is is not fun it is not fair balanced or even remotely logical loads of the guns need reworks and the whole competitive elo thing is broken 10 10 voice acting would go sneaky beaky again just in a different game,641.4,27.0,9,Not Recommended,"January 17, 2019",Counter-Strike 2,Snow
