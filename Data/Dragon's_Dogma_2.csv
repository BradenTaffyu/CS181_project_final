74800,it was fun and i enjoyed it its impossible not to but as someone who waited ages for a dd1 sequel that was finally given the time and budget to feel complete this game wasn t it i can sum up my disappointment with the fact that you spend the entire game fighting the same 4 5 enemy types that you spent the whole game fighting in dd1 goblins saurians harpies wolves and humans make up 99 of all normal encounters dd2 has almost all of the problems that 1 had and more all while feeling even more incomplete due to a lack of quests and basically no main story it has a beginning and an end with no middle bigger world better open world mechanics not nearly enough content to go in it this was not the showing that we should expect from a company like capcom in this day and age i will never understand how companies keep making games based around combat and then include so few enemies all this time and almost nothing new aside from a few bosses i ve seen so many people defend the lack of enemies as if adding an enemy or a unique moveset is the most impossible task in the world this is not an indie game this isn t even a new series when you re in a climactic fight with a rival you ve been building up you don t just make them the same human enemy you ve fought 800 times you can t just model swap the same saurian 4 times and call it content i hate that so many players give these things a pass i enjoyed the game but i just can t recommend it given the context especially at this price,67.9,762.0,4,Not Recommended,21 April,Dragon's Dogma 2,Kii
74811,being almost 70 years old normally i cannot play games like this as my manual dexterity just is not on par however having ai control my partner and my two hirelings allows me to form a well rounded party and when tough fights come they make up for any slack from me i have over 240 hours in this game and have loved every minute of it i wish there were more games like this for those of us with physical imitations this game is completely playable as long as you have a sharp mind more than a sharp sword cudos to capcom other than thaty i will spend about 10 seconds on saying what every one else has the graphics are stunning the gameplay is smooth the storyline is enticing for me a 11 10,240.6,222.0,5,Recommended,September 19,Dragon's Dogma 2,Zokushi
74812,pros the world looks amazing and stunning it s huge more options for fast travel no spoilers explore it multiple vocations classes than can be changed anytime in cities villages combat is fluid not clunky lots of items there are things that can only be found in different places because it s like an exclusive option to buy stuffs for real money for players that don t want to grind everything can be achievable for free so you don t need to pay for it if you like grinding pawn system is fun you can meet other players pawns and when you dismiss them you can even give feedback and a gift to the other player during a sale it is definitely worth buying you can have a lot of fun with dragon s dogma 2 cons optimization problems mostly in the cities the variety of enemies can get pretty boring if you stay in the same area for long periods of time the dialogues of the pawns can be repeated several times within a short time which can frustrate some players pawns roam the map and different pawns may repeatedly try to stop you to introduce themselves to you to try to recruit them some people are bothered by this but if you avoid them and not go close to them this can be avoided it has a hate train because of these the microtransactions which is optional bad launch and this is not a sequel of the first game but rather a reboot there are things that were in dragon s dogma dark arisen that are missing from dragon s dogma 2 beside the problems dragon s dogma 2 has i really enjoy it s gameplay hopefully we ll get a dlc that fixes the existing issues and will arrive with a lot of new content thank you for reading,100.9,407.0,9,Recommended,August 20,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Reyik

74815,this is going to be a revised and re written review of the game following my third playthrough ng of my 2nd character around 300 hours of in game play time i think i m finally ready to put the game down until we get dlc which i think the game will very badly need to have the relevance a sequel like this should ve had i still would not recommend it until then the good the combat of the game really is exceptional it is very similar to dd1 nearly the same in core design really but executed in such a satisfying way the added weight and energy given to attacks and movement plays a big part in that it helps to further ground the game in a sort of fantastical realism that the first game didn t quite have since it was comparatively fast and floaty at times the world design is phenomenal in my opinion its really impressive to me that they got a map this big and detailed and populated to be a seamless open world it has its drawbacks namely performance but as a technical feat its crazy what they have done for a capcom game there s very little if anything that feels like an oversight or afterthought the game as a whole just looks fantastic great design great direction great environments and great atmosphere enemies look wonderful griffons and dullahans stick out to me as exceptional griffons for how stunning they look and dullahans for just how hectic and dangerous they are as a humanoid enemy i will agree with others that there is a lack of enemy variety but it personally never bothered me much because combat is still so different from encounter to encounter enemy placement enemy composition enemy tactics and the terrain you fight in play a big part in how you will approach each situation it keeps the gameplay very fresh and fun well beyond what i would expect for a game with a limited bestiary these points make up probably 80 of your time with the game and it is good that they did them all so well it made it so that my time with the game was largely enjoyable the whole way through and i could recommend the game on those points alone if you can overlook all the other issues i will be laying out ahead the mixedas great as the combat feels in this game there is simply less choice and less to do than in dd1 all the classes lost at least a few abilities spells the physical combat classes fighter warrior thief and archer all are great some class skills got made into core skills so the transition from 6 skills to 4 really didn t hurt them much would ve been nice to see the return or implementation of combo based inputs to further expand their core skillset but i wouldn t say it feels lacking without them mages and sorcerers lost almost all their indirect defensive offensive skills i cannot understate how comparatively butchered they are in this version of the game are they still useful yes but between the move from 6 to 4 spell slots and the removal of different boons buffs and debilitations they are far less flexible mages are relegated to a hard support role with almost no direct offensive capabilities no 2nd tier of offensive skills like comestion or brontide no poison and no torpor torpor admittedly was busted sorcerers got some good spells but lost a lot of other good spells as well they re great at applying debilitations in this game which are very strong but it feels more like a sidegrade than an upgrade to the walking magical nuke they were in dd1 strangely only bolide now meteorn and maelstrom returned from the first game as an avid sorcerer lover in dd1 to me it just leaves sorcerer in an odd place to me where you either use their normal lower tier spells which dont hit that hard and are great at applying status effects or you instantly blow up every enemy with meteorn through brute force alone really feast or famine in my eyes in terms of class fantasy the removal of spell free aiming also hurts maelstrom i wish mystic spearhand had some elemental damage skills its an alright class but it has a lot of built in drawbacks that only kindof justify their strength very lacking in good offensive skills a third of their skills feel gimmicky and or bad i will not entertain mirror shield apologists the class is not strong just because it has a broken defensive skill i wish we could cook fish at campfires too instead of just beast steaks items and crafting in general are under utilized weapon selection is not as good as it could ve been in my opinion especially knowing dd1 had a similar issue wish we had more good enchanted weapons for each class a lot of npcs have capes we cannot have give us their capes get rid of the dragonforged visual it looks bad i wish there were more randomized boss encounters they re the most fun part of the game to me but they dont let them appear out of their spawn areas enough the badthe main story isn t great starts okay in vernworth but very quickly loses any rhyme or reason once you reach battahl if you spend longer than 5 minutes thinking about any individual facet of the story and the characters therein you will probably find some issue for a game that advertised 60 hours to complete i quite frankly see that as a failure don t know what they were thinking when writing it and sadly i dont think it can be fixed with updates or dlcs the themes of the story retread on a lot of the themes from the first game but do it worse and also make less sense and explain less if you are the kind of person that wants to be engrossed by the world and get attached to characters the game does a pretty bad job of doing that and thats after 3 playthroughs really just a flop all around side quests aren t much better there are at least some interesting ones but nowhere close to anything worth writing home about a lot of running from person to person and place to place or passing time waiting on events not even many quests you can fail the objective of outside of advancing the main story or outright killing the quest npc just feels like the team somehow hasn t learned anything from the past decade of rpg games that preceded it characters themselves are overall less memorable than they were in dd1 in my opinion they added so many more of them and they individually just have less going on there are a few i actually did come to like and ones that i would say had good or compelling stories but even other major characters do nothing to draw you in the romance system is so archaic and wasted in this game even how its tied into the story is less impactful and clumsier than in dd1 the fact i can romance disa let alone be let in the same room as her causes such narrative dissonance in my head that i find it boggling really its just used as a way to get discounts at shops thats all its good for loot distribution in the game is dire almost everything you use you will buy in a shop the world is so fun to explore and see but they reward you for it so badly best loot you could really hope for in an area is finding some seekers tokens would very much recommend the wild loot mod its not perfect but its a massive improvement to the actual adventuring and looting aspect of the game we need some harder difficulties asap dont know how an itsuno game has come out in 2024 that has no official hard mode and no sort of replayable challenge to push the character you spend dozens of hours building up the game is an incredible foundation for more to come but with how long its been since dd1 it shouldn t have needed to be just a foundation personally i think it could use either an iceborne tier expansion to make it whole or more than one bbi sized dlc there is so much good in this game that they just didn t do enough with until some serious content additions come out or big updates happen i cant recommend the game it does not feel complete great action game terrible rpg,361.6,648.0,4,Not Recommended,May 28,Dragon's Dogma 2,Orion
74818,tech demo 2 eternal boogaloo looking back twelve years later it s clear that the original dragon s dogma earned its well deserved cult following not only for what it had to offer but for what it could have been the clear signs of cut or unfinished content became obvious to anyone who spent enough time with the game and series creator hideaki itsuno s 2013 gdc presentation touting the finished product as being only half of what they had envisioned for the game only helped to fan those flames it was not uncommon to see the game described as the best 7 10 game ever made or an unfinished gem in my review of the game i made the bold claim that while dragon s dogma was not the greatest arpg ever created it was the tech demo for it fast forward a decade and against all odds capcom was actually convinced to take a risk on greenlighting a sequel while initially cautiously optimistic further trailers and presentations only increased enthusiasm of many long time fans of the series helmed by itsuno s claims that the sequel s design philosophy was to be a faithful as possible to the original as it turns out this claim was painfully accurate dragon s dogma 2 is a game that performs worse in as many categories as it improves on dragon s dogma 1 to give a small sample improvements the artstyle was perfectly translated to the new engine and the increased graphical fidelity that came with it character creator is more robust adding new customization options that make character designs more unique even though everyone still only makes waifu pawns combat movement positioning standing on top of monsters more verticality via moves and nearby terrain enemies will fight each other call reinforcements and multiple boss monsters can appear at once pawn dialogue pawns will respond to each other talk about contextual topics like their vocations etc a larger more fleshed out yet still unfinished and somewhat underutilized world that facilitates the sense of adventure that the game strives for a near complete lack of loading screens also greatly helps this sense of adventure and immersion emphasis on foot travel planning out your party composition and equipment requiring the use of hub areas for rest and restocking superior yet clearly unfinished endgame the endgame expands on the overarching lore of the world and the cycle that binds it downgrades combat movement arguably some players dislike the added weight and delay compared to the snappy movement of dd1 i disagree in most scenarios except for how monster parkour is not nearly as viable anymore you can pinpoint the coronation cutscene as the exact moment the main questline begins to absolutely fall apart the entire battahl arc is a clearly unfinished disjointed string of quests that are confusing either for your character s motives or how they are meant to weave into anything else going on around you most npcs are completely uninteresting and little more than set pieces dragon s dogma 1 had tons of npcs with important dialogue relating to the world quests and other characters which would update with new dialogue the further you progressed the main story this is almost completely absent in dd2 the heavy emphasis on npc interactivity not only with the player but with other npcs is allegedly the main cause of the performance issues that still plague this game for many people with even mid range setups this feature ends up being barely noticeable and is absolutely not worth the cost to cpu performance the loss of the gauntlet boot and underclothes slots makes fashion much less varied especially with how class restricted much of the armor is not enough context based core skills to warrant the loss of 2 skill slots compared to dd1 less skills to choose from compared to dd1 especially for mages sorcs severe lack of david lodge voicing the dragon although the new va did a pretty decent job from my perspective very few of the issues that i have with this game boil down to it s actual design philosophy many people do not like the constant walking or how it does not hold you hand with many quests and mechanics being left up to the player to discover this game is not going to appeal to everyone and that is fine they doubled down on many aspects of the philosophy from the first game and i am happy that they did in reality the most damning problem that this game has it that it has managed to fall into nearly every single development related pitfall that befell dragon s dogma 1 most of my gripes about this game are not about what they did but what they did not or could not do was it rushed out the door to increase quarterly profits was it never given the budget time and development team size that it needed in the first place did it suffer from complications due to work at home restrictions during the pandemic or because of issues that needed to be resolved while translating the re engine to an open world setting was it mismanaged by directors and producers and doomed to fail regardless of any other problems that may or may not have occurred during development i don t know i don t think we ll ever know if you are confused as to why this is marked as a positive review i do not blame you the easy answer is that steam s rating system just like every other modern platform s binary like dislike system is stupid the more nuanced answer is that i have been harsh on this game only because it feels like it could be so much more than what it is and after now experiencing this feeling for two games in a row i have much less sympathy to offer i am disappointed in the final product and yet at the same time dragon s dogma offers so many things that cannot be found in any other game it is a rollercoaster of quality but its peaks stand high above most other games at the end of the day i still enjoyed my time with dragon s dogma 2 regardless of what happened to this game there is a faint glimmer of hope as capcom executives seem to have realized the potential this series has claiming it to be among their core franchises whether it be updates to the base game expansions or an eventual sequel only time will tell whether they will keep their word and finally give us a fully realized product or if we are doomed to repeat this cycle of wondering what could have been,269.7,295.0,9,Recommended,July 5,Dragon's

74826,played for about 4 hours in albeit at a really slow pace because i wanted to test the limits of the game and fool around a bit the good it s a good rpg at its core with good combat mechanics gameplay elements and in general just solid gameplay design outside of a few things we ll get to that the bad let s get it out the way first the game is very very very badly optimised in not just the performance optimisation but also the graphical aspect of it it s not a bad looking game but it s not exactly a super good looking one and definitely not one that should be so graphically intensive not to mention the cpu intensiveness in town the graphics texture themselves are rather dated and in the grand scheme of things look like something out of the age of monster hunter world while having about a 2 to 4 times graphics processing requirement for context cpu 7800x3d gpu amd 7800xt frame rate at 1440p without frame gen tech below 60 in the main screen around 60 80fps around normal play that s atrociously bad graphic optimisation not to mention city issues many design elements makes sense in the first dragon s dogma and no longer do these days why is the riftstone mechanics making a reversal compared to what was implemented in dragon s dogma s dark arisen why is the game design taking a step backwards bad game qol in first game being propagated back to the second even after so many years issues with single save file issue with how the save is being done issue with how romance works with the game the list goes on story wise tbh i feel like it s higher production value worse execution but this is just personal preference ymmv the mtx thing leaves a sour taste in my mouth because it gives the vibes that the qol features arent properly implemented so that they mtx at least makes some sense if you are reading this review and want to have 1 takeaway it is that although the game is fun i will highly recommend to at the minimum delay the purchasing of the game until it s on sale it s not 70 dollar good even on a pc like mine which can run it without issues with some help i e frame gen fsr tuning down some configs and running it at 1440p instead of 4k moreover it s very evident that it s an incomplete game that is released at this timing because capcom is looking for the last inflow of revenue before the end of the financial year if you still want to play the game badly and is willing to pay full price but feel guilty about buying the game in its current state situation delay until after 1st april and then buy it it will at least have an impact and send the message to capcom via the yearly financial results edit i am adding on to this review after about 50 hours into the game about a week later i am not editing anything above but looking back at my own early review it really foreshadows the deeper issues i find with the game that most people will find and for those who are looking for a takeaway from the revisit it is that to get any value out of this purchase this game will need to be purchased a year or two from now during a sale after confirmation that the deep rooted issues has been fixed as it is right now the greatest accomplishment this game has done is convinced me to not buy monster hunter wilds on release despite all the friends i have within the community additional pros and cons with the game after 50 hours pros core gameplay loops especially with larger sized monsters is really fun exploration within the game can be fun with high peaks discovery of new areas new monsters and low lows i e walking simulator with a repetitive wolf goblin saurian encounter every 30 seconds that is just stun stagger galore in either direction cons the story was subjectively worse in terms of vibe in the first 5 hours of play it s objectively worse as the story goes along as the buildup for the first portion of the game ended in a grand pile of nothing and results in just oh just go to the next city to talk to this guy main storyline is pretty lacklustre and the side quests have close to zero impact to the world at large and it really showcases capcom s weakness in story writing within a narrative driven rpg context which admitedly i should have saw this a mile coming considering i played both dmc and monster hunter and the storyline is meme worthy when at its best incompleteness in so so so many aspects monsters scaling is super off even before end game i have not yet reached there yet but encounters within towns typically take a few seconds each for the typical mob and big monsters like golems griffins etc barely takes a minute that s with a build that isnt even end game equipment augments etc yet with a vocation that generally is classified on the lower end of the brokeness spectrum archer monster variety is strictly worse than dark arisen and in terms of repetitive nation of most portion of the gameplay gives off early generation assassin s creed open world vibes aka around ac3 good action rpgs tend of introduce depth nuances and complexity or at least the neccesity of understanding those as the game progresses and this game has very little of that advanced classes are not straight up upgrades of the basic classes but are complete different classes that often have a different power scale which can be worse or better than a basic class all in all the game feels very incomplete and reminiscent of dragon s dogma 1 before dark arisen which is in all accounts an incomplete game even in the eyes of the dd1 game directory with that in mind the fact that dragon s dogma 2 came out at full price at the exact same state with improvement in some areas while also worse off in others is a straight up disgrace while the foundation for a great game is there the potential is never fulfilled and even though there will be folks that bring up the potential of a dlc like dark arisen was to dd1 to bring it up to par why should anyone accept an incomplete product at a complete price point and release for those who are thinking to buy this please just buy it on sale one year or two later after release and after being sure that there has been a fix for all these issue either via patches or dlc because honestly capcom has done a masterful job of convincing me to never buy anything at full price at launch from them going forward considering the terrible experience that got worse with each release from monster hunter world to monster hunter rise to now dragon s dogma 2 third time is not the charm for capcom but at least it s for me to learn the lesson of not buying any of the hype they put out and that game day reviews tends to not be able to cover reach the point in the game where the incompleteness of the game becomes evident,92.0,404.0,9,Not Recommended,March

74827,i was really on the fence if i should give a recommendation or not on this game this is probably both one of the best and most frustrating gaming experiences i have ever had at the same time i don t think i have experienced a product that is so impressive and at the same time so sloppy i absolutely adore the first dragons dogma and i actually replayed it again just prior to starting up dragons dogma 2 upon playing the first dragons dogma i reflected again over how incredible immersive your companion pawns where in how they commented on things in the environment in a context dependent manner after playing dragons dogma 2 though it is just so frustrating to feel like the pawn behavior is a huge step back from the first game they constantly repeat the same dialogue lines over and over and over again and most of it is even nonsense and non helpful like telling you for the 1000 time that you can combine stuff when you are 100 hours into the game and have already done this 1000 times before i keep saying shut the up in annoyance constantly this never ever happened in the first game even after playing 100 hours and they never annoyed me it is really insufferable how much they repeat the same lines over and over again i also find that there is much less context dependent comments on unique environmental features like in the first game but that is less of an issue when compared to the constant nag also even the context of when they speak is extremely sloppy many times i make camp and 3 seconds after having camped some pawn makes a comment on how we probably are not in need of camping just now or they ask if i need guidance to a cave when i stand 1 meter from the opening of it it is constant and incredibly annoying it is such a shame because the game is incredible immersive in most other aspects but this completely and utterly ruin all that illusion of an immersive real world with these pawns there are other issues with the game but for me this is really the main gripe repeating dialogue is really an immersive killer in most games but it is really critical here since having the pawns behave in a natural manner is such a big part of the game and something that was really nailed in the first game and such an unique feature of what that game was and how it stood out from other just implementing some cooldown on how often dialogue can repeat would go a long way to making the pawns feel less fake and artificial which is the complete opposite of what should be the goal here the game really feels like some masterpiece painting by a great artist and then some clowns come in and throw faeces all over it the repeating dialogue almost single handedly takes one of the most immersive worlds i have seen in a game and completely demolish it anyhow that is my main gripe some other pros and cons though pros extremely beautiful graphics with amazing looking animations no loading between areas or going into towns or dungeons etc beautiful music when exploring good controls and characters have a sense of physics to their movement quests are not entirely hand holding like in most other games and sometimes you actually have to think for yourself no cheap quick travel and like in the first game the quick travel system is actually implemented in the game world especially love how when you throw a ferrystone up in the air and it hits a roof it fails to trigger in game logic increases believability and immersion in he game world though i understand if it can be a bit constraining to some players and probably they nerfed the portalstones etc to be able to sell them as microtransactions bad nice system i have not seen before where many quest givers actually initiate conversation with you in a natural manner as you go near instead of having a system with fake looking markers above their head like in most other games elves in this game actually look like how elves are supposed to look like great character creator and from my understanding some of the actual physical elements of your character like their height and weight determine movement speed to some extentcons again the repeating dialogue of the pawns almost destroy the game but enough said about that the game has performance issues especially in cities and even dlss does not seem to make much of a difference microtransactions dungeon cave design are really really really repetitive and are only caves really in different sizes one of the best aspects of the original dragons dogma was how incredible good the level design was in some of the dungeons with atmospheric elements like flowing streams in the floor or just a huge sense of detail both in design and soundscape to some of them the lack of variety in dungeons and locations really hurt the sense of wonder and exploration as when you have seen the first cave you have pretty much seen them all difficulty is really trivial and most of the time it feels like just swapping annoying flies when dealing with the enemy mobs except for some of the huge ones that are more bullet sponges until you have the equipment for them having pretty much infinite potential for healing with items does not help with quick buttons that just refills your health instantly without even needing a drink or eat animation etc just destroy all aspects of any difficulty the developers should really look at implementing something more akin to how healing is handled in dark souls elden ring the permanent reduction of healing that needs to be refilled by sleeping is a good feature though imo the sound mixing is atrocious and probably the worst i have ever seen heard you have to constantly adjust the volume down or up as you get your ears blown out with the combat music in battle that drowns out all other sound mobs of enemies are placed way to frequent in the game world which just feels fake and artificial and you can barely move a step until there is another group of enemies are on you because the difficulty is so trivial they more become an annoyance than something that feels like a treat as you try to traverse around the environment enemies also respawn way to frequent it would be nice to actually be able to clear out areas especially in the routes of the oxcarts to make travel easier without getting jumped by enemies it feels like enemies respawns in areas after just a day when really it should be after a week ingame at the least capcom made human pawns are incredibly ugly and just look unfitting to the game it does not help that for some reason like half of all the names are not matching the genders of the characters so you will have males named lisa or sofia and females named peter and gregory etc while the initiation of dialogue is a great thing for quest givers etc this is also used on pawns you meet on the road and they interrupt you with a conversation if you get to near which can be extremely annoying the game has incredible vistas with huge mountains so it is a massive bummer to discover that much of it has invisible walls that prevents you from going to many places not a fan how shopkeepers stand in place 24 7 even at night some more routine in their behavior would be welcome and having closed at night etc the feature of having to have a pawn that understands elvish and that can interpret to the player as they speak would be an incredible original idea if implemented right imagine as an elf speaks in a foreign language to the player and your pawn conveying what is said to you in real time it would be really unique idea that would enhance the believability of the game world however how this was implemented in the game just flushed all that potential down the toilet by just having what they say in text if you have a translator and you even have to go to options to turn subtitles on if you have them off or you will not even see what they say anyway word count reached,120.1,205.0,3,Recommended,August 12,Dragon's Dogma 2,outcast

74835,dragon s dogma 2 is a 2012 game dressed in 2024 graphics it s a decent game but you should only pick it up on sale in my opinion here are some pros and cons to summarize my thoughts on the game open world exploration there is always a cave to explore a chest to loot or a boss to battle you ll spend dozens of hours immersing yourself in dd2 s open world as it s the shining star of the game combat the variety of vocations classes dd2 has is impressive from melee focused classes like the sword and shield fighter who excels in drawing out enemy attention and climb on bosses to ranged classes like the archer who is best at targeting specific parts of bosses to dexterity based classes like the thief who is fast and can steal items from enemies to magic wielders like the mage who can offer boosts and healing spells to your party not to mention advanced vocations that add more unique playstyles graphics not really much to say the re engine proves once again that it s one the best engines in the industry pawn system just like the nemesis system from shadow of mordor pawns are underrated and should be added to more rpgs pawns hired will support players in guiding them through quests catch them when they fall from heights loot and hold items as well as finding treasures and caves that you may have missed my only two gripes about pawns are a they need more meaningful dialogue and b i just wish capcom would expand on the system further add co op or the ability to give orders to pawns like shooting locks or boost the players to reach unreachable locations ai the ai of pawns can be bad at times one time my pawns stood around during a boss battle not targeting the specific parts needed to defeat the boss i was fighting as a trickster which made the fight literally impossible also a few times i was pinned down or stunned and they ll watch you suffer in silence the bad ai made me quit using the trickster and sorcerer vocations story pretty bare bones story with weak writing performance bugs the game is poorly optimized for the cpu side of the game as evident by the major fps drops in npc busy areas dd2 is the first re engine title with high density complex npcs so performance issues are to be expected hopefully capcom will work on cpu optimization more because i can t see how monster hunter wilds will perform with the same issues dd2 is also quite buggy there is a chance to bug out of side quests like the game did to me save system being able to save anywhere is great however capcom s decision against adding save slots is a stupid one microtransaction you don t need to buy any but still there is no reason to add microtransactions in full priced 70 games,61.3,248.0,8,Recommended,April 9,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Rōnin

74839,honestly for the price i cannot recommend this game in good faith although there are some good aspects it just has way too much working against it first and probably most obviously the performance for how long it s been out this really shouldn t still be as much of an issue as it is but there are so many reviews that touch on this that i ll just move on if i had to pick a second thing it s the class system the classes in the first game were enjoyable there were a good variety of skills to choose from and you could equip enough of them to create builds that felt like they had character in this game you re limited to only four skills or three if you re a warfarer and don t want to go into your equipment menu to change weapons every 30 seconds even though the only thing that makes this a less appealing choice than using the warfarer meister skill is the inconvenience especially considering it costs stamina to use and if you re playing as a magic user it just always feels like there is something missing from your kit for other vocations like the mystic spearhand it feels like if you could use six skills instead of four it would be really enjoyable but instead you re always missing one crucial piece of your best form additionally while the combat can be challenging and interesting at first after completing your first run of the game practically every encounter is completely trivial because you re just way too strong for the enemies you generally encounter personally i got to the point that i literally could not try new combinations of skills on enemies because they would die before i could finish executing the second skill unlike in the first game there is no hard mode i ve heard something about automatic difficulty scaling in this game but if that is an actual feature i haven t noticed it since the combat and exploration are the main focuses of this game and it does those to an acceptably well i was prepared to skip over my complaints about the story but recalling my experience of the first game i really just could not bring myself to give it a pass the premise seems cool but the execution of the main plot is sorely sorely lacking several story elements don t even really make sense and while on the surface it seems like the game wants you to be able to approach the story in whatever way you want there are really only two endings as far as i m aware and either can be locked off if the relevant npcs have died there is no simultaneous multiplayer to speak of at all period maybe there s a mod for it i haven t looked this was also the case in the first game but in that game the experience was amazing despite the lack of multiplayer by contrast in this game the lack of multiplayer is just one more problem on the heap of issues that make it fail to live up to its promise if the game did have multiplayer i might honestly recommend it despite its multitude of other flaws then there s the controls good gods above the controls i could probably write an entire essay on why i hate them so i ll just fire them off in quick succession and move on targetting system is completely borked and it s nigh on impossible to aim spells or staff bolts at the correct target except in ideal conditions a stark contrast to the first game where you could manually aim almost any spell and your staff bolts would fire pretty much where you are looking sliding will completely lock you out of controlling your character in any meaningful way rendering you completely defenceless for the duration and will happen in seemingly nonsensical places you cannot swim period and while in the first game it seemed like a reasonable design choice to limit the areas the player could explore to put a cap on the scale of the game in this installment it really just seems like laziness the exact reason would be a spoiler but you ll understand if you see the endgame landing on top of certain enemies will instantly throw you into a ragdoll state which results in forced unavoidable damage even if it was your own attack that put you there there is no auto run feature which makes the long travel times agonising especially considering the extremely limited fast travel options on mouse and keyboard there is no way to toggle the walk speed you have to hold alt to move more slowly than your running speed whose idea was this seriously and it s made worse by the next point on mouse and keyboard there are several important keybinds that are 1 placed on seemingly nonsensical keys 2 cannot be reassigned and or 3 must have a modifier key like ctrl assigned with them even if there is no real reason it has to editing keybinds on mouse and keyboard is frustratingly limited especially considering how many of the default keybinds make it seem like whoever designed the controls has never played a game on a keyboard before i ll stop there this is already way too long the game is very pretty when the graphics are actually working properly and the combat and exploration can feel fun and rewarding at times but at the price point i can t say i m happy with my purchase i would have much rather spent my 65ish bucks on my ffxiv sub and i don t even like the combat in that game and if you ve played the first dragon s dogma game graphics aside this game is pretty much a strict downgrade if this game was like 30 maybe it d be worth

74842,dragon s dogma 2 looks better and is bigger than the first everything else is either on par or worse than dragon s dogma a lot of stuff could be fixed with dlc but right now i don t think it s worth the price you are better off waiting for a future sale preferably one that would include said dlc enemy variety is a problem none of the bitterblack isle enemies make a return and even some enemies from the original base game are missing there are a couple of new additions unique to this game but aside from the minotaurs all of them are either one off encounters and or can only be found in a single location so for most of the game you will be fighting the same goblins bandits ogres cyclopes and such over and over and you fight a lot in this game despite the game being so much bigger than the first enemy density is really high when exploring the world it can get to the point especially in the game s second region that encounters start to stack on top of each other because of how close they are as a result of this it s easy to get tired of the small selection of enemies very quickly exploration is a bit of a mixed bag on one hand dragon s dogma 2 gives you the freedom to go wherever you want whenever you want even if a location seems blocked off to you for story reasons there s likely an alternate route you can take this is useful considering that two of the game s vocations are located almost right next to where the end of the game takes place but aside from cases like that and a few hidden encounters across the map i didn t find exploring to be all that rewarding a lot of the caves in the game don t have any side quests tied to them don t have a boss or unique encounter in them and don t have any interesting loot at one point the last piece of gear i found in one of them was a cheap chest piece i had already bought at the city in the same region there are some unique gear pieces you will only find out in the world but they re rare enough you can easily miss them speaking of gear the equipment system is much simpler compared to dragon s dogma the gloves are now tied to your chest piece and the clothing layer for the chest and leg slots no longer exist instead being tied to chest and leg armor respectively there isn t any armor with unique effects so most of the time you will just be using whatever has the highest stats unless you are stubborn like me and choose to forsake efficiency in the name of fashion what vocations can wear what armor doesn t always make sense either there are cases where pieces of armor look like they should be part of the same set can t be worn together because separately they require different vocations all this combined will likely result in many arisen and their pawns looking the same as other players i m personally not a fan of how vocations were handled compared to the dragon s dogma despite every vocation gaining an extra active skill slot and some old ones being made into passive core abilities some vocations ended up being more limited than before a good example is mage in dragon s dogma mage had to slot in their main healing spell but they also had 2 sets of 3 skills for a total of 6 in dragon s dogma 2 mage s main heal is now tied to their heavy attack but they only have 4 slots total meaning they lose out on 1 or 2 since you didn t need to keep your heal in dragon s dogma fighter is similar since sword mace and shield skills now share the same slots instead of being separate mystic knight and sword based assassin despite getting replacements or being folded into other vocations are sorely missed in terms of play style vocations are all limited to a specific weapon type so no more sword dagger and bow builds which i really felt with how many times i wish i could just pull out a bow on my thief to hit a flyer the new warfarer vocation who can use all armor and any weapon is flawed in that weapon skills don t swap between weapons and swapping your weapon takes up one of your skill slots so if you were hoping to recreate one of the old hybrids you might be disappointed the game is also too easy and lacks a hard mode there is no everfall or bitterblack isle from dragon s dogma equivalent to be found here the post game ends up being more of an annoyance rather than a challenge enemies don t even scale up when you enter ng despite ng offering additional ways to increase your character s power you will eventually get to the point where nothing can threaten you even without maxing our your gear and levels the story sucks there s no sugarcoating it most of the main story has you doing fetch quests and running around to talk to different people most of which don t involve any combat hell literally half of them don t require you to leave the game s first major city and come from the same guy once you get past this boring political intrigue plot the story tries to speedrun you through the game s second region so fast that it s possible to accidentally find yourself at the end of the game before you even realize it s also really odd how the game spends so much time having you learning what s going on in the first city only to completely gloss over the second one as a minor spoiler the leader of this area is featured on the game s cover art and you never interact with them outside of a few very brief sidequests but even if it we did interact with them more i likely wouldn t have cared anyway there s a very small handful of interesting characters in the game and even those are still limited in how relevant they are i think i would have liked this game more had i not played dragon s dogma specifically dragon s dogma dark arisen it feels like no lessons were learned from the original game i see people talk about a potential dragon s dogma 2 dark arisen being able to fix these issues but this is stuff that should have been part of or considered for the base game i don t want to end up paying more money for this game to get up to the point where dragon s dogma dark arisen currently is that s why i can t rightfully recommend this game in it s current state at it s current full price,104.9,237.0,2,Not Recommended,April

74843,i ve been really chewing on whether i d give this game a thumbs up or down and i think i have to say it s gonna be a thumbs down but it was close honestly the game got me to play it for 60 hours and i was tempted to start another playthrough just to max out my last few vocations i had to uninstall lest i be sucked in again i didn t have any technical issues besides frame rate drops in major cities those were annoying but not showstoppers positives the vocations are interesting they all play very differently and there s no real harm in mixing and matching however you want there s not really a meta you have to hit just do what s fun the graphics are largely pretty good magic effects look great and the monster animations are solid there are some nice vistas in the game but most of the time is spent in the dark or in forests or canyons where you can t see much taking down a large monster feels like an accomplishment especially a drake the hidden world at the end was a nice touch even if it was also kind of a letdown upgrading your gear and getting new skills to use and master felt great the whole way through it was fun addicting enough to get me to keep playing despite my constant state of severe frustration i liked sven he was interesting and had a fun character arc negatives the way this game pads its playtime is with endless amounts of stupid bs so many fights just felt cheap and frustrating because they re designed to be obnoxious one example i m on a game necessary important escort quest on foot of course a random encounter dragon shows up and kills the vital npc quest is now ruined game unwinnable mostly you can revive dead npcs with rare items but i was all out of them i had to scour the map to find just one more rush back to the corpse of the npc revive her and hope the quest could continue it did this took hours and i hated every minute of it nothing adds to the joy of an escort quest like an npc too stupid to hide from a dragon and they are all too stupid they re also usually slow too meaning you can outrun them and fail the quest but that s not all monsters tend to come in packs and they re absolutely everywhere every twenty feet it s another fight wolves harpies bandits wolves again goblins bandits troll on and on and on the same tiresome fights dozens of them any time you have to walk somewhere which is always that s all this game is long walks through murder tunnels speaking of stupid bs every time you take damage your max health goes down a little this gets really old when they dump a boss on you during the first 3rd of the trip then another one near the end that you can t fight anymore because after 30 encounters your max health is like 15 of normal and same with all your pawns it even does this if you die and reload you reload with less max health it adds difficulty sure but mostly it just adds stress and makes the game feel like more of a chore than it should the map feels small no matter what color they make it it s just a long series of tunnels there s nothing open here no wide fields and forests just roads and caves and canyons it feels incredibly constrained sure it s large in the sense that it takes forever to run from a to b but that s because there were 20 fights and the road was lined with short cut preventing cliffs at all times it feels constrained the whole way through claustrophobic even you only get to use with 4 skills from your class despite a big list to choose from so pick ones you want to use 100 000 times wayfarer vocation is bafflingly stupid game design equip many weapons only get 3 skills total so don t bother with another set of weapons just be a worse archer or whatever if you play it the pawns never shut up never they re either complaining or repeating unneeded advice always so many of the npc faces are terrible 100 of the children look monstrous and deformed like the game devs have never seen an actual living child before most human adults are weird and ugly all the cat people are fine but they re just cat faces incredibly disappointing romance sure you can be very good friends with any npc in the game but you can t actually have a relationship there s no love cutscene no marriage no your reward is an escort quest that s right they come and ask you to take them somewhere once you get there nothing happens they just say thanks this aspect of the game is so pathetic i don t know why they even bothered don t get me started on the brothel not that many big monsters you run through the list real quick and your 50th cyclops isn t a very interesting fight and the boss fights tend to be long too which is cool until it s your 10th dragon or 20th gryphon weight and inventory management i know this is in every game but they have a tradeoff if you play as a small character you re faster and nimble but you can t carry more than a deck of cards before you re dragging your feet and begging to rest worrying about being overburdened every time you pick up a flower is not fun the music is boring dragon s dogma had outstanding music esp bitterblack isle overall it feels like this game was close to being really good but falls short in so many ways it s bad

74849,it seems like most people have forgotten what dragon s dogma was before the dark arisen release edits marked with first of all i got to say i m not defending micro transaction or the devs choice to add them if you want to give this game a bad review because of that then its totally understandable but some reviews are very misleading and paints the devs as more of evil mustachio twirling villains than they are this is by no way close to blizzard or other companies in level of disgusting 1 fast travel with portcrystals are locked behind a mt paywall this is false in my playthrough i gained 4 5 portcrystals just from exploring and doing quests it was enough to space them out for easy travel most of the times i actually used the oxen service because i was out of ferry stones 2 character edit is locked behind a mt paywall this is also false right now you only have 2 full recreation tickets per playthrough the devs have now uped it to 99 these cost 500 rc which is really easy to get and you will have enough of them by mid game to basically never worry about them 3 no multiple characters option to start over some has stated that this is a lack of freedom to try out different vocations this is just wrong since you can change vocations when ever you want and you no longer have to level different vocations for your end build like in the previous games they have now added a start a new game that overwrites your current file 4 performance issues yes this game has some horrendous performance in major cities the devs are aware of this as well and are working on a solution but i have seen people with hardware waaaay below the recommended specs complain about this no it will stutter if you have a i5 gen 8 when the game is depending so much on a strong cpu i had a constant of 70 60 fps whilst outside of towns inside the towns i had 30 50 with major drops when a town was attacked every thing on max dlls on quality 2560x1440 specs at bottom performance is better but still wobbly in cities 5 finalok so everyone please lay down your torches and pick forks for a second and look at the mt content they offer it s all in the game already you don t have to pay anything extra to enjoy the game as the game was intended exploration time consuming as it is but none the less if you only have 10 hours in the game you haven t even played it even if the above statement is ridiculous its true this game will take time a review talking about ingame content or lacking of content that is under 10 hours has not even left the first area of the map and have not explored that area to 100 the big but every fix is still just a promise they will add they will fix in coming patches don t worry the dragons are coming right now its only performance that is still an issue ok now to the game after almost doing a 100 on this game story is decent but i just finished the main story and i have to say it felt short now i see you looking at my almost 100 hours at the time of this review and hold up wait a minute i did a lot of stuff side quests almost all vocations and their ultimate skills romances you name it but i didn t do it all and that says a lot about the content that s in the game but the main quest felt like you where following a breadcrumb trail while enjoying the scenery which can be really nice specially when the areas looks great and have a lot of details this game is a adhd nightmare i m not diagnosed but every chance i got i said you to the pawn guiding me to a quest to see what this other path lead and oh boy there are some awesome areas you miss out on if you just blaze through the game some argue it s the same game again well yes like the darksouls game are technically the same game again but wait there is more the modding community has already been working like crazy and you can already find mods like unlimited stamina outside of battle and real fov slider and surly more is to come the world and its inhabitants i would summarize the game to be on the level of dragons dogma 1 when it comes to variations of enemies you have your standards of goblins skeletons lizardos bandidos draginos ogrerrendae cyclopos dadeiahfgeslf the list goes on but they also have dark variants for the bigger monsters and a couple of new ones these enemies walk around their respective areas but can be seen fighting from time to time i have seen some reviews saying there s a lack of variations but there are like 4 5 different variations of saurians that is not just a dark variant they are made from different elements and live in different climates and look pretty cool that s basically the feeling of the world everything is pretty cool untill a gryphin wrecks my desert crank lift and wipes my whole party there are random quests that pop up here and there with people to save monsters to cull or escort missions they are ok but it would be nice if the escort person would actually say where they want to go before you accept it i might be wanting to hunt down a dragon in the area walked from the capital and camped to get here and they just want to be escorted to the capital no way peasant you are now on the dragon hunter squad vocations i was really sad to see that the assasain was removed as it was my go to vocation in dd1 so we got theif and archer no daggers and bow just daggers or bow i felt my breathing going faster and my typing fingers loading up to rant about why i hated this but i calmed down and gave the theif and archer a chance and now i like it with all the vocations and special vocations from dd1 and specially with the new spear hand which is totally op and broken af but more of that later most of the regular vocations would be well obsolete they would only be an annoying hurdle to pass to get to the vocation you wanted with this new system all vocations are unique and dare i say fun buff archer ult pls its so baby tier rn m reowshrsji brdb ok imagine being a jedi that can tank any attack in the game even the dragoins meteor showers and lightning attacks imagine being fus ro da yeeted off high hrhorghharhhf just to stand up and dust yourself off imagine being able to teleport around the fight like narutos daddy throwing on the enemy and just appearing on them now imagine being able to spear the heart of a dragon with a powerful magic projectile that will make the dragon backflip into the sky right through the moon this is the spear hand vocation ok that might be too much but you get my meaning the vocation actually have a bubble spell it makes you immune to all dmg for a short while ok how short are we talking like 5 secs so you have to time it perfectly no its like 4 seconds it outlasts most channel attacks and it costs so little stamina so you can keep it up an entire boss fight and it bubbles your pawns as well i no joke didn t take a single point of dmg from the end boss when i challanged him with this class and none of my pawns died there was tools in the boss arena that could be used on the boss but i didnt even have to use them just bubble away it takes a lot of time to get any where and it can be confusing to figure out what the game wants from you or what you can expect from the game but then the areas are so nice so some people wont mind the time taken some people like to figure everything out even if it might be cryptic and non nonsensical at times its not a game where you can get a feel of it within the refund time this is not dark arisen its going to lack some quality of life things only buy at full price if you are sure you are going to

74865,it was definitely possible if not outright likely this sequel would not be dragon s dogma the game design could have died a death by a thousand antithetical cuts at the hands of suits and contemporary standards but for better or worse here s dragon s dogma 2 they didn t mess with it you will jump and climb on giant monsters and stab them in the eye while stuffing potatoes into your face you will hear your pawn remark about the same ladder in vernworth more times than you ve heard hello in your lifetime the story is anemic and arbitrary forgetting its own beats the characters are plentiful but cardboard there are two saves you will lose pawns to terrain despite your best micromanaging your pawn will pick up all your worst combat habits and embarrass you in front of strangers online progression scaling is lackluster you will feel hopelessly desperate at the beginning only to wake up one level and feel like god fast travel is artificially limited but similarly scaled where suddenly you are awash in ferrystones big mob hunting is made more tedious by the large map and minotaurs are the griffins of this title it feels like quests are still easy to bungle due to time progress or simply missing them and most importantly all of this is gift wrapped in the meta of the dragon s literal dogma so of course everything i just mentioned is thematically deliberate and why there s no 2 in the main menu title frankly it was everything i wanted and once again my complaint is give me more but that s obviously not my only complaint i actually didn t have many crashes in 100 hours but the game still runs like molten molasses framerates are mostly fine in the wilderness but low in cities which is mildly problematic later on normally this would be least concern easiest fixed but the fact the game shipped like this that they thought even the poor performance on the ps5 was acceptable hints that maybe that s not the case beaucoup hardware won t save you here something is fundamentally wrong and it s currently setting your cpu on fire while the frames hitch if you like dragon s dogma warts and all and circumstances have prevented you from buying it at release try it anyway i found it playable on my potato rig once i acclimated to the framerate dips if you think you could like dragon s dogma play dark arisen instead as the price point for curiosity is lower 5 bucks on sale usually and it won t melt your rig if you didn t like dragon s dogma 1 this isn t going to change your mind and you d just be engaging the definition of insanity,164.4,163.0,7,Recommended,March 31,Dragon's Dogma 2,"monday

74867,this review is coming from a somewhat specific point of view i have mixed feelings but i must settle on negative and it isn t due to the performance issues or microtransactions throughout i will compare the first and second game there will also be some spoilers though i ll try to be ambiguous vague wherever possible whilst keeping relevancy in mind older dragon s dogma 1 dark arisen players may be able to more accurately pick up or relate to what i say firstly i believe this isn t emphasized enough but the game itself is by and large an almost identical copy of the first game dragon s dogma dark arisen ddda normally this is not a bad thing i believe that if something is good and if it works then there s no reason to change it of course making improvements and adding innovation to that existing formula without overly modifying it is good and welcome but when it comes to dragon s dogma 2 i d argue that some things went in reverse starting with something very simple npc conversation camera in the first game ddda when we talk to some notable npcs your character s silhouette will completely vanish and the camera will focus solely on that npc it made for conversation to be more personal it was the case with most notable npcs not all mind you in dd2 when conversing with notable npcs apart from the innkeepers shopkeepers there s very minor zoom and focus connected to that are the npcs themselves more specifically the beastren race you may notice that the npcs are very generic same repeating voice lines even having the same voices the first game ddda was also somewhat similar and to some this is likely inconsequential but i feel like this takes away from the whole point of making a new region and a new race if you re simply going to palette swap the environment and give fur to the npcs they could have kept the same repeating generic voice lines but why not make it so that the beastren npcs have distinctive vocal undertone or perhaps a slightly different manner of speech compared to the human npcs to me both human and beastren npcs seemed to have the same voice actors and the same generic dialogue excluding unique npcs of course moving onto the gameplay there s really nothing quite wrong with this aspect dragon s dogma 1 2 honestly is just a hack and slash simulator with exploration as more of an afterthought except they have stripped down some of the abilities spells of the vocations classes that were present in the first game i cannot comment on how impactful it is for other vocations as i mostly played sorcerer in both games but quite a number of spells were taken away from the sorcerer vocation i could have lived with that if they simply didn t make the default light attack of sorcerers useless compared to how it was in ddda the default light attack be it charged or not is simply garbage in a way this felt a bit crippling and perhaps some other vocation may feel crippled as well due to having their abilities from the first game removed but i don t know enough to comment on this yet what else the lack of anything considerably original new so the region of vermund human kingdom is essentially just a different version of the first game s gransys region nothing too new about it there was one notable new boss type enemy added the dullahan though you are very unlikely to encounter unless you travel to a specific location at nighttime this is once again fine but not so in the case of the brand new region of battahl i was expecting at least 2 or 3 new common enemy types but sadly everything was the same as vermund in terms of enemy variety and general environmental design all the enemies were simply given a new coat of texture and made substantially stronger nothing too new was here either apart from the addition of a single new enemy in the battahl region this being medusa but you literally only encounter it in one very specific location that you can easily miss or never explore one could also argue that medusa is just a replacement of the first game s evil eye and hydra bosses combined so in a way it wasn t that new paired with the npcs sounding same the whole region battahl just felt like vermund with an orange coat of paint i will admit that the new battahl only ropeway station mechanic was a bit fun at first but that s about it now you might be asking is there anything that s spectacularly new or original well there s the sphinx and her riddles some fun to be had there onto the story there s a lot to unpack here and if nothing has been spoiled for you considerably yet the next few paragraphs might take a look at the cover image of dragon s dogma 2 we see someone clad in armor in the middle and two other characters to the left and right the character in the middle is intended to be us the arisen the one on the right is ulrika a relatively important individual in early part of the game now the character on the left is the beastren kingdom s empress nadinia one would guess that she is obviously going to be important to our questing right wrong she is about as useful as any standard side quest npc the interactions with her is so little that its hardly worth mentioning and while in battahl its constantly mentioned that the empress dances in the public for her people but did capcom bother to even put that sort of minor animation in the game no they did not before going further into the main plot i d like to mention a certain mechanic that existed in the first game ddda the beloved mechanic simply put all npcs have an affinity meter which increases if you do things for them or gift them items the highest affinity npc will eventually be locked in for romance in the final bits of the main quest by romance i mean that they get kidnapped near the end and they get a dedicated intimate moment and cutscene and would live in your house during post game content dragon s dogma 2 also has that mechanic sort of problem is the highest affinity npc doesn t get a cutscene and doesn t live with you in your house however they do show up at the very end of the credits for 4 seconds and smiles at the camera while looking at the horizon what do i even say but hold on even though the highest affinity npc gets kidnapped in this game they aren t locked in as your romance because if for some reason you get higher affinity with a new npc in post game then that new npc shows up in the credits instead the beloved system was pretty mediocre in the first game but now it just might as well not exist this may sound contentious but i think the game does bit of a disservice to the original lore of the first game the pathfinder doesn t seem like the seneschal we are aware of in the first game it could be true that this a different world in the multiverse and if the pathfinder plays the same role as the seneschal did in the first game ddda then there should have been a little bit more exposition apart from their monotone narration it seems an awful lot of game s budget was poured into making the action cinematics and cutscenes in the lead up to post game and a little after it the rest felt as it was simply copy pasted the from the first game while stripping away the things that made the original great not just spells skills abilities even a lot of the consumables curatives were removed or overly simplified my personal dissatisfaction is from the lack of one of the best items liquid vim that was removed now every time my pawn says we now have the vim to tackle the day after resting it s blatantly obvious that we don t have the vim and we may possibly never will in short this may be a good game but its certainly not a good sequel it also lacks proper regional pricing nostalgia made me fork over 80 usd i implore trying the first game

74868,i feel like this game is a rushed copy of the first meant to use people s nostalgia for a quick money grab plus i don t believe it had the amount of development that it is being said just my opinion based on playing the game only we get copy paste of monsters from the first game and barely anything new griphins harpies goblins chimeras drakes metal golems the thing that carries this game is players nostalgia i love this series but i guess i am upset at this i feel like this game was rushed out for the money medusa being the new monster its fight mechanics is basically the same as for the hydra the body model is also incredibly similar but i guess a snake is a snake also i prepared most of the game expecting to meet the medusa stacking up in items for petrification afraid of losing my pawns or getting outright killed then during the fight it wasn t even an issue she just moved around looking dangerously and died that s it and most areas feel rushed and unfinished the elf city had 2 main quests which is basically one quest divided and nought else i refuse to count the fetch quest with the tree sapling as content since teleport here and then back again should not even be a quest in an rpg the main arch in vermund gets forgotten the queen regent enslaves us trying to retain sven in power for no reason whatsoever but greed and nepotism and not only does it get forgotten at the endgame we take orders from them while having no option to go against it or have another ending to vermund s possible ruler the same rings true for bakbattahl massive city with a handful of quests that are neither engaging nor barely scratch the surface of the story the queen s assassination plot barely gets explored your mission is to go to a house and quest completed they promised a game that explores a race being oppressed and what not the only mention of this is people saying that your pawns stink a couple of times this having no impact in the game whatsoever plus again at the endgame the whole city dies because menella bugs out 50 of the times and doesn t get a quest marker so you can t find her the true ending the core story none of it made any thread of sense they showed the giant dude during trailers as an incredible part of the story it showed up when i was out exploring i had idea of what was going on before i even managed to get there the guy goes for a swim i thought i lost some massive part of the game a little bit of google tells me that it is barely relevant and a few dozen caves and such dungeons that have the same monsters you find literally everywhere else plus copper take it or leave it no content there plus escort quests because calling them fetch quests wouldn t be elegant so instead of fetching you are delivering i am really mad because some characters had some real charisma ulrika elf princess girl captain of the guards dude but had nothing to go along with them in ddda selene had one of the most interesting quest lines and associated story that i ve met in gaming i feel like they just grabbed ddda upgraded the graphics downgraded the story and content then placed it out if ddda didn t exist this would be an awesome game as it is it feels like an unfinished cash grab,110.2,282.0,2,Not Recommended,May 12,Dragon's Dogma 2,Valkyrie

74877,i m not leaving a negative review for the poor debut performance or the micro transactions but the replayability the original dragon s dogma is easily one of my top five favorite games of all time but this one doesn t really make the cut due to how bland ng is and how it ultimately kills the replayability of the game in fact the lack of any ng mode that s any more than an afterthought is exactly what i think will make this game quietly die out in the next 3 or 4 months and that really disappoints me when you start a new game after beating it that s all it is a new game there is no added difficulty there are no enhanced or additional mobs there is no ur dragon with competitive damage rankings and rewards for defeating it as a community you simply go about a new playthrough with your old gear and level sure you might get the most mileage doing one more run to complete some sidequests you might have missed or pick up some secret chest items you didn t find that will be useless because you re already juiced up but ultimately ng is currently pointless and really disappointing there s no hardcore or time trial runs either the games ending in general really screams we didn t meet deadlines and had to cut stuff again and it s really unfortunate because the first dd suffered a similar fate,163.9,351.0,12,Not Recommended,March 29,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Looooser Jr. [Superbad]

74888,extremely minor spoilers for story and post game dragons dogma 2 can ultimately be summed up as a disappointment the short and sweet of it is that what people wanted was a fixed and expanded version of ddda and instead what we got was the first game with all of its problems released again it still has great combat but it doesn t have better combat and in every other regard it is a sidegrade at best or a downgrade story they tried to make it better but in doing so they just made it more complicated and it ended up being worse ddda s story is bad but it was a story this one is really not a story it is a beginning and an end characters again ddda did not have great characters by any stretch of the imagination but they were characters they were all stereotypes and predictable but a stereotype is more of a character than nothing and they each had quest lines that you could follow throughout the game so they felt more part of your journey where as in dd2 you speed through their quests if they even have any and then drop them for the rest of the playthrough the dragon going to separate this from characters because this is a particularly important one grigori in the first game was amazing his introduction managed to show both that he was a terrifying force of nature but also that he was a very intelligent being that seemed to have more intention than destruction for destruction s sake he was intriguing and you felt his presence throughout the game everything you did was either in order to get to him or because of his workings in dd2 we don t even know the dragon s name and you honestly forget it even exists until he randomly pops out at the end of the game grigori was an iconic character in ddda dd2 s dragon is just another monster you fight exploration it is not bad but it only a sidegrade ddda s exploration was poor because there just wasn t much to explore dd2 s exploration is bad because the stuff that you explore is all very generic you don t have the cool and unique dungeons you had in the first game it is all just a series of caves that look exactly the sameendgame the one saving grace this game could have had is its combat but in order to do so you would need something to use that combat on the normal world is simply too easy pretty quickly and what you really want is an everfall bitterblack isle similar to ddda we don t have that in dd2 instead there is a timed post game that acts similarly but essentially means that you are limited in your fun because it will run out and then you will have to slog through the entire game again just to get the point where the combat isn t completely braindead because of how easy the regular world enemies are ultimately the only reason to get this game is if you cannot stand the graphics of the first because otherwise there is no reason to pick this game up over the 12 year old original because frankly that one is just more fun with less flaws,66.3,736.0,15,Not Recommended,March 28,Dragon's Dogma 2,RedWinter
74892,why won t you let me like you if there was one sentence to define this game it would be that there s so much here that just begs to be enjoyed exciting the mind with possibilities and fun yet just when you re hitting that groove the game hits you with a right hook designed to make you regret purchasing it i want to recommend this game i ve enjoyed dozens of hours with this game but it would be absolutely irresponsible to not front load any review with the mind numbing dredgery this b tier rpg is more than willing to lampoon its players with because there s no other way to describe it the game will just outright bend you over sometimes perhaps its due to bugs perhaps the quests wind up failing themselves before you even get to interact with them the number of times you ll be interrupted when focusing on something will get to some people while the wildly shifting difficulty might get others expect your companions to fail you whether its because their pathfinding breaks or they just don t follow orders correctly its pick your poison planning around their screw ups is more optimal than trying to stop them same could be said for the npcs and their unending escort missions know now that most are optional so never feel inclined to do them for anyone you don t care about i d ramble more about the bugs or the utterly baffling methods of monetization but those have been talked about to death and are honestly just a small portion of what damages the game s longevity if you re the type of player who can overlook all of that then you ll find a decently entertaining rpg underneath the story s neither good nor bad more of just a skeleton for you to chart your adventure through some love it others hate it but the gameplay is the saving grace from either camp combat ranges from good to stellar in places but your mileage will vary drastically given the range of classes available the selection is an unquestionable downgrade from what the prior game offered but whats here is serviceable given the length of the game you could get dozens of hours of entertainment out of it but i m not convinced most people wouldn t get more out of playing something else if you re determined to get it then please wait for a sale you owe it to yourself and your hard earned money,210.6,126.0,7,Not Recommended,August 13,Dragon's Dogma 2,Tasty Library

74897,world and map are cool combat is great and the most epic feeling fantasy combat you ll get from a game unfortunately that world and map and combat lack a reason for being combat in a rpg like this will always be something you do on the way of your journey or adventure and no matter how good the combat is it can t make up for other crucial aspects of an rpg game like story quests loot and dungeons when you see some cool ruins in the distance up on a hill it lights up your imagination to want to explore it but when you get there there s often nothing there but some cookie cutter cellar with a chest with lousy consumables for loot aside from some caves there aren t really any cool dungeons in the game and the story and quests aren t great either and it s anticlimactic to buy your best gear from a merchant instead of finding it out in the field so the otherwise great combat and world basically don t serve any purpose ultimately the game is a big disappointment because it could have been something truly great perhaps it will someday,172.9,45.0,2,Not Recommended,September 18,Dragon's Dogma 2,numena1

74903,for fans of the original 2012 release this game is a firm sidegrade in terms of combat repeatability and storytelling even the thing that i shall not spoil is a sidegrade to what we had in dragon s dogma 1 it follows in line with the resident evil remakes in terms of having slightly less janky fair systems that limit some of the wildly broken movesets from the first game while also reducing your skill roster to 4 skills instead of 6 and leaving out a lot of the high magicks and holy enchantments holy enchants are now baked into certain weapons iirc while slightly retelling the story of gransys into that of vermund s and battahl s at its current state performance qol and enemy varieties are lacking compared to dd1 i wouldn t buy it for at least two months as we wait for a sale patches to address these issues for new players it s a fairly standard action fantasy rpg that puts a large emphasis on action based combat rather than the usual turn based number ticking that you see from other jrpgs to that end you are given several classes with diverse fighting styles bot controlled allies called pawns that can adapt to your fighting style over the course of several hours and a sprawling world full of winding roads deep dungeons and scattering of towns and settlements to help it s not revolutionary it s not wow ing it just does the action part really well climbing larger enemies grappling small ones to set them up for finishers tossing especially small enemies into explosive barrels and off cliffsides etc are all fair game it definitely doesn t have baldur s gate level of complexity and creativity in terms of questlines and character interactions but the voice acting and localization is solid for all its pluses it does carry mechanics that put it in line with the older rpgs that it takes inspiration from single save files to avoid savescumming multiple quest endings that allow for failures to persist in the player s world a severe lack of fast travel points to emphasize the journey and timeliness essential npc deaths you can accumulate revive stones and visit the mortuary to revive important quest npcs but the fact that they can still die in things like random monster attacks on towns means you ll be on edge even in town it s not necessarily a bad thing these features do make things feel more urgent and grave just like older crpgs there are a few dealbreakers dragonsplague which essentially exists to destroy your save file if you ignore your pawn becoming disobedient and then holds that very same save file hostage by offering you an easy way out by selling you microtransaction revive stones to you so you can you know revive the entire town that was nuked because you didn t know what dragonsplague would do as a terminal effect it s a bit scummy imo since the eternal wakestone isn t omnipotent lack of new game button on release forces people to stay locked in save files the only way to manually remove old save files is to dig into the userdata folder on steam and find the right folder with which to delete those bin files especially bad for players who tinkered with the character creator and found out the character creator is not 1 1 with the actual game s lighting environs abysmal cpu bound performance rumor has it that a certain resizable bar setting is what clogs performance but essentially even the best consumer cpus cannot run this game above 90 fps in desolate empty areas cities and towns are always going to be a sub 60 fps experience with plenty of stuttering verdict again wait for a month or two to let the patches roll in and fix the game before giving this game a try as of 3 25 2024 i do not recommend this game to most people except those who are willing to put up with the dealbreakers,69.1,514.0,9,Not Recommended,March 26,Dragon's Dogma 2,vedrisca

74929,okay i wasn t going to post a review originally but i feel that this hate train has gone on long enough so i m throwing my two cents in not for the people who are convinced they hate the game already but for those who look at the countless negative reviews and wonder what in the world is going on i m going to try and be as unbiased as i possibly can here and weather you want to take what i say to heart or throw it all in the trash is on you i also don t do tl drs you ve been warned i ve spent a little over 800 hours in this game gone through about 6 and a half playthroughs with the main goal of getting all the gear i felt i would want before i stopped and first i want to say that i enjoyed it did i enjoy everything no just like every game in existence and every future game it has it s problems people need to understand that first and foremost before going on a smear campaign for months on end complaining about the same things some them being just plain silly and most likely started by whiny keyboard warriors with nothing else to do but tell everyone else what to do with their money and if you disagree with anything they say then you re just dumb i just want to say don t let anyone tell you what to do with your own money and don t believe everything you hear on the internet that goes for this review as well take what everyone says with a grain of salt take people s opinions into consideration but the ultimate decision is yours don t be a sheep and blindly follow what people tell you with that said let s begin let s start with the price one of the main hot topics i don t think anyone can deny that this game is pretty darn expensive but the real question is is it worth it well from the hours and repeated playthroughs i have put into this game at full price honestly no i don t think it s worth it at 15 25 off i would say it s fine but even though i like the game enough to sink a lot of hours into it there just isn t enough here to warrant full price i say wait for a sale with the aforementioned discount if you have the patience for the people who say they won t buy the game for more then 30 all i can say is have fun waiting a few years might as well just forget about the game all together at that point if you re going that far because that s just not realistic when the game is only a few months old at the time of writing this review despite what people want you to think the game sold very well and capcom has no reason to lower it so low another thing that has been disputed time and time again is the performance of the game it s been talked about so much that i m frankly sick of it at this point is it that much of a problem honestly it depends on who you ask and what kind of rig they have everyone is different some people won t play a game that can t at least hit 60fps which is fine some people won t play a game unless they can run it with unlimited frames which is also fine still others straight up can t get the game to run at all which is not fine and others like myself can t get it to run more than 30 fps everyone is different but i ll say that on my end i still enjoyed my time with it despite the 30fps this isn t the first game i ve played with bad frame rate i like to see myself as a patient man and the game was playable enough for me to 100 the game so the frame rate didn t make the game unplayable of course it was not the best it could be but it was playable enough to be fun i know not everyone will think that way but to each their own there s more i could talk about but this review has gone on long enough i m just tired of hearing complaints from entitled people who expect every game to be flawless at launch every time so yeah don t be apart of the hate train please especially if you don t even have the game for goodness sake also take a good hard look before you judge something or just have a little patience before you go slinging around hate i just hope this review makes a least one person take a step back and reevaluate things,805.5,539.0,38,Recommended,June 24,Dragon's Dogma 2,"FeartheGreat

74939,for better and for worse dragon s dogma 2 is a faithful sequel to its predecessor it has taken after seemingly everything the first game did lay out good and bad may it be design decisions or corporate not giving it enough room to breathe it s a refined somewhat streamlined maybe even simplified version of the first game s combat system making for a different experience but a more accessible one you ll turn out a game plan for all the vocations you pick up pretty quickly and there s basically no overlap between what all the vocations are capable meant to do the loop is by my definition pretty fun may it be dispatching the game s abundance of goblin or saurian chaff or tackling the larger members of the game s bestiary unfortunately their placement across the game world is mismanaged and it may lead to a nagging feeling of repetitiveness in the later parts of a playthrough the pawns they are great both stupid and smart capable of triumphant success and bitter failure they will be the source of both your highest and lowest moments in the game in equal measure they will comment about every little thing and attempt numerous times to guide you to your next destination or a chest they happened to find while exploring other worlds beyond the rift i would like to dedicate this review to the pawn adam sandler if his creator ever reads this godspeed the story is as anecdotal as it once was it is a mishmash of unexplored ideas unfinished story beats and hollow characters that will inevitably lead to a feeling of disappointment as for many players the credits will roll and i suspect they ll be thinking that s it the pacing is poorly handled with the later half of the game feeling like a summary of events rather than a well told middle and end to the game s narrative with a high probability that players will miss out on a very meaningful chunk of the game visually the characters and enemies are modeled and animated beautifully the landscapes are gorgeous and traversing the world is a genuinely pleasing experience weapon swings will feel light or weighty as they require and the feedback from connecting weapons skills or finishers is very satisfying the game s sound design and music are also phenomenal i will miss dark arisen s main menu theme but aside from that the music accompanying you during either exploration or combat are very well composed and the sound effects punctuating fights also add to the previously mentioned feedback further enhancing combat as a whole from a technical standpoint the game bears many faults performance and stability issues have been mentioned numerous times rightfully i personally have only struggled with dropping frame rates in particularly dense environments and while i ve only ever crashed once in 141 hours of playtime i ve slipped under geometry a couple times a very harrowing experience i am not too sensible to performance issues but it may heavily hinder your enjoyment of the game it definitely deserved more time to simmer and i hope we will eventually get a more stable and better performing version later not too late into its lifespan so as to allow for a greater amount of people to play the game the micro transactions topic has been done and done none of the content being sold to you is exclusive to the digital storefront it is all obtainable in game with minimal effort you are paying to go fast not paying to play or to win that being said i would like to highlight i do not condone the addition of the redundant micro transactions they only brought bad pr for nothing i would like to believe it is a clause they need to be added per the executive decision of some corporate goon and it was decided to pick the lesser of all possible evils in the game they are not intrusive in the slightest and not once would it come to my mind to quit out of the game to purchase any of the items sold but they already tarnished the game in many people s eyes pointlessly in conclusion unfortunately and like many many games dragon s dogma 2 is not perfect in the current sorry state of the industry it has come out as on par with its peers hastily released and very much owed at least another 6 months in the competent hands of developers unspoiled by greed in spite of that it is really really fun tarred as the frame rates may sometimes be the joy it brings me to sink a sword of dragon slaying proportions into the nearest living creature or toppling a great beast many many times my size is simply too great my god please give us a slider for the fov i am begging on my knees,144.4,50.0,2,Recommended,April 6,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Frenchy

74944,a series that i always wished to get into after my initial 25h playthrough the last time i tried to play dd1 was right after a date was announced for dd2 and when i inevitably dropped the prequel again needless to say i was not holding my breath for the sequel still i came across the advertising on socials and could see the huge hype the community had for it and when the character creator demo was released i obviously had to try and make my beloved characters regardless of my history with the series this sparked my interest but what really put the nail in the coffin was the gameranx before you buy video where he compared exploring in dd2 to elden ring the dogmathe story revolves around the main character the arisen chosen directly by the dragon who steals its heart binding the two together the arisen has then the objective to become inhumanly powerful to challenge the dragon win its heart back and save the world with the help of human looking immortal otherworldly beings known as pawns that respond exclusively to the arisen as long as the dragon lives the arisen cannot die the main pawn of the arisen can be created freely while the other two can be hired to have a group of four the arisen is not a one man army and requires the support of a well made team of pawns to succeed in the setting of dd2 arisens are now by default the king of the city of venworth yet our journey begins as slaves after having lost our memory that being said the story of the game is not the primary focus and has low roleplayability when it comes to choice making the subplots especially in the second half leave a lot to desire the bigger picture of the world does the heavy lifting being the more interesting part a world worth exploringwhat dd2 does amazingly is feel like a breathing world with a plethora of npcs that can give quests often responding to our actions the vermundian forest and the batthali desert are the 2 biomes available with cities and occasional new structures or areas in some specific parts of the map besides fighting questing and the 240 collectibles around the map caves dungeons are one of the few activities available in the open world these can be as small as a few rooms to medium sized but usually share the same style and design the enemies variety although fun to fight against is almost identical to dd1 making it blatant that ignoring re skinned variants there are roughly 20 enemy types in total including bosses this lack of variety is extended to loot with some chests rewarding equipment but many offering consumables all this is somewhat aggravated by the constant barrage of enemies the player has to fight to the point of making one of the alternatives to foot travel hard to use the first time i took one of the carts that go by the main roads i wanted to sit and enjoy the whole trip instead of taking a nap we were attacked 5 times back to back and the cart was destroyed for taking too much damage moreover these carts although not supposed to travel by night in the lore some travels are so long that if awoken it ll be night a simple fix for an immersion breaking mistake like in the aforementioned example the beautiful and dynamic world of dd2 does not communicate to the player its lore with its design enemy placement or loot there is often no special reason behind why a certain group of enemies is there or why that greatsword was in that cave instead the world is simply where everything happens one of the design points that is both controversial and well known in the series is that fast travel is not easily accessible by design the creator believes that fast travel is a crutch for a bad world design and that it s a reflection of a boring world i could not disagree more while yes fast travel can be a crutch to a less interesting world design providing that commodity does not make the world less interesting by default forcing the player to walk everywhere and constantly fight enemies didn t incentivize me to explore every corner just like elden ring s fast travel did not deter me from it where in elden ring i found myself going from a to b having as the incentive the much more varied world loot enemies etc in between in dd2 it s how dynamic the experience of going toward b that motivated me because what happens during the travel often counts more than the destination interactivity beastthis game shines in its combat system and the interactivity that it offers vocations or classes can be changed on a whim at no cost and completely change the fighting approach complimented by amazing animations vocations have their own weapon with a starting moveset just as complex as any from software game these level up only when using them and unlock both core abilities active abilities basically 4 additional weapon skills and passive abilities that can be used on any vocation i started the game as a fighter using a sword and shield and later moved to the warrior with a two handed greatsword by the time i unlocked the magic warrior with a twin spear my mind was set to only level up the vocations that i was interested in when i noticed that my main pawn as an archer had unlocked a passive to deal more damage to weak points i changed my mind and decided to level all of them one of the core abilities of a fighter is to absorb fall damage by landing on the shield right after changing back to this vocation a griffin attacked near the town s exit and during the fight tried to fly away while i was on its back i proceeded to attack it until we both fell from the sky but the griffin being bigger fell faster so with my death impending i remembered i could land on my shield to hopefully dampen my fall which was funnily right on its head dealing a lot of damage another highlight was how at some point i was exploring a part of the map and noticed that where i wanted to go was inaccessible to me because of a high cliff from the near high ground i then noticed a cyclop was sleeping not too far from the edge of the cliff since i was playing archer i hit it at a distance to lure it closer and once weakened it pushed it against the wall of the cliff climbed on its back and used its height as a way to reach the top of this cliff all these interactions happened not because they were scripted but simply because different systems in the game worked together if you think you can do it you likely can and that s the real magic of this game micro optimizationa lot of rightful noise was made at the game s release because of microtransactions and pc performances and don t get me wrong i denounce both not to be devil s advocate but when it comes to microtransactions while it s disgusting they included them it is of the lesser ugly of sorts with items that are easily accessible and available in game even rift crystals used to hire pawns are readily available and useless since hiring current level pawns is free just like for other recent capcom releases it s mostly a scam to less savvy players stunning as it might be the pc port runs poorly and even with my hardware i had to fall back on dlss frame generation to have a stable frame time inside the city and avoid vrr flicker the game s graphic options do little to nothing for performance gains with a major visual impact 2 for a sequel the title builds on the already solid gameplay base of dd1 and adds some resulting in a magical gaming experience that i won t forget and motivates me to play the prequel and to keep playing although flawed the game stands as a unique experience one that i strongly suggest 9 8 10,148.7,53.0,6,Recommended,May 14,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Torllay

74947,i m liking the game a lot honestly but there are a couple outrageous things that stop me for giving it a thumbs up the extremely silly microtransactions cheat codes all of those items can be get fairly easy in the game so please don t buy any i really rather for them to remove them because is scaring a lot of people away from trying the game the game performance is really iffy no matter if i maxed out or put my graphics at bare minumum the frames stay the exact same as a note i have an rtx3060 which never given me any issues with current gen games denuvo if you reinstall the game in too many devices say goodbye to play this thing likely part of the reason of the poor performance basically maleware,174.9,98.0,0,Not Recommended,March 22,Dragon's Dogma 2,Lumikarh

74954,mostly i feel many of the critical reviews are whiny this is a fun game in its own right and if you liked dark arisen or similar games you ll enjoy this one too do not spend the extra money on the deluxe edition ever regardless of sales i played through twice to 100 the game and enjoyed my time doing so i waited a regrettably long time to try the thief vocation which is crazy fun to play and deadly powerful against large enemies especially those that are completely immune to magic in almost every form two things i ll address in case anyone still cares firstly the dlc is totally irrelevant and there is no need at all for anyone to spend additional money on it everything you can buy you will easily obtain in the game just by playing is it that the dlc even exists in the first place yes should you cry about it and not play the game because of it i guess that depends on how badly you need a deep cry but probably not secondly i can t argue with the mention of optimization issues but rarely did i feel it was so slow as to be unplayable that said i have an rtx 4070 and wasn t playing on max settings or anything and 30 45 fps wasn t uncommon and yes it was irritating and i could see for some that being immersion breaking but perhaps this is just me i never really believed i was anywhere doing anything other than sitting on my very non fiction ass playing a very fiction game in the first place so mildly irritated is all i was i still rode a griffin like it was my own personal escort to well not where i was hoping to be but here i am,119.4,100.0,9,Recommended,July 23,Dragon's Dogma 2,"sbrown0428

74959,at first i found the save system a bit odd and having pawns jump off cliffs or run into water to their doom really annoying but i persevered and began to learn the games mechanics and got really into playing with the different combat styles the story is a bit crap but the combat makes up for it and i didn t have any game breaking bugs performance was pretty good throughout as well definitely deserves better than mixed reviews on here 7 5 10,108.3,67.0,5,Recommended,June 6,Dragon's Dogma 2,Angelo

74977,it is my first detailed review but i will be honest and i will make it as detailed as possible dragon s dogma 2 is a fun experience a game worth buying but i want to mention each section that follows with a few details combat my gods the combat can be the funniest thing you can experience you can stomp on giants and dragons and still get cucked from wolves any playstyle you choose is viable and it comes with many different opportunities while the enemies are not rich in variety you will notice that they will also change to be stronger and different in appearance the more you progress the story a small example is the typical early goblin that you will encounter later they become bigger armored and tend to be in bigger packs the elite enemies also give you a satisfying battle each time especially when they can come out of nowhere like the griffin when you are chilling in a wagon a solid 8 5 10 story at the first steps of your journey the story is rather vague and plain you soon learn who you truly are and what is your purpose the majority of questlines are rather simple too telling you do kill that or bring me that now without spoiling much you have to prove through these quests who you are in this world the problem is the rewarding is not that satisfying story perspective you would expect to be noticed more for specific major npcs but that doesn t really happen except from one or two then you reach the end of the story leading to the final boss fight i beat it and proceeded to continue towards the conclusion then the unexpected happened there is a true ending in this game that you can follow which in my honest opinion it was amazing the story line continues even after you fought the boss and the game progresses further and not by a simple quest but something grant that effects the whole world and all the important npcs too including your main pawn in conclusion the true ending is a must for a wholesome fullfilling story experience i absolutely recommend it for anyone that found the story to be average until that point 5 10 without true ending 9 10 with true ending performance i did not encounter a problem maybe an fps drop around 30 when i entered the main city once i don t have a nasa computer but my specs aren t the oldest either i have seen many topics regarding this issue but unfortunately i am not in position to say anything because the game is running smoothly for me character creation second only to black desert it is amazing simple as that wait to see the other main pawns from other players too if you haven t seen anything already from yt or other media micro transactions seriously it pains me to see this game being shadowed from that topic the first step i did before bying this game was to check about this mtx issue that seemed to plague this game every choice you have in your disposal to buy can be farmed in matter of hours twicefold even the only exception is the soundtrack dlc so the main problem here is not the choices of dlc that you can farm or receive in game its the controversy of actually putting mtx in a single player game i don t support that idea by all means but i wanted to be fair with myself so i put things down and checked 1 do these mtx dlc choices hinder my progress if i don t have them the answer is no 2 are they needed for a specific part of the story or to unlock more content for it the answer is no if i haven t seen all these controversial topics for this matter online i will be completely honest i wouldn t even know they actually exist in the game there were no pop ups or anything specifically even to guide you to buy them i emphasize on that because unfortunately there is a big psychological manipulation that exists behind this behaviour hence its controversy too so for a game not guiding you to buy anything that is completely optional and unnecessary except the soundtrack which is just not my thing it comes clear and fair tldr solid game worth your time and money ignore the mtx controversy play the game with its true ending,311.4,67.0,1,Recommended,April 12,Dragon's Dogma 2,Dravening
74980,tldr it s not much different from the first game it s better looking and it feels very good to play however it runs like garbage and there are pointless microtransactions update after 200 hours i ve beaten the game granted some of those hours was due to the game s executable running in the background randomly after i accidentally caused the game to crash i actually was en route to get the true ending on accident so my review is based on that experience the game is honestly great as someone who enjoys traveling through morrowind oblivion and then skyrim on foot as opposed to fast traveling i fell in love with this game instantly in the endgame portion i was impressed at how much and how little things change without going into spoilers i feel like the endgame portion makes the experience worth it if only because the difficulty spikes up and now you genuinely feel like you have a purpose as opposed to just wandering around the world looking for upgrades a lot of care was put into the world and you can kind of tell simply by exploring the locations you used to avoid previously in order to reach locations that were previously blocked off or impassable however i honestly feel like the weakest part of the game is the story like yeah it s a great story on paper but its execution felt rushed and befuddled honestly there were two points in the story which made me have to go online and look up what the hell i was actually doing because a character would say do abc your objective marker will say do cba and then the overall plot implies that you re doing bca it s honestly annoying and i do not believe in the excuse that it s an issue with translation nah that s just poor quality control and execution the story has potential but it feels like your actions as the arisen literally doesn t matter until the endgame your subterfuge your actions and the romance in this game feels like it s just set dressing it feels like the bethesda games where you ve literally killed god and bandits still go dang i need to loot your corpse you ve become an unstoppable force yet the plot pretends that you didn t just travel across the continent killing ogres dragons and a medusa before you reach the endgame it s a typical problem with these kinds of games but i feel it especially here i will 100 buy the dlc when it comes out because if it s on the same level as dark arisen then please take my money i ve only played for about an hour my first thoughts were negative because for whatever reason every game since 2020 needs to compile shaders before you even play it which is wild to me after i got past that i loaded up the character i made using their character creator i can totally see how poor the optimization is despite the fact that i m running the game on the highest possible graphics and the game s buttery smooth due to a pretty damn beefy pc though the processor and ram is last gen you can tell because when i dropped certain things like the shadows or even the textures down to low my frames go haywire for 10 minutes until the fsr levels it all out the gameplay itself is so damn good though it s almost witcher 3 level combat but it feels more fluid the boss fight had so much going on made it hard to see what the heck was even going on but i think that s just due to the setting and location the graphics are actually really good i do believe that this industry has officially hit a roadblock in terms of graphical innovation games will only be able to go one of two ways now more hyper realistic which means uncanny valley and really noticeable flaws in facial animations and character visual fidelity or more stylistic using modern graphical breakthroughs to compliment current graphical abilities to provide more interesting and unique visual representations of every day things the sound is good it s a capcom game so they usually have this down microtransactions they exist and it s embarrassing it s a 70 dollar game dlc it a capcom staple but adding dumb gems shards or other stupid currencies is a certified shareholders moment overall it s a solid game as long as your computer is up to snuff as the tldr said just wait for an update that fixes optimization as ridiculous as that is once again mainstream publishers drop the ball on optimizing their damn games before releasing it this was a dumb comment it s more akin to the true directional combat mod for skyrim take that how you wish update i ve played this game way too much and i haven t even beaten it never have i had this much fun playing a game since monster hunter worlds or even skyrim i will 100 admit that the game is terribly optimized but if your computer runs it fine then you ll have fun,452.7,412.0,30,Recommended,March 22,Dragon's Dogma 2,Detective Mekova™
74981,all in all dragon s dogma 2 is an adventure of epic proportions but not without its flaws let me list what i enjoyed and what i did not let s start with the positive the character creator is insane without a doubt the best most detailed one out there that i ve ever seen i actually shamelessly re created myself given a choice i want my first playthrough of any game to truly be mine and in dd2 i could quite literally make that so the first few hours and the last were the most amazing your first fight against a cyclops griffin or dragon are simply unforgettable the build up in strength too is amazing to witness and well fleshed out i got my butt kicked in under five minutes by the first dragon i ran into but by mid game it was the other way around and felt very satisfying the exploration too at the beginning is amazing there s a lot to see and explore i thought i had looked at every nook and crannie but never did get the achievement for having found 50 caves i personally thought there were enough vocations to keep it interesting i fell in love with mystic spearhand and stuck with it all game through i had also mastered fighter warrior my dear amaterasu main pawn was a magician and sorcerer and had a blast terrorizing local wildlife bandits and monsters alike there were truly funny moments too like her handing me herbs after a grueling fight against a troll pleasantly going here you go master like we had just enjoyed some nice quiet lunch instead of a vicious fight the ending was truly momentous i went for the regular good ending first before attempting the true ending and all cussing aside it was truly worth it literally epic to not give away spoilers i ll leave it at that but let me just say when i read people had shed some tears i had rolled my eyes thinking it exaggerated until it happened to me too full marks what i didn t enjoy the endless walking endless no fight was tougher than the mile long hikes through the same areas i had plenty of portcrystals set up but at some point almost ran out of ferrystones and it was painful that was near the end when i had thought i had explored most of batthal haha i had not and forced myself to keep going anyway due to the amazing ending i am glad i did but it was definitely a slog and required a lot of willpower i didn t really mind the banter between the pawns too much but it got definitely repetitive same with the small variety of enemies what enemies they threw in were truly epic don t get me wrong the chimeras dragons griffins the medusa the sphinx glorious fights but there simply were too many goblins and wolves and cyclops and trolls and gods did i hate the trolls the side quests were interesting but without google reddit i would not have been able to figure out how to go about some of them i am all for letting people explore and figure things out themselves but that was in places a but too cryptic the story itself was also a bit all over the place but fortunately the true ending definitely made up for that that about sums it up i only ever bought exactly one item with real money and that was one extra portcrystal so the rage about the microtransactions baffles me as you re in no way required to buy any of them other companies are much much worse about that and get no grief over it whatsoever so as i said all in all dd2 was definitely an epic adventure a glorious rpg with great moments monstrous fights and plenty of adventures definitely recommend,141.4,33.0,5,Recommended,May 26,Dragon's Dogma 2,"SteffiSyndrome

74999,tldr the game itself is great like ddda but better the only problem for me are the performance issues i will happily update my review if they get fixed because i love the game in and of itself updated 1st day impressions i have to say that the performance issues really are noticeable especially for someone who meets the recommended specs i wouldn t mind lower fps overall if it was stable unfortunately it s quite frequent for me to get fps drops in towns and the city i just kind of got used to it by now because otherwise i am enjoying the game immensely the game itself is incredibly good it really feels like a dragon s dogma game to me the vibes are here ddda is so incredibly important to me and this game really matches that feeling of nostalgia it s like i know this game you know it feels like home to me i love that the pawns never shut up i love that the merchants repeat the same line over and over again i love the gathering system being the same i love how the setting feels so familiar i love the combat and how more intuitive it feels now i love this game because i loved the first one and this is more of the same thing it feels like coming home if you love ddda you will love this one too as for the microtransactions i am definitely not a fan i honestly hate them i do but i wish people would fact check before posting negative reviews as you can get those items i think except the music dlc in game for free with minimal effort,213.2,16.0,0,Recommended,March 23,Dragon's Dogma 2,gale's chromatic orbs

75006,dragon s dogma 2 is a phenomenal open world rpg that manages to improve upon most of its predecessor s mechanics excelling at character progression and providing a sense of adventure though people should be aware that it also kept the same design decisions that had already made dragon s dogma 1 a fairly niche rpg experience pros cons incredible attention to detail in world design makes exploring on your own accord a consistently rewarding experience much of the game s best content is hidden away without the player ever being directly pointed in their direction valuing player agency the pace of the game can be quite slow frequent backtracking across vast stretches of the map and very consistent refighting of enemies that used to be more sparse in the previous title can be jarring on occasion character and pawn progression have been vastly improved through inclusions such as pawn specializations as well as overall greater skill diversity especially when considering the newly added vocations many sidequests can be overly cryptic either in what you are supposed to do or in the very mechanics of the game for example the acquisition of maister skill tomes is not only tied to their respective quests but also to their affinity with involved characters absolutely amazing presentation both due to the gorgeous graphics and also the superb framing of many of the encounters such as fighting a medusa in a hidden away temple and finding ways to manipulate her gaze attack or the wingbeat of a griffin breezing across the grass there are some noticeable balancing issues both between vocations but more so with the player outscaling enemies towards the latter half of the game leading to an overall pretty easy game with a distinct lack of a hard mode or an equivalent to the bitterblack isle megadungeon specsz790ud axi7 13700kgeforce rtx 407032 gb ddr5 technical issues and performancecontrary to many other reviews i have not experienced any noticeable issues with the above system i have not crashed throughout the entirety of my playtime nor did i encounter any broken quests or other miscellaneous glitches performance has been very consistent as well with the single exception in the city of vernworth causing me to drop between 5 and 10 frames on occasion graphics and sounddragon s dogma 2 looks absolutely phenomenal apart from sheer graphical fidelity there is an obscene amount of detail in the environment and how creatures interact with it a lot of this is also somewhat needed as arguably the game s best moments are hidden outside of the main quest and are therefore reliant on the player picking out clues from the environment to find them a tower in the distance a statue pointing towards a shrine hidden somewhere in the mountains and more dragon s dogma 2 a screenshot of dragon s dogma 2 by halicor the sound is a bit of a mixed bag overall i find dd1 s ost to be a bit more memorable though here it is still perfectly fitting weapons feel and sound impactful and i have found the voice acting to be quite good in both english and japanese one thing to note is that regardless of the quality of the music it can be a bit jarring to dip in and out of the same combat tracks since especially large enemy encounters have become a lot more common story and settingdd2 shares the same setting as its predecessor in which the player controls an arisen once a regular human who stood against a dragon and for their efforts had its heart taken by the same dragon thus becoming effectively immortal but also bound to eventually confront it again this is all linked to a political intrigue surrounding the sovereignship of one of the two major kingdoms there is a significant focus on making dragon s dogma 2 a bit more of a narrative experience many sidequests will cross over one another in ways that may not be apparent at first there are no quest indicators either forcing the player to go out of their way and intuit how a story may progress like the many optional encounters hidden away from the main story the questing experience relies heavily on the player making an effort to seek many of them out on their own a point of criticism should be that there are both time sensitive quests and multiple points of no return during the story which are not always properly communicated while i found the main story to be serviceable and the sidequests actively quite good sometimes the game is a bit too ambiguous for its own good such as during the notorious sphinx riddles or albeit this not being strictly speaking a proper quest the completely unreasonable task of finding seeker tokens 220 medals hidden all across the obscenely huge map gameplayas an action rpg dragon s dogma features a selection of class kits the player can freely switch between these range from fairly standard archetypes such as archers fighters and mages to more eccentric additions such as the new mystic spearhand a battlemage archetype each of these vocations levels up separately from the player offering both skills that are unique to itself and augmentations that can be freely used on any other vocation as well heavily incentivizing experimentation aside from the arisen players also create a pawn who acts as a permanent party member and that doubles as a soft multiplayer feature this is due to pawns being shared online allowing any player to hire up to two additional pawns next to their own pawns learn during gameplay as well as such if your pawns has witnessed you completing a quest objective it will offer guidance to another player hiring it into their party i do genuinely love this concept as it is very appealing to try and develop your pawn to be more useful to other group compositions as well i do kind of wish that the quest guide functionality would be a bit more in depth than just the pawns generally guiding you to the location in question however in combat aside from the skills you set yourself according to your vocation an integral part of dd is the ability to grab and climb on monsters in dragon s dogma 1 it was vital to be able to deal significant damage which this game is a little less strict about due to simply higher damage potential but is still a vital part of gameplay some enemies require it for certain objectives such as being able to behead a medusa as such few skills or mechanics feel meaningless in combat rather it is up to the player how deeply they want to engage in their party building due to the difficulty of the game generally becoming easier and easier however people may miss the sheer depth character building could reach during a dungeon like bitterblack isle this would also constitute my greatest criticism as currently dragon s dogma 2 becomes quite grindy due to the time limited postgame requiring a vast amount of raw resources to max out your equipment whereas there is no true content that actually requires it and thus rewards carrying on the gameplay loop past the initial playthrough final thoughtsdragon s dogma 2 is a fantastic sequel it is very close to being the best open world game that i have played too with most of my criticism stemming from the fairly niche design decisions that however also make up its appeal limited fast travel may be obnoxious but it undoubtedly adds to the immersion and supports the exploration that the game so heavily relies upon for example it is dd1 but more of it be that for better or for worse follow our curator page summit reviews to see more high quality reviews

75014,tl drthe game is absolutely fantastic and very addicting yet i can t forgive capcom for releasing a 70 usd title with such poor optimization and performance issues on top of the audacity of releasing day 1 pay to win dlc even though you can earn the stuff in game capcom released a statement that they will investigate performance so i ll gladly change my review to positive once they fix it dragon s dogma 2 is the game i ve been waiting for over 10 years i absolutely loved the first and played it for countless hours the sequel expands everything the original title offered pumped to eleven it s really hard to put the controller down once i start playing that said this is a very punishing game you can fail quests npcs can die including quest givers and there is a certain mechanic within the game that can potentially kill all the npcs in a town there is absolutely no hand holding in this title the good this game probably has the best character customization i ve ever seen it s incredibly detailed and there are crazy stuff you can do just check reddit to see all kinds of characters people make combat is meaty and filled with depth it feels like something between monster hunter and dark souls a bit on the sluggish side as you have to commit to your attacks but there are a plenty of animation cancel through skills the whole mechanic of climbing monsters is huge appeal exploration is satisfying and despite the game being open world you ll always stumble on something interesting every so often the pawns will always alert if there are any points of interest and mark them on the map this is arguably one of the best open worlds i ve ever seen there is rarely empty space that plagues so many other open world games you ll always find items to harvest meet a traveling pawn or a merchant or stumble upon a small group of enemies every few steps and the world design is so beautiful and varied it never feels stale you have a lot of freedom to do what you want when you want there are also multiple ways to solve quests the dungeons are incredibly claustrophobic in the best way possible the reliance on using light to navigate dark caverns is something i loved in the original game and it s pumped to eleven here the revised vocations as well the brand new hybrid vocations feel so good to control mystic spearhand is super fun and my favorite so far the power fantasy is much stronger in this game compared to the first one the game has plenty of graphics settings to tweak with nearly non existing loading times surprisingly the bad the story is a mixed bag the first game had a clear defined objective find grigori the dragon and kill him in this one the dragon doesn t even have a name and he doesn t feel impacting to the story in the slightest until the very end they also try to pull some game of thrones vibes with political machinations but it never pays off the whole plot feels incredibly disconnected lots of characters that are featured in the trailer cover and promotional material barely appear in the story there is no build up and there is no pay off things happen at random without explanation it s not some cryptic writing like dark souls just plain bad the camera is a bit janky sometimes especially inside dungeons such as caverns with tight walls while you can increase the field of view it s not enough there are plenty of times where i get hit from stuff offscreen that i have no time to react despite the pawn system being refined the pawn ai still is a bit dumb sometimes they will often approach enemies head on even the likes of mages and sorcerers i ve lost count how many times my pawns killed themselves by standing in front of enemies there is still a lot of platforming in this game but the it doesn t really work very well movement can feel janky and very unprecise while you do have a lot of freedom there are a couple of times where the game doesn t really explain what you need to do the game still uses a couple of outdated mechanics from the first title most notably poor inventory management and vague ability tooltips no gear skill loadout system this was an issue in the original game and it persists here swapping between vocations is still a massive chore there is a lot of backtracking this existed in the original but the world size was like a tenth of the sequel i understand this is part of itsuno s vision and i actually enjoy the traveling but it can get annoying lack of enemy variety that is somehow less than the first game i wish there were more races to choose from you can make humans and cat people but would be pretty cool if there were other races to choose from it s a huge step for the series though the terrible it s really painful to say this but i don t think this game was ready to release yet it s so poorly optimized even though it s loaded with graphics settings my specs are above the minimum requirement but i was getting framerate drops all the time even outside of cities between 20 to 10 fps as well gpu temperatures reaching whopping 90c even with graphics on minimum i ve been reading reports of players with rigs that match or exceed maximum requirement but are also getting performance issues and overheating apparently doing some tweaking on the nvidia control panel remedied some of the performance issues but my temperatures are still pretty high around 83c max also i m pretty sure this game also has memory leak issues because i have 32gb ram but kept getting warning messages about bugs i have a feeling this is a problem of the re engine because i was getting issues like that with the demo of resident evil 4 remake i ve been getting constant crashes during character re customization when using art of metamorphosis i ve legit lost over 30 minutes of customization three times because of that edit i figured out it s related to the background you set up for lightning reference if you use any other than the default one there is a chance it ll crash the game another huge red flag is the fact this single player game launched with a bunch of microtransactions so incredibly scummy reminds me of tales of arise capcom joining the practices of day 1 pay to win dlc is really disappointing fast travel camps items and even character recustomization sure none of them are actual pay to win because they can be found in the actual game but it s still a very bad practice it uses denuvo which definitely plays a role in the bad performance i heard some rumors that it s also using enigma protector too i don t get why two drms in a single player game i feel really bad for itsuno san because he s an incredibly passionate game designer who worked hard to convince capcom to let him make the sequel and fulfill his vision for the original dragon s dogma but this game really needed more time in the oven to polish performance on pc not sure about consoles it s clear the game was released in this state to meet deadlines set by capcom and this whole situation sucks because the game is incredibly fun polishing the gameplay of the original game in a very satisfying way but the glaring performance issues make hard to fully enjoy it at least i didn t encounter any bugs so far aside from occasional pawn pathing which is surprising considering a game of this scope however at the current state i cannot recommend this game even though i m having a

75040,i absolutely loved the 1st dd and was so excited to hear it was finally getting a sequel however i was pretty deflated when it came out and got slammed with negative reviews and i nearly avoided buying it altogether well i m glad i didn t listen and decided to purchase it anyway it is everything i enjoy about dd and other action adventure rpg s and more the world is massive and immersive and exploring it all is almost always rewarding the player customization is nearly endless and offers a ton of different ways to play finally the combat is incredibly engaging and exciting and will constantly set you up with epic and memorable encounters sure the trademark capcom silliness is there at times with the story and it s characters but you should already know what you re getting yourself into when you load up a capcom game in my experience the negative comments that have bogged down this game s reviews have been unfounded micro transactions don t pay for them and play the game normally every single item can be acquired in game relatively easily as you go frame rate drops maybe i m just me but the minor drops i ve experienced are not only not game breaking they are barely noticeable in most cases they have not hindered my enjoyment in any way so if you loved dd and want more of it this game will likely scratch the itch if the original didn t click with you or you re on the fence you may want wait until it goes on sale or skip it altogether but in my opinion you ll be missing out on an amazing experience,143.4,21.0,2,Recommended,May 21,Dragon's Dogma 2,bakersbeard

75056,this game is so much fun even more enjoyable than the first one with a beautifully crafted world that never gets boring to explore despite the lengthy journey adventuring with your own character accompanied by a friend s pawn adds to the fun with enjoyable role playing and smart ai pawns assisting in the adventure the gameplay is incredibly satisfying with challenging combat and boss battles in the 24 hours i played i didn t encounter any issues like bugs or crashes regarding the microtransactions that many people are talking about i see them as optional choices you can obtain everything through gameplay you can farm gold and rc to acquire items available in microtransactions like the art of metamorphosis book used to change your character s appearance however i must admit the game optimization is very poor my gpu isn t fully utilized and instead my cpu works excessively hard no matter what settings i use it doesn t improve the game s performance you should be wise in giving reviews as i believe people tend to exaggerate the issue of microtransactions capcom has already implemented microtransactions in previous games like the resident evil series and monster hunter which even offers a character edit voucher microtransactions are simply for those who are lazy to grind and farm you ll enjoy the gameplay if you start from scratch,102.9,45.0,0,Recommended,March 24,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Suis ""Matasaburo""

75057,i ve been enjoying the game so far i have played the first game it s more of what i loved about the original the microtransactions well i don t want to see these in any game but looking at what is in dragon s dogma 2 it s actually really minor and these things can be obtained in game easily i think don t give it a pass just because of the complaints about these otherwise you d be missing out on an excellent game just don t buy the items because really the game doesn t require you to in order to progress i play a lot of mmos and believe me the mtx in this game is so insignificant it can be ignored performance issues i have a very fast pc so didn t have a problem with framerates but it definitely can use more optimization i believe these optimization issues can be fixed and it should improve the performance for others having more issues running their games overall my recommendation is to buy and enjoy the game just like the first game this second installment promises many hours of awesome rpg fun,253.0,289.0,20,Recommended,March 24,Dragon's Dogma 2,Drakkon
75062,i enjoy the game a lot gameplay wise it is basically what it says on the tin dragon s dogma and for everyone who wanted more dragon s dogma after finishing dragon s dogma dark arisen you will certainly be getting it with dragon s dogma 2 so i can easily recommend the game for people who enjoyed the first game that is the short of itif you come into the game expecting it to be dark souls monster hunter the witcher baldur s gate or anything else then you are going to be disappointed it is not any of those games it is dragon s dogma just like it says in the title maybe there are other games like dragon s dogma but in that case i have never played them so i do not have any good point of reference to compare it toand if you have not played dragon s dogma why in the world are you shelling out 70 for the sequel go and play the first game the story may be standalone in dd2 but the setting and context for it builds on first game more importantly ddda is a fantastic game in its own rightpositivessolid gameplay foundation and loop lots of different vocations to try and a lot of different approaches can be taken in combat similar to the previous game the mechanics and feel of the battles is an arpg at its height the grappling and climbing on bigger enemies is a high point for me especiallythe pawn system is what really sets the game apart from others in the genre and one of my favorite novel systems in the franchise you create an npc sidekick which follows you around on your journey and helps you to the best of its ability this npc can also be rented to other players on the network similarly you might want to hire pawns from other players to give yourself an edge in combat to help with quests or just to translate idiotic elven babble for youlike in the original the setting is also deceptively different from its first appearances and presentation as high fantasy slop it uses themes and subject matter from mythology religion and philosophy that it is rare to see in a game like this and you might not expect unfortunately the forays into these themes are typically pretty surface level compared to the original which was not very in depth in the first placethe setting and worldbuilding also integrates a lot of the more game mechanical aspects of dragon s dogma pretty stylishly and seamlessly sewing crunch mechanics into the fluff of the worldbuilding makes it deceptively easy to get immersed into what is actually a completely goofy and insane setting if you spend more than a few seconds thinking about it i also love the use of archaic english to sell the medieval setting and i get to learn that domain and jail were at some point written demesne and gaol as a bonusnegativesit does have a lot of shortfalls i think a lot of people who played the first game were hoping that dd2 might have released in a more finished state than the first game unfortunately it does not seem to be the case a lot of the content is half baked a lot of ideas were started but left unfinished is a sense i get with a lot of the content in the gameat the same time the game feels notably less ambitious than the first game the story and ideas around the narrative are also a lot more standard fare than previously this is probably my biggest complaint about the game i would have preferred an overly ambitious game like the previous installment even if it meant it would fail to deliver on a lot more ideas at least then you can lament the missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential by cutting its own ambition short in the sequel the game has in my mind limited its potential in the first placethis is also felt in a lot of the narrative worldbuilding ideas which i found cool about the first game such as the everfall infinite parallel worlds cyclical time will volition as the driving force of the world are either left out glossed over or unceremoniously mentioned in passing before being written off as if from a checklist if i played dd2 before ddda i would be thoroughly unimpressed by the setting which is a shamei would say the narrative of the game is still a cut above your regular high fantasy slop but just barely there is a reveal at the end of the game but it is something of a hidden ending that you might have trouble figuring out by yourself without being familiar with the first game note on microtransactionsabout the same story as with ddda you can pay extra to get readily available in game items there is no reason to do this and it does not give you any real advantage over just playing the game normallymy suspicion is that the mtx are reluctantly included in the release of the game as a way to mollify capcom shareholders with the predictable outcome of souring the game for a lot of potential buyers instead note on performancei can only speak for my own setup but i did initially have some performance issues these were relatively easy to rectify howeverif you are having issues with performance try disabling dynamic resolution and fidelityfx super resolution after i disabled these options the game not only ran a lot better but also looked a lot betterthe game as it is runs butter smooth on the high preset for my midrange desktop 1080p rx 6700 xt ryzen 5 1600x and 32gb of ram i understood your mileage may vary a lot depending on your setup and for a lot of people playing

that with care love passion and a lot of dedication you can pull off an incredible rpg originally posted by taleplay check our curator page for short reviews if you wish to get more gaming listings news and reviews check our youtube channel as we release videos there often in depth gameplay exploration dragon s dogma is an action adventure open world game focused on combat monster hunting tactical planning and intensive over the top difficult combat its system focuses on the pawn system a system used before in the first game where you control to a certain degree up to 3 additional pawns that serve as different classes to aid you in combat the difference this time around is the change in the class system where we see separations between archer and dual wielding warriors into two separate classes it s a nice change in my opinion as it doesn t force you to mainly use blades despite preferring an archer class and vice versa the combat is intense a lot more difficult but feels more realistic pawns work together much better this time around prompting for combo skills and evolving in experience the further you progress in the world and face different monsters physics play a nice role here and can be utilized better in your advantage it s a lot harder to dodge incoming attacks from large beasts as the hitbox does feel change and the combos not so predictable exploration is improved this time around greatly the world is expansive rich full of life with impressive visuals and places to explore each carrying interesting places to visit youtube video sorcerer playthrough

the game and make things fairly seamless one hour later community created artwork for steam artwork by robilar5500 sound voice acting the sound effects are great and give a good sense of impact when striking voice acting is fairly good but not impressive in all regards i feel there s somewhat a mismatch between exhausting breaths and the voice of my character main characters from the story are well performed i must remark that the loose language is very well covered by old english expressions and foul language is well censored by different expressions that i personally appreciate the use of old english is interesting in this regard and it s something i don t remember being part of the first game story writing a step in the right direction despite not being heavily focused on the story and more on the experience this game is a step forward in that area a lot of the side quests and main quests can be missed or skipped if you truly just wish to see the game to the end it has 3 potential endings one being the true and the most interesting endings the other two despite one being good feels somewhat like something is missing my pawns a screenshot of dragon s dogma 2 by vasharal length difficulty it s a very lengthy game to complete and so was the first game since the developers have said this game is 4x larger you can expect a good 100 hours to complete it difficulty wise it is fairly more balanced in a way considering the fact that there s no difficulty picking and in dark arisen hard mode getting hit once is fatal here you re still challenged but with careful positioning and patience you can pull it off better verdict dragon s dogma 2 is an impressive game and by far one of the best games i ve played in 2024 i m excited to explore and complete this game and share more if ever i change my views on the game i only wish it would get the fixes in performance it deserves other than that i d avoid taking people s complaints on the matters they don t understand because except for denuvo and microtransactions the game is a gem,142.0,18.0,1,Recommended,March 24,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Vasharal

75110,an affront to long time players of dragon s dogma and dragon s dogma dark arisenas a long time player 12 years almost non stop and content creator for dragon s dogma dark arisen i was over the moon when dragon s dogma ii was announced the character creator was fun yet i was sorely disappointed that personality was tied so closely to voice i preferred having far more choices for my pawn than i was permitted here while i could mostly create the pawn i wanted the voice was off i slowly got used to it in game despite my misgivings it wasn t a game breaker for me i think the story web the developers and director itsuno chose to use is fatally flawed however through no fault of my own and unbeknownst to me a minor yet important npc died before i even arrived at his erstwhile spawn i eventually found him at the morgue revived him and he went back to the location he was supposed to be at however i can not complete the quest because all the enemies are dead and haven t respawned despite resting numerous times completing several side and main story quests and taking various routes and modes of transportation to his location he waves his hands about complaining about enemies that are not there so sad yes i understand the concept of ng and how wakestones work no i don t want to be babysat if an npc dies in battle under my watch then that s fair game if he just dies before i even get to the location though he is a minor npc that interacts with a major npc the very one the devs told us was extremely important and indeed is on the cover art i have read of others who have gone to the end game and an important npc who was needed to finish the story had died the player brought the npc back to life but now it just stands there a complete zombie thus the player can not progress the story to its inevitable conclusion this isn t the first quest that i have run into where there are so many filaments woven together that if one seemingly innocuous thread is snapped the whole cobweb unravels you gave us an beautiful open world but if we explore it we are punished this is not how dragon s dogma treated its hard core players in the past yes you might miss one quest but the rest of your adventure was unaffected by the small loss the game would move forward you still were given many choices for endings in other words you weren t screwed i hear people say there is always new game what kind of a choice is that it s simply unjust to lose everything i played for through no fault of my own because some dude in an office somewhere thought intertwining quests was the coolest thing ever i have found all sorts of great armor upgraded it dragonforged it became a maester in a couple of vocations and was working on finishing that up i am extremely happy with the combat it is fluid it is nice that pawn behavior is locked in place at least as far as i have been able to test that is great for some who never understood pawn behavior or never bothered to try to understand it in ddda those are the highlights it is 2024 why do i feel that i have stepped back in time past 2013 past 2012 4 skills no eternal ferrystone my pawn could be anybody s pawn in an effort to appease a certain vocal minority there isn t as much nuanced behavior other players are talking about metas for this game what that s what made the arisen and pawn system so much fun before anything was doable you could play what you wanted you didn t need the favor of some npc to become a maester warrior fighter magic archer you could dream big i cherished dragon s dogma dark arisen endured friends teasing when they saw me playing yet again built up my twitch and youtube channel on dogma material alone the game did a lot for me it brought me out of a dark place in my life and gave me almost all the interweb friends i know and care about deeply i will leave game performance out of it i do have a powerful machine but 8 10 fps in town while streaming is ridiculous that is post patch by the way overall 7 10combat 9 10 story 5 10 graphics tech 5 10,267.6,32.0,2,Not Recommended,April 5,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Gemmalady

75113,hello i don t tend to review many games and i certainly don t do them early but i feel like this one needs a review due to the recent review bombs i have seen pros the pawn system is interesting fun and unique build variety being able to change class at will and experiment is great fun exploration you are really encouraged to explore to uncover secrets which has you playing the game at a more methodical pace combat this is fun and refreshing action based combat consequences side quests i enjoy the fact that there are consequences to actions and the side quests are decent it doesn t hold your hand which encourages rpg elements such as figuring out some quests not all as many do still have markers and making you live with the consequences of your actions which i feel like will add replayability it does have ng cons performance in the capital does drop a bit it is still very much playable for me and doesn t bother me but it is there the most annoying bit is npcs popping in the game is cpu heavy so don t expect graphics to fix it you will need a higher end pc to play it currently movement is a bit slow it would have been nice to maybe have a mount or have it where stamina doesn t drain out of combat encounters can get repetitive the game throws enemies at you a lot and since you have to walk everywhere and are slow you end up fighting the same enemies a lot micro transactions aren t great and i will never condone them but at least you can get all of the paid for items in this game early on i don t feel a need to buy anything and they haven t unnecessarily slowed down your experience to make you want to buy them like ubisoft does verdict is this game for you it is hard to say dragon s dogma was always a polarising game it is not like many other rpgs and you shouldn t go into it expecting it to be if you want to play it safe you can get the first one in a heavy sale and very cheap to try out the style of game before buying this one this game doesn t really feel too much like a sequel in all honesty and the developer s have even sort of confirmed that it wasn t meant to be this is more like dragon s dogma 1 5 it is what they envisioned the first one to be but didn t have the technology at the time to make so the first one will give you a very good idea if you are on the fence i would highly recommend just waiting for a sale before buying and do plenty of research maybe watch some let s plays reviews critiques but try not to spoil it too much in case you go for it i m not entirely sure myself if it is worth the current price tag but i do think it is a good and fun game and is worth playing so long as you understand what you are getting you can always wait for a price drop and some patches to fix some of the current issues edit i have now played the game for a lot longer than i had with my first review i am still enjoying it massively and think it is worth the price if this is your style of game i see personally see myself playing this for a very long time,63.5,20.0,1,Recommended,March 23,Dragon's Dogma 2,KittyTheCockatoo

75173,review contains mega spoilers obviously tldr after putting a decent chunk of time into this game i honestly can t recommend spending 70 on it the combat is incredibly fun before you start out leveling everything but that s really the only thing that kept me going for as long as i did exploring the world is fun for awhile until you realize that there are very few dungeons that are unique or creative in any way the vast majority of places you discover are a small cave ruin with a few saurians goblins bandits around along with a few chests that contain nothing notable the main story of this game is basically non existent after the first act or what i would assume is the first act since it feels like a second act was cut altogether and a third act started and ended almost immediately the dragon has absolutely zero build up throughout the story and then just kind of shows up at the end like he forgot about us the whole time and was sitting at home like oh dang i m supposed to fight the arisen today overall this game feels like it s in early access or a combat demo with a really big map i put hundreds of hours into ddda on the 360 so it s honestly pretty crushing to realize that the sequel i ve been wanting over a decade is just a shell of what it could have been this just goes for me personally but for me to only put 80 hours into an open world rpg that i was excited for is unheard of for me even starfield got 170 hours out of me after launch and i was disappointed in that game overall as well combat the combat in this game is by far the best thing about it and it s not even close i really enjoyed all the vocations yes even trickster and feel like they all bring something unique to the table a little less so with sorc which felt mildly gutted compared to mage and it s previous iteration in ddda and synergize well with each other the addition of things like ragdolls stagger and take downs add many different and often hilarious ways to take down enemies by yourself or together with your pawn the addition of being able to stand on large monsters also opens up the combat a great deal allowing almost any vocation to be able to effectively mount large monsters the small monster variety in this game is not great but in my opinion the different variants of them behave differently enough to make them not all feel like simply reskins overall the combat systems in this game and how they allow you and the monsters interact with each other and the environment feel amazing and are incredibly fun story npcs the main story in this game is honestly painful to even think about i don t think i can even say it s bad and that s because it barely even exists there s not much of the story that s complete enough to actually critique in any meaningful way but here goes i guess the first act of the game vermund starts off really promising you escape from your gulag and make it to the capital where brant tells you that you re the true arisen and that queen regent disa has installed a false arisen on the throne you re then tasked with sneaking into the castle and surrounding areas in the first few quests to find proof of disa s misdeeds expose her as a fraud and convince the people that you are the true arisen sounds like you ve been set up for plenty of juicy political intrigue with some fun cloak dagger shenanigans right wrong when brant tells you you ll have to sneak into the castle under the cover of darkness what that really means is you re going to stroll into a side door walk right down the main hallway past all the guards and through the castle like you work there pick up a scrap of paper and jump out a window another one of these quests has you breaking a political ally out of jail and even gives you the key surely you ll have to sneak past the guards whose only job is to keep the prisoners in prison right nah just walk right in unlock the cell right in front of them hoist og over your shoulder like a sack of grain and walk right out easy peasy they really made the first few quests in the main story stealth based and then added no stealth mechanics to the game whatsoever the npcs you re sneaking around have no agency whatsoever and couldn t give less of a crap about who you are or what you re doing in the castle the only thing they re thinking about is whether or not they ll have a nice tipple before bed this isn t unique to lowly guard npcs either it s everyone if any of the big players in the main story are standing around somewhere that you can get to you can just walk right up to them and they ll just give you an oblivion npc line about the weather or something anyway you go through these stealth missions and gather your evidence and allies and then all of it leads to nothing absolutely nothing you learn of the godsway and phaesus disa s partner in crime and then the story pivots to finding phaesus and the entire disa plotline is forgotten about altogether so now we re off to battahl to find phaesus and learn more about the godsway here s where i would talk about the second act if there was one we re in battahl now and we re unknowingly a few quests from the game ending here s where nearly all sense of narrative or continuity completely flies out the window we learn of the forbidden magic research lab and are tasked with finding a way in so we can learn about the godsway so naturally we just follow the road signs to the super secret and mysterious lab walk right in the front door and find what we re looking for before leaving nice now we re off to find a man named ambrosius who phaesus has tasked with finding special blue crystals which are used to create godsway crystals which can control minds we know this because when we find ambrosius he just tells us exactly what they re doing why and to what end he then asks if we d like to help him out in exchange for some gold to which we agree from then on the game frames things as if we are working with for phaesus at this point it feels like the story completely falls apart in every way i m not gonna go into the ending of the game in great detail but from this point it s basically bada bing bada boom dragon just kind of shows up and you to your thing game over you can fight the dragon but you re probably going to kill it in less than three minutes then ironically the true ending is to not fight the dragon at all after all this you finally get to the endgame which is a sort of boss rush that leads into the last cutscene there are plenty of powerful monsters around the map in this section of the game which would lead one to believe it to be this game s version of the everfall or bitterblack in which you can repeatedly battle farm these powerful monsters to your heart s content well turns out you only have a couple days worth of time to enjoy this there are ways to stay here but the game is clearly designed for you to complete the game and ng as soon as possible once here in summary you go through the first act and meet a few main and side characters that you assume are going to be interesting and important down the line and then they just aren t a few of them like ulrika who is on the cover of the game mind you and wilhelmina have one or two more side quests and then you never see them in the main story again nadinia also top billed the empress of battahl the country with long standing ties to vermund is a completely optional npc when it comes to the main story disa the first antagonist just says yeah whatever man in the end and she s done then you and the homie phaesus take a walk and the dragon shows up done 5 10 and like 3 of those 5 points are the combat sadge,76.2,16.0,0,Not Recommended,April 6,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Grimgate

75174,edit they addressed the issues i was concerned with all that s left is for game performance to be at a good level then i ll change this to a thumbs up as for the game its itself story 6 10 8 10 if you go for and complete the true ending you also get a different cutscene if you finish it when your main pawn has high affinity gameplay 10 10 the games has the bones to be something truly great but falls short in some areas the fact that new game plus doesn t scale with you is a damn shame however if you are a completionist there s a lot to keep you busy overall rating 7 5 10 needs endgame dlc original review below the game itself is fantastic it has everything you could ever want if you ve enjoyed the original dragons dogma so why a thumbs down it runs like ass and its single save you need a good pc to run it well consistently people are absolutely overreacting with the micro transactions they are tame and inconsequential as almost everything can be earned in game and easily too so buying them makes you an idiot it gives me headaches to see other games with similar mtx tame easily ignorable get praised to the high moon like monster hunter world resident evil 4 devil may cry 5 yet this game gets on for it if you re gonna push back on the mtx which is absolutely okay at least be consistent with the movement with every game past present or future otherwise you re being a hypocrite with double standards and doing absolute all to get companies to understand what is unacceptable or not the only micro transaction that is seriously questionable is the 2 character editor if you don t like the way your character looks you re out of luck because you can t make another save file or make another character the 2 character editor itself is inconsequential you can get it in game however the 2 editor in combination with only having one save file is an absolute scumbag move not being allowed a quick redo or make another character via another new game save file is depressing that said if you have a good pc or don t mind fps drops don t mind having a single save or don t even care about mtx then by all means go ahead and enjoy underneath all the scummy business decisions and optimization is a genuinely good game i have long past the refund window but i have a decent enough pc so i might as well just enjoy this absolute gem covered in mud however those on the fence should just wait a bit until capcom fixes the optimization and single save bs then this game would be an 100 easy recommend without a shadow of a doubt it is situations like this where i wish there was a sideways thumb or conditional recommendation option why hasn t steam added something like this is a mystery to me,250.2,24.0,1,Not Recommended,March 23,Dragon's Dogma 2,Ursiri

75199,after 120 hours the rose tinted glasses have shattered and i can safely say that this game is not good and i cannot recommend it in it s current state the base game s content is absolutely pathetic and the fact that the previous game in the series offered a more robust and complete experience even without dlc is a sham the fact that the performance hasn t been addressed or that it even was released in this state is inexcusable the combat balancing is truly a mystery to the greatest of scholars the fact that thief is the only class capable of teching the numerous knockdowns in this game unlike the previous game where every melee class was able to quickly stand up severely harms the pace of combat as unlike the previous game getting knocked down does not put you in a canned animation but rather a full ragdoll which i will admit is very entertaining at first but quickly becomes frustrating the nerf to all magick bolts for both mage and sorcerer severely limits their playstyles compared to the first game the enemy variety is somehow worse than the first game featuring only a few flavors of goblins or saurians in the overworld and very few new large monsters having been created in exchange for losing the hydra archhydra cockatrice evil eye the other two dragon variants wyvern wyrm we only gained minotaurs medusa who you likely will miss and the dullahan being one of the only fights in the game that i think is truly fantastic but unfortunately the dullahan so rarely spawns in that you could potentially go an entire playthrough without encountering one there is almost no incentive to actually fight anything at no point in the story is defeating a large monster mandatory save for the final boss which pales in comparison to the first game the unmoored world is a pathetic excuse for an endgame what it does do well with presentation is completely and utterly shattered in gameplay the everfall from the first game featured a diverse range of challenges all for the goal of collecting wakestones or simply preparing for the dlc meanwhile more time is spent walking in the unmoored world and the few new fights there are are simply repeated across each challenge all of which leads to an utterly anemic ending without even having the privilege of a satisfying final boss 4 10 this game is dead and the updates are too little and too late to revive it until an expansion comes,127.3,25.0,1,Not Recommended,May 15,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Antarctica's #1 Yoshimitsu

75205,writing this review feels almost as disappointing as playing this game one might think that capcom learned from the flaws of the first game solving them while improving on the strengths right no quite the opposite enemy variety instead of fighting the same 6 monsters types like in the first game you fight the same 3 tedious travelling instead of fighting the same monsters every 50 seconds you fight them every 20 seconds romance system basically the same only made more pointless story they are even reusing the exact same story with the same twists the only difference is that using the same twist post dragon does not work again because it s so predictable if you have played the first game bosses there actually are some new bosses added to the game but instead capcom thought it was a good idea to let you fight ogres and cyclopses again for 90 of the time while taking out the best bosses of the first game beholder and hydra classes yes the classes were pretty unbalanced in the first game but instead of balancing them they just butchered all of them by giving you only 3 abilities except for the warrior my recommendation is to stay away and play the prequel with the dlc which is the best part compared to both games after that you can get this on sale and be as disappointed as i am if you crave a game with a combat system as unique as dragon s dogma,90.8,19.0,0,Not Recommended,July 8,Dragon's Dogma 2,"SeanLilarcor

75268,i want to preface this review that i did absolutely enjoy my playtime with dragon s dogma 2 i even went out of my way after completing the post game to go grind out some of my missing achievements for a full 100 i didn t gather all 220 240 seeker tokens though but its a game i have a lot of gripes and issues with one of the few times i wish steam had a mixed review instead of flat out yes no i adored the first game i had my first playthrough of it back with the dark arisen re release back on the ps3 i still have fond memories of the first time i went out exploring at night getting my ass handed to me by skeletons because of just how unprepared i was and the closest to recapturing that feeling was from fromsoft s soulsborne games the first game was very publicly unfinished the final dungeon was cut and replaced with a single swirling hallway instead of a dungeon taking place on the moon multiple races the landmass etc was all unfinished so coming up on twelve years later and itsuno and his team being able to take another shot at releasing a fully finalized realised take on dragon s dogma is great and i think for the most part they did succeed in that exploration itself feels far more rewarding than the first game i actually wanted to go off the beaten path the map design primarily vermund is downright fantastic i loved filling out my map and finding all these neat little crevices mines caves and minor settlements i spent 50 hours exploring the world before i even bothered touching the main quest after reaching the third proper quest it was enthralling satisfying and i m glad i was able to experience that eventually both from playing the game and looking back on it i do feel a gnawing pain of what the game could ve been and i ll discuss this throughout the review enemy variety in terms of general exploration traversing main roads and following the main quest dragon s dogma 2 has the exact same enemy types as the first game bandits goblins hobgoblins wolves saurians harpies cyclops undead ogres griffins and golems and finally drakes for a game that likely had years of planning a large amount of cut content from the first game to build off of surely they could ve added more entirely unique enemy types i had fun the combat s great as usual with dd itsuno s works devil may cry 3 onwards but i fought these enemies so so many times back in the first game and they re largely unchanged knackers are unique but they re just goblins that hide within bushes or around trees that s kind of about it in terms of bosses ogres cyclops griffin drakes a singular medusa and then the sphinx where did the beholders go the hydras the cockatrice why were they removed it pains me to be fighting largely the same enemies that i have done for so many times sure it s enjoyable but after all this time i wanted more unique enemy types dungeons there s basically none the closest we get appears in the final zone and can be missed if you follow the main quest but again it just uses the basic goblin saurians and cyclops you ve seen for two games in a row and features nothing all that unique or interesting in terms of layout ambushes etc the caves themselves are largely pretty well designed and a good chunk of them can act as shortcuts throughout the world the dungeon i just mentioned lets you bypass a gate barred by the main quest some of them even feature fairly good level design but they all share the exact same look cave within mountain 8920 so aesthetically they re absurdly repetitive what happened to the unique dungeons we got within dd1 everfall both pre post game versions dark arisen s bitter black isle arguably the best part of the game and one of the reasons its so highly regarded now waterfall ruins soulflayer canyon ancient quarry the goblin fortress etc they were very very distinct the main quest i m not even sure what to say for this dogma 1 s main quest whilst it had large flaws and pacing issues at least felt cohesive and built off of itself fairly well plot points made sense and the titular dragon had a large presence throughout the story here though i thought the opening hour or so laid a really solid foundation and an interesting premise a stolen throne a false arisen somehow controlling pawns great stuff sadly that all goes to the wayside within 3 main quests the main quest is incredibly short and feels absurdly unfinished this feels evident as the millisecond you reach battahl you re bordering on the endgame the main quest can be summarised as reach kingdom do a side quest to progress main story sneak into castle four times reach battahl talk to npc kill a drake or two walk to final boss and the whole plot around finding out the false arisen and taking back your kingdom it s just gone after the fourth quest the villains have zero presence within the story even the dragon barely exists for a world which i really like by the way built on a multi dimensional cycle of dragon vs arisen why does the dragon do nothing you get a singular flashback 10 minutes into the game and he s gone until the final boss fight grigori in the first game was a constant threat everything you did was to deal with him why am i wasting time collecting evidence for a false arisen that does nothing to us you see him in a brothel the throne room and then the end why battahl this area just feels like it was added in last second the beastren were a major part of the marketing their empress is even a key part of the boxart banner art on the steam page and yet battahl has a really small map density main quest progression only gives you two main quests total there before moving onto the final boss which takes place in another part of the map and not battahl and in terms of side content you re either constantly barraged by an absurd combat encounter density with 100 goblins or human beastren bandits like 10 caves where a good chunk of them are fairly small and come to a screeching halt with abrupt dead ends no destroy able rocks walls or floors and maybe at max 6 side quests for such a major component of the marketing where s the content why does the quality of the game just radically dip the millisecond you reach battahl it s a crying shame as the zone s designed quite well from a map design and visually its artistically beautiful one of the few times i have loved the look of an arid desert biome in games but from a gameplay standpoint it s not all that fun to explore or go through endgame post game i just flat out don t like it everfall wasn t amazing but i d take another everfall over a weird timed roguelike which goes against the whole preparation and exploration focused main game why should i be rushing around the world constantly with a slight worry over a timer or having all of my progress lost because i died visually its pretty neat and the new paths are decent enough i d just want to explore it at my hearts content and at my own free time instead of dealing with a timer to finish the quests there i won t spoil it much because that d be unfair to do in a review overall the game s a great time but i just can t stop thinking of what could have been there s a survey going around which is nice to see maybe they ll address content concerns issues with free updates and then an eventual dlc dark arisen styled but bigger hopefully i view the game at least vermund as a great remake of the first game but as a sequel it kinda feels pointless and at times a worst game overall i d recommend the game still and i m glad the game does exist i just wish it was better and felt far more cohesive than it currently is also yes the game suffers from performance issues the microtransactions suck but they re the most bog standard mtx

game whenever you wanted to do so unlike in this sequel incredibly stupid oversight or cynical attempt to sell microtransactions while making the game far worse in the process you be the judge personally i m left wondering how much of this game might ve been made artificially worse to potentially sell me something on top of that dragon s dogma 2 runs like garbage has worse keyboard and mouse gameplay than it s predecessor it s plagued by denuvo and i find myself remembering that i paid 70 for this game while also being past the refund window maybe after a lot of patches i ll change this into a positive review but this is a pretty shameful release in terms of improvements i really enjoy this game s character creation too bad the game goes out of it s way to prevent me from actually using it much on a similar note improved graphics are nice but i d much rather have the game run at least somewhat well instead i feel like this is one step forward and two steps back the sequel update after game completion having finished my playthrough i m now only more convinced that this sequel went backwards and it s hard to justify playing this over dd da certain vocations are acquired so late in the game that they might as well not even be in the game at all i mean there are a number of baffling design decisions displayed within this game but this is a great example i can see what they were going for by not having all of the vocations immediately available for use in the capital although i m not sure that i agree with the decision yet what i can t understand is who thought it would be a good idea for magick archer to be acquired so late that you d be unlikely to even be bothered trying it much less leveling it two of the original game s most enjoyable vocations are entirely absent here you can equip four abilities as opposed to six in the first game and this is especially noticeable on sorcerer again i just don t get it what were they going for here it seems like this game has been obstructed at every turn by questionable design choices which seem to add nothing boring sidequests even in comparison to the first game at best it s a problem which hasn t been improved here all vocations have less abilities and augments to choose from and there are also less gear slots with a noticeable lack of options in general what gear this game does have is subjected to what are sometimes bizarre restrictions limiting the effective options to a couple pieces of armor for certain hybrid vocations the story is a step back from dd da the dragon in particular is barely a character at all anymore he doesn t even have a name in dd2 meanwhile he was incredible in the first game in fact the confrontation with him perfectly encapsulates how this game is an uninspired clone of the original game despite failing to include most of what made that game enjoyable aside from the combat seriously watch the sequences in question from both games back to back they speak for themselves by the time i finished my playthrough i d acquired one portable portcrystal and i could ve purchased another keep in mind that i played the game blind so that s two in a game with an open world four times the size of the original as stated by the developers now granted i m certain that i missed something but i could also make the argument that the fast travel solutions in this game are unintuitive and insufficient consequently a large portion of my play time was spent traversing backtracking and all the while running into the same goblins saurians harpies over and over again it s mindboggling how dark arisen added the eternal ferrystone after all the backlash over the backtracking in the original game and yet it s entirely absent here despite this game suffering from the same problem and the problem is actually far exacerbated here as i was getting at in the previous point this game has a fairly severe lack of enemy variety most of enemies it does have were ported from the first game despite that dd da still has a greater enemy variety than dd2 no equivalent to dd da s everfall or bitterblack isle in fact dd2 has little to no endgame content whatsoever so as a result my favorite parts of the previous game simply aren t in this game at all in and of itself this wouldn t necessarily be a bad thing but the problem is that this game isn t so much a true sequel as it is a reimagining of the original game yet in it s current state dd2 is inferior to the original ng is rendered mostly pointless by a lack of any sort of hard mode or scaling difficulty by the time you reach it you ll annihilate every enemy in your path while facing zero challenge frankly i d have preferred a quality remaster of dark arisen over this game at least as it exists as of the time in which i m writing this review it genuinely feels somewhat bad to even write this as dd da is one of my favorite games tl dr don t bother with dragon s dogma 2 unless the graphics of dark arisen are a dealbreaker for you and 70 is asking a lot when considering how many issues are present within this game dd2 is entirely carried by it s combat and even then there are less options here than there were in dd da most likely a lot of this will change in future patches and inevitable dlc but i m reviewing the game as it is now at it s current price,99.0,19.0,0,Not

75516,alright i m going to cut through all the bull about muh microtransactions or muh one save files or muh performance and i m going to give you the most honest review that i can the microtransactionsi m going to get the biggest elephant in the room out of the way first we ve all seen a lot of complaints over this with not much context backing this up so the microtransaction dlc stuff you see on the store page is all stuff you can acquire within the first hour or two of playing the game wakestones rift crystals the ability to reset your character s appearance you can get all that stuff within the first couple hours i ve honestly never seen a series of microtransactions so utterly pointless to buy since well to be honest the first dragon s dogma yeah you heard me right the first dragon s dogma in fact capcom seems to have gone to some lengths to directly copypaste the ddda mtxs and they were just as pointless there too as for the presentation there is none none of it s remotely in your face at all now that i ve established that the dreaded microtransactions are the most pointless purchases known to man let s move on to something a bit weightier and if this is still a dealbreaker i m sorry but i m also glad we got it out of the way early performanceokay yeah this one s actually a solid negative from me i can run most games of similar graphical fidelity at a solid 60 80 fps on max settings or near enough dragon s dogma ii struggles to make 30 on medium high for me that being said i m also a former console player so i don t really care that much as long as the framerate is consistent which dd2 can usually accomplish unless it s loading in graphic intensive areas in which case i drop to 15 20 for a few seconds if that s a dealbreaker well i m sorry but i m also glad we got it out of the way now one save slotyeah it s a bummer but it was also present in the first game so i don t know what to tell you here story gameplayi m going to lump this all into one category here sorry about that it s just how i m rolling i m not gonna sugarcoat it this game is ddda but bigger meatier and with the names and some of the small details changed around that s it it s not a sequel unless there s some hidden boss 80 hours in or something it s a remake i honestly blame the marketing team here that being said i really can t say anything more than what i already did it s ddda with moderate to large improvements across the board if you liked the first game you ll probably like this one unless any of the above categories were dealbreakers if you didn t like the first game there probably won t be much to recommend with this one the voice acting is moderately improved from the first game we ve gone from an average and serviceable 4 5 5 5 10 to a decent but not outstanding 6 5 7 10 in that regard the dragon continues to be awesome the dialogue continues to be presented in a somewhat archaic syntax delivery that most people seem to be annoyed by but i find oddly charming the core gameplay is essentially the same as the first game from what i can tell but hey if it ain t broke why bother fixing it the story is the names and faces are different but the broad strokes seem to be the same there s still the big capital city about halfway down the eastern shoreline on the map except this time you start in the north instead of the south but the broad strokes are similar enough to where i was able to map my progress by comparing the ddda quest progression i e oh yeah a quest here was just x quest from ddda so b quest here will probably fill the same role as y quest from the first game and so far that s been essentially borne out final verdicti like it solid buy glad i got it that being said i m fully aware of what made me like the game might turn other people off but if you liked ddda and nothing of what i typed here is a turnoff for you dd2 is probably worth checking out dd2 is ddda but bigger and better and i can high five my pawn sometimes and that s all i really wanted out of another dragon s dogma game but if you don t like that i completely understand,63.1,23.0,0,Recommended,March 22,Dragon's Dogma 2,Legionary Guard
75517,the game is pretty amazing on its own especially if you haven t ever played the original dragon s dogma or especcialy dd dark arisen it is plagued by performance issues however windows users get it bad but currently linux users get 50 the performance of windows users due to the game only being able to utilize 50 gpu and 50 cpu regardless of your setup now for those who have played and enjoyed original dd this game is a major downgrade in almost every respect except for the beautiful world and graphics so much has been dumbed down that the list would be pages long broadly however combat no longer requires strategy tactics or preparation this game is a button masher due to how leveling works regardless of what equipment you use you will reach a point just from leveling up normally without grinding where it ll be pretty easy to win every battle just using your default attack and occasionally trying to dodge a hit or two this game has fewer weapons fewer pieces of armor and fewer types of enemies than the first game augments don t matter at all you can play without any just as well as you can play with them enabled and probably never notice a difference due to the innate imbalance of the game clothing slots were removed armor was dumbed down and simplified to be more skyrim style the pawn inclination system has been dumbed down bestiary knowledge no longer exists even the rating system has been simplified i would never recommend this game to a fan of dragon s dogma in its current state however like i said at the start of this review this game will be fun for those who haven t experienced the original dragon s dogma and enjoyed it,253.2,44.0,3,Not Recommended,March 22,Dragon's Dogma 2,"cream

75865,i wish i could recommend this game i really do i am 85 hours play time and i have loved every minute of it going wherever i want doing whatever i want for me the fantasy and immersion of this game is unreal and unmatched imo i ve bloody loved every second of it it was amazing i say was because my game is now stuck in ctd loop crash to desktop that i do not know how to resolve i have an extremely highly capable pc i was able to brute force my way through most of the performance issues people were having as of the last 24 hours i do not know what has changed the game was not patched my graphics drivers did not get an update verifying file integrity in steam does not help administrator mode toggles do nothing bottoming out the graphics does nothing restarting my computer does nothing making sure everything is closed except steam and this game does nothing nothing does nothing everything does nothing i can no longer play the game for more than 30 60 seconds without a hard ctd and then spending the next 2min as the capcom crash error reporter collects data to send to capcom to tell them their game is hard broken the only thing i can think of is that my save is corrupt in some way because i am close to vernworth city and the closer i get to it the faster i can make it crash i don t want a refund i don t want to stop playing the game please fix the game capcom it s a masterpiece that wants to be played but i am literally incapable of doing so i want to change this review to positive i really do,187.0,18.0,1,Not Recommended,April 5,Dragon's Dogma 2,Petce
75867,ok so after playing the game for 8 hours i m here to give my review i f seen alot pf complaints about mx which isnt true 1 they are dlc so can only be bought once 2 they are very easy to gain in game just by playing the game so everyone is jumping on the hate for the wrong reason the fps for me i locked on 50fps on 4k which is good enough for me playing with ray tracing on and shadows mid and i dont have a high end rig so far i only get a lower fps in the biggest city which plays between 40 50 which isnt too bad what i dont like is the 1 character only thing which is stupid and they realised they made a mistake and said they are working on now overall the game is beautiful and combat is really amazing i pre ordered this game and went through it even after all the hate and i dont regret it a little bit it s been a very long time since i had a game that got me excited to get home to play 9 10 for me would get a 10 if they fixed the single character issue and make it easy to restart the game,66.2,28.0,0,Recommended,March 23,Dragon's Dogma 2,Firegeddon

75893,update wanted to include a brief rant about the state of dragons dogma 2 since capcom obviously pushed this product out way too early the game seems only half finished the story is barely there and it is extremely hard to care or even follow it s just so meaningless the weapons are lacklaster and all of them are available at any blacksmith weaponsmith npc yes there is no merit to explore and tackle challenging bosses encounters there s literaly nothing to gain other than xp in a game that is basically built on immersion it s sad the weapon variety screams how unfinished this game really is some of the weapon types don t even have elemental options and every single new weapon you find is basically just an upgrade downgrade there is a clear difference in numbers and almost zero special effects to consider just go with the flow and buy a new one each time you want to feel stronger verdict dragons dogma 2 is 3 10 one of the saddest single player time wasters with a great foundation but in an absolutely unfinished state i d suggest supporting capcom and its corporate incompetence by buying it under 15 or buy something that at the very least its publisher cares about dragon s dogma 2 is an absolute mess to the point where i cannot even blame capcom for getting away from the traditional gaming culture and joining the ranks of ea blizzard and many other beloved companies who compete at destroying their product at a large scale with cash shop and low life quality simply to abuse an already beloved title from back in the day when their name meant something the performance is terrible to the point where a frozen screen is part of the gameplay capcom also encourages players to not get invested in their game it randomly saves your progression overriding your previous save file and there is only one one time i wanted to redo a timed quest that saved instantly the moment i failed i tried to load my save from the inn when i realized i lost 6 hours of progression it was my bad not realizing that campfire is not part of this feature however since they went with this approach for absolutely no reason i feel like blaming them for intentionally wasting their players time effort and will to play any further the story feels like an unfinished university project that was started the day before without any memorable moments characters or real action and threat it s simply about kill that thing then bring that other thing there is absolutely zero drive in the player to put effort into the goal their characters want to achieve other than reaching the end of the play through tho simply uninstalling seems to be the better choice among players the dialogs are the most ridiculous thing i have ever experienced within a game they introduced a new old feature awkward silence well as long as the player doesn t manually start the next sentence or accidently skips conversations because it is hard to tell when it s over,112.2,18.0,0,Not Recommended,June 26,Dragon's Dogma 2,Alaric Bell

76113,dragon s dogma 2 is a game that as a fan of ddda i really wanted to like unfortunately at every turn i get the feeling that capcom didn t try to make dd2 but rather dd1 2 and what they ended up with is dragon s dogma 0 7 and at the point where i can say i had fun with the game i absolutely cannot recommend it certainly not in its current state short summary to be expanded below character editor audiovisuals improved combat system and game formula lack of new game option fixed but worth mentioning re engine optimization and technical graphics side microtransactions developer statements and unmet expectations fewer monster types than in ddda simplified armor system and overall equipment classes and skills pawn system worse than in ddda storyline endgame eternal wakestone character editorprobably the best character editor in capcom games which besides visuals slightly affects character statistics mainly endurance and its regeneration carrying capacity and melee weapon range audiovisualsdespite some shortcomings facial animations the game looks really good models animations there s not much to complain about here the music doesn t particularly stand out with a few exceptions and it lacks something as characteristic as the main theme from ddda unfortunately the technical aspect related to graphics disappoints improved combat system and game formulathey moved some skills from the original game s weapon skill to core skill which immediately improved combat here you can really feel progress compared to the original because fighting is simply more enjoyable similarly the core of the game remains unchanged from ddda it s still an action rpg with an open world somewhat trying to be like what if monster hunter worked in an open world medieval fantasy setting now on a significantly larger map where west part of the region is a different biome lack of new game option fixed but worth mentioning wtf capcom i find it hard to believe that no one absolutely no one during the game s development or reviewing process noticed the absence of such a basic feature as the new game option it s like some grim joke from a game dev re engine optimization and technical graphics sidecapcom is heading down the same path ea recently stumbled upon pushing for all studio games to be on the frostbite engine here you can clearly see that the engine is barely keeping up when forced to generate an open world with a large number of enemies npcs and more options than the closed corridors of resident evil locations the optimization sucks especially in cities related to how the game calculates npcs and the game should not have been released in such a technical state furthermore there s something off with the implementation of rtx and dlss as enabling both options noticeably degrades the game s appearance and this is a problem not just for me as modders have already fixed it working much faster than capcom microtransactionsyou might have already read somewhere that microtransactions in dragon s dogma 2 are okay because everything or almost everything can be obtained normally in the game however this is a single player aaa game it shouldn t contain any microtransactions and it s a mistake on capcom s part especially since you can practically get everything in the game without much trouble it was an unnecessary move that brings more pr backlash to capcom than benefits developer statements and unmet expectationsanother aspect that looks bad is related to the developers statements about the game and how it was marketed before release you hear about how the developers don t like fast travel because it s shortcut how they want their game to be so engaging that players don t feel the need to use fast travel at all what do you see after release microtransactions with a fast travel pack another issue is with the game s announcements quoting one of the trailers the game will offer what we ve shown and much much more the problem is there s nothing more practically all the most interesting elements of the game were shown in the trailers but more on that later a third issue is i m not sure if this is confimred that dragon s dogma 2 had a much smaller dev team than other flagship capcom titles fewer monster types than in dddacontinuing the above thought i refer to the trailer with the sphinx the creators promised more of complex monster encounters there s literally nothing more like that in the whole game the sphinx is a one time encounter the fight with it is completely optional and quite easy to miss there s another monster definitely less complex but if you remember zorah magdaros from monster hunter world and weren t a fan of that fight i have bad news for you there are fewer types of monsters than in the predecessor moreover not only are there fewer monsters but their population is spread over a map about four times larger which simply makes everything feel the same everywhere the fact that despite the larger map the distances between enemy groups seem even smaller than in ddda doesn t help making fighting all the time start to feel tedious in the long run just to be clear here s a numerical comparison of monsters small and bosses together in ddda and dragon s dogma 2 ddda 92 types of enemiesdd2 57 types of enemies simplified armor system and overall equipmentthere are fewer options regarding armor in the game leading to situations when using a riftstone pawns are dressed in very similar gear capcom claimed this solution would increase diversity in ddda there was an armor system where you separately chose the clothing layer and the armor layer this has now been simplified to one category per body part except for the head where some items are treated as cosmetic and can be worn with a helmet most often it s some kind of mask or glasses another criticism is that there are no horizontal choices here practically every item has its clear upgrade every category of item has the best item you want to find did i say find i m sorry i meant buy in the game about 95 of equipment can simply be bought from a merchant along with the best items available in the game i m not sure if this is a flaw but it s worth mentioning the chest system has been changed from ddda and now contains predetermined items but their contents never respawn unfortunately most of the things found in chests are junk or consumable items,70.4,32.0,3,Not Recommended,April 20,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Maly_007

76185,first off the negatives that everyone know so far the game uses denuvo drms are bad drms are evil there are microtransactions that weren t called for there is no in game option to restart your save to which i answer drms are evil drms are bad the mtx are all optional none are needed not even the riftcrystal dd2 is no mobile game farming you can fast travel with in game items looted or purchased with gold you can change your appearance with in game items purchased with rift crystals that can be easily looted off monsters treasures and through online pawn sharing they have no right to exist in a single player game but thankfully their existence don t take away game content their existence don t make resources harder to find these exist for the silly people who love spending more money than they need to also you can reset your save file by using steam cloud s settings and deleting some local files the goodit s dragon s dogma the combat is what dragon s dogma managed to achieve ten years ago reactive rewarding satisfying chaotic in terms of action rpg it is and always will be one of my favorite systems so of course i ll be biased the gameplay feels a little more sluggish but this sacrifice ends up making the movements and interactions feel like they blend together a lot better stamina is still consumed outside of combats and unlimited in settlements health and damage work nearly the same way the difference is that whenever you take direct damage your maximum health decreases down to 20 limiting your amount of recoverable health this encourages players to do better to avoid the heal spams and to simulate grievous wounds that need tending at an inn or at camp won t be to the taste of everyone but i began to dig it exploration is slow can feel tedious but each journey is rewarding there is always that sigh of relief when you can finally return to town unload your loot stock up on supplies and equipment then you just go out there once again further than last time easier than last time because your stats increased because you became better at mastering the system it feels good you want to find sidequests listen to npcs ranting about speak to them discover rumors there isn t any marker telling you hey you can start a sidequest there some npcs will come to you some will never interacting with the world is rewarding pawns the ai controlled teammates feel overall smarter more active and reactive the personality system has been simplified for everyone s joy although this takes away the joy of finally having a pawn do whatever the heck you wanted them to do it will work for some it won t for others but to be fair in dd1 you could just forcefeed scrolls to your pawn until they decided that gathering items and hugging you during big battles is actually a terrible idea i really enjoy this game i am so so very happy to finally see it exist and so grateful i got to play it so here is my honest tl dr review keep an eye on the game if it s your jam but do wait for compatibility performance patches i may have a somewhat powerful computer i want more people than those with very good rigs to be able to enjoy it the game is so very satisfying and so carefully made with a reputation unfortunately tainted by the terrible horrendous habits of the modern gaming industry please give this game a chance when it gets more accessible,90.5,37.0,1,Recommended,March 22,Dragon's Dogma 2,BryzzWind

76487,so i am going to have to give the game a negative review and it is entirely based on the save system it is the most backwards junk system i have seen in a decade you get two save the constantly auto updating main save and the inn save the inn save can only be done as inns so of course in this massively huge open world map their are inns all over the place right no you have camp site all over the place so you can get an inn save there right no so in the few inns there are i can just go up and click save no it costs you gold and automatically puts you into a rest cycle weather you like it or not to create back up points you will literally need to go to the save file location on your computer and copy the save file and save a copy some where else on your computer the inconvenience of this system negates any positives about the game because a wrong button press or the game crashing at the wrong time can cost you hours of game play i can t fathom what the game designers though that this type of system would add to game play edit so found out why they have this screwed up save system and the reason is even more messed up then if the game designers were just idiots it is a spoiler but i strongly suggest that everyone playing this game looks up the in game effect of what the dragon plague is this feature that can soft lock your game advancement is just about the dumbest thing i have heard as a game design if you want to find out what this little gem of a poison pill idea the dragon plague is on your own that s fine just remember that the save system is designed to screw you hard,81.1,24.0,0,Not Recommended,March 25,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Rusharn

77620,keep in mind that with all of these reviews you never know who or what kind of person wrote them so they might aswell be a complete idiot that did not play the game or they re someone along the lines of a video game journalist as such i want to tell you that i have hundreds of hours of playtime in the first game across multiple systems xbox switch pc and was quite a fan of it s unique albeit unpolished gameplay but even then i was only sold on it once the game started opening up which is when you beat it so i let me preface this by saying i do want you to try this game as i greatly enjoyed it and yes i am biased but there are points in this game that left even me wanting specifically endgame has performance issues ranging from minor to medium i tested it on multiple setups on the one im sticking with rx6600 ryzen 7 5800x3d it runs smoothly at 60fps high ultra settings sans stuttering in one city that i literally havent visited in the last 20 hours of playtime which accounts for 50 of my first playthrough that solely being the major city in the first region bakbattahl and the minor settlements and the open world all run really well personally i didn t mind one bit as it never impeded me in playing the game as you almost never fight in the city though the fps issues there still really need to be improved upon it s really not an acceptable state but you can live with it i really don t get why people say the performance makes it unplayable do you run a 1050ti 2017 ryzen in 2024 or what it might be that this game greatly benefits from the 5800x3ds cache though no idea as for the gameplay i think it improved upon flaws the first game had and gave it some much needed quality of life no more running all the way to gran soren to swap out your skills as a mage because all of them are simply not fit for fighting the specific enemy you re going to encounter as you can change skills while camping now it really wonderfully ties in into the exploration because that s what you ll constantly want to be doing as you play through it i had to often remind myself to not keep exploring for 4 hours at a time and get some progress on the main story in the first game you often would lament playing melee because of flying enemies i found this not to be as big an issue in this game as the melee vocations vertical attacks gained some range so unlike the first game i wasn t just standing around waiting for my pawn to do it for me but actually leaping into the air and beating them myself this game is perhaps the closest thing there is to what i d want to a dnd experience as an action rpg the combat travelling and exploration aswell as the ways things can get messy really make it feel that way for me if there s anything bad i would have to say about it that would be that combat while it does have some weight to it it feels as though the first game had more to it and i miss that feeling i would like to speak about the difficulty of the game but i as someone who is experienced with these games cannot tell a potential buyer the game is too easy it is a little tough in the beginning but you lose that feeling after 10 or so levels and then only drakes and lesser dragons will seem imposing to you however they will seem that way for a while even ogres still mess up you up if they get you good later on however it certainly doesn t feel as esoteric as the first game and that i miss mystic knight fighter even though it got some skills from the class just isn t quite the same without the seal orb cannon i don t think the game is particularly unfinished or untested and anyone who says so didn t play the game but rather that people had high expectations for something that was never going to be more than dragon s dogma 1 2 and honestly i blame ecelebs in part but that s capcom digging their own grave if there is something that i disliked about the game it would solely be the post game content i already had expectations as to what would happen in postgame due to dragon s dogma 1 so i probably wasn t as surprised as someone who would experience it for the first time again in that regard this is really just the first game all over again but it s missing something akin to the everfall from the first game if this game would receive dlc or atleast something akin to the first games dark arisen i believe that would make me strongly recommend it to everyone instead of only strongly recommending it to people that enjoyed the first game and even those will have one or two bad things to say about it people like and dislike games for different reasons after all i think it s really funny that people complain about the microtransactions as they re on the same level of buying red orbs for dmc v if you even think of buying them there s something wrong with your head i sincerely believe they just put them in to satisfy some capcom suit that really wanted mtx and they put these in knowing noone will buy these though i wish getting the first games ost available for this game wasn t mtx either i can somewhat understand why it would be the same people that complain about mtx here readily spend 20 bucks for cosmetics in other games by the way they wouldn t be here if people didn t keep buying them this sort of thing is why this is so prevalent everywhere should ve gotten used to it cause this is the future you chose there s a reason why fans of the first game kept chanting stuff among the lines of dragon s dogma is the worst game i have ever played i love it it was never for everyone especially not with what the avg modern gamer wants but i think with just a little more it could be for everyone,155.6,72.0,6,Recommended,March 26,Dragon's Dogma 2,"tammy

77879,dragon s dogma 2 is an awesome successor of dragon s dogma dark arisen but not perfect in my opinion it s a 7 5 10 so why does this game loses 2 5 in rating easy 1 5 for microtransactions which aren t that useful in my opinion 1 for an absolutly horrible performance which isn t fixed yeti finished my first playthrough in about 120 hours but that s not how long the story is going on i did a lot of exploring to get up to 120h,154.9,17.0,1,Recommended,April 29,Dragon's Dogma 2,"Ares
