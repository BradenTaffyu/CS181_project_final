33571,2021 apex was a truly amazing game it helped me have an outlet as well as something to play with my best friend i had so much fun with it i made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins after 510 hours and a decent financial commitment and interest i wasn t able to play as things where getting busy with work in that time frame my ea account was hacked by someone not steam but ea the thing i m not using to play i m unsure of what that person did but whatever it was was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement despite the ea support seeing the suspicious login activity and acknowledging my account being hacked they still decided to stand by the ban so here i am 510 hours in and unless i want to spend 5 months going through legal issues this is the end of apex for me i m sure someone reading this would say i could just create another ea account but why would i invest any more of my time into a game where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens are punishing you for it ea will not get a single dollar from me ever again and i will pass the message anywhere i can overall don t buy this game and certainly don t spend any money on it cause it could be gone in an instant,512.0,999.0,92,Not Recommended,"December 2, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,<RG> Tyberious

33581,2021 out of all the brs i ve played extensively pubg warzone apex danger zone fortnite this is the one that i actually continue to enjoy warzone is way too sweaty pubg s the engine lag is too unforgivable fortnite is too goofy and danger zone has too little to offer the movement mechanics in apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless the legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don t feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like overwatch can and that skill ceiling is insanely high developers are constantly adding content again and games queue up very quickly so it doesn t get boring if you tried apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of season 7,669.2,230.0,4,Recommended,"March 17, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"buddhapest

33597,2020 apex legends apex legends is one of the best feeling fps games on the market everything is tight from the looting to movement the gunplay and so much more being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze apex legends proves it is here to stay monetization like most f2p games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop and for some skins in apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny along with the typical battle pass there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck there are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent albeit with a large grind attached most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard gunplay gunplay in apex legends is near perfect for any fps game period with 24 weapons available to choose from each feeling as great to use as the last every gun in apex is deadly if wielded correctly this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot there is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just click and once it does you ll never look at another fps the same the variety of recoil patterns enjoyable to master bullet drop etc all combine to provide the core of apex s masterfully crafted gunplay when you lose a fight in this game it doesn t feel cheap it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made if there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in apex legends it is skill one major facet of gameplay to note is that apex legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates this means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback this is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into apex as the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes mastering the gunplay and movement system in unison is key to constantly achieving that delicious chicken dinner a screenshot of by notaspy game modes apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked it also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours besides that apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace ranging from solos to snipers shotgun and many holiday themed events movement arguably one of the most popular aspects of apex legends is its movement system and how fluid it feels to traverse the map mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim the default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with with sliding down slopes to gain momentum being able to climb walls for a couple seconds are the basis of the movement system using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed just line in the gunplay after hours of experience it just clicks and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance looting a battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides and apex legends is no exception to this rule like i said with 24 weapons to find countless grenade types attachments med shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner as stated above every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a bad starting weapon isn t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre the first couple minutes of a hot drop is almost like a randomized deathmatch where the best team that utilizes abilities teamwork and aim to reign supreme not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun now previously i never really liked finding attachments in battle royals but in apex legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use so it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match which might sound bad on paper but in action it works extremely well almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game there are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor in other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick a real shot in the dark but in apex legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival from smoke grenades to firewalls sticky explosive there is a lot to play around with so managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry leads to inventory management being a key skill as well the possibility of your loadouts is almost endless the tools at your disposal are a revolving door of toys a screenshot of by notaspy roster with this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from each offering a completely different playstyle all with their unique advantages and disadvantages it is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat from pathfinder s grapple hook to help swing across maps wattson s ability to anchor down tight corridors crypto s drone for intel and that s not even scratching the surface each champion offers a unique passive tactical ability and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork 3 of the possible 15 champions to select from finding the right composition and the use of teamwork is crucial to becoming an apex predator a screenshot of by notaspy map design there are two maps currently in apex kings canyon and world s edge with the new map olympus being released today while they are by no means spectacular they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place both are filled with key landmarks that have you reminiscing of battles old and new there is a real focal point on elevation in apex legends which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times if there is one thing to take away from apex legends map design is to always have the high ground visuals sound despite apex legends stealth drop back in 2019 the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre apex legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from respawns doing at first glance the visual style might seem generic but soon you will see all the original love poured into apex s unique art direction running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards the sound quality of apex is also on par with its visuals each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you re up against from the kraber to re 45 each gun has a satisfying boom the real win in the sound design is the top notch directional sound in other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end whether you re in a building 200m away or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in apex is unmatched conclusion apex legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today there are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is apex legends please do yourself a favor if you like brs tight gunplay and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter apex legends is an auto play especially considering the barrier of entry that is being free to play overall score 9 10 visit

33618,2022 with over 900 hours on apex on origin and 400 hours on steam i can confidently say that i wouldn t recommend this game to newer players with the amount of smurfs highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies even as a prestige level 112 theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at now i know most of you will say thats just a skill issue but when its in every single match it gets quite annoying another issue is apex s skill based match making the concept is simple you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you however apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level i hope this review is helpful sincerely a concerned player,767.2,163.0,5,Not Recommended,"December 29, 2022",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,Xiraret

33637,2021 apex legends was the first battle royale game i put more than 1 hour into normally i don t play these types of games they re just not something i personally enjoy all too much but apex legends was different since a lot of my friends are really into this game so i was able to semi consistently have someone to play with which is amazing putting in almost 20 hours i feel confident enough to say i ve formed an opinion about it so this review is just that do i think apex legends is good honestly yes i do i didn t expect it but i ve been so far enjoying apex legends quite a bit there are gripes i have with the game but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not my answer would be a solid yes if that s enough to convince you good hope you go on to enjoy the game for the rest who want to hear more read on gameplay there are a lot of aspects about apex legends that i enjoy when talking about gameplay so let s break them down point by point gun playthe guns in apex are satisfying to use most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying if i had to compare it to anything oddly enough i d choose to compare it to tf2 the gun play is rock solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage for example is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say hey i died but i had fun not everything is perfect though one of my least favorite mechanics in any first person shooter is bullet drop off and apex has that i can understand why for the sake of balance so that someone with an smg can t just snipe across the map but even at mid range it just feels clunky and annoying on top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless prime examples for me would be most energy weapons and most shotguns their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use while this would be good in a tactical shooter in counter strike or something in a fast paced battle royale like apex i just don t think they work very well and they aren t anywhere near as appealing as a sniper rifle or an lmg i now understand why there s memes about shotguns in this game being bad it s because they just really don t fit in with the way this game wants you to play it to clarify i m not saying they re useless i m just saying that other options will get you results faster more efficiently abilitiesthis game s abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and i feel like they aren t integrated into gameplay properly it s the one thing that i dislike about this game being that you have no idea what you re getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once but perhaps that could be seen as a good thing as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent but this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others most of the time i end up playing bloodhound lifeline because they re conceptually super simple and easy to grasp whereas characters like wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not overall though i appreciate that this game doesn t make it so you need to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you can use if you need it movementi love this game s movement mechanics being based on the source engine of all things it s no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics moving around flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels really good and during fights movement can either be the make or break of an encounter the only complaint in regards to movement i have concern a specific legend pathfinder his standard grapple ability depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple once you get the hang of it it s super satisfying but man does it feel awkward initially monetization this is a free to play game it s natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they ve created the one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher ea the worst possible one given this fact how s the monetization in this game honestly i m incredibly mixed on it lemme go into detail why dlcthe dlc is stupidly overpriced for what it offers the steam reviews reflect that 30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price the other dlc definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer honestly i m hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it s just a shame altogether i d personally avoid the dlc if i were you unless it goes on a 50 off sale at some point if ever lootboxesi think the lootbox system in apex is pretty okay i m not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best apex legends lootboxes offer 100 cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon character skins from what i ve gathered they don t do limited time lootbox drops so they re avoiding making the consumer feel fomo which is a welcome addition in other words they re there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and i really appreciate that battle passthis is one thing i actively dislike about this game s monetization system purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like reach level 25 to unlock this skin only for you to reach level 25 and the game tells you buy premium to get this skin at which point i just wanna tell the game to off the battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium battle pass i actively dislike that graphics sound optimization how are the other aspects of the game graphicsfor being developed on the source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it the game looks great not outstanding or stunning but still visually appealing and eye catching some gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often i found myself staring at insanely low res textures only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones it s not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something i noticed regardless soundthe sound music of apex is good the guns sound great the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying the music isn t anything outstanding nothing that sticks in my mind so i don t really have much to comment great to have in the background during non crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute forget about the voice acting is okay does the job the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to optimizationi think the game could use some work in this department i frequently notice random frame drops also mentioned the texture loading thing but as a whole the game doesn t seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate it s just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying conclusion there are more things i wanna talk about but i have to cut it due to the steam character limit overall apex legends surprised me being that it s satisfyingly fun looks great but the monetization system optimization could use some work if you were on the fence about trying it you should try it and see if you like it,98.3,200.0,11,Recommended,"April 10, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,irrelevant

33656,2023 it s absolutely impossible to enjoy apex legends the goodhonestly the core gameplay of apex legends has to be one of the best games out right now the weapons the characters the movement mechanics everything is deep and enjoyable if it s all you look at and when they truly feel balanced it really is a great game at it s core but it s potential is just ruined by terrible choices of the dev team the badhorrific match making there is no such thing as casual play i can t understand it what am i even playing i m a dad i play a couple hours a week of video games i just want to hop on with some buddies and get some kills and have a little fun not allowed you will play against the sweatiest try hards imaginable every game no breaks it s brutal but not in the fun grinding haha brutal kind of way more in the draining you of life almost immediately kind of way if you play regular lobbies you play against the top 1 multi thousand kills players you play ranked you still play against those same guys what s the point of either one i just want to play against players around my skill level i don t want to just get headshoted back to back by a triple take from miles away i don t want to spend 10 minutes looting and looting with no mic randoms just to be rolled and not even fire my weapon by a full masters squad in pubs i don t want to get to end game with 10 teams alive and half of them are just rats in the most disgusting rat spots and i just have to wait til final circle and throw a 50 50 shot at who gets a down first the game has deteriorated to such a point that you have to do the most boring stuff to win or you die immediately from a third party every gun fight the uglythere s so much ugly about this game the toxic player base the hacking the over powered legends and weapons on release to sell skins the overpriced store items the audio the list is endless conclusion stay away some of my favorite streamers and yours play this game and even for them it s a brutal grind but sometimes it s impressive what they can achieve and it makes it look like fun the reality is very far from that those guys play 8 10 hours every day for years to get that good playing this game for the first time or even casually is absolutely impossible a great potential game is ruined by its own awful match making decisions,322.5,679.0,53,Not Recommended,"August 19, 2023",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"TeflonDon3000

33699,2020 i played nearly 600 hours of this game on origin before the steam release which is practically unheard of for me in any game i m also not a huge multiplayer pvp game fan so to get so invested in this game says a lot to me with that last thought in mind i m also far from a great player i ll have my moments and i d say i m pretty mediocre at this point but i ll still get slapped down pretty hard when my mmr seems to start getting too high even still i ve steadily brought my k d ratio up from a miserable 23 at launch to a current 60 with starting out season 7 it s not perfect and there have been issues plaguing nearly every season most recently this season s biggest issue is the battle pass which was tweaked to make the grind insufferable and hard for any normal person like me to dream of completing previously there were widespread issues with hits not registering and as with many pvp multiplayer games there s a certain toxic element in the playerbase that can be hard to avoid i ve spent probably 95 of my time playing this game with a pre made squad to avoid playing with randoms never mind the 20 tick servers they ve been using since launch which may be unacceptable to those with more experience in pvp games like this even with the issues this game does have it s still a blast to play each character is unique and the movement is quick snappy and just feels so good even the sound effects of breaking shields and knocking down opponents are incredibly satisfying i may not be joining in on this season s battle pass without a major overhaul to minimize the excessive grind but i m definitely going to be putting another stack of triple digit hours into this game going forward edit 1 a bit under 20 hours for me to unlock all of the steam achievements which on origin took me some 150 hours to accomplish some of these unlocked early with my carried over origin data but i have still pulled off a win with 8 different legends across the 4 different hero types to feel like i legitimately earned it on steam as well i ve also so far kept my season k d ratio slightly over 1 0 after 100 games so i m super excited to see just how much i ve improved cannot recommend this game enough for a battle royale pvp game to anyone who has friends to play it with edit 2 now approaching 250 hours in steam so roughly 850 hours total including origin and still having a mostly great time the newest season was absolutely the most stable so far as well even if the new map is a bit of a mixed bag,459.2,68.0,3,Recommended,"November 6, 2020",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Ryuuga Hideki

33708,2021 i have 0 hours on steam because i ve played over 900 hours on origin and let me just tell you that i personally think this is the greatest battle royale game ever created it blends the perfect mix of gunplay communication and mobility to create an almost perfect game there are some kinks for new players which i assume a lot of the people reading this review are going to be are currently the issue with smurf accounts is rampant and it can be a very difficult experience getting used to the game and its combat when level 450 wraith mains create a new account and then dunk on the newbies with a wingman if you stick with the game and reach level 10 or 20 this becomes less of a problem as many smurf accounts are used a few times to troll or have fun without reaching higher levels if you even consider playing ranked expect a massive amount of cheating respawn has not fixed the issue of hacked clients and very often you see players who have hundreds of kills still playing fine in ranked lobbies it is currently an extremely toxic and impossible environment to play not mentioning the many glitches and bugs that plague it and i really hope respawn takes the time to fix those issues in the next ranked season as is customary with electronic arts they do enjoy getting consumers to pay as much as possible and recently were exposed for putting certain cosmetics with unmatching sets in the store even though the teasers for the new items showed said items together in a uniform set this is only a big deal if you ever really consider putting money into the game the only benefit to using the in game store is cosmetics and by playing regularly you can earn a lot of rare and legendary items yourself these are either recent or temporary problems however and the benefits and pros of this game far outweigh the cons if you have been looking for a battle royale that is unique in its own sense and will take you away from the endless spam of fortnite pubg warzone and other popular brs this game is absolutely for you please give apex a try i am almost certain you will not regret it,373.0,147.0,6,Recommended,"January 5, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Elluvon

33738,2022 don t bother anymorethis game was a gem years ago seasons 1 6 were honestly a blast game felt refreshing and there was a larger player base so you weren t put up with people on the top if you weren t on the topit started going downhill on season 7 the content was great sure but the player base started to dwindle somewhere around season 11 12 things hit the fan and you started seeing 3 stack predators in normal lobbies i think this was something they did with ranked it hasn t really recovered the game has gotten stale respawn is a shell of what it used to be if your looking for a shooter i reckon to say that this isn t a good place to start i have tried multiple times to get back into this game following season 12 but to no avail each session was just met with more and more frustration as me and my friends arguably middle golds were consistently matched against high diamonds masters and the occasional predators in both ranked and unranked skill based matchmaking is no longer a solid thing i m afraid and you cant improve if you get gunned down the moment somebody sees you that and ea respawn have been shifting more and more away from interesting gameplay and more and more into recycled content to sell more skins ontop of butchering existing and established ideas to be politically correct occasionally when you can find less sweaty lobbies it s still a good time killer titanfall2 s online features can be accessed with the northstar client look it up,423.5,680.0,29,Not Recommended,"December 8, 2022",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"VenomDragon

33775,2020 a fresh start to the battle royale genre tl dr if you are considering trying out this game i highly recommend it it s very fun and offers a completely new style of battle royale apex legends remains by far one of the most solid shooter games i have experienced and i am extremely happy to see it land on steam to be given the opportunity to play it without all the recurring issues caused by origin this game combines aim skill split decision making movement and communication delivering it all in one package characters the character selection is amazing and allows players to choose which legend they want with each legend comes specific abilities and skills that differ from many other battle royale games and adds depth to the gameplay every character also has their own backstory based on titanfall lore and you will often hear references when they engage in dialogues movement this game has incredible capability in terms of movement the complicated and meticulous movement based system allows you to manipulate your character limitlessly to gain a competitive edge for example you are able to climb on top of virtually anything as well as slide which enables the potential for variety in each gunfight not to mention the movement feels fluid allowing for more challenging and fast paced combat gunplay and mechanics the guns are very responsive when fired and never feel clunky in this game you ll find that there is a wide range of guns to choose from whether it be assault rifles smgs snipers shotguns or pistols along with the numerous weapon choices also come attachments which can be applied to improve factors such as recoil firing rate magazine size etc the option for readily available customization to weapons adds incredible potential and power on the battlefield apex legends also has mechanics which are exclusive to it such as evolving shields moreover it introduces a ping system which allows users to communicate in all sorts of ways from each person s perspective making it easier to cooperate as a team updates and content the game s updates remain consistent and always add new and exciting content through new limited time modes this includes legends weapons and new maps map changes new skins are also released which are specifically designed to appeal to the player base furthermore the gameplay also always remains stable and balanced as developers ensure any bugs or exploits before implementing changes in every patch tweaks are always made to the guns and legends sometimes drastically changing the way the game is played the latest updates are always posted after each patch and can be found on the official apex legends news website conclusion overall the developers at respawn entertainment are doing an excellent job with apex legends as it has proven to be consistently good and innovative throughout everything they ve released so far i am enjoying the game a lot and will continue to play it and am very excited to see what s coming next score 8 9 10was this review helpful if so please leave a rating and comment on what you think this is my first time writing a detailed review awards are greatly appreciated,772.0,44.0,2,Recommended,"November 5, 2020",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Vhaen

33776,2022 i m so trash at this game but i can t stop playing it hard stuck gold because boomer hands and i feel like a damned imposter just soloing sitting at the very bottom of plat 4 ranked in this game can be very toxic but honestly the experience is worth it by virtue of how flashy the fights are playing apex is like if everyone were a raze main in valorant i ve met and queued with some wonderful people in pubs so i guess that balances out the toxicity by a fair amount on top of being a flashy game apex hands down has one of the best battle passes in most modern shooters other games have bps that feel like a sludgefest to complete and just don t give you enough breathing room in case you have to miss a few days here and there in contrast you can start the apex bp late complete it through various modes complete it further with the help of limited timed events that provide extra stars levels to your bp and you can definitely finish it with weeks to spare my favorite part about this hero shooter is how the impact of movement is definitely more pronounced and plays a large role in winning games i main raze in valorant and i just loved the transition from that kind of aerial maneuvering to the plethora of movement techniques you see in apex tap strafing bhopping walljumping super grapples etc it just hits different compared to slower tactical shooters and i love it great game there is no substitute for this kind of fun,542.2,66.0,16,Recommended,"April 16, 2022",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Jedo

33915,2023 product received for free edit this review was for season 17 the game has changed a lot since then and match making is much better for casual players today the time needed before being able to play ranked has been lowered and the console dominance is not as noticeable anymore stay away new player experience and it s by far the worst gaming experience i ve ever had the displeasure of living through barely this is a long one first warning this is not grindr the way it constantly invades your behind you could easily think it is but on grindr at least you have a chance of a kiss first if you are a new player looking for a new game stay away i repeat don t even think of touching the load of crap that this game is right now apex is not interested in new players stay away there are two major issues that completely ruins the new player experience in this game the first one with separate but no less horribly designed flaws that contribute to the larger issue 1 there is no new player pathway to get to know the game in a fun and easy way as a lvl 1 account you have access to 3 game modes which is a playlist of non battle royale maps such as zone control and then you have br duo or trio but not ranked to be able to join ranked your account needs to be lvl 50 which took me and my friend about 90 hours so just to be able to join a playlist where decent matchmaking is expected you need to play through a single player campaign worth of time so you re stuck with these 3 modes to grind for 90 hours and it is a horrifying grind the apex matchmaking has created its new category of completely useless in our first games we were constantly matched against people with 1000 s of kills and when our kda dropped close to absolute zero we instead only got people with 100 s of kills if you re unlucky enough that the game accidentally gives you a match where you happen to win then you re screwed you re back at practically every match having diamond players on the other teams will you get matches without diamonds sure but i can count those matches on one hand the times i ve wanted to send hate mails to the devs i ve lost count of but say you stay and try to hit that lvl 50 mark to get into ranked because there surely it ll get better right first you have 10 placement matches in my first i had 10 diamond trails which kinda makes sense you get tested against the best to place same thing the rest of the 10 games great i got placed in wood 2 below bronze that has to mean i ll get matched against other suckers like me right no my friend and i were rookie ii we had a bronze iii friend join cause ranked is only trios and here we go again diamond trails all over the place top players having 1000 s of kills bad first luck i ve played 5 more ranked games and it hasn t been any different it s like apex says they ve implemented a ranked system but forgot to add the actual code for placing you in a rank or adding a rank limit for any matches i can go on for ages about the abyssmal matchmaking apex doesn t have but i think i ve made my point clear 2 the second major issue is cross platform which is a great thing when you want it but as a pc player you can t turn that off consoles can pc can t and that shouldn t be too much of an issue right you have a mouse that moves way more precise than sticks only what apex did was to give controllers a gluestick of aim assist it doesn t matter if you have 100 more hours than the controller you re up against if you re in a 1v1 he will down you majority of the times because he can t miss when most of the streamers of a game switches to playing on console it s a very telling sign that you have an issue this has been voiced by the community but apex doesn t care 3 and that s the third category of issues with apex that aren t game breaking in the same way they don t care about you i had several technical issues in the beginning and i posted several threads on different forums including apex own technical forum on apex forum i never got a reply on the other threads the answers ranged from gitgud or yeah apex sucks you just have to deal with it the apex support team is nonexistent except if you post in an unsupported language and the apex player community is with a few exceptions just straight out toxic and it makes me sad because the game is fun the champs are unique with lots of fun ideas the weapons and items are good and allow you to form your own play style the maps are good and gives you great opportunities to utilize the unique play styles the champs have but these positives are nothing compared to the horrible matchmaking the unfair device configurations the heap of technical issues and the community sure it s free but in its current state you should get paid to play it i would ve had a better time counting grains of sand in a desert for 90hrs i can t stress enough how bad of an overall experience apex has been there aren t enough numbers below 0 for me to rate this game don t touch,840.3,395.0,58,Not Recommended,"July 20, 2023",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,Chaosbuttclaps
33916,2021 this will be a very long review highlighting all the issues with apex what are the issues 1 the serversi always jokingly say servers ordered on wish because i don t know one single other multiplayer game that runs on 20 tick rate servers this results in you getting shot when you re already around a corner or when you already closed a door but still the shot magically goes through the door this is even worse when the ridiculously low tickrate gets paired with high ping which you will get pretty frequently at least as an advanced player because sbmm drags you across servers which results in you selecting i e frankfurt 2 15ms but once you re in the game you have a 90ms ping it is unbelievable how one of the biggest game publishers keeps a game so big on such a terrible infrastructure apex generated 500 million dollars of revenue in 2020 and ea plans on doubling this to 1 billion dollar yet they keep the servers on the crap end because it isn t ea s 1 cashcow it is pathetic and shows why ea truly is the worst publisher that deservs to be hated by everyone 2 sbmmsbmm or skill based matchmaking is a thing in apex personally i don t even have a problem with that and as someone who almost has 10k kills on wraith i personally preferred getting matched with master and pred sweats than to stomp some level 40 noob however apex sbmm doesn t simply match you with similarly skilled players an apex legends pro by the name of bowswer revealed how it actually works it gives you a few good games and after that when you play with randoms at least it pairs you with worse players also due for a loss on purpose while matching you against higher skilled players so to anyone who has some experience with this game if you ever wondered why your randoms are level 50 garbage with maybe 30 kills while your champion squad is a triple stacking master squad rocking a 20 bomb 4k badge triple triple badge or whatnot now you know why this happens you can read the article for yourself just search for apex pro player reveals how sbmm doesn t match players based on skill level it s an article from the website gameriv they also linked the thesis paper that ea has on the engagement optimized matchmaking framework personally i think apex sbmm goes even further this is unproven territory tho just my personal assumption based on 2400hrs of total playtime if i include smurfs to the point where it alters the loot you get again pretty much every advanced player knows these game sessions where you get some great rounds at the beginning and all of a sudden after some decent games you re suddenly struggeling to find any decent loot you run across half the map but you just can t find anything better than an alternator and a havoc without turbocharger heal items like cells syringes batteries medkits or pheoenix kits seem to almost not exist in this particular match or least not for you cause whenever you encounter enemies they always shoot at you with r301 s or volts 3 the legend metamy issue with the legend meta is how legends are being held to completely different standards in both their abilities and the buff cycles legends like gibby got buffed again and again in i think it was season 5 to the point where 95 of the playerbase said he was op also basically everyone made jokes about even further buffs eventually respawn realized and they nerfed him a tiny bit by reducing his arm shield hp from 75 to 50hp meanwhile other legends like mirage and octane had been waiting for some buffs since the beginning of the game they eventually got some buffs in season 6 and following but only with the season 8 buffs i d say that they are finally good legends like bangalore have not really seen any real buff even though she is only mediocre at best they did buff her ult a little by making it explode faster but that s it meanwhile legends like horizon entered the game incredibly op as a result she very quickly skyrocketed to the top of the winrate in season 7 as far as i know she is still 1 i won t explain the multitude of unique and unfair advantages that she has but in short she is the smallest legend now that wraith s hitbox got sized up by 15 yet she doesn t have low profile she s almost impossible to hit in her gravity lift cause she can a d strafe quickly while being 30m up in the air you can shoot a horizon low and all she has to do is make her gravity lift and she is basically guaranteed to get a battery through her tactical and her landing both have no sound before the nerf wraith was the legend with the smallest hitbox horizon s hitbox was just 5 bigger back then but she didn t have and still doesn t have low profile and while that was is the case for her while she also in 1 in winrate the devs did not see any need for a nerf instead they decided to nerf wraith for the 5th or 6th time even though she had already dropped to 2 and she had low profile while being basically equal in size no matter how you feel about a legend completely objectively speaking this is entirely unreasonable it is also unreasonable when you compare horizon s tactical cooldown 15s with the cooldown of other legends lobas crappy bracelet has 30s wraith s phasing has 25s even though horizon s q is definitely stronger than both the point about this is not to rant about certain legends if you still want to see it that way feel free to do so i can t do more than talk the point is to explain illustrate the highly unreasonable and illogical and therefore frustrating buff nerf attitude that respawn has towards its legends caustic has finally received a nerf a pretty massive one actually but i d say contrary to what caustic mains say they did not break him i still avoid gas it still causes big trouble it just won t kill you in 10s when you have full hp but even with the recent changes which are actually decent you still shouldn t expect reasonable and equally spread out legend balancing 4 soundthe sound of apex is the no reg of cs go it s not like it will happen with every 2nd enemy in every game but it will happen frequently enough in order to get frustrating gems are the silent devo back in season 5 or season 6 and a classic that has persisted through the game no footsteps if you ever get frustrated cause an entire squad came sprinting up to you and they all shredded you from behind all i can say is welcome to apex legends ladies and gentlemen imo it has gotten even worse after the 09th march update 5 the consistent ignorance about player demands obviously when a game has millions of players you can t cater to all demands however there have been some requests that are voiced quite frequently by the community but still these fatures have yet to find their way into the game a few examples are the introduction of a kill cam a top 3 system for legends the idea is to mark 3 legends as your 1 2 and 3 favourite a random picks your 1 favourite legend and you re afk no problem the game automatically picks your 2 favourite solosdespite popular demand the devs will simply not implement these fatures even though some are super simple to do which is insanely frustrating solos is especially frustrating soooo many players want solos but the devs seem to have almost some fundamentally religious opposition towards it they don t even test it you know instead of at least trying it out they keep up this no we will not implement solos attitude but they implemented no fill which allows you to play solo against trio and duo squads makes sense that concludes my review i kept it as neutral as

33927,product received for free please follow united critics for quality reviewsapex legends reviewi ve been diving deep into the world of apex legends on pc and let me tell you it s been a wild ride apex legends isn t your average battle royale game it stands out with its unique blend of characters abilities and high octane gameplay i m excited to share my experience with you breaking down the game s storyline gameplay mechanics visuals audio and more so grab your favorite snack and let s jump into the electrifying world of apex legends about this game storyline apex legends takes place in a universe where the frontier war has ended and peace seems to be a possibility however to maintain peace the apex games were created these games are a brutal battle royale where legends from all corners of the frontier compete for fame glory and fortune the lore is rich and evolves with each season revealing more about the legends backstories and the world they inhabit for example wraith with her interdimensional abilities is struggling to uncover her past while bloodhound a technological tracker follows the path of the old norse gods the game doesn t shove the lore in your face but if you re like me and love digging into stories you ll find plenty of lore scattered throughout the game in voice lines cinematics and environmental storytelling gameplay mechanics apex legends gameplay is where the game truly shines it s a mixture of strategy skill and quick thinking i ll break down the key mechanics characters legends each legend has a unique personality backstory and set of abilities including a passive tactical and ultimate ability these abilities can significantly influence your playstyle and strategy for instance gibraltar provides defensive capabilities with his shield while lifeline focuses on healing and support as of now there are a total of 25 different legends you can unlock and play as to unlock a legend you need a total of 12k legend tokens which can be earned by leveling up you get 600 tokens per level which means you have to level up 20 times to unlock a legend there is also the pay to unlock route where you can buy apex coins using real money then use that to unlock the legends you want the legends are divided into different classes with class specific unique perks as follows assault combat utility initiation assault legends can access the extra compartment in weapon supply bins and can carry extra ammo skirmisher combat mobility escape skirmisher legends have the passive ability known as care package insight which allows them to see the contents of a care package before it even lands recon enemy intel tracking recon legends can access survey beacons which reveal the location of all enemies in the map for a brief period of time controller area setup control controller legends can access ring consoles which show the team the location of the next ring support team survival supply support legends can access the extra compartment in the extended supply bins and also allow the whole team to craft ally banners using replicators movementone of the first things you ll notice in apex legends is the fluidity and dynamics of movement this isn t just about running and gunning it s about mastering the art of maneuverability advanced movement techniques players can slide down slopes for increased speed climb up higher walls than in most shooters and use zip lines to quickly change positions this verticality and flexibility add a whole new dimension to combat and exploration parkour elements the game incorporates parkour like elements you can vault over obstacles slide through narrow gaps and even perform a bunny hop to maintain momentum while healing mastering these movements can significantly improve your survival and combat effectiveness balloon redeploy scattered across the map are redeploy balloons that you can use to quickly ascend and then glide across the map repositioning your team or escaping a tight spot this feature adds an extra layer of strategic movement no fall damage a key feature in apex legends is the absence of fall damage encouraging players to take daring leaps from heights without fear of health penalties this freedom supports the game s emphasis on high speed three dimensional combat visuals audiovisually apex legends is stunning the game s world is vibrant and detailed with varied environments like deserts cities and forests the character designs are impressive each legend having a distinct look that fits their personality the audio design deserves praise too gunshots footsteps and voice lines are crisp and clear providing not just immersion but also valuable information during gameplay you can often hear enemy movements before seeing them adding a layer of strategy to the game at times the audio can be really bad pros diverse legends with unique abilities effective non verbal communication via ping system fluid and engaging movement mechanics strategic squad based gameplay regular content updates and balance changes immersive graphics and audio continuously evolving lore wide range of weapons for different combat styles competitive ranked play mode active community and developer interaction cons challenging for newcomers to learn all mechanics occasional server issues and connectivity problems intensely competitive environment limited options for solo play requires substantial time investment for unlocking features periodic bugs and glitches a lot of cheaters voice chat toxicityconclusionapex legends on pc is a standout title in the battle royale genre offering a unique blend of characters engaging gameplay mechanics stunning visuals and immersive audio that creates a captivating gaming experience however it s important to note that the game may not be as beginner friendly as some might hope the matchmaking system has been a point of contention often placing new players in lobbies with high ranked experienced players this can make the initial learning curve quite steep and potentially frustrating for newcomers despite this challenge the pros of apex legends still significantly outweigh the cons the game s adrenaline pumping action strategic squad play and rich lore provide a diverse array of attractions for different types of players if you re up for the challenge and willing to navigate through the initial hurdles apex legends offers a rewarding experience so if you haven t tried it yet i d still recommend giving apex legends a shot who knows with some perseverance and practice you might just

33942,product received for free apex legends is a game i have played for 4 years and i have definitely seen its ups and downs as time passed i would personally recommend this game not just because it is fun but because it has its own unique characteristics in comparison to other battle royale games like cod warzone and fortnite you can certainly look up many things about this game but i believe that it is most likely guaranteed you will find a legend in the roster that suits you best there is also a great amount of customization in this game which can be very expensive if you choose to spend money on this game comparable to the likes of the games i mentioned prior with extra possessions like your tailored banner the last thing i will say before i review this game critically is that it may be tough for new players though if you research ways to get better online you will get through it now since we have sung its praises with many more that i did not mention we must now look at what apex does not get right or what it could fix to do better hacking is currently rampant in apex especially in the competitive mode as you move up the ranks this has been a problem for a very long time possibly dating back to season 2 when i started playing when i was on console so at that time hacking was barely a concern or even not a concern at all while when i switched to pc in season 3 i personally started seeing cheaters in game as soon as season 5 it also relates to the large incident that happened in algs recently where 2 players genburten and imperialhal had their game hijacked giving them esp with full hitboxes health and player names along with bullet not aim locking aimbot hacking is the only concern i will describe in this review because it has been recent and is a genuine concern and has been for a long time in conclusion while apex has many great qualities i mentioned there are some concerns that do not have to do with how the game is intended to be played i would personally give the game an 8 9 10 because despite its shortcomings it is unique it can be tailored and most of all it is great but its shortcomings hinder me from giving it a 9 10 amazing opinions can differ widely on how good or bad this game is depending on who you ask so i am not expecting you to 100 believe in my opinion and all i ask of you is that you at the very least consider it,947.8,46.0,0,Recommended,April 13,Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,fluorine

33979,2020 this is probably the best battle royale shooter out there that being said you might be asking yourself why i gave it a bad review the answer is simple this game has the worst servers i have ever seen in any game in my entire life i ve been playing this game for quite some time now since s4 to be exact and accumulated around 350 hours in total counting hours on origin which isn t a small number in this game i ve been playing quite a bit of ranked was diamond and know my ways around the game but i can t recommend this game at its current state the game mechanics are fun and versatile the characters are great and the game has a bunch of good stuff to offer it would be foolish to not recommend this game judging by what i just said but there is one thing that makes this game a at best the servers run at unknown server tick rates some say its 20 tick some say its 16 some even go lower spectator mode probably runs at 4 8 ticks but what are tick rates tick rates are the rates at which the server refreshes the game so to say eg you shoot at your target and track it the hitbox moves with the target with low tickrates the hitbox might be a little behind the target but thats no big deal as long as the following doesn t happen ea is the main company behind apex if you hadn t noticed by the earrape intro pro tip go to properties launch settings and type in dev in there this gets rid of the intro and so you might except stable servers since they already are low tick no the servers don t run good they run like in fact they run so bad that you could eat tacos with spicy mexican salsa and down a rusty pipe filled with bugs and rotting corpses and that would run better than the apex legends servers cs go ran the same engine with 64tick servers the minimum for shooter games imo the difference between cs go and apex is that valves servers run good so what exactly makes the server so damn bad they have insane packet loss 20 80 usually have tethering issues brutal high ping you can lose your connection and even get kicked out of the game entirely making enjoying the game a very difficult task you might say that that doesn t happen often because it just simply can t right it happens almost all the time sure you might have a lucky streak of 3 4 games that aren t ultra laggy but if you find that you might aswell gamble all of your stuff away because you basically just won the lottery to give you a perspective i ve played 10 games today for reference i had 2 good lobbies that didn t lag me out the rest were gruesome and disgusting i ve been kicked out of the game lagged so damn hard i got pulled back multiple times was stuck midair and my shots hit the target but didn t register i have a good internet connection and usually play on 10ms ping they could fix this major issue by simply attending to their servers and increase the tick rates hell even 32 tick would be enough to play this game properly fixing the server to be stable not cut the connections of players not have insane packet loss or latency would also make this game insanely enjoyable even at 16 tick another big issue i ran in is optimization my current rig isn t the best used to play on a i5 4460k 1050ti currently running the same gpu but with a r5 3600xt going to upgrade to a 5700xt on the gpu soon tho anyhow the game has it struggles to keep 60 fps even at the lowest settings on 1080p even worse performance on the latest map olympus especially on longer sightlines and larger locations tl drall in all apex legends qualifies as the best battle royale but the server performance is the main problem hindering it from being the best the servers are just way too bad to be even considered using as servers for a game thats not low demanding like vanilla mc servers,167.2,382.0,49,Not Recommended,"December 20, 2020",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,stoned.

33985,2023 title apex legends a fall from gracerating apex legends once hailed as a groundbreaking battle royale game has regrettably transformed into one of the worst gaming experiences in recent memory as an avid player and observer it pains me to witness the downfall of a game that held such promise at its inception several key factors have contributed to its rapid descent into mediocrity making it an unappealing choice for both casual and competitive gamers alike first and foremost the developers failure to address fundamental issues and deliver timely updates has severely damaged the game s integrity despite community feedback and countless complaints respawn entertainment has shown a lack of responsiveness to game breaking bugs glitches and exploits this negligence has left players frustrated and disheartened as the game suffers from poor hit detection rampant cheating and unbalanced gameplay the absence of proper action has created an atmosphere of disillusionment among the player base one of the most glaring issues plaguing apex legends is the clear prioritization of pro players needs over those of the casual player base while catering to the competitive scene is important it shouldn t come at the expense of the majority of players who enjoy the game for leisure and fun the constant appeasement of pro players has created an imbalance in the game s development feedback and changes from the competitive community often take precedence leaving casual players feeling neglected and overlooked this approach disregards the needs and desires of the larger player base who seek a balanced and enjoyable experience even when pro players receive the adjustments they clamor for it never seems to be enough their insatiable demands can lead to a perpetual cycle of dissatisfaction as there will always be something they find fault with no matter how much the game caters to their desires this lopsided focus not only alienates casual players but also undermines the overall integrity of the game striving for a healthy balance between casual and competitive play should be a top priority for developers apex legends must recognize and address the concerns and aspirations of its vast casual player base to ensure a thriving and inclusive gaming environment moreover the game s monetization strategy is nothing short of predatory apex legends has become a playground for microtransactions prioritizing profit over player enjoyment cosmetic items such as skins and emotes are priced exorbitantly exploiting the desires of players to customize their characters the in game store is flooded with overpriced loot boxes enticing vulnerable individuals into spending their hard earned money on a chance based system this emphasis on greed rather than fostering a fair and rewarding experience has caused a significant decline in the game s reputation additionally the lack of substantial content updates has contributed to the game s downfall the introduction of new characters maps and game modes has been painfully slow failing to keep players engaged and excited apex legends once prided itself on its unique legend abilities and dynamic map design but the developers seem to have lost their creative spark the absence of fresh content has led to a stagnant meta and repetitive gameplay leaving players with a sense of boredom and a desire for something new finally the communication between the developers and the community has been abysmal transparent and open dialogue is crucial in maintaining a healthy player developer relationship but respawn entertainment has consistently fallen short in this regard the lack of timely updates community engagement and meaningful interaction has left players feeling ignored and unimportant this further exacerbates the frustrations of an already disappointed fan base in conclusion apex legends descent from grace can be attributed to a combination of neglecting game breaking issues prioritizing profit driven microtransactions a lack of fresh content updates and poor communication it is disheartening to witness a game that once had so much potential succumb to such unfortunate circumstances unless the developers address these pressing concerns and prioritize player satisfaction apex legends will continue its downward spiral and be remembered as one of the worst games ever released,931.6,68.0,6,Not Recommended,"May 12, 2023",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,Mad Dog

34018,2023 apex legends is a battle royale game that has shown a fair amount of growth since its release in 2019 most battle royale genre games have fallen in popularity over the last couple of years but apex legends still holds a strong fan base this game builds off the titanfall universe for characters and story but combines it to a battle royale game with abilities for each character you play when starting off you get a fair amount of characters but it will take a long time before you earn all of them for free since this game is published through ea it s not surprising to see micro transactions being littered across the game with apex packs collection events and unlocking characters and weapon skins since the game is free to play this doesn t bother me as much because it s completely optional and you can earn characters and apex packs for free just not as many it is likely that if you invest time in the game you will feel like investing money too the gameplay for apex legends is pretty decent considering that this game is live service there are constant balance changes and updates with new characters and weapons to shake the meta up each season most characters have their strengths and weaknesses which is up to the player to decide which legend suits them best here are my personal thoughts on what apex is good at and bad at pros has constant updates and changes to make the game more interesting has a long term grind to work on with unlocking characters and levelling up to the max level 500 has fun moments with friends and is more fun when you take the game less seriously ltms during different times of the year are very fun to play usually have good incentive to earn rewards from playing them with character weapon skins trackers or badges cons matchmaking in terms of waiting time is quite long sometimes can be frustrating matchmaking in terms of who you match against in matches has been changed a ton which is making it seem like you are punished for playing well in public matches because you will immediately be matched with incredibly sweaty players next game ranked has seen a lot of changes to balance how lp is earned a point system based on match performance and this has seen huge issues in the past with players simply camping in zone to earn lp up to master predator ranks there is no playlist activity for solo vs solo players you are stuck with duo or trio due to the fact that apex legends is a teamworking based battle royale it would be nice to see a solo activity for players overall apex legends is a pretty well thought out game with plenty of content to play for no cost there are times where i have personally felt burnt out from playing due to the nature of the game being a battle royale it s definitely worth a try if you are interested in this genre but i wouldn t try it if you aren t into battle royale games,877.7,58.0,5,Recommended,"September 22, 2023",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Archill

34036,2020 tldr game good but buggy business practices bad play but no buy stuff until fixlong version at the time of writing i have 529h play time on origin in apex legends i ve been here since season 0 to put things into perspective a bit better to me this is the best battle royale out there that i ve tried and the only one that had me stick around it s action packed creative beautiful and fun highly recommended to play with friends at this point you must be thinking why is the review negative then you dope well i ll tell ya buckle up buckaroos because this is the long and negative side of the review i m so happy i can voice my concerns now that the game is not tied to ea s origin al sin anymore the publisher is ea if you didn t catch that so of course expect sleazy practices and boy you got em monetization just recently season 7 came out and damn did they nerf the battle pass this time around question are you a casual player who has a career and or family or dare i say it other things other than apex legends in your life get out of here this isn t for you we only take pro gamers who pump out double digit gaming hours daily or a lot of money and please don t give them more money to put it simply it s grindy extremely grindy and it s clear what they re trying to do to us don t stand for it and vote with your wallet this kind of stuff is what ruins communities as for the skins you buy with real money let s look at the halloween event we had just now a bundle with 2 old and 2 recolored skins from last year and 1 banner animation cost you want to guess yes 60 eur which means you can buy a completely new triple a game with the same amount of money it gets worse though if you want a heirloom legends carry it around while you play when you unlock them eg kunai knife for wraith naruto you need to buy all 24 event skins which equates to about 180 or eur otherwise you can only get a heirloom through rng with loot boxes apparently 500 loot boxes for a heirloom wow right 180 eur to get everything from a short event you could buy the witcher 3 cyberpunk 2077 skyrim fridge edition call of duty 69 420 and heaps of indie games you probably like for that money technical issues servers are 20hz tick rate you can feel it you can see it and you can even hear it speaking of hearing the sound is completely gone quite literally this season 7 has 50 of the sound in game during gunfights retired and on a vacation and i ve asked around just in case it s just on my end we get new bugs each season which take a lot of time to fix and that s fine i guess but some issues like the subpar servers and sound issues persist since the games release the game is not optimized well but it does look good and the graphics are beautifully stylised in my opinion on the new map olympus if you step into a particular waterfall your fps gets cut in half previous maps have suffered from fps inconsistency and drops but this is the worst example i can think of i m at 1440p with a rx5700 gpu and an 2700x cpu thermals are great don t worry and the fps manages to drop to 30fps sometimes and even below that i tested the drops with a couple of friends and strangers and it s repeatable on both amd and nvidia systems which is a great look for the testers and devs at respawn should you play it yeah it s free and also fun should you give them your hard earned money not until they improve,706.7,158.0,9,Not Recommended,"November 8, 2020",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,Wettey

34085,let me share my thoughts on apex legends a game that i ve really come to enjoy first off the gameplay in apex is incredibly engaging it s fast paced action packed and always keeps you on your toes every match feels like a new adventure and the variety of characters each with their own unique abilities adds an extra layer of strategy to the game one of the things i love most about apex is the teamwork aspect you re always working with your squad to outsmart and outgun your opponents whether you re reviving a teammate coordinating your ultimate abilities or just communicating your next move the teamwork required in apex makes every victory feel even sweeter the graphics and design of the game are also top notch the maps are beautifully crafted with diverse environments that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting and the attention to detail in the character designs and animations really helps bring the world of apex to life another aspect of apex that i appreciate is the constant updates and new content the developers are always adding new features weapons and characters to keep the game feeling fresh and evolving overall apex legends is a fantastic game that i would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys fast paced team based shooters with its engaging gameplay stunning graphics and constant updates it s definitely one of my favorite games to play,514.8,27.0,8,Recommended,March 7,Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"The Hot Peppa Steppa

34157,2021 too many cheaters ranked mode is like punishing yourself and badges require insane grinds season passes mostly contain skins that are literal vomit similar color and patterns etc and all round you re going to be part of the 99 of players that are there just to make up the numbers they re also constantly trying to get you to play arena s to farm for limited rares thus inflating the arena play percentage when i m sure a majority doesn t like it once again due to cheaters and even worse in this mode smurfs lastly they will ban your account for 72h for dropping one f bomb but cannot and will not ban players that spam the f word 1000 times in a row on the microphone or other stuff additional note if you re a belgium player good luck as they gouge out these players specifically if you want a collection event skin it s over 400 to buy the coins to get all skins and thus a heirloom i m sure they ve got a hidden dial that turns off heirloom odds for any belgium players so they can milk that demographic wallet bigtime,340.9,47.0,6,Not Recommended,"September 13, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"GamingRevenant (YT)

34158,2020 product received for free just want to keep it short i don t like most battle royal games but this one is good the reason being that its fast paced environment elements are like any other battle royal games pros its fast paced lots of skins lots of different legends player operator to choose from 33 40 operators are given for free and others you can unlock by just playing the game graphics are good haven t encountered any cheater yet idk must be there but i haven t encountered any training mode gives you brief on controls and game play mechanics good for beginners its free xd cons still lags on lobby games crashes between games and also some time gives network issues sometime puts onto server with very high ping literally teleports the legends on map xd above are my thoughts you want to know play it yourself as it is free as a beginner you must play the training mode before you start with match it s a lot more fun with friends and worth a try shant x out,152.3,32.0,0,Recommended,"November 28, 2020",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Shant_X

34218,2021 apex legends is the third instalment in the illustrious battle royale genre with a wide cast of characters and some crazy movement options you ll be hard pressed to find a game with more octane in it s blood the best part is they are always adding in new characters to play as my favourite one they added was the big guy gibraltar because he s just so good with his awesome shields and since no one else ever wants to play him i always can and the best part is it s free to play plus the item shop sucks so much that you ll never have to worry about spending money,877.2,20.0,10,Recommended,"June 14, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,zzFuzzy

34222,2022 product received for free i could write an entire textbook on why this game sucks ass with cited examples and sources but that won t fit in a steam review so i ll summarize the devs do not give 1 singular about this game or franchise none of the current dev team are trustworthy and all they care about is the money they get from recolors of old skins and random color patterns the devs have an extensive and well documented history of directly lying to their players over several years and across multiple games not just apex the skill based matchmaking in this game has been entirely nonfunctional since season 12 which was in early 2022 and it is impossible to play this game casually pubs the non ranked gamemode will put anyone against anyone else and that means the champion squad is always a premade team of 3 of the top 0 04 of players in the world real number not exaggerated in ranked which is supposed to be the competitive gamemode that matches you against people of similar rank skill there are skill brackets that it uses to put people into matches but they barely exclude any ranks at all and are rarely even used so it is possible to see the highest rank in the world in a lobby with the lowest rank in the world this is a known and extremely well documented problem that has been going on for over a year and will likely never be fixed because it is functioning as designed yes you read that right the matchmaking is not broken in any way and is functioning exactly as intended on top of the matchmaking the audio in this game specifically enemy footsteps doesn t work 40 of the time and the servers have performance comparable to a 2012 model macbook with constant stutters rubber banding freezes the occasional slow motion server etc this is a multi billion dollar game with infinitely worse performance function and servers than pretty much any indie game i have ever played i cannot say it enough do not play this game and if you must do not ever think about giving a cent to this lying credit stealing backstabbing scam company i wish this game was good it has the framework to be great it was good once but the devs ruined it against the wishes of their players do not play this game,961.2,21.0,2,Not Recommended,"April 20, 2022",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Manic_Mechanist

34242,2023 in all fairness this is actually a great game problem is unless you re actually good at fps its hard to play without using any kind of external help whatever happened to just being trash at fps this game is ruined by gamers using third party software hardware to pretend they re actually good at video games respawn needs to start banning people with zens strike packs and those that use certain if not any macros this no recoil era is insane if they messed with the recoil patterns consistently that could help or just remove recoil all together so the people with those devices paid for nothing and people are all able to laser each other it has only gotten worse as time moves on do yourself a favor and just go play something else until this cheating phase in gaming is over,743.6,22.0,0,Not Recommended,"September 4, 2023",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,BAUL PUNYAN

34266,this game has been ruined from controller if you like to get aim assisted into the ground while they run a three stack then go ahead on top of not fixing controller they reward apex player with still no regs the controller has so much aim assist its a joke no skill is required to play this game if you play with a controller all you have to do is push your control stick forward and allow the aim of a controller not the player do the work this game will never recover from the amount of controller hacking lobbies and re spawn answer to that is selling a 360 death create dont play this game even if its free also if you do manage to find yourself a good lobby which is very far and in between you are quickly humble by a three stack of master to pred players i dont play this game very often the 300 plus hours have been spread over many years of this game coming back hoping it gets better they dont care about a balance system ie horizon is still the most played broken champ you can pick while they nerf and force you to play the same characters also you think that with the time it takes for them to release things that new champs would have new and innovated ideas wrong every new champ just is a better version of the base champs that were released at launch making the old champs outdated not only are they outdated but have the same or similar abilities as the base champ but a better version new weapons no they take weapons away to not fill the loot pool which is a understandable reason but then you take the base amount of weapons and turn 3 into weapons you use for 2 seasons straight if you dont use these buffed weapons when they made their season tweak then you are out gun from the start to top if off after 3 seasons its still accepteable to have out of the map hiding spots or to health yourself 300000 yards from the safe zone only to secure your masters spot in rank the game only gets worse if you dont have a three stack if you are a duo and a random as a 3rd then its ok that they solo drop die in 3 4 seconds when they land because the game doesnt pushing inting that said player that doesnt want to play with a team is reward by getting to return to lobby after quiting only to start a game 5 seconds later tell me how that is accpetable if you made changes to respawning a tm to make it easier but if fast to quit a game screw the duo team and just load up again playing a support player feels like only supporting the teammates you que in with because they are willing to stick around dead game dead community dead company,394.7,19.0,0,Not Recommended,February 7,Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,TAX

34455,2022 a well designed game with great art direction and polished feel of the movement system and bullet balistics it is a wonder how a game this good is ftp truly a worthy successor for the titanfall franshise however for the love of god don t play it hear out my frustration tears bugs servers the servers are laggy making the game unplayable at times much more often than you d imagine a ea sponsored game to be the last 2 months have been pure pain where playing ranked with lags like that is voluntarily de ranking yourself bugs related to the shop are fixed in seconds while other bugs take weeks to even get noticed by the devs a bug that casually adds the us english keyboard each time the application is launched makes re launching the game annoying at best this issue has been there since launch it is still in the game then there is being stuck in returning to lobby if you won a lottery of getting on a laggy server which makes relaunching the game the only solution bots and cheaters are a hard issue to deal with no doubt but now i see them even in non ranked lobbies prompting a question of just how many of these get through respawn s security systems the game is poorly optimized for weak or even average rigs i can not play the game without lags or stutters with gtx 1650 and amd ryzen 5 3600 on the lowest settings even launching apex through geforce experience optimization doesn t guarantee you won t have lags note that my rig is way beyond minimal settings if not hardware or bug related problems then server lags will make sure your gaming experience is not as intended by the dev team donation system lootboxes oh boy oh boy let s talk about it if you will want to invest money in the game to cheer up the devs despite everything you will find your wallet being bled dry the prices are 25 for a skin on average which feels completely ridiculous compared to any other life service game i ve played you will feel like a fool every time you buy a retexture of a base model for a price of an indie game the so called collection events time limited events to buy skins are their own special animal where you are invited to spend 130 to get a reskin for your character s melee aka an heirloom that exact melee that has been nerfed so hard during the latest update that you re better off using the weakest pistol in the game to deal with your enemies you basically pay 130 euro for something to be angry beyond comprehension when using it expect this to happen consistently because some skins obscure the view when scoping more than basic ones and some skins give you an advantage in that regard effectively making gun skins an unfair advantage or a paid for disadvantage devs gaslight their fanbase on social media into believeing the pricing is fair and necessary despite respawn being sponsored by ea who have all the money in the world skins almost always come with their price already reduced and later re sold by the devs with the original price being different from the starting one which is illegal in most countries speaking of illegal the game s main donation mechanic is lootbox based the pool of rewards is inflated with worthless trash with legend banners and sprays considered legendary and epic quality getting a legendary lootbox does not guarantee you a weapon character skin at all anymore a chance of getting something legendary is 7 by the way which sound like a lot but it isn t a chance of getting an heirloom the aformentioned melee reskin is 0 1 read unobtainable for an average player summary generally it is a wonderful game to play alone or with friends but the servers make it unbearable at times and if you will want to spend money to sweeten your experience at least a little bit then expect the game not respect your wallet at all i really want to recommend it but i can t do so without feeling guilty p s i criticize the game because i have played it for so long stop with the yet you participate in it curious i am very smart i want this game to be better but its flaws persist until it is up to standards i won t be able to recommend it,679.1,36.0,4,Not Recommended,"January 7, 2022",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Coco Banooka

34465,2023 hey ho i played apex since day 1 and i have to admit apex has its upsides and downsides but still it is my favourite game here is why i love the gameplay awesome character designs the weapons from titanfall that we loved and buitiful and colorful maps olympus kingscanyon stormpoint brokenmoon worldsedgelots of soundtracks to choose from to get you in the mood and recently also a lot of different gamemodes to play trios battleroyal where it all started duos battleroyal trios ranked battleroyal teamdeathmatch control gungameit is an awesome game but recently something is of i used to play apex with my bros playing ranked not to sweaty just to have some fun but now ranked is no good for fun way to sweaty lobbys and also no goals rewards for most of the modes teamdeathmatch control gungame over all the game feels like it just a feeding ground for all the master and predator players you are just waiting for a new season to come in hope that finally the game will make you smile again while playing but no i have the feeling since two or three seasons the game just gets worse even event are just cash events for ea this wasn t always the case we had rewards for arena a long gone mode and ranked was perfect for your fun time with the boys after a long day of work i used to play until platin and switched than to standard br for the rest of the season it was a good feeling to accomplish your goal at the end of the season and be hyped for the new content of the next one every event also braught extra fun you were hyped for the rewards that you could get by playing the last season gave us crossprogression something we waited like years for and i switched from xbox to pc but still ranked gets worse and worse yeah pro gamers will be like just play better but no this is not about pros its about the average person playing this game currently the only thing that binds me to apex are the memories i have to it and my girlfriend who just recently started playing it and she is the perfect example for the problem which apex currently has she improved a lot since she started playing she loves the characters favourite is lifeline she loves the gameplay and the guns skins music bit she absoulutly doesn t enjoy battleroyal and for a battleroyal that is a big problem it is apex main feature it should be the mode that makes you wanting to play this game but she doesn t enjoy it at all for new players to find themselfes and their comfort modes teamdeathmatch control gungame and to stay there is a huge problem for a battleroyal game but now let s get to the ingame story we had awesome stories to tell from the game the reconstruction of ash bangalores long lost brother new castle the infected ships arriving on olympus leviathans walking over kings canyon and now we have revenant and loba yes still revenant and loba since over ten seasons it s revenant and loba and i get annoyed every time i watch a new trailer why don t we get cool new stories there is so much they could do from wraith finding old memories about her past self to the remain of cryptos girlfriend and much more it is just repeating every season we want more lore and new stories even after all that apex is still my favourite game and i hope it will one day be as good as it used to be that i can have fun in ranked again with my bros and laugh with my best friend when he opens a apex pack and still has no heirloom since season 1 btw i write this comment so that it may reaches a lot of other players who think like me about this game and that it may even reaches respawn and changes something one day i want to smile again while playing and think my favourite game is apex legends,690.5,34.0,1,Recommended,"December 4, 2023",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,ShellyD

34474,2022 gaming as a whole in the 21st century can be summed up perfectly by playing this game apex legends has bar none the best game mechanics in any battle royale and credit where its due respawn absolutely knocked the game fundamentals out of the park however all of apex legends problems stem from its overt and predatory monetization 1 loot boxes literal gambling that you can spend your life savings on2 skill based matchmaking in pubs is incredibly strong i am a bronze 1 player and i have not had a teammate lower than gold in a non ranked game mode for those who do not know strong skill based matchmaking is forced onto developers to increase retention and coerce players to linger in the menus and browse the shop the longer they are out of a game 3 cosmetic prices in the shop are valorant levels of greedy some skins you cannot buy individually or even earn in game and all event skins come bundled which further inflates the price 4 the amount of currency in this game is a psychological tactic used by developers to blur the line between real money and the corresponding premium currency you will never ever be able to outright be able to purchase the exact amount of coins in the shop to buy your desired cosmetic and will always have to spend more than you originally want to in order to do so which always results for you to have leftover currency which is also another psychological tactic used by developers to just push you over the edge to spend more money on this f2p title 5 despite all of this the battlepasses offered in apex legends have consistently been awful providing little value to those who buy them and the only decent skin is the level 100 skins which only apply to one weapon not to mention the vast majority of the cosmetics offered in the battlepasses are menial and only have 5 6 skins which only 1 2 of them are even legendary actually change the character noticeably 6 because all of this the only progression in the game is so bogged down that you aren t even guaranteed a loot box every time you level up which the lootboxes don t usually contain any of the premium skins bundled and price hiked in the shop not to mention the lootboxes effect every hero in the game meaning if you get a legendary skin for a hero you don t have it simply does not have any value to you whatsoever 7 the crafting material allows you to buy with in game currency skins and cosmetics you would otherwise gamble on with lootboxes however there is no surefire method to grind for this currency and the only way to get consistent crafting materials is to buy lootboxes outright this is such a massive leap backwards from titanfall 2 s super consumer friendly cosmetic shop where cosmetics had incredible value while also respecting the consumer enough to not make the cosmetics the only thing having any value in the game i bought into titanfall 2 s shop many times because of how fair and reasonable the prices value and quality of the items the developers themselves have outdone themselves on consistently providing quality content to the game the business side of ea and respawn are giving mobile games a run for their money in being the most egregious and predatory monetization for a aaa product all i ask is that respawn listen to their player base and to not forget where they come from because i can guarantee that if apex legends was more consumer friendly they would make even more money and the playerbase would be happy respawn and ea can do better and we as a playerbase have to hold them accountable if we expect any meaningful changes to such a predatory system,131.8,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"November 1, 2022",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"sconeeee

36467,2021 used to be an enjoyable movement based battle royale engaging fights and a good way to pass some time with friends now it s just an utter sweatfest almost every medium of fun factor has been either ruined or just completely removed from the game how so many movement techniques have been altered as to limit or altogether prevent players from performing them character s movement abilities have been significantly nerfed or changed in a way that grounds the game as an almost generic first person shooter not a movement based one the characters and their abilities that hinder movement are getting buffed i understand that character balance is one thing but the very thing that set the game apart from the others was undone by its own developers this isn t to say there isn t any form of movement whatsoever no no there are still many ways of high skill play based around movement simply it s hard not to notice the game transitioning further and further away from its roots when compared to the engaging combat and pure enjoyment found in titanfall 2 s movement system apex is found lacking as of now it barely holds a torch that being said the gameplay is still some of the best out there that you ll find in the battle royale genre characters are unique and guns feel good to fire though it is becoming increasingly harder and harder to enjoy with the so called skilled based match making now as i m not someone who coded the algorithm for it i obviously don t know exactly how it functions or if it is working properly but i can attest that it is simply not functioning in a way that is beneficial for the majority of players and the game i m a casual player i hop on the game to play some chill matches and have a break of sorts that s nearly impossible now with the way it groups teams from my experience i believe the sbmm matchmakes you based off of your most recent match if you won or just generally did good got a few more kills than normal you will be in the sweatiest of sweaty lobbies when you get instantly killed on drop by that sweaty 20k kill ttv wraith you will still be in sweaty lobbies for your next match you will have to play around 10 or so games to get into a comfortable lobby more so around your skill level that seems good right not having your elo tank simply because of an off match the problem is that your elo will skyrocket upon a win so the algorithm will take its time keeping you in sweaty lobbies upon a loss and instantly assume you re playing this game for a living and queue you accordingly for every decent match you have the flaw lies in the fact that the game is always trying to give you the toughest match it can even in casual pubs mode the shortcomings of the so called sbmm are highlighted even more when you play with friends either of a higher or lower skill bracket than you instead of being able to play some music and get the occasional few kills you re expected to sweat your pits off trying to kill a squad before you get wiped by the 3rd party team who can hear your shots from across the map and will arrive in 20 seconds a game should do its best to bring enjoyment for the players not prevent them from doing the very thing the apex is marketed on fighting and combat because the players are afraid to engage another team due to the fear of the 3rd party team arriving to janitor both squads there can be enjoyment and fun in competition and trying your hardest that is why there is a ranked mode but the sweat should stay in ranked it shouldn t be forced to spill into casuals due to poor development choices i consider myself an above average player i ve got somewhere around a 1 5 k d ratio which is nothing impressive but it means i m good enough to typically kill more than one person per match it does not mean i can compete with triple stacked predator teams with all the fancy badges that preds have and skill based matchmaking should not force me to do so players should be grouped with others according to their overall performance this current season not on a whim based on their most recent match matchmaking should take the average of how the player is performing over a broad set amount of matches and match them with players of similar stats this way the player is allowed to see themselves improve and enjoy that instead of being punished for doing well moving on the servers are absolute trash for this game play a few matches and you ll see for yourself hackers are rampant micro transactions are limited to cosmetics only lootboxes etc which is good however the prices are unacceptable ea respawn are charging 20 25 for most limited event skins yeah it s a free to play game and they need to monetize it somehow i get it but 20 for a single skin on a single character is borderline robbery to put this into perspective you can get an entire aaa game title for the same price on steam sales you can get a brand new whole other aaa game upon release for the equivalent of three what are essentially recolors of a character in this game that s a bit ridiculous if you ask me i know i on this game quite a bit during this review i actually do have some rather fond memories of it and it still is fun to play sometimes i simply cannot recommend it because the enjoyment it brings is not worth the salt and other disgruntled feelings that come along with it it will leave a bad taste in your mouth,654.4,19.0,3,Not Recommended,"January 13, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"Infinity

36644,2022 i am a 22 year old mother probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single mother to my son who is now 14 my son recently started apex legends and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my husband had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories about loba s enormously thicc thighs,955.7,23.0,20,Recommended,"July 16, 2022",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,LiLuuuuuuuuuuu

37009,2021 this game saved my life i am 41 my ex wife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide after learning of the severity of my self inflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didn t beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as today i am close friend with my kids mother we don t fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldn t be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that thank you,79.3,40.0,11,Recommended,"April 7, 2021",Apex Legends‚Ñ¢,"DuvarYikan
