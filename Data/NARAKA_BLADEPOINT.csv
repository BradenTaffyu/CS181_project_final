23532,2022 lets see almost a 100hrs on this game and these are the issues 1 chinese smurfing on eu and na among new players their high ping makes it impossible to hit them literally 2 eu and na players are leaving thanks to the chinese players using vpns to get easy wins once again using rubber banding 3 almost every match you have squads teaming up together mostly chinese players farming points and its usually 4 players vs 2 in duo or 6 vs 3 in trios conclusion great game overall very bad and horrible management in the west cant even prevent vpn users from playing on the western servers frankly don t bother buying this game as long as the devs keep blind eye to what s going on with the current state of the game in the west also hackers are barely getting banned since you encounter them on daily basis update 3 5 2023current state of the game in every match is mix of bots and ton of chinese players in the lobby i rarely come across actual players from eu update 2 4 2023 nothing has changed just more events and no bug fixes chinese players are openly teaming up together during matches now they wont bother hiding it videos has been recorded and submit yet nobody got bannedthis is the final update regarding my review on this game dont buy it,640.3,851.0,34,Not Recommended,"October 15, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,GTX
23533,2021 naraka is personally a 10 10 game for me most fun pvp game i ve played in years i have over 1000 hours in pubg and apex legends but this game does not really feel like a traditional br it s more like a fighting game somewhat similar to mordhau while being hands down the best action combat melee multiplayer game i have ever played and i ve tried several the overarching br element takes a lot of inspiration from apex legends while feeling different enough to not feel like you re playing the same game pros every weapon and every hero is very well thought out the souljade system adds a lot of variety in gameplay each melee weapon has a variety of options for attacks and combos that make the game not feel repetitive instead becoming very addictive and rewarding for improving in the skillcap is not that high so even new players have a chance against the best players in the game if they read a few games and get enough practice unlike other games in naraka you never feel like you can t beat even the sweatiest player the grapple and free climbing system is absolutely amazing considering that you can grapple and climb almost any object you see it has the best animations i have seen in an action combat game and its not even close even subtle things like shimmying around corners has its own animation the game does not feel janky at all unlike other games i have played recently new world bf 2042 beta elyon i have not encountered a single bug like falling through the map getting stuck glitching through objects etc which is remarkable considering you can traverse and climb everything the textures and model designs for the heroes weapons and environment are fantastic the audio for each weapon and hero abilities makes them all unique and you can easily tell what is going around you the ui is very intuitive minimalist and easy to use the gameplay is very fluid and you can even cancel animations without the game feeling janky or glitchy the downsides the downsides of the game have nothing to do with the game itself all the downsides come from the player base the most complained topics are meta picks region switching long queues strange ranking system but all of those issues all boil down to a low player base at least in the west difficulty is the other issue this is a game that will turn away a lot of new players because those who are experienced will smash their face in it is a hard game to start as you will get rolled a lot but for those that stick it out they will hopefully see what a masterpiece this game is and lastly many players complain about the rng lootboxes the lootboxes are purely cosmetic there is no pay to win in the game let me repeat no pay to win in the game incredibly refreshing for an asian developer the shop has plenty of great skins that can be bought outright to balance out the best cosmetics being locked behind rng you can play the entire game without being disadvantaged for the base price the only thing locked behind a grind are the glyphs but it takes only a few days to get all glyphs maxed out to be on fair ground with all opponents and teammates i have played many games this year that were an absolute embarrassment particularly new world and bf2042 beta in terms of gameplay fun and fluidity i primarily rate a game based on how fun it is to play and for me 99 of that comes from the gameplay not how shiny the environment is in naraka everything works it feels great to play its a whole lotta fun if you invest the time to get better it feels rewarding to duel someone and come out on top or hunt someone down third party get a multikill a clutch play a snipe a satisfying ulti etc the game feels incredibly well made and i think the developers put a lot of thought and love into everything i wrote this long ass review in the hopes that more people give it a shot it s a real gem that is sadly being overlooked in the west and i really appreciate that there s still some developers out that are focusing on gameplay over glitz and glamour,514.5,277.0,4,Recommended,"October 20, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Vayce

23546,2021 i love this game to death it has one of the best gameplay loops i can think of and is nearly the perfect br for me which is why it sucks having to write this review the staggering amount of eastern players on us eu servers is frankly unacceptable you can go from a 30kill game to a game where you can t even react because the enemy is desyncing so much it makes a mobile seizure look like a stock image you never see them get banned but they flood the leaderboard and every match you re only hope at a good game is doing quick match and praying the chinese players with vpns are only looking to mmr climb in ranked blood bath is usually extremely fun as there is no competitive scene behind it so you re 99 of the time playing with players with a decent ping when losing against players who are simply better than you it is still fun and satisfying you can think back and go oh i should have done this or if i would have countered here i could have turned that around losing in such a manner almost never makes you rage losing against a player dysyncing who is pulling off combos then teleporting behind you or somehow countering you 3 5 seconds after you ve swung does not feel good it can completely destroy an a good time and will genuinely make you drop the game for the night or entirely until a strict stance is taken against vpn and desyncing players i refuse to spend another cent on this game and will advice others to stay away,159.4,193.0,13,Not Recommended,"December 29, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Jigsaw

23548,2021 this is the best battle royale game i have ever played pro each melee weapon has its own combo many ways to kill an opponent unique combat mechanism basic beats parry parry beats charged and charged beats basic master this and you can get many kills successfully parry can make enemy drop their weapon on the ground its hard to cheat since aimbot is useless cuz of the combat mechanism maybe theres other cheats but i believe its harder to cheat in this game compare to other battle royale games not pay to win the micro transaction is to buy pretty outfit and weapon skins and i think thats reasonable if you are stingy you still can win the game with default outfits everyone can be a spiderman i think this what makes this game feels superior compare to any battle royale game the grappling hook feels so smooth to travel into any buildings con theres only 3 mode which are solo trio and deathmatch well its like other battle royale games but i think its really cool if the dev can add 4squad and 5squad mode hahahi am sorry theres only one con i can give at the momentthis game deserves a good rating so i give 9 10for people who is complaining why the game is not free please understand that not all good games should be free both paid games and free games have their own advantage and we should understand that if you cant buy it then dont buy video games are not essential its a luxury and people should only buy when they can afford it,260.8,542.0,16,Recommended,"August 16, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"CikMeow

23553,2022 all the negative reviews that cite the issue with chinese players ruining the game for the na eu audience could not be more true i read them bought the game anyway to give it a shot and your very first public match you ll be greeted to just how bad it is trying to play against someone from china using a vpn you can t hit them you can t counter them and they ll land 100 of their abilities on you no problem the fact that more of an effort hasn t been taken to remove these players using vpn s lag switches and other nefarious methods to get the upper hand in this game shows just how little the dev s care about porting this game to the west it s to the point when you queue into a match just look for the players with chinese characters in their name and you ll already find the winners of each round couple the above with the fact that this game is basically a melee clone of apex legends with a generic eastern theme and suffers from the same lack of new maps any that apex did for months means you ll get tired of the same play each time if getting face rolled for hours on end by chinese players in an apex knockoff battle royal game is your jam then 10 10 this is for you for everyone else thats sane and isn t a masochist look elsewhere update 12 feb 23 at the urging of a friend i picked this game back up because he said and i quote they changed the game a lot it s a lot more friendly to new players now allow me to enlighten you all to what new player friendly is for this game developer there s now a rating system for ranked matches think arena rating and mmr from like wow if you played you start of at like bronze v and work your way down numerically v iv iii ii i etc until you re in the next bracket so on and so forth in theory this means you re only supposed to go against other players around your same mmr hence keeping the chinese players that have no life d this game from its inception out of your games right wrong there s so few players in that low mmr low bronze for new players that the queue times for those matches would be astronomical so what did the dev s do they fill those low ranked matches with bots ez mode bots in ranked matches however they give the bots random names like taitai2000 and other randomness so you think you re playing against other players and giving you the feel like the mmr system is working it gives you the illusion that you ll be able to work your way up the brackets and gradually face stronger players as your own skills improve its a farce from bronze v to bronze ii it s nothing but bots with the occasional other na player in the same boat as you there s even a badly translated tooltip on one of the screens that reads something along the lines of robotic players decrease as you ascend through each stage the whole thing is designed to catch you and make you think you re successful then we get into bronze ii i and silver tiers and above this is where you encounter the carries chinese players back again in full force tanking their own mmr or queuing with brand new accounts that sit afk in party so it drags their main account down into your mmr so they can fight you for the ez wins so what does this all mean the game is still not region locked you still fight players from china and all over the world and fight their internet connections their lag and their no life status on the game instead of region locking the game like many na players have called for the dev s create this fake mmr system a system designed to pull the wool over your eyes and make you believe you re actually achieving something in reality all you re doing is being prepared as fodder for far eastern players who are either too bad or too bored of playing against each other that they want to ruin your gaming experience instead,109.2,635.0,38,Not Recommended,"April 10, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Kithek Hunter

23577,2021 naraka is a great fast paced battle royal which provides a fresh take on the genre and the high skill ceiling of a fighting game pros melee combat feels fantastic there is so much potential with dash cancels fakes parries and a lot more tech if you are willing to learn and invest time into it movement is so much fun you can grapple around like spiderman slide around or just run character choice the game has many characters and more in the future for different playstyles each character gets a single core ability and an ultimate however with each ability ultimate you get three choices that can drastically change how it works for more customization c character customization you have so many options to customize your character it s too much power from cosmetics appearance glyphs rune system like league and skills you can play solo or with friends up to a party of 3 there is also rank play there is also more game modes coming in the future cons the game is sometimes very clunky for example it can be hard to jump out of a window and instead get stuck climbing a wall when in a building the game is not entirely balanced some characters feel a lot stronger than others the high skill ceiling it can be very daunting for noob players like me and off putting for others but improvement comes with time i would recommend having an ssd otherwise it s unplayable overall i m enjoying the game and would recommend you give it a try i truly believe this game has potential,92.9,150.0,5,Recommended,"September 1, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Sad Neon
23578,2021 update game is still bad review subject to change the core game is fun and great to play nice mix with melee ranged combat strategy feels well done the movement is not clunky and the combat for the most part is pretty fluent the character editor is fun and of course the cosmetics are nice ive logged many hours in this game and can really see what needs adjustments we will start with the extremely high ping players playing in ranked matches this needs a cap on ping as i am sure you have read many complaints about the chinese players using vpn and zerging the us servers which makes the game vary unpopular no one wants to try to swing in a melee game at a target you can not actually hit this makes for a vary big issue in a br game this game favors high ping players instead of forcing the high ping player to be locked in place to catch up to the server they instead just let them run wild and hit at any target they see dealing damage to them even if they are not actually at that current location if you try to swing at them and hit them your attacks phase through their body so as you can see why all the top players are chinese second off the weapons and heroes need much balancing as i am sure most people have noticed being grappled hook stun spammed this could easily be fixed by disabling auto lock on melee and hooks in ranked play this in turn would make the game more skill based and the engagements more interesting instead of being grapple stunned for people to long sword slash spam you heroes such as need some work his 150m range grab not only needs to be much sorter id say about the range of a grapple hook with 50 range and it also needs a cool down 5 8 seconds you could give him a small aoe ground pound to make up for the cd wait time long sword slash needs much fine tuning the katana stun lock needs some work the spears whirlwind attack needs some adjusting as well ect ect with the map itself its fun its interesting enough the issue is with the way the character grabs onto ever little thing and you tend to get stuck on it some objects such as small rocks need better clip nodes so the characters and step over them a bit easier instead of just coming to a full stop and then getting stuck as far as the way players are playing the game it is a bit toxic due to the game rewarding those players that hide all game to reach the top 5 in trios and 3 in solos instead of just displaying giving larger amounts of exp for kills and damage dealt the reward those for hiding and reaching top 5 i can understand hiding in ranked anyways because no one wants to fight high ping chinese players because you can not hit them anyways i could easily point out many issues with this game that need to be adjusted for smooth and fun game play but i will sit back and see what the next update has in store if they get rid of auto locking melee and grapples from ranked its ok in qm lock the ping to keep the ping abusers out you know who you are and re balance some of the heroes weapons i would be not only thrilled with this but would give this a positive review as i am sure a lot of you would as well,201.0,266.0,17,Not Recommended,"August 26, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Arpeojus
23586,2022 this is going to be quite a lengthy and detailed review i bought this game when it was on sale and i ve been hooked since it s a very fun game with a high skill ceiling without being too difficult to grasp the fundamentals of this is very much a skill based fighting game and doesn t really play out much like a traditional br there s advanced movement tech the combat flow is super addicting and beating someone will always feel satisfying your first few games will have some bots in them to ease the new player experience i initially thought this was kind of lame since i m not a fan of versing bots in a pvp game but i found the bots to be very helpful as a new player as it introduced me to the basic fighting loop or flow of the game the difference between bots and players is very noticeable and at the start you re going to think this game is quite easy or basic on the surface skilled players who practice combat and movement tech can outplay their opponents 1 2 or even 1 3 while it can be dissuading at the start to get completely stomped by these players after dominating bots for the first couple of hours sticking with the game and learning the mechanics is definitely worth the time as the barrier of entry to learning these mechanics is actually very simple once you get the fundamentals down and start getting the hang of focus dashing attack cancelling and parrying dodging the game really opens up there are lots of incredible guides online on youtube which are very helpful for new players to understand the rhythm and flow of combat and even putting in a little bit of time practicing these movements and tech made the game vastly more enjoyable for me you soon realise that the game is made up of quite small technical combos and movements and highly skilled players are just incredibly good at chaining them together once you get those small combos and movements down like focus dashing crouch cancelling and parry cancelling then you naturally string them together and soon you find yourself in a lot more control beating a lot more people the game s combat is based off a rock paper scissors system of attacks it basically looks something like this charged attacks focus light attackslight attacks parriesparries charged attacks focus throw in ranged weapons unique hero skills and a dodging mechanic and what we get is a simple yet nuanced base combat loop which rewards control prediction and reaction a lot of the fights come down to predicting what the other player may do and making decisions off that if you know a player always does a focus attack after their light attacks you might predict their next chain and get a crucial parry off turning the tide of the battle you can react to what a player might do like dodge out of their attack and make a huge play off of one clutch aerial combo what you get is a very cat and mouse like combat loop where players are constantly poking and testing one another waiting for an opportune time to strike or punish their opponent there are solos duos and trio game modes as well as some other casual game modes like bloodsport tdm and some pve and pvevp ones i can t speak too much for the casual modes as i mainly play the ranked ones but bloodsport is a good place to warm up and become familiar with the weapons and mechanics of heroes there s a decent variety of weapons available and they each have their own unique playstyle there are small strategies and approaches you ll need to consider when versing each weapon which further adds to the depth of the game contrary to popular belief i found the servers to be quite populated and have never waited for more than a couple of minutes for queues with near instant queues around peak time my favourite game mode is solo s however the most popular game modes are definitely trios and duos for context i play in australia and connecting to the sea node i get about 100ms which is very playable there s only been a few times where i ve died to ping related issues and those could have been mitigated if i had played better the first thing many players complain about is the abundance of chinese players in their games regardless of whichever server they re on while some of these may be chinese players connecting to the server from china via a vpn the majority of these chinese named players are players within the region using chinese characters in their names this game is massively popular in china and is somewhat of a cultural phenomenon amongst chinese diaspora around the world and as a result the best players and meta usually comes from that region so we get a lot of people who want to presumably imitate the level of players over there and use chinese characters as their ign s via google translate in my 100 hours of playing this game i can confidently say that i haven t played against anyone with a chinese name who has a terrible connection or even lost to another player due to ping differences if you re into highly skill based games with plenty of depth for both movement and combat tech then i highly recommend picking up naraka i consider myself a pretty competitive person in terms of the kind of games that i enjoy playing and i haven t had this much fun learning and grinding out a game in years if you re picking it up my advice is to stick with it and really learn the mechanics and fundamentals of the game and not to get demoralised or disheartened when you lose to a better player as i guarantee you that learning the game is not as hard as it looks the barrier of entry s kill floor is actually quite low with learning the tech and fundamentals and once you learn the basics of movement and combat you really begin to enjoy the game on the other hand the skill ceiling maximum potential or skill is quite high with skilled players being able to easily punish and win fights due to their proficiency with combat and movement and knowledge prediction of what players might do if you have any doubts i d recommend picking it up on sale however i would gladly pay full price for this game having experienced it myself,250.8,54.0,4,Recommended,"September 19, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,gachie

23602,2023 great game friendly community requires fast ssd m 2 crossplay with xbox players game servers in eu na as sea china there is no sa server so ppl from that region will have 200 ms ping pretty much unplayable supports keyboard mouse and gamepads game has own anticheat system all in game micro transactions are cosmetics no pay2win pay to look better frequent content updates season passes and time limited events if you want to know what edition is best standard deluxe or ultimate it is standard season pass unlock 10 game modes survival ranked casual battle royale bloodbath deathmatch with bots and players matchmaking waiting time is 4 minute right now showdown pve for 3 players but it is possible to play in duos and solo if ppl are gut time limited only for friday saturday and sunday bot mode survival with bots 3 level of difficulty room matches players only pvp and some other time limited modes game mechanics since it is close combat game with ranged weapon elements you need to adapt to your enemies it is not look kill shooter game it is not masher simulator either like dmc because of parry system from souls like and fighting games there is no block button at all but greatsword and polesword have blocking properties there is light fast charged blue slow attack and parry if you got stunned with any light attack you can t do charge attack but you can dodge after stun at some point if you started charged attack before enemy hit you with light you have priority and you will make good damage but charged attacks can be parried and you can t parry light attacks so it is triangle system because of different ping parry timing will differ too some ppl play with 40 ms ping others with 140 e t c fast movement and fast retreat recover is mandatory also two types of dodges click shift hold shift require proper stamina management there are lots of stuff that you can do in the game upgrade account level upgrade weapon level hero cultivation e t c more than 10 heroes already some of them are free and others you can buy with in game currency tae silver combat depends on weapon you use katana dagger spear long sword characters just have some additional features skills and ultimates currency in game gold real money if you pay for season pass unlock and complete it fully you will receive all gold back 1200 gold silver tae you will receive basically for doing anything useful same with silk dark coins you use to buy stuff in survival mode from special chest rift dealer also there is special season pass coins 3x coins if you complete task in survival mode will grant you 1 season pass level usually season pass has 130 lv last sp was shorter for fast sp grind you need to complete daily weekly and monthly season tasks from usual matches you will get not so much exp keep in mind than in survival ranked first you will play only against easy bots to understand whole game better only with ppl you will play at platinum rank and higher but matchmaking time will be longer too usually more ppl in the evening and very few or nobody in the morning so this is not a game where you can play all day if you want to play with real ppl overall it is a great game and developers publishers support it constantly making new stuff because of lack of ppl in eu na region it is difficult to be a main game but for few hours after work it is good enough for sure all usual quests and 95 of achievements you can do solo in bot mode exception are the overcomer hand of grace fickle fortune the most annoying achievement is accuracy assured where you need to level up ranged weapon to 25 lv basically all my time in this game was about completing this one achievement,959.9,167.0,5,Recommended,"April 25, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"It is my CAT

23611,2023 at times naraka bladepoint is a fun enjoyable game and at other times it s boring and unpleasant to play for example in a match you either go up against bots players who are far less skilled than you are or players who are far more skilled than you are hardly ever fighting someone equally as skilled as you or that was my experience anyways for example in ranked i was plat 1 and i swear i was fighting both silver and empyrean players in the same match and that s not even mentioning that 50 of the players in a match are bots you may find that hard to believe if you ever looked at the active player base for naraka bladepoint but it s true since most of the active player base is on the cn server,74.3,262.0,20,Not Recommended,"June 21, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"frey

23617,2021 if you can put in the time to learn its mechanics the game is fun and plays like a fighting game with fast paced fluid movement however it s not worth playing or buying until a ping restriction is implemented on servers combat mechanics fall apart completely when playing against players that connect to servers overseas to avoid playing in their own region on the na server lobbies frequently have more of these overseas players than actual na region players and this problem is exacerbated depending on the time of day you play,102.6,139.0,12,Not Recommended,"September 6, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Fizzycandy

23638,2022 the game is extremely fun to play and worth the 20 but there are a few catches they have failed to really grow the player base and it s been stagnant and dropping in numbers for a while now it might be a worthwhile game for you if your available hours mesh with the spike in players on your specific region but otherwise your queue times might be a little long with that in mind you re really only allowed to play ranked matches where there are enough bots injected into your game at any and all ranks to inflate your performance as long as you don t die off spawn with this in mind the average player who wants a fast queue time will be resorted to play the ranked mode over the several other available modes because of queue times ranging from a full bot lobby instant popping to a 15 minute queue that finally popped because those other people just finished their game that will only take effect at a higher rank but there is nothing preventing the system from injecting someone of a high rank into your ranked match even when you re a brand new player the match will be deemed extremely difficult and you ll get extremely high rating for the match dependent on kills and placement personally despite my opinions on the game i wish they were to make this free to play as it s a really fun game to play and there is no arguing that i ve invested close to 400 hours between my two accounts and i ve tried to get many people into the game but many failed due to the strict learning curve associated with this game this is how it will go 1 you make your account and queue up for a quick match to play against a non ranked environment 2 your queue insta pops and you feel great about it 3 there are probably 2 other players in your game and it s your two other teammates in your trio 4 you will run around and fight some ai who sometimes run into walls have incredible parry reaction speed sometimes and sometimes it s just not there at all there is no middle ground 5 you will likely win your first 1 3 and they will be fast queues because of the amount of real players in the game is low 6 dependent on your performance in your other matches your queue time might increase as more and more players get injected into your game you will progressively see 1 or 2 real parties then maybe 3 6 then maybe more this will progressively go up and up as you get going into your levels but within the past several months playing both ranked in platinum where the queue times hit 10 minutes reguarly i have yet to see a full game of real players i never see more than 3 9 different names in the kill feed throughout the entire game and it feels like a vacant game now on the other hand if you had a friend to play and you were local to each other where the ping variance wasn t too severe i give this a 10 10 for customs the most playtime i get in this game nowadays is a custom lobby where several of my friends perform koth,423.4,84.0,2,Not Recommended,"June 12, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,ronny

23652,2021 product received for free 8 10 naraka bladepoint is a really interesting battle royale game instead of the current gunfight battle royale they try to make a game that is mainly based on melee cold weapons most of the ranged weapons in this game are inferior to the melee weapon combat to make this game different the system of this game is very attractive the graph is not bad the optimization of the game is fairly plausible the music on the main menu and the music cut in during the battle are very good too however we can not ignore the shortcomings of this game for now there is only one map in this game not good for keeping the enthusiasm of the players for the first 20 or 30 hours you may find this game is really interesting however after you know how this game work you will find that each round of this game sometime is a little similar however i think the developer still could fix it and i just hope that netease would not screw it up this game is impressive but for now maybe still needs to be polished unless you want to try this game now maybe waiting for the patch is a good choice which edition of this game you should purchase is also an important thing for you to consider as many people reflect that the dlc of this game sometimes does not work even if you purchase them,78.5,73.0,6,Recommended,"September 14, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Wandering Cavalry

23663,great game great idea and combat system sadly very frustrating due to ping compensation mechanic being abused by players playing on servers they re not meant to there are literally combos that you can only pull off on high ping due to air attacks pushing people farther higher to give players with high ping more time to react infinite spammable combos inconsistent parries i can only guess dependent on ping lots of bots making it unsatisfying when you can easily tell whos a bot and realise that about 70 of players you meet in ranked matches are bots with such a big playerbase why do the devs even feel the need for bots past low ranks if you really study the game you can usually counter the ping abuse infinite combos and parry problems but even if i like studying how games work why would i want to spend so much time on finding out the minuscule details of the game code instead of just playing the game to get better especially when i can get a better and more fair experience from other games out there you basically need to be on the skill level of the top hundred players to be able to consistently counter ping abuse it s a shame because i really like the idea and love action melee combat but at this point if i want a fairer competetive experience i d rather just play some fps and even if i wanted to just play casually too many people abuse the game in unranked matches too,109.8,28.0,0,Not Recommended,January 5,NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"velllllloeg

23664,2021 barely playable but not because it s poor quality yeah reinstalled to try to get into a match dead game is dead 40k players in china maybe what it is a battle royale focused around melee combat rather than guns this is actually a lot more entertaining than you would think with movement being a big part of the gameplay gameplay a very combo heavy methodical combat which requires you to be on your toes constantly especially when fighting multiple enemies at once movement skills are a must quick inputs and good timing are necessary it s to the walls at all times difficulty skill ceiling is not visible graphics pretty good they aren t the best or groundbreaking but you won t be disappointed by them by any means personally i like my frames so i run them low audio fantastic 360 degree immersive sound replay value depends how far your patience goes this game is a true test of it what i like the combat is unique the gameplay is fast paced the animations are smooth everything is here for this game to be really nice and unique and fun to play what i don t nerfed a large portion of the games movement via scale rush and haven t address any of the realistic balance problems the game has i don t even have fun anymore every single match in gold v to gold i and back down again is just a bunch of sea sweatlards and it s ruining the na gameplay not to mention local leaderboards are broken because of cn players using vpns rip to being 1 in my state since randomly one day an asian player was at the top shrug leaderboards are infested with boosters using new accounts friends to drop elo and farm improper teaming within asian teams is common at higher ranks they like killing nas hitboxes are buggy both because of latency netcode and because they aren t very accurate parry has reached a state of full uselessness there is no proper ranked system for matches you ll be matched with silvers in plat and plats in bronze it literally is just a clusterfrick at this point as of this review i am gold iv and have been plat once and in that time i have seen more plats as a gold iv than i ever did as a plat it s goofy as hell i wouldn t buy this game to be honest the devs show no interest in fixing common and real player complaints instead erring on the side of using surveys which are vastly weighted in favor of the cn player answers most of whom all main the broken characters weps so they never receive the nerfs they need honestly man after 240 hours 80 in game 500 matches and being wr on one of the characters former temulch 50 i can honestly say i hate the state of this game devs have released a new character which is busted and basically replaces an existing one with better skills they don t seem to actually care about anything other than shelling out 20 dollar skins for weps and characters at lightning paces if you re an american with a social life or a family or full time job you will never achieve sea levels of sweatiness leaving every game to become dodge the guy with the asiatic name until final circle and then get smacked because their parry worked facing 180 degrees away from you,272.3,53.0,3,Not Recommended,"September 13, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"krunchly

23694,2021 awesome game thrilling fast paced combat and movement systems beautiful art work and characters high skill cap variety of weapons and warrior abilities refreshing and novel new take on the br genre totally unique the variety of character abilities weapons and high skill cap means this game already has an abyssal depth with plenty of potential to add more i m puzzled though by the many negative reviews i ve seen here most negative reviews admit the game is very well thought out and kick ass but complain that they would like to see a region lock and a ping limit placed on lobbies as high ping is basically an exploit being used by eastern players to dominate na servers i m south african and as there are no regional servers here i play on eu servers with at best around 190 ping if there is a way to use this to my advantage please can someone explain it to me it has been extremely challenging trying to compete with the higher ping and since i ve hit bronze ii lobbies it s been almost impossible to win any 1 v 1 s unless i time everything perfectly with my high ping i experience the following unable to land standard parry the way i have been able to land a parry is by perfectly timing a jump or crouch parry or by faking a focus attack and switching to crouch parry even if i time this perfectly it is unreliable at best and attacks penetrate straight through my parry s focus attack doesn t reliably block standard attacks many light attacks penetrate my focus attack as if it doesn t exist 200 ms delay in such fast combat means i have to anticipate the opponent perfectly to land my combos i grapple away thinking i ve survived only to find i ve been struck and actually died i combo toward an opponent only to find he s moved and is now behind me ranged combat is almost impossible as at a distance as you cant accurately time or lead the shot in spite of these challenges i have managed to progress and enjoy the game and in light of my experience i don t understand how na players are saying high ping is being exploited to dominate their servers please explain it to me so i can have a better experience i would therefore not like it at all if the devs created a region lock or ping lock as i would not be able to play from south africa and this is what the devs mean when they say creating a region lock would cause them to lose players please can the dev s look into having regional servers in south africa there is a large gaming community and naraka would be popular many other big name titles if not most have servers in south africa this would greatly improve the gaming experience obviously you could try contacting gamesoft to arrange them hosting servers naraka is a solid thumbs up from me,201.0,22.0,0,Recommended,"September 28, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Witness

23697,2022 this game has a really nice learning curve you actually get rewarded for the time you put in and see the fruits of your labor i love the aestethic of the game and the different filter options it has so you can customize the looks fitting to your liking should you have a strong enough pc the combat is simple but complex enough for every taste and every mechanic has counterplay there was never a time i felt like i couldnt do anything about anything its always i could have dodged then go for a light attack etc i like games like these really much and i enjoy it some people say there are bots or it is a dead game which is not the case at all i really recommend you trying it out there are pvp modes battle royalarenapve and everything is connected to reward systems that you can either buy for money or just grind there is a gamepass for it which is really good value but i myself never bought anything for money except the core game for like 30 bucks i have nice aestethic freedom due to the customizer tool for skin facecial features etc the team really puts in effort to make the game balanced and i think it is so far i ve played like 10 games in gold of which i ve won the past 6 as 1 rank and i gotta say it feels so rewarding once you understand the system to a detail for example now there is a ashen katana that is only available through grinding quests and it actually rewards you for putting in the time to my knowledge not even buyable throug money so it gives you the sense of prestige if you want it i love this game highly recommend even tho there are frustrating learning moments not gonna lie,83.7,43.0,8,Recommended,"November 21, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Hentiksz

23705,2023 throughout this game you will encounter nothing but players who spend their entire lives grinding to achieve top rank yes even if youre new you will go against top 500 players due to low server pop but worry not its not that hard you only have to choose from a bountiful of champs to pick from no they re not balanced at all but don t worry just become a meta slave and you ll be a okay meta will be a combination of trash champions that people with low self esteem and body oder that just wont go away and their mother has given up hope on employment for them no matter how much the community complains about the obvious advantaged other champs and weapons have above others there wont be a patch update for like 2 3 seasons and even then the nerf is hardly noticeable the term nerf to e24 only means reducing damage but 5 maybe this really doesn t change anything visibly sick there are a ton of weapons to chose from ranged and melee and an infinite way to combo with them which is amazing its too bad that in recent seasons they are only re skinning weapons that have the same move set and calling them new e g spear staff polearm and greatsword the difference between these weapons is very minor but im unable to blame e24 for this due to time not providing enough weapon variants throughout history anime fans will be hyped though there is big sword that skinny anime twink boy wields dagger that sneaky assassin has meta for that last 4 5 season no i wont stop complaining longsword oooo crouching tiger hidden dragon anyone dual blades are cool nunchucks wow so cool bruce lee so wow or some call numchucks because they cant read and lastly the weeb sword thats been folded over 10 000 times katana there are ranged weapons and they are about what you would expect from a melee focused game summary this game is fun you ll have a fun time not in ranked when you get bent over by a team that has 4k more hours than you weapons ranged and melee are all fun to use all champs are fun just balancing needs correcting but no dev gets it right so you ll just deal with it like everyone else overall you ll have a decent time,774.4,65.0,48,Recommended,"February 19, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,anpan

23715,2022 actually quite enjoyablebought it thinking that me and my friends would return this game but surprisingly it was a great experience playing from the na server i have a ping range of about 40ms to 80ms occasionally spiking to over 200ms however it doesn t really effect the game play pros great graphics fluid combos satisfying abilities and possible parries cons have a limited play window before everything goes wrong you would usually want to play around 2pm to 9pm that is when the server belongs to the na players however the moment it does into 10pm all the cn monsters awake and your ping will spike hard i am not sure why they would prioritize the amount of players from a regions ping compared to the supposed region like if i m from na i should always have around 60ms not altered because some people from other regions want to play in my region it really doesn t make any sense like if cn players come to na they should always have over 200ms,100.5,18.0,2,Recommended,"June 29, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Koboba
23717,after almost 3 years and hundreds of hours i am reasy to write a review in short i do not recommend this game unless you enjoy being in the ass without lube now some details the game is absolutely beautiful graphics characters outfits architecture attention to details evrything is just stunning this is the main reason why i kept going back but now my butt isn t just hurting but anus is gushing blood that s why i am writing this review the game is not greedy and you can get a lot of cosmetics without paying there are a lot of rewards just for your time in the game and once you purchase the battle pass you can get all your gold back after completing it now it s time for some whining everything below is written from the point of view of an average solo player there is and there was no balance in the game not enough players to fill matches in order to have any semblance of equal rank when you are silver you play with bots when you are platinum you are matched against top players on the server should i explain how such matches go oh god my anus twitches violently just remembering those encounters with top 100 players when you are not even in 500 you will be stunlocked and comboed into oblivion if you are lucky you ll be able to land a hit new heroes are increasingly op with ridiculous ultimates that will rip your anus in shreds in seconds even if they rework abilities of some old heroes they give make them op you can t really learn tutorial exoplains the basics easy bots are morons and do not act as players hard bots will you in the ass as quickly and is roughly as any top player i think that s enough of a rant for today i feel a little bit better now it s time to apply some cooling balm on you guessed it,670.3,46.0,40,Not Recommended,August 5,NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,BubbleTea

23724,2021 it is not worthy to buy it hot garbage as some might say game is a melee oriented battle royale set in chinese culture just because combat is mostly focused on melee weapons you still have a few ranged options to chose from as well if you die you die because you can t play melee you won t get sniped by hanzo or widowmaker from 300m just because someone plays sniper rifles for 9000h in fps game is not easy and somewhat foggy about what should i do to not die to some korean player with spear there are a few tutorials in game but they are pretty basic enough to play against bots but not enough to play against players all weapons have their own combos every character have their own skills some are straight useless in most cases but generally everything is playabe i ll try to summarize pros and cons in easy form there are quite a lot of people on every server so it shouldn t be a problem to find ranked game unless you play when gamers amount is decreasing then queue time is getting noticeably longer game has nice but repetative vibe graphics sounds multi language dubbing lines animations games are not that long i think they end at around 25th minute at most there are some waifu and rule34 materials wink there is build in voice chat in game on top of normal text chat you can play with up to 2 friends since lobby is capped at 3 players there are few game modes on top of normal game you should use ssd drive to play hdd will make your game freeze quite often and it is crucial to be freeze less to stay alive battle pass costs almost as much as base game it offers both free and paid tiers of course but you probably experienced in other games that difference between free and paid is visible but free to play games like narka has to make money too right there are quite a lot of quests daily weekly seasonal character specific not like this is bad by itself but you almost exclusively gain in game currency from quests you can t grind them by just playing this is to slow progress of gaining skins and push you to paying with real money for them you ll open chests rather rarely this is bad because your customization progress will be slow if you won t invest real money in gambling boxes and feeling of expanding wardrobe is non existant comparing to overwatch where you get chest every account level or after doing some quests here you get chests from battlepass character quests so like 2 3 per character and you can buy them with hard cap 4 week game is made on unity engine and has its own anti cheat that is kinda garbage game is flooded with cheaters script macro users game is not pay to win you can upgrade weapons only in match with lootable glyphs everybody can do that and it is part of gameplay there is no crafting system but it does have lootboxes with skins a bit like overwatch skins are quite expensive for free to play players the most expensive costs 98000 silk and i have like 30k after 70h in game so your best bet is to get them from chest not every skin is chestable some are exclusive to battle pass or promo codes gambling to change nickname in game you need to pay with paid or grindable currency game is absolutely the purest form of tryharding that exists recommended only for players that enjoy sweatin to the limits it is fun when you are good but it will take time to get to that level if you don t have background in frame perfect games like tekken note battlepass costs either 1360 or 4360 gold all premium tiers if you unlock them will give you only 1280 gold back so here goes your money you either buy more to sustain battle pass for few seasons or be forced to buy some gold every 3 months gold packages available in store 240g 1 851200g 9 253000g 23 15 1 lootbox 6000g 46 25 3 lootbox 12000g 92 5 10 lootbox only thing that hurts me personally about this game is cashgrabs and gambling taken straight from mobile games on top of paying 20 for game that is far from perfect battle pass gambling boxes paid exclusive skins and maybe more in the future don t buy it it is a hot garbage and twitch audience is already dying in eu na i doubt this game will bloom but might wither for few years being populated by pros who can t play other games and cheaters don t make same mistake as i did but if you think this is suitable enviroment for you you can use my reference code in game chdkdkxqhr,319.5,40.0,2,Not Recommended,"August 13, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Unexpected Katz

23729,2021 edit this is after the update which came well sometimes now the game runs well now the new character valda cui is an interesting addition but needs a bit of a balancing about balancing it still need a bit more polishing but slowly getting there it s really enjoyable now naraka bladepoint is an online battle royale game where warriors around the world go to morus isle to fight for the mask of immortality for their own goal i waited a bit to write this review to experience more from the game i also got experience from the beta so this review will hopefully be a complete overview about this game it s hard for me to choose what i like most in this game but probably my favorite is the sound design the game has epic and traditional sounding like soundtrack but what takes the cake is the sound effects in general because you can determine it easily where the sound coming from even if someone shooting from behind of a building or someone running on the roof above you you will definitely notice it most online games lack of this quality sound design the character s voice are pretty good too my personal favorite the authentic chinese dub about the controls it seems a bit confusing at first however you can get into it quickly the combat system also simple you can do horizontal and vertical strikes with the left right click you can charge these attack types and also you can do a counter if you press both attack types at the same type movement is similar to other games but the game also indicates the usable buttons on the screen surprisingly the game got really good graphics the whole world is vibrating because of the different colors and places which looks really good effects are also nice looking just like the models too however because of this awesome graphics you will need at least a 4gb graphics card instead of 2gb sadly this is also a problem with the game because if you lack of proper components to play the game the game will lag a lot when it s load in the game also it s recommended to put the game on ssd to reduce load time believe me it will be better for you because sadly if the game not loaded in properly you won t be able to interact properly in the world it s always a nice touch when the devs making backstories for the life and death game and for the characters too you can find more lore about the characters which are interesting and give depth for the game and also it s pretty surprising to see such thing in a multiplayer only game time to talk about the gameplay i don t want to write a long describing about what you do in the game but i try to mention the corner stones of the gameplay so there are 60 players on an island which has varied environment and loots you can play 7 different characters right now they got 2 skills per character and every skill has 2 other variants too you can find melee and ranged weapons in the game every range weapon has it s own mechanic and stats you can find bows muskets or even a flamethrower for example i briefly mentioned the melee combat system but you can do different attacks in different movement state and of course you can use different weapons like longswords spears or great swords for example and also these weapons got their own combo system and stats too you can find additional items in the world but also you can collect coins and buy items from the shops on the island which will help you throughout your journey i want to mention the jades which can give you passive or even active skills either for weapons or for your character moonbane charms can make danger zones basically you ask the help of a snake god which will make the area of your choice to purge the game also has other dangers or helps in the world for example you can eat fruits to buff yourself temporarily or find dandelions to make your footsteps silenced the mentioned dangerous are could be fire lamps which if it falls on you you will get stunned and you start burning which takes your hp but there are wheels in dried up rivers which if you make move you can take out players with and a lot other you can find and explore need to mention the findable quest scrolls in the game which if you complete in the game you earn coins these all alone makes the gameplay really interesting but i need to mention the movement in the game which makes your character go parkour you can do jumps flips and combining with the findable and buyable grappling hooks you can do really fun movements and strategies needless to say the game has a lot to offer in the matches however outside of the island you can experience the detailed character face customization the tons of skins in the game leaderboards throughout the game either you play in solo or trio the custom game option and also the ffa game mode bloodbath but also the unranked br game mode too but there is also a talent system in the game which gives you certain passive buffs for your character in each match also naraka bladepoint not the regular long ranged battle royale game because ranged weapons are not that damage heavy the game focuses on the melee weapons you need to go face to face with others and defeat them in there if you want to achieve victory which is really changing up the usual battle royale receipt long story short the game has tons of really good things and usually battle royale games are not interesting for me but naraka bladepoint got me good with it s tons of details however things are not that always good probably the biggest issue with this game it s skill heavy there are lot of players who play insanely well in the game in every division making every match difficult even top 5 finishes too if you want to play casually you might have a bad time until you don t learn how to better in the game the developers tried to make this a bit easier at the beginning when the player got introduced with bots in regular matches lot of people had their hopes up when they won a match easily until the next game where they got destroyed by real players so if you are interested in the game you need to step up in your game because you might just rage quit from naraka because you don t understand why you got stun locked in a fight why you can t win games the game s movement also lacking sometimes not grabbing edges when it should or at few parts your character get stuck in places the game also unoptimized too these are basically the biggest issues with the game another interesting thing in the game is that sometimes you end up playing someone else from the other side of the world or even you are not on eu server the devs say that they try to minimize the lags in this case but most of the time it s really noticeable and unfair before i verdict this review i want to mention two more things first the loot boxes and dlcs i don t understand why you hate the game which has these stuffs because if you buy a dlc or loot box you only get cosmetics the game is not pay to win so you can just simply avoid these things lot other games do the same and there is just a few which let you freely choose between cosmetics for free so i don t really get what s the matter with it if you still get annoyed by this it will be the best for everyone for you to not play this game the other thing the mentioned bots you can say it s a marketing step to not let the player let go early from the game but it s an understandable move in general naraka bladepoint is a really detailed and fun battle royale game and also competitive lot of people will give up on it because it s difficult but i recommend you to check videos about the game and tutorials to learn the game i can definietly recommend you to play the game even for the full price because this is by far my favorite battle royale game i have ever played,204.7,23.0,1,Recommended,"August 31, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"[ME] etneveL

23733,2021 this has got to be the most aggressive business model i have ever seen in a game so if you purchase the battle pass you get 16x80 gold that is 1280 the battle pass cost 1360 gold even if you buy the battle pass and only want to use the gold from the battle pass to purchase next seasons battle pass you can t you have to spend money on the game skins on sale are 1700 gold that s roughly 15 for a skin on sale its 2400g not on sale which is roughly 20 that is insane then they have a lootbox system that doesn t contain every skin or item in the game purchasing the deluxe 60 gives 0 gold and 0 silver that s an extremely aggressive business model if i say so myself the game is fun the combat is fun everything is b2p just the added cosmetics on top of b2p on top of lootboxs on top torchbearer on top everything else like they have so many ways to make money yet they charge 60 for the deluxe that barely comes with extras i recommend the game for playing and content i do not recommend due to the in your face buy our premium currency model,255.0,119.0,11,Not Recommended,"August 12, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Effedupcamel
23734,2022 probably the only battle royale i liked i fell in love with the aesthetic of the game at first which is what made me want to try it the character designs and the maps are exquisitely designed when i actually tried the combat it felt so seamless and realistic i love it the learning curve is quite large and actually requires skill and not just spamming the attack button i like that they also managed to add in nun chucks as a melee option it s also not p2w as you only pay for some cosmetics all the characters and some skins can be bought with in game currency and there are also a lot of events that give out free cosmetics through limited time quests,71.9,22.0,1,Recommended,"February 14, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Nashe

23739,2023 feel good bots when i played on release i was curious about why the devs had decided to use bots that s because they use them in pvp player vs player game modes where it s supposed to be full of people not only that but the only indication that they were bots was certain animation jank involving the grappling hook the answer despite what other reviews say it wasn t an issue of population they were prevalent even on release in all queues no it was an issue of psychology if you feel good playing the game you will be more likely to buy microtransactions minion masters also sneakily does the same thing no thanks i ll wait until they can physically make me feel good psa look up click farms and maybe you ll see why 2000 positive reviews consist of the words cool game,108.7,121.0,13,Not Recommended,"June 29, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,ajv941
23740,2023 this game is super fun and feels like a fresh breeze of air in a sea of br s with a few exceptions because this game is buy to play it really stops most of the players to try it out including me i kept my eye on this game for a long time until i saw it on a good discount eu na player base is not that big especially compared to china i heard something about 15mil sold copies what do we get from all this we get ridiculously unfair ranked matchmaking how it s fair to place fresh players against literally top 500 sweatlords and chinese smurfs with 200 ping i m pretty sure some people drop this game only because of this and you can t blame them plus add complexity of the game 14 characters with different skills and their variations and a bunch of melee and ranged weapons which in my opinion is a good thing but still it take some time to learn it all despite all the downsides this game is worth a try but be prepared for the challenges i hope the developers will someday realize the need to move to an f2p model and this game will shine,269.4,24.0,2,Not Recommended,"January 5, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Lindell

23758,2021 naraka is honestly a breath of fresh air in the field of battle royale games while most brs are focused on ranged combat naraka puts heavy emphasis on melee and it feels good the combat system is very similar to traditional fighting games combos counters dodging etc and its honestly the most fun i ve had in a battle royale in a long time of course the combat isn t the only selling point the movement system is extremely satisfying and fun to use anything that you want to do you can do climb up walls stealthily balance on a chain hide in a tree hang from the edge of a roof dive through a window the list goes on you also have the option to use a grappling hook which when used properly can make you feel like batman zipping from building to building visually the game is beautiful there s a lot of detail on things that you wouldn t normally spend very long looking at and of course all of the main elements are amazing as well combat visuals are easy to see and interpret but not so much that they clutter the screen the characters are all unique with their own playstyles and it all seems decently balanced so you won t have to worry about picking the wrong hero its the perfect game to play casually or competitively and i highly recommend trying it that being said it does have some issues if you don t have an ssd you should definitely get one before downloading naraka running it from an hdd causes stuttering and lag spikes its not enough to make the game unplayable but it is very frustrating and menus can take a very long time to load sometimes long enough that you don t get to pick your spawn point before the match starts other than this though the game is very polished and clean and if you have no hardware conflicts then you shouldn t run into any issues feel free to use my referral code if my review helped you decide to give the game a try referral code chh64ajm3w,161.0,19.0,0,Recommended,"September 24, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Wyvern

23762,2022 loved the game at first but the increased issues with cheaters and chinese players invading eu servers made it unplayable not to mention it takes a century to get into any kind of match to the point where it feels like the only thing you can do is play bot matches if you re not in china don t waste your time the devs only care about the chinese player base so don t expect to have a good experience if that s not your case,210.8,21.0,0,Not Recommended,"May 10, 2022",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,mfcostacampos
23763,2023 i see this is one of those games the community is trying to rally against even without playing it or looking into it in any depth and so i ll spend some of my life writing my first steam review i like hard games i like asian aesthetic and historical culture as well as folklore and i like uniqueness this game checks all those boxes well and i ve seen the game grow in playability since it s early seasons in fact i don t think they even called them seasons at first it s not perfect and my biggest gripe at first was that it was a game with an upfront cost as well as many micro transaction options the game is now free to play however and you unlock legendary skins items every now and again from just playing as well as offering ways to unlock playable characters of your choice with in game currency when mentioning this game in conversation i ve been met with disinterest because of it s lack of popularity as well as some off hand racism i encourage all that are looking for a challenging and fun game to give it a try despite these stigmas i m very glad i tried it out that first time since this is an honest review i ll mention cons as well i feel there s just a bit too much going on in the main menus as far as events currencies packages skins doo dads links texts ect i do enjoy it to some extent as it s a fun tribute to the chinese culture to have festivals and events and cool little gifts however it s just a bit excessive of this function to the point where i don t know what some things are because i simply want to get into a battle most of the time and not try to track down what kind of coins i just acquired randomly and what shop i can use them in gameplay wise i have a great time there are some very good players in this game and it s very important to try to pick apart what exactly they re doing better than you and try to use those skills for yourself which is akin to martial arts and i think that s cool a high skill ceiling for sure but those that are scared of this shouldn t fear too much there is a bot mode with 3 difficulties that you can play solo or with your friends so that there is no chance of being whipped up and down by the lord of the lobby as i ve affectionately named the player you can see in the lobby before you spawn in that has a mastery rank that you can t even understand piggy backing off that point when you play pvp there will be bots in the mix and you will feel great for defeating many of them but when you meet the lord of the lobby in that same game your fate will likely be sealed before you realize it is he she it makes you pay more attention if anything but the skill jump can be a bit of a shock when it happens might i add you can accomplish the in game quests achievements in the bot modes overall this is one of my favorite games to play lately i m a bit of a casual gamer as you can see i don t have thousands of hours in this game only a hundred or so but i still find it challenging and fun for fans of the dynasty warriors series it will feel homey but also much more polished and fluid if i may interject with a comparison here there are many many dynasty warriors games and they ve gathered quite a following over the years however they have been much of the same game with improvements here and there on graphics features and playability this is a fresh take on a very similar concept of gameplay polishing it up and also incorporating pvp and online co op dynasty warriors holds a place in my heart from years and years ago and i think looking at the two side by side grows my love of naraka to and even higher state i won t give a number rating for this game or any other game that s not my style just know i like this game a lot and i think more people should give it a try thank you for reading my review and may your journeys be full of wonder,192.4,39.0,4,Recommended,"December 17, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,Von Nebo

23832,2021 i usually don t like br games at all i find them far too boring and reliant on gathering skills and playing like a coward while naraka bladepoint still suffers from general br issues it still feels worth playing and has several ways of forcing conflict along with the classic ever shrinking ring there are quest scrolls you can pick up that promise great rewards if you can complete a small task one of these is the bounty quest which marks a certain nearby player as your target allowing you to track their location to a certain degree that player is also notified of the bounty on their head and whoever survives the encounter comes out of it with a hefty coin advantage to spend at one of the game s many merchant chests melee combat is the game s main focus and verticality plays a huge role on the surface it s a simple rps system lights beat counters which beat focus attacks which beat lights this ends up being a lot deeper due to the varied melee weapons with different strength light and focus attacks and further deepens once you get used to the game s dodging sliding and grapple hook based movement systems all of the weapons have their strengths and the fact that the community has jumped from calling at least 4 different weapons op and broken is a testament to their balance finally the heroes are small in number but varied enough to be interesting none stand out as particularly op although some of their ultimates are more annoying than others once again the community can t decide which hero is the most broken meaning they re probably all pretty viable at this stage i m sure in the future the meta will develop towards favouring one or two but so far i haven t felt like any choice has been overly weak,267.2,16.0,0,Recommended,"August 16, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Love Memory

23994,2021 just another one of those typical eastern made games that gives you a dopamine hit for the first week and then goes to complete and turns into a heavy money and time sink they obviously admitted to using strategic bots as a way to gently introduce new players into what ultimately turns into a brutal ass pounding that i personally feel does more harm than good honestly they are just there so you can toot your own horn and make you think you re a god and then you fight for the rest of your career and realise your garbage i love how every trailer is some dude beating down what is obviously a bot and not showing much if any real player interaction like this could be you dominating the battlefield but the reality is you are basically that bot helplessly savaged by the eastern hordes it s been a long while since i played it but i figured i should write something i don t imagine they ve done anything about a proper region lock yet or found anyway to stop chinanumberone vpning into eu and us servers or if they even give a to dominate the leaderboards with their lag sure the skill ceiling gets extremely high too but i always remember moments where lag gave them distinct advantages in moments it shouldn t like completely ignoring your attacks when they aren t even focused or their attacks phasing through a well timed parry or when they manage to somehow interrupt you with a normal attack while you are focused i honestly have better things to do than sweat on naraka all day long so i of course fell well behind the skill gap too and ultimately what was for the first 50 60 hours a somewhat enjoyable experience just got worse and worse it has its fair share of hacking too having witnessed it first had a few times one such instance when this guy had a hack that every time they charged up and released their focus attack they teleported behind you instantly from pretty much any distance and just juggled your corpse didn t really seem like they were bothered about combating it or other issues just pumping out pretty skins for your weapons and characters so you can roleplay an otherwise very aesthetically pleasing game that masks its truly ugly nature underneath i wouldn t honestly bother unless you hate your life have no job and want to sit playing it 24 7 also bruce lee what,124.1,16.0,3,Not Recommended,"December 14, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Gunn

24201,2023 normally it would be a very good game we enjoyed it very much at first but the rank system of the game is very problematic i just started playing this game but im playing with the chinese who have been playing it for years also the servers should be separated i don t want to play with the chinese that s why we deleted the game 3 friends you have to remove the chinese from this game and separate the servers otherwise you will continue to lose players at least the rank system should work correctly so that we can play with our equivalent players and enjoy the game i ve only played for 30 hours and a chinese who has played 1000 hours should not be matched fix the matchmaking system or split servers especially separate the asia server from europe,83.9,18.0,16,Not Recommended,"February 18, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,ExeLds
24465,2021 the first mixed review game that i really do enjoy 1 amazing optimization even though naraka has an up tempo combat style 2 cosmetics itself is very pleasant to the eyes 3 movement system is pretty enjoyable except of one point i wish dodge button shift and fast run button also shift would changed somehow frequently when you pressing it instead of fast run he just wasting energy by dodging death awaits you if skilled player chasing you p s don t be mad if you were killed by squikki that guy is a monster,64.2,16.0,0,Recommended,"August 13, 2021",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"the Mongrel

24923,2023 updated after 290h positive notes high movement good combat mechanics also i really like the focused melee combat good maps no sbmm thanks god you can buy old items i really like the skills very high skill gap variety of modes super customizable characters but now let s start with the negative notes some items cost too much money dumb gacha mechanics sometimes the netcode is horrible zai need a look her ulti is too much you get stunned almost everytime and you can t do nothing ranked mode need a rework when you start getting almost every match yellow lobbies ranking up became a very very long grind and unnecessary i hope they remove this mechanic parry incosistent it not work properly everytime and this sucks spyware i don t know where this thing cameout but it s fun to see people caring about their privacy with a random game while they have installed every sort of social network in their phone and keep posting everything about their lifes if you really care about your privacy you will not even own a smartphone,445.9,18.0,5,Recommended,"July 29, 2023",NARAKA: BLADEPOINT,"Shikii
