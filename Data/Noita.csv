84800,2021 the reasons why people love and hate this game are exactly the same the game won t offer you a goal guide or quest but it will offer you countless hours of exploring and experimenting with whatever you want if you start playing with the mindset of this being your usual roguelike or rougelite you ll probably come out frustrated the game never boxes you in in fact it wants you to use its own mechanics against it every wall is crossable every enemy is defeatable the game feels difficult because an unbreakable material or a boss with a million health feels like a roadblock you re not meant to cross but in noita you are meant to do it the game s seemingly ridiculous difficulty stems from how non conventional the combat is you might not be able to take that eldritch monster straight on but you can turn it into a sheep and teleport it into lava or you can dig a tunnel and just never have to deal with it on a slightly different note as a completionist this game has felt incredibly satisfying to play i m the type of person who checks every bookshelf in a game just to read there are some books here fifty times so i wasn t expecting anything big when i tried to go out of bounds let me tell you there are no bounds every time i tried to throw the game a curveball it threw one right back at me in conclision noita is best played if you enjoy learning the game s mechanics through trial and error the game is more rewarding than it seems and it encourages creative problem solving it won t be easy but every accomplishment will be yours,193.8,806.0,5,Recommended,"8 February, 2021",Noita,Puli

84806,2022 have you ever been tripping on mushrooms and accidentally drink super rare urine off the floor because you thought it was a shield potion but it actually caused you to vomit lava on your feet but you re immune to fire so you drown instead that s how it feels to play noita,79.4,591.0,342,Recommended,"14 September, 2022",Noita,Zanny
84807,2021 there is so much more to this game than meets the eye the basics you play as a mage you kill enemies with your wands spells you progress downward through levels and reach safe zones where you can purchase new wands spells and perks when you die it s game over and the entire game restarts quite literally due to the design if you progress far enough you ll reach the end game boss defeat said boss to achieve victory sounds simple enough right well you have one life and there are no saves zero hand holding the game tells you the controls and off you go to explore and die enemies do not around they will wreck your bosses laugh at you and ragdoll your corpse if you re not prepared everything else can and will kill you you ll think you re having a good run then bam death by falling rocks exploding barrels hidden traps lava acid electricity panicking pressing the wrong key at the wrong time the list goes on and on pros wand building and player perks there s a huge variety of spells for your wands as well as player perks spells can be linked together in weird and wonderful ways for maximum carnage it s insanely fun and dangerous experimenting with different spell and perk combinations exploration and secrets without spoiling too much the game is a lot larger than it appears try going off the beaten track and see what you can find there s a lot of secrets to be discovered some are massively cryptic though so i found myself having to search for answers online enemies and bosses awesome variety of enemies with unique stats and abilities you ll find yourself learning enemy behaviour and capabilities a spell which is effective against one enemy might be totally useless against another pure destruction everything in the game can be destroyed in one way or another solid rock can be nuked into oblivion liquids turned into gas and flammable items burned so you can unleash your inner pyro potions liquids you can collect all kinds of liquids in bottles which act as utility items for example some put out fires while others provide temporary buffs and debuffs there s so much more i want to say but it s way more fun and rewarding discovering these things for yourself cons rng can be a sometimes the random spells wands or potions you find might be undesirable depending on your situation on the flipside it pushes you to adapt and figure out how to make it work in your favour there s also a certain event which makes all of the safe zones very unsafe i won t say what it is or how it happens but it s normally triggered by you the player sometimes it can seemingly happen at random and will make the remainder of your run a lot more painful singular pixels it s not uncommon to accidentally explode yourself because you did not see a single pixel right in front of you during a fight it s also quite easy to become blocked or trapped by a single pixel while you re manoeuvring or fleeing no saves or difficulty setting i personally do not think this is a bad thing but others might the game is designed to be challenging and harsh you will die easily and frequently losing everything after many hours of hard work can be really frustrating but that s the nature of the game overall noita is an amazing game with an incredible amount of depth it will punish you over and over but you ll keep coming back for more,187.4,316.0,4,Recommended,"11 October, 2021",Noita,"Ryno

84810,2020 they market it with the pixel simulation and it s certainly very cool and makes many other games feel horribly rigid but the real draw is the wand spell building system it allows you to eventually build totally broken god tier wands erasing anything in an instant nice power trip until you are polymorphed into a sheep with 1 hp the game is difficult and sometimes death feels a bit unfair but even then it still manages to pull me right back in for just one more run the world is also bigger than it first seems so there is plenty to explore i just wish there were more in game hints to secrets and lore much of that stuff is very obscure and hard to discover organically without resorting to reading stuff from wiki according to steam play time tracking this might be my most played game ever and although quantity does not equate quality it is an indication of something here,239.0,281.0,6,Recommended,"December 23, 2020",Noita,Tapio
84811,2020 honestly this is one of those times where i really wish there was a middle thumb option for reviews i love this game but noita is definitely the kind of game that you ll either absolutely love or completely despise pros awesome physics between all the ways you can interact with the world mess with terrain and even perform genuine alchemy it s definitely the biggest selling point of the game it s just super cool the wand building there s a huge variety of spells at your disposal at any given time and there s quite a few spells you can unlock through various secret shenanigans having the ability to concoct any handheld death machine you want and subsequently die to improperly crafted ones gives the game such a fantastic extra layer of creativity and encourages the player to a experiment often and b learn from any deadly mistakes huge world the main progression is pretty linear but there is an absolutely absurd amount of secrets and hidden biomes for you to explore like holy crap i don t think i ve ever played a game with this sheer amount of secret side stuff before a couple biomes are really lackluster looking at you snow chasm and desert chasm but 95 of the time discovering any of these new out of the way areas and solving the obscure puzzles is just a joy that i haven t felt since first playing the original spelunky it s wonderful neat story it s told mostly through out of the way lore snippets and through the environment and it paints a cool picture of what you re doing why you re here how the world came to be etcetera while letting you fill in the blanks super moddable is there anything you don t like use mods and the game s more fun ta da subjective the difficulty oh boy noita is hard and everyone on the internet has already probably told you that for the most part i like the challenge but far too often have i succumbed to something completely out of my control you can learn from deaths from enemies or your own spell mishaps or from environmental shenanigans but sometimes the cards are stacked against you and you just get instakilled by an explosive buried in snow or dunked in to a sea of lava by a few pixels of teleportation liquid the problem is this is spelunky tier difficulty in a game where any run that s not a speedrun will almost always take several hours you die it s back to square one and you ll have to go back to all those secret areas all over again if you want to take advantage of their spoils this will really be the deciding factor in whether or not you like this game are you okay with the risk of losing hours of progress to little avail personally i think noita offers just enough for me to be cool with that but i wouldn t blame you for hating the hell out of it cons not a huge amount of unlockable content there s plenty of wonderful secret sights to behold sure but outside of the eleven orbs there are only a measly seven or so challenges that actually unlock permanent rewards two secret bosses three super secret puzzles and two huge challenge runs this probably sounds like a decent amount but remember each run takes many many hours you ll only unlock this stuff if you re going for all the super secret hidden side stuff if you re just doing a normal go straight down run there is precisely nothing to unlock there are actually plenty of achievements but they mostly don t unlock anything without many achievements that provide tangible rewards it often just feels completely pointless and frustrating to continue when you just suddenly die to some random x factor there s sort of a wand meta if you want a god run you re going to have two wands a rapid fire homing death laser that kills everything instantly and an infinite black hole wand you re basically shooting yourself in the foot if you re not trying to build for that and oftentimes the game will be the one shooting you in the foot by not giving you any good wands some weird perks some of them just feel like they should be features and some of them are one time bonuses that scale horrendously tinker with wands everywhere is so necessary that i feel like you should just start with it cough cough get the mod that lets you start with it and all of the wand upgrade perks are so profoundly dumb unless you get them while you already have the godliest wands some very questionable enemy design the game largely has some actually pretty cool enemies but there s just a fewww too many enemies that are massive run ending terrors got hit by a blinding wizard good luck fighting a bulky guy with a poison gun have fun getting your health drained for 30 years if you don t fight him from 30 miles away fighting a scrawny robot assassin haha oops he s actually the tankiest enemy in the game this extends to the two of the bosses the lava lake boss is probably the most nonsensically hard enemy in the game everything is fine except for that polymorph attack why almost guaranteed to end your run it just turns the fight in to oops do you not have any way to deflect projectiles or hide guess you die and the final boss is weird he s mostly super cool but if you re going for a high orb run the fight is going to take centuries have fun eating through several billion health that s not an exaggeration even the godliest of god runs will literally take over half an hour to kill it conclusion noita is an absolutely magical experience wrapped in a layer of barbed wire the game s still in active development so hopefully it gets even better play with your own selection of mods for the ideal experience because jeez there s a lot of wonky stuff if you can vibe with the brutally punishing difficulty i can t recommend this game enough however if you don t want to deal with that difficulty combined with the huge run length give it a pass or buy it when it s on sale edit 10 13 21 lol parts of this review haven t aged super well since i haven t touched noita once since before the full release because of how high commitment it is still a good game but sheesh just thinking about how much there is to do in the game with my completionist brain is so stressful,169.0,379.0,4,Recommended,"November 17,

84813,imagine if everyone kept telling you flappy birds had an amazing endgame and you couldn t make it past the first 3 pillars consistently,147.5,209.0,74,Recommended,May 19,Noita,kaddar
84814,when i was younger i always wanted to play a game that gave me incredible freedom when it comes to magic something that didn t give me just a little set amount of spells i can use like most games do but rather a place where to do magic to create my own years later noita does that and much more wand tinkering and spells in general would require a review on their own there are around 380 spells in the base game and 422 in the current beta branch update beta branch went live two days after this and most of them if not all are interesting in their own right the amount of things you are allowed to do is immense do you want a wand that casts angry boulders ready to fly onto any and every enemy they see crushing them to their death not only it s doable but it only requires you to use two spells perhaps you d like a wand that shoots nukes at the same rate a machine gun shoots its stuff i wouldn t recommend it your pc probably wouldn t like it but it doesn t hurt to try once or twice or how about using a spell that kills read destroy any enemy within range the range being your entire screen just like that as if they were disappearing because you ve snapped your fingers such spell exists of course some spells are better than others and some require better wands to be casted but noita works in mysterious ways and with the right set of spells even the most humble ones can become weapons of mass destruction always cast wands add lots of fun and new ideas to the mix every time you cast any spell from said wand the spell or spells you can have multiple always casts will get casted as well a good always cast spell can and will change your run although they re fairly rare to come by the complexity of wand tinkering is definitely not something that i can fully cover because even now 283 hours into the game i still feel like i ve barely scratched its surface noita does that pretty well making me feel like i m still learning something new every single run for those who are interested youtube is full of tutorials on how to maximise damage on which spells you want to look for on which synergise well personally i ve always avoided them spending time tinkering is a key component to my enjoyment of the game and sharing the results with some of the friends that play the game makes it even more satisfying alchemy or as a friend of mine likes to call it shampoo making definitely deserves a mention as well alongside potions in general note that when i say alchemy i am referring only to the act of potion mixing and not the concept of alchemy as a whole with all its references to real life more on that later noita has a big variety of potions liquids and materials going on and lots of them interact with each other from mixing acceleratium a liquid that makes you go faster and levitatium a liquid that lets you levitate faster together to create hastium a liquid that will let you both move and levitate faster to creating an alchemical wonder that will turn everything it touches into gold alchemy comes in different degrees of complexity just like wand tinkering then you can spend hours upon hours messing around with liquids trying to conoct something new and interesting while updating a spreadsheet open where you save your discoveries mixing acceleratium with slime isn t a good idea heating up water will create smoke setting a small pixel of oil on fire will eventually turn the whole pool of oil into fire throwing blood on lava will create volcanic rock and so on chances are i ve never seen every single potion in the game since i ve happened to stumble across liquids i had never seen before not too long ago the current beta branch is adding some more liquids as well one of which is a game changer when it comes to alchemy and will make mixing potions easier and more fun for the potions to have an effect on you you don t necessarily have to stain yourself with them since the game also has a drink and eat mechanic of course drinking some potions and liquids isn t a good idea why would you drink your flask of acid but the option is always there you can also eat some materials eating some things in certain quantities might also make interesting things happen so go ahead and consume everything you see if it does you good good for you and if does you bad at least you ve learnt something new i ll never be able to stress enough the importance of learning from your mistakes in noita the whole point of the game is to learn learn which spells are good and synergise well learn which potions you always want to have with you learn which enemies are best avoided what they do learn what perks do and which are best exploring the world is incredibly fun its main structure remains mostly unvaried you can go down the mountain trying to get down as much as you can but it only represents a small amount of the content noita has to offer there is a whole world to be explored filled with secrets enemies bosses and special wands in due time if you re willing to sink time into it you ll learn how it s structured how to traverse it and where to look for anything that might make you stronger the artwork is amazing i am in love with it and i m still disappointed there is no points shop 500 steam points for a noita profile background will be worth it enemies bosses in particular will teach you the importance of having different kinds of damage since some of them are completely immune to certain kinds while also being weak to others is it really that surprising that the guy made out of fire dies when thrown water at a wand you ve made after hours of careful consideration and hard work to look for the right spells might turn out to be completely powerless against the boss you meant to fight and yes it has happened to me some might complain the game is too harsh on you and while i don t agree with them denying it s still harsh would be unfair the game is harsh some enjoy calling it a great self discovery tool for masochists you will die a lot sometimes in frustrating ways through no fault of yours sometimes it s so random you ll ask yourself how am i meant to avoid this but you will learn how to survive longer how to avoid dangerous situations how to heal consistently how to make the best out of what you have and random deaths will happen less and less you ll come to hate polymorphine and enemies that shoot it they ll make you feel vulnerable even at your strongest and i like it you ll never be fully invincible there are also some complaints on the game s secrets even i felt the game might have been too wiki dependant when i first started since i just couldn t figure out what some things meant what they did how to use them but the game does give you the means of solving them although admittedly a few of them are really obscure a lot of answers are scattered throughout the world and when you ll find them you ll connect the dots and feel satisfied and in future runs you ll be able to take advantage of your new found secret so go ahead and explore the world your curiosity is rewarded do keep in mind the game is trying to go for a whimsical esoteric feel that rewards people willing to take their time and understand what surrounds them it has plenty of references to alchemy and finnish mythology the latter i am completely unprepared for the former i m lucky enough to know things of watching how the game interprets some of its concepts the emerald tablet alchemical symbols has been very interesting it also even has its own writing system and some secrets are yet unsolved perhaps you ll be the one to solve them try the game out then give it another try if you ve played it in the past and keep playing it if you ve never stopped the game is a harsh teacher but learning is incredibly fun,346.6,325.0,9,Recommended,April 6,Noita,bingotunes
84815,2021 got my first win after 231 deaths and 50 hours i can now recommend the game,117.1,277.0,77,Recommended,"November 15, 2021",Noita,crabzarb
84817,2021 i will one day give this game a more detailed review but for now if you are a hardcore gamer you will enjoy noita it is a punishing game that rewards experimentation and rewards experience with satisfying dominance over its world however even when you get the right set of tools in a randomized run you are still vulnerable your death is always one drop of liquid away it keeps you on your feet and it keeps your adrenaline pumping this game is extremely tough and unforgiving it is trivial to die which resets your run this can be frustrating this is frustrating but that s part of playing a hardcore roguelike this game features extremely deep engineering mechanics which are directly tied to your success in it this is a game where you try out a new thing and probably die as a result but this time you know a bit more and as you learn more and more suddenly the mechanic that killed you will click and boom you know how to make a magic wand that is more akin to tsar bomba than avada kedavra the game world is absolutely laden with secrets and hidden mechanics some of them are almost impossible to figure out on your own though but most are totally discoverable my only gripe with this game is that there is a mid game in your player development in which you are good enough to be comfortable with the game but not good enough to really turn any run into a win run in which you can discover secrets imo the primary goal of this game in this mid game you ll find yourself not random rolling the right tools that you want meaning you get frustrating periods of being stuck at the starter levels with meh equipment it s not that fun but when you get the right tools ohhhhhhhh man it makes it all worth it even if you immediately die because for one moment you were the grim reaper of noita death incarnate the apex predator as you get better with the game you find that the game gives you the right tools more and more often because they were almost always there right under your nose but you were not experienced enough to see it sometimes you just get awful runs though that are only viable for the really really experienced players tl dr this is a game about exploration and science i personally felt like a toddler again while playing this experimenting exploring the world for the first time and eventually much more powerful than i really was it s thrilling also this game is completely whimsical it s art style and theme is beautiful curious and entertaining at all levels a number rating doesn t do this game justice maybe 8 10 because of the balance problems of the mid game but not in a traditional sense this is a good game this is a special game it is unique and a ton of fun a breathe of fresh air but man it can be frustrating sometimes but that s part of the appeal the only part of the game that i think is outright bad is the randomized starting loadouts for reasons that will become clear not starting the game with water or an analog is just an outright hindrance and manifests as needing to find a source of water asap it s not fun you can probably fix that with a mod relatively trivially but i haven t because i bet one day i ll figure out how to use all the starting potions to my advantage,123.1,247.0,9,Recommended,"July 28, 2021",Noita,Pyrohawk

84825,2021 alright i m apparently 451 5 hrs in played this more than any game whilst having the busiest period of my life and in many ways it helped me get through it all somewhat intact thank you noitathis is a recommendation for those of you who use games therapeutically 450 hrs in this is probably the most useful review i can write this is what noita does for me positives spiralling thoughts calm down escalated thoughts that grim area beyond spiralling thoughts are actually shut down very quicklythis surprised me due to the games unforgiving nature and often surprising and immediate deaths somehow dying in noita seems reasonable even to the most primal parts of you acceptance of death is immediate and even oddly satisfying yes you are right this is how i died and it was fine if you know that acceptance is just not you and you will definitely want to get back at the game you can also do that you can build wands in this game that will be too hard to handle for any cpu i don t have that urge but there s plenty of very nice twitch streamers out there who play this game daily dissecting every little pixels of it and figuring out how to obliterate every pixel your cpu can muster to sputter out lots of updates to the game without destroying the main loop which your brain has been squeezing for dopamine etc both devs and an active mod scene are amazing if you do need to edit your game loop more drastically from time to time to get your brain chemicals going as needed negatives it can get you hookednow you know there s a scale to this and after 450 hrs of exposure i can say i have not once played noita instead of completing urgent or major tasks minor tasks yeah of course skip those play noita noita did prevent me from going to sleep a couple of times but those incidences also coincided with particularly stressful days which might have caused me to avoid sleep in a different way tl drif your therapist has asked you if you ve tried meditation also try noita i stuck with noita as meditation makes me angry,589.4,294.0,39,Recommended,"February 12, 2021",Noita,"OozeMancer

84828,actually one of the greatest games i ve ever played it s incredibly deep rewarding and much more expansive than it seems at first depending on your penchant for punishment and capacity for persistence going in blind could either be a great benefit or a hindrance to your immediate enjoyment of the game for me i tried playing noita a few times without knowing anything about it and kept bouncing off of it noita just seemed like another overly difficult roguelite admittedly one with cool physics and an intriguing modular spellcasting system however a few months ago i caught a youtube video the worst guide to noita that revealed a little more about what s just beneath the surface of noita getting a confirmation that noita had a lot more going on than i initially thought spurred me into giving it another shot it took me 60 hours and 112 deaths before i finally finished a run and now i m in the middle of an adventure to explore some of the more obscure and esoteric elements and mechanics hidden in noita anyways if you re like me and noita didn t initially hook you don t hesitate to spoil a little bit of what the game actually has in store for you it might motivate you to jump back in,87.1,165.0,2,Recommended,June 6,Noita,ElDobleK

84834,so you enjoy roguelike games and decided to give noita a try you begin with a simple wand and 100 hp at the entrance of a cave there are no tutorials to tell you what to do so you just walk in not knowing what awaits you right after you enter the cave you ll see some monsters that don t look too dangerous but once they hit you you ll realize they are indeed very lethal and you might die in a single hit now alert you explore the cave cautiously you see a small spider thinking you can easily best it but as you get closer you see it s not just one spider but five you die instantly once again you start with a simple wand and 100 hp at the entrance of the cave this time you re careful dodging the monsters and killing some as you learn their behaviors you discover new wands potions and interactive items as you descend you see a portal this is your first visit to a holy mountain here you learn about perks wand crafting and thinking about gameplay strategies but as soon as you leave the holy mountain you see a pink potion and consumed by curiosity decide to try it you re turned into a sheep with only 5 hp and quickly destroyed by a shotgunner back to the entrance of the cave with a simple wand and 100 hp as time passes you become a master alchemist you have great wand crafting skills a strong understanding of game mechanics and a mastery of gameplay strategies you explore all the biomes encounter all the enemies defeat mini bosses and finally face the final boss kolmi after a long and challenging battle you emerge victorious feeling proud of your accomplishment you consider yourself a master alchemist yet you don t have all the achievements gods are impressed you wonder how on earth do you get that one time to check guides or youtube but wait is this the game you ve been playing there are alphabet spells a meat realm fungal caverns fungal shifts sky islands parallel worlds the ability to create a black hole the eye riddle the cauldron and many more things you never even imagined this game could hold you realize you ve only been experiencing 10 of the game thinking you had mastered it you were no master alchemist you were no great wandcrafter and you have no idea how this game is played oh well back you go starting yet again with a simple wand and 100 hp at the entrance of the cave,340.4,174.0,19,Recommended,April 19,Noita,"persistentPerfection

84838,2021 about to hit the 220 hour mark figured i would try and write a review noita wand spell torturenoita is a game about a lot of things discovery exploration getting set on fire dousing yourself in toxic sludge experimentation dying to a stealth propane tank getting set on fire dicing yourself with a giant sawblade uncovering the deepest secrets the world has to offer mastering the wandcrafting system to destroy your enemies and accidentally obliterate yourself and finally getting set on fire the world of noita is awash in flammable and explosive materials everything is therefore always on fire in noita and since the whole world is physically simulated this actually alters the environment in real time you will get set on fire a lot but so will your enemies and fire can be used to burn away wooden obstacles it s both a hazard and an opportunity just remember to have a flask of water at all times the game is also awash in magical materials that can be used to great effect on your journey buffing your damage teleporting you making you invisible or turning you into a sheep leaving you helpless as you re shotgunned in the face careful what you step in you will die a lot i have over 500 deaths and only 9 wins but in my over 200 hours playing this game i ve stopped caring about the win condition now the real focus of noita is the world itself the wand and spell system and how you interact with each when i started with this game i was satisfied with a basic chainsaw on trigger spell that let me shred the final boss and get a few wins my fastest run is about 40 minutes not bad still i have a terribly low win ratio but that s okay many of your runs will end quickly but noita is a long game 200 hours in i ve had six hour marathon sessions where i completely lost track of time wandering the world uncovering secrets and collecting wands spells and other treasures as an avid player of open world sandbox games like minecraft terraria and starbound exploring and digging around procedural worlds is like crack to me the first time i cracked open the holy mountain fought a miniboss completely off the main path and obtained the power to dig wherever i please completely changed my noita experience modern roguelike games are all about fast paced action and i m a big fan of those too but noita has done something unique my journey with this game is unlike anything else i ve played and it just gets more compelling the further i go but you will die and death is permanent that s okay though every new run is a fresh slate to build new and exciting spells and hopefully not blow yourself up with them as the steam description says use what you learn in the next run there are spells to unlock as you progress but not nearly as many as say dead cells your main form of progression in noita is just getting better at building wands and getting better at not dying in conclusion don t forget your water flask experiment make mistakes don t sweat it too much when you die you will lose good runs really good ones and it will sting but if this game hooks you like it has me you ll soon be itching to go back to the mountains for more what can i say it s magical,445.1,222.0,28,Recommended,"January 13, 2021",Noita,Seri (small)
84839,2020 early access review i am officially old constantly receiving froward invitations from aarp and wondering why kids keep congregating on my lawn so platformers please i m not that kind of gamer twitch games in general flummox me but full physics in a pixel based world how intriguing is that so i was seduced into trying the game the first thing i found is that there are really just three movement controls up left and right down is there but incidental and it includes ah consuming things on the ground which works but eccchhh yeah okay so the first thing you ll discover is that moving around is easy this is not some platformer where you have to memorize a sequence of moves just to get from one side of the screen to the other no this is the cave of procedural generation and therein lies genius in the game everything you do even walking around has an effect on the area around you shoot things and they fall or tear apart or explode or catch fire or dissolve with acid drop heavy things on something not heavy and you ll crush it put metal in water and it will rust different liquids have different densities every pixel has a platonic nature soil acid snow sand gunpowder grass fungus teleportatium and many others and you can be coated by them or use them to set off effects or even be trapped by unpleasant developments drowning under newly growing ice in a pond is a distinct possibility it s the physics effects on every pixel that make the game so interesting and amusing obviously the game also has enemies for you to die fighting each with their own effects floating acid dudes small fast melee critters fire demons guys with shotguns or other weapons terrain eating speedy worms all sorts of stuff to deal with them you have wands and potions potions to coat yourself with or ward off fire and acid or increase your crits or transform enemies or many other effects you can throw them or kind of shake them up and shoot them nearby say to fill a hole with water to remove pesky fire wands well wands are the weapons of the game wands have varying natures spell slots latency mana stores and recharge times etc there are many different spells and spells can be stacked to produce enhanced effects or to chain different effects together you generally start off with two small sparky spells that fly out and do a little damage in a fairly straight line as you gather spells and wands in game you might add a trail of flaming dust to each shot thus causing fires underneath the flight path or maybe a spell that lets you fire three shots at once there are all kinds of interesting projectiles and effects some quite interesting and unusual some entirely deadly to you as well as your enemies there is an interesting sub game of configuring your wands with new spells especially as enemies get harder to deal with meaningful choices abound so this game is a classic roguelike in nature even though it is not composed of alpha numeric characters everything can kill you including the ground you stand on stuff happens off screen at times which can lead to chain effects that can mess with you you ll quickly find that the game is as much stealth shooter as it is a run and gun one and you constantly have to mind where you are going to avoid the perils of fire acid whiskey and even falling burning beams and gunpowder pits in short this game is entirely accessible to non twitch games with easy controls huge variety impeccable replayability and an environment that wants you dead it s an avalanche of sheer fun highly recommended,310.1,221.0,13,Recommended,"January 18, 2020",Noita,RobearGWJ
84840,2020 this game is exceedingly hard for me to review properly but i m going to take a stab at it firstly i recommended this game because i love this game it has the right amount of challenge can be played at whatever pace you feel like and when you get that itch to go exploring well this game s got that covered too i personally have taken on the challenge of becoming consistent at the game having held the early access world record for most consecutive wins with 11 and i did it by doing only 11 orb runs but know before getting into it that there are some clear downsides to noita especially with the 1 0 release that i would like to speak to first these changes made it very difficult for a casual player to get into the world of noita unfortunately however if you are seeking out a challenge noita is definitely for you my main point of contention is that 1 0 added forced randomized starting loadouts previously they were opt in by way of doing the daily instead of a normal game that sometimes give you different spells and a different flask to work with these cause needless suffering for new players for 3 reasons 1 you can get a primary wand with a single spitter bolt on it this single spitter bolt wand will have low range poor accuracy and poor speed and can leave players vulnerable to enemy attacks even veterans can become overwhelmed if they suddenly find themselves surrounded by enemies but new players are especially susceptible because they won t know what the correct enemy prioritization is resulting in heavy damage or death there are other bad primary wands as well but the spitter bolt is the worst and my hope is that spitter bolt and anything with short range really gets removed from the initial primary wand pool great alternatives are spark bolt bouncing burst summon arrow or magic arrow 2 you can get a secondary wand with no explosives on it while a rain cloud has its use see the next point the ability to get out of potential soft locked situations with an explosion is invaluable for new players and not having an explosive spell to do so hurts new player progression 3 you can get a random flask this is the most inexplicable decision to me because water is exceedingly valuable at all levels of play it can be used to put out fires neutralize toxic sludge make the player not take fire damage while stained with water and kill one of the more challenging first zone enemies the stendari my recommendation is to ditch whatever flask it gives you when you start even if beneficial and replace it immediately with water water can be found to the left of start under the tree you may have to dig and you may not have the tools necessary to do it but sometimes it s free to the right if you re willing to climb the mountain with an appropriate explosive in the wall ie anything but a bomb and find the lake or if you start with the rain cloud wand honestly it is my opinion that nolla should revert this change and make it opt in for the daily only or even enable it as an option for full runs why i find this important enough to bring up first is because there s literally a whole world of things to explore and learn about this game to have to also deal with the frustrations of a randomized and sometimes underwhelming starting loadout players are going to have their hands full tackling every challenge this game throws at it and as you get deeper into the game those challenges grow bigger and more difficult and that is what i love about this game this game pulls no punches you will get shot by the shotgunner repeatedly you will die to enemies with a freeze wand or a nuke wand or machine gun concentrated light wand you will kill yourself experimenting with wand building you will find enemies you have absolutely no idea what they do even after the 50th or 100th time you kill them because darn it that enemy is going to die before you find out what kind of terror it will inflict on you you will be running about panicked or scared because you know you can t deal with that one particular enemy and now you re running headlong into a bunch of other enemies and well game over there s a reason win streaks in this game are hard to come by and that s because the game is hard it makes you stop and think about what you re about to do is going down this hallway without checking above and below a safe bet is there a propane tank lurking in the snow you re about to dig in that you can t see is that underwater chest going to have a thunderstone did i just hear ukko or is that the wind often second guessing yourself and staying as safe as possible is the key to victory in noita if you re a speedrunning type noita has got you covered runs of this game can be as short as 2 minutes and involve absolute chaos tight dodges teleporting blindly into new territory and trying to find that one boss killing wand to finish the game as quickly as possible if you re an exploration type ignore the usual seven zones and explore the world around you find out what s at the bottom of the pit to the right of the lava lake what s outside to the left of the tree or to the right of the mountain journey into the sky or fight your way beneath the temple of the art to see what my lurk there traverse impossibly thick walls on either side of the map and see what might be on the other side fight optional bosses with unique mechanics and rewards discover strange quest items and try to figure out what to do with them learn the secrets of alchemy and be blessed with endless health and wealth if you re a completionist type you ll be interested in what s at the top of the tree pillars of meta progress that grow as you unlock more endings more spells and more challenges i myself plan on doing a ng 28 33 orb run at some point i expect that run to take weeks and to think that one drop of polymorphine can end that run is a scary but exciting prospect that will keep me on my toes the entire time if you re a mad scientist type wand building is where it s at there are so many spells with so many spell combinations in the game that you will be hard pressed to get a win with the same wand twice sure there are repeating themes homing mist wand trigger chainsaw wands speedy bouncing burst wands but in the end you get to craft your own tools of destruction from what you find in the game and that s one of the most rewarding things about this game so overall my recommendation for new players is to expect the game to be challenging and hard if you re going into this blind you are going to die quite possibly hundreds of times before you get a win if this is not your style this game may not be for you but if you re willing to learn everything the game has to offer you will be rewarded with a rich world of mystery worth exploring satisfying wands of mass destruction fulfilling victories against challenging bosses and the thrill of winning the game on your terms that is in between bouts of stepping in polymorphine and getting one shot best of luck noidat,939.3,217.0,3,Recommended,"October 21, 2020",Noita,"roncli

84848,2020 early access review in noita there are a handful of things that are true wands cast spells monsters attack you the world is malleable you are the noita this game hates you it actively mocks your attempts to learn each time you descend into the mountain noita is not hard because enemies are hard to hit it s not hard because it s fast paced noita is hard because it is designed exploit at least one loophole in your fragile human skull if you play meticulously inching along you will be killed if you rush in landing shots on monsters left and right you will still be killed the game asks for a level of wisdom about its own world that you will not have for very long time this game is difficult to learn and almost impossible to master as you collect perks spells wands and items you ll get brief glimpses of what you can become you might even reach a point where you think you re as powerful as you can be but then you ll be back at the entrance for the cave wondering how you ever died as you play and explore the world you may find places and wonder why they are there and where they lead you will go places until you wonder why you are still walking you will be alone in an empty world that does not care about you press on learn all that you can find ways to stay alive to win noita there are certain things you must learn learn to edit wands learn to kill all learn to shape the world learn to be a noita,100.4,150.0,3,Recommended,"September 8, 2020",Noita,FuriQ

84850,some games have a learning curve noita has a learning cliff you ll be hard pressed to find a more unforgiving game you either play for 3 hours and give up because you don t understand a thing or you sacrifice your sanity for a peek behind the curtains as the game puts it the sacrifice of oneself to the pursuit of knowledge is the highest tribute to the gods but when you when you get the god run that would put buddha in his place the world is your playground literally entering parallel worlds for your own advancement nothing can challenge you then enters polymorph then you turn into a flying sheep die and question life if i were to give words of advice gain the knowledge to exploit the game mechanics or it will exploit you the game balance was designed with you needing to break the rules there won t be another game that gives you as much freedom as noita offers for a very long time for the wand building completely unparalleled magic system and no other game even comes close to scratching it genuinely leaves morrowind in the dust it s kinda sad to think that the magic system is so ahead of it s time because i don t want to have to wait 15 years for something similar to pop up,133.1,208.0,12,Recommended,September 2,Noita,"aidan653

84859,2021 i m michael i play great games really poorly twitch tv noita is a game of surprising depth it s dev team nolla games undersell the game as a simple showcase for the game engine they have developed a pixel based physics game in which every pixel is physically simulated my own initial interest in the game was as something that i d anticipated to be a kind of pixel playground with a side interest in magic spells i was very wrong playing noita is a joyous punishment with each comical death you learn hard lessons you are told no rules but given tools and the facilities to learn how to use them on first presentation the game which looks like a funky terraria clone reveals itself to be more of a roguelite with a little dungeoneering thrown in for good measure it s only once you ve died around a hundred times before you re awakened to some of the scale of how wrong you were intitially the procedurally generated levels are new with every rebirth but you come to learn the patterns of the landscape you come to identify the mechanics of the increasingly obnoxious mobs and the quirks of specific spells in combination with each other all of a sudden you re beginning to see that this simple physics based roguelite game is actually a comprehensively punishing game based on precision intricate knowledge of the game mechanics and unflinching desire for more more gold more spells more wands more power after 282 hours i have beaten the game twice i have died upwards of 500 times i refuse to play the game any longer it showed me a side of myself which scared me i had become a man obsessed with discovering the secrets hidden within secrets which nolla games have painstakingly laced into the very fabric of this magical action roguelite i can only give this game the highest of praises it showed me the flaws within myself i was left humbled and defeated by it,720.1,193.0,13,Recommended,"September 17, 2021",Noita,mictheobnoxious

84862,2022 this is not a game to be played by anyone that can t handle the frustration of repeated occasionally nonsensical and always brutal deaths you can be 10 hours into a run which is a pretty insane achievement in itself feel like you re invincible and a single second of inattention or lapse of concentration is all it takes to send you splattering back to square one that being said noita has easily become one of my favourite games of all time on the surface it s a relatively simple game with cool as hell physics and a super fun interesting system of spell and wand building magic that can provide hours of entertainment on its own the aim is to progress downwards through a series of biomes in a manner familiar to most gamers clearing and exploring each area until you reach the end and complete your run this in itself can easily take tens or hundreds of attempts and will feel like a monumental victory the first time you succeed without spoiling too much though this game is deep far deeper and far more expansive than you can possibly imagine upon first playing exploration experimentation careful consideration of everything you witness and pushing the limits of thinking outside of the box are all rewarded richly usually with a swift death and a valuable piece of additional knowledge about this intriguing world if you were to play this blind without ever looking information up online you could spend literally thousands of hours without discovering all that this masterpiece has to offer i don t want to give away anything more but if you enjoy games that are extremely challenging to the point of easily being frustrating endlessly replayable and accept you will likely never truly complete it without mods and outside info then in my opinion noita is the greatest time money value you could possibly ever get from any single player game i ve seen a lot of what s written here may seem like hyperbole and the difficulty opacity of progression will certainly put many people off there are mods that can help you with that but 15 20 30 years from now this is the game that will be stuck in my memory as a truly special experience as well as quite possibly still having me coming back to explore and attempt to fully truly complete,559.6,113.0,1,Recommended,"November 13, 2022",Noita,Wraiyth

84866,2021 this game owes a lot to rogue nethack angband you start out as a weak character and can delve into a dungeon armed with the weakest of weapons and a potion which may or not be helpful rather than rogue s ascii 2d top down dungeon you have a terraria style 2d ant farm crafted in individual pixels the dungeon is structured as procedurally generated layers or biomes in a persistent framework which can be learned there are numerous secrets and mysteries the only way to make progress is to spawn experiment and die spawn experiment and die you ll find new items and start to build a library of spells monsters perks and an understanding of how the world is constructed and how to survive and then time your stay in a particular biome to give you the tools to push on a bit further each level is an engine of chaos and the whole game is an exercise in chaos management monsters fight each other trigger environmental hazards pick up wands and use them potion bottles shatter the liquids cascading down through the level interacting with the terrain vapours rising causing further explosions corrosion or hazards explosive barrels of various types are scattered about some levels feature exposed electrical appliances lava acid strange articulate machinery at every death you kick yourself and or curse the game your early runs will see a hundred or more deaths before reaching the foot of the dungeon later on you will have developed a sixth sense about when to risk grabbing a piece of gold and when to move on you will also have noticed mysteries and oddities in the landscape that beg to be investyigated what happens if i kick this how about if i pour this kind of potion in there what s up there why can i drill that rock if it is a boundary and what lies beyond the craziness of the chaos makes it hard to play on after you have invested 30 minutes into a run only to see it torched because of some monster picking up a deadly wand and destroying itself and you in a screen wide cataclysm or when you ve pushed your luck too far and you die immediately to some avoidable danger when you could have easily gone through the gate and restored your health it is without doubt a great game but pixels are harsh man it s not for everyone and i wonder how long i am going to keep taking the punishment,74.0,140.0,8,Recommended,"March 20, 2021",Noita,The Giant Mimir

84873,2021 first and foremost let s make one thing clear this is a game which creates polarizing opinions you ll either love it unconditionally or hate it completely and there s a simple reason to that know yourself and you ll know whether you ll enjoy the game if you play games to win you will not enjoy the game as with most roguelites but especially so with this one the game is as unfair as they come in a way roguelites are always difficult but most usually you don t have the option to kill yourself with your own weapon and in this game it s one of the biggest causes of mortality does that mean the weapon system is bad no much to the contrary the marketing campaign of the game was that every pixel is simulated and while that s true and impressive i find that the game is as good as it is because of the weapon system weapons are fully customizable and completely broken if you know your way around the wandcrafting in the world you ll find wands which have certain stats and spells the roster of spells is almost excessive so there is a myriad to not say an infinite amount of possible spell combinations which must synergize with the wand too remember that it s a roguelite and suddenly you see that while you have many different options you have to improvise most of the time but that s not bad through improvisation you might find combinations you would never imagine were so powerful but you might accidentally kill yourself in the process the weapon system is not the only thing that is immense finding your way to the final boss of the game is a tough endeavour and often feels like a very long journey you start at the surface and you make your way down across seven biomes before meeting the boss it s long but it s the shortest most basic route you can take what if instead of going down the mines you climb the giant tree you ll find left of your spawn and see what s west or jump to the top of the mountain which gives access to the cave and see what s east want to get more advanced what s up you can go anywhere and if you don t mind the spoilers search for a map on google the seven basic biomes let s call them like that are very small compared to the entire world there s a million things i could say about the game but most you should find yourself whether it be on youtube or after a thousand tries or so the amount of content in this game is ludicrous and the challenges it offers are inhuman it s a very versatile and dynamic game but keep in mind that it s ridiculosly unkind even the rocks want to kill you not for the faint of heart but definitely for those who want a balanced game that s completely broken,150.8,112.0,1,Recommended,"March 31, 2021",Noita,Sir Gordinni

84882,2019 product received for free early access review short version this game is amazing buy it long version noita is a cave exploring adventure with an incredible physics engine the falling everything engine creates a fully destructible world where every explosion could start a chain reaction of immense proportions fire spreads and when it spreads to that pile of gunpowder over there you ll get some wonderful fireworks which just might ignite the coal next to that pool of oil and create an even bigger fire just be careful not to get caught in the flames the interaction of elements fire and liquids like water and oil are beautifully and create a world where everything will fall burn and blow up as it should this creates for some fun gameplay when you try to find innovative ways to kill monsters and find a way forward you fight bad guys with magic you find wands with different spells in your travels each wand has different specs as to how many spells they can cast before recharging etc you can also buy wands and spells in the safe house between each level and there you can also edit your wands and receive special abilities all this means that each game you will use different spells and be buffed with different abilities providing you with different ways to kill your opponents and hopefully survive longer than last time there is a nice variety of enemies that have different ways of killing you and you have to learn the best ways to deal with them of course instead of shooting the baddies you could just light that pile of coal they are standing on on fire and watch them burn or why not drown them in toxic sludge or acid did i mention exploding barrels or just kick a mine cart on them that will work too in noita you will die a lot but you will die laughing most of the time an average game might last for less than 15 minutes but you will happily start a new adventure and try again if you can figure out the archaic language used to name the monsters you might laugh even harder when you get shot by a rynkkyhiisi or are burned to death by a stendari for fans of rogue lite games spelunky ftl etc this game is a true gem and a wonderful addition to the genre and even if you usually aren t a fan of games where you die a lot the wonderful disasters that kill you will help you feel just a little less frustrated and keep you trying after all the next attempt might be the one where you finally get to that hiisi base with the perfect wand for fighting them or not most likely not most likely you will die burning in the fire you started or just get beaten to death by a h mis that you didn t notice because you were busy fighting the group of hiisi on the other side of that burning pile of coal while also being bombed with toxic sludge by a limanuljaska,75.9,181.0,9,Recommended,"September 24, 2019",Noita,"Tapsa

84888,2022 short reviewthe base experience is very fun unforgiving and a good sandbox roguelike technically lite i guess experience beyond that however i find that the game can sort of fall off and become really repetitive convoluted i recommend this game however mainly because i believe that the first few times you realize and explore the world beyond the boundaries the game just changes completely also the large majority of players do not even touch upon the stuff that bothers me so it s unlikely the average player will go far beyond the base experience if you really enjoy uncovering really obscure secrets then this is genuinely the perfect game for you be aware that a lot of the time you re going to die to that is out of your control stuff like a worm breaking into an area and the gods getting angry at you instead for some reason other times you may be even unluckier and some alchemical reaction off screen butterfly effects into something random that ultimately kills you on one occasion i straight up randomly died due to heavy impact despite standing peacefully away from enemies and not seeing anything fall down or hit me going to spoiler some secret quest stuff if you want to figure it out yourself good partsthe spell wand system is incredible it is basically a language that you slowly start to understand while you play and mess around more you will slowly learn how easy it is to become overpowered with just basic spell and or perk combinations there is so so much to explore and understand and it really feels like you are learning something new every single run i really enjoyed the avarice diamond quests in a game about trusting nothing i found some solace in putting the little green guy in the race car and driving all the way to the diamond the feeling of power when you finally do a proper long run is immeasurable you truly and genuinely feel like you have achieved something immense when you finally complete one of the harder longer secrets in the game the game rewards you for breaking it do not feel bad about it even stuff like the heartache hp exploit was kept in and nerfed because the devs liked it despite it being able to bring you over 1k health easily bad weird parts stuff to watch out for too if you reasonably want to achieve something like the completing the sun quest you need to visit a large number of parallel worlds to break the perk reroll machine and achieve all the necessary perks for the incredibly dangerous task obviously you don t need to do this extensive several hour long preparation every single time you want to have a long overpowered run this could be shortened to perhaps an hour if you are just looking to become generally hard to kill instead to be honest this isn t that big of a deal if you re just playing the game without a specific goal but i just find it extremely tedious if i m missing hard to get spells while knowing how easy it is to screw up the progress towards those spells and how you d have to do that all over again mainly because it s not really a challenge it s just kinda like walking window to window until you find a shop selling the thing you want with no real risk present to you at all if you are reasonably cautious the hints for things are semi impossible to figure out on your own unless you have an immense amount of dedication please use the wiki unless finding obscure secrets is your thing anything you don t know or understand has the potential to just end your run instantly and there are way too many things to know too many secrets and too many things you can only learn after it happens for example one boss requires a specific item to killed properly so you bring it with you and throw it on the floor to start attacking the boss while it s vulnerable suddenly the boss just destroys the item mid fight because you placed it too close got unlucky this item only consistently spawns in one specific spot in the entire world if you did not know this beforehand you would have to explore the rest of the world until you find that specific item again as a random chest drop and then challenge the boss again while being a bit more careful this ties in to what i believe to be the biggest issue of this game it doesn t really feel like a game at times instead it feels like some weird social experiment i assume this is reminiscent of older games where players collectively work together to uncover the secrets except the scale is far larger because of player hosted wikis and etc it just kinda feels like a waste though the game is rated overwhelmingly positive yet only 10 of players beat the game and 0 2 of players have uncovered all the spells enemies which means they personally witnessed a majority of the secrets why is the game hiding so much more cool content outside of the main game instead of making it part of the main game this is their design choice and respect is to be had for the level of detail put in the world and its secrets but a lot of this stuff is convoluted and it feels like it would have been a lot more enjoyable fulfilling for the individual player if we didn t have to scan the wiki to find out the secrets lore in a reasonable amount of time the noita discord probably went ham on the secrets though another thing to note is that parallel worlds dramatically increases the size of your save file and make it increasingly unstable especially when you are searching for spells to complete your progress for example i visited over a hundred parallel worlds using a wand built for this purpose so i didn t walk there trying to find a single spell for 4 5 hours and my save file increased to 1 2gb in size i did not find the spell i later found out it was bugged and i had to manually fix the issue to get the spell in a new game a prior run simply to get reasonably overpowered got my save file to around 500mb in size i did not notice any issues with the world loading until i hit over 1gb on the other hand the game itself can crash break quite easily i ve had all holy mountains disappear from the world the pyramid disappeared too idk and other times the background images disappeared too like the interiors of cabins the entrance cave etc during these longer runs it is a bit odd how visiting these places is considered mandatory for more difficult content by the community but the game itself cannot really handle it sometimes another time i placed some items in a specific spot in the desert in preparation for a quest only to come back and see the items completely gone no idea what happened there just be prepared to make saves restart the game often because it is completely possible something can just break randomly and ruin your run i probably would not have been so annoyed with my runs if it weren t for that also if you want to use really powerful wands please at least invest in a good pc i have a decent pc but the game will sometimes just turn into a stop motion animation when several of my perks domino effect each other 10 times a second,101.0,101.0,7,Recommended,"September 10, 2022",Noita,"godsblade

84897,2022 this game will kill you this isn t i feel like a god but there is always a bigger fish this game will just kill you i have yet to beat one run i have had to legitimately research this game in order to play it to the minimal extent i can this game presents itself as almost nothing if you think its a fun wand builder you re wrong this game is death and if you don t like a game that just kills you because it said you where dead don t buy it the difficulty isn t imposed in a way that makes you say oh i see why i died it instead just randomly explodes you and you are left trying to figure out what just happened can you prevent it maybe some things you just can t if an enemy takes you by surprise you re dead i don t normally enjoy this philosophy in game balance players are usually more reactionary when it comes to rouges you see what you get then you adapt your play style to the perks or weapons you have not in noita you only have the pleasure of playing the way you want once you bend this game to your will though the use of bugs which at this point are just unintended features you need to exploit ever vein you find be so observant around every area and search every area for anything that might be useful add to that reaction times to dodge and understand each situation noita has caught me slacking this game is unapologetic this game is hard this game plays dirty and for that i thank it noita has taught me how to be proactive in a game it has taught me to prepare for each situation it will throw at me i have had to research spells view general maps of how the worlds spawn and learn an entire chemistry table just to know what i am doing in this game finally i have prepared for everything now i just need to react and execute something which i have still yet to do thank you noita you have shown me what goes into getting good at a game i no longer find myself passively gaining knowledge and instead now evaluate each death if something kills me unexpectedly i look into what that thing is exactly noita has taught me how i gain knowledge of games now i just need to get good enough to beat the final boss one final thank you noita don t play this game learn this game it gets my recommendation just don t expect to have fun with the first few days,63.2,171.0,17,Recommended,"December 13, 2022",Noita,"stik555

84898,2021 it s the sort of a game where you get told how to move your character and that s it for tutorialit s a rogue like game but where you can t upgrade different things in between the runs like in rogue legacy unlocking new classes or buffs or new starting items like in isaac no it s a game where you die you lose everything the only thing you ve earnt is a bit more knowledge about the game it s a game where you walk up to an empty shrine where you re supposed to find a wand think to yourself aw man the heck some shrines spawn empty and then outta nowhere a giant saw disc flies into you butchering you for more than half of your hpafter what you learn that enemies may equip your weapons if they find them first it s the game where you find out that some enemies bleed lava instead of blood by dying to a corpse which suddenly started acting like a beautiful lava fountain sprinking orange liquid of death and pain everywhere around itit s the sort of a game where you learn that some enemies explode after most likely dying to them cause you didn t see them shoot stuff so you let them come too close it s the sort of a game where where you can spend over 50 hours in it start a new game thinking that well damn i spend so much time in this stuff surely i won t die like a dumbass cause of a silly mistake forgetting that the dungeon might spawn one of the toughest flying monsters in game on the first floor of the dungeon just because or perphaps a shotgunner who d die in 1 shot from your magic wand broke a polymorph potion while shooting at another enemy transformed into a magical worm monster from the last stage of the game and spooked the hell out of you literally and of course we can t forget about you simply walking into the dungeon and seeing you have angered the gods wondering what the heck does that meanand then getting slaughtered like a pig in a butcher house by a spooky flying skeleton with a magical shield which repels all your projectiles and who can spam slightly homing magical fireballs at the same time cause game spawned worms and they decided to ignore the worm crystal and ruin the holy mountain it s a game where you spawnand sometimessomething already explodes in the mines underneath youit s a game where you can complete a normal run in around 16 first hours of the gamethen remember that you can eat enemy s corpsesand decide bruh screw that boss for almost killing me i ll show it that i eat such creatures for breakfast literally i ain t going into no final portals till i devour its whole corpse and then you learn that you can explode by overeating ruin your best run so far and fail to reach the final boss in the next 20 hoursit s a game where you can get victory achievement after spending 70 hours in it just like i did and yet ya d be proud of it 11 10 not enough deaths cause of shooting lightning into an enemy and hitting liquid that flew from above at that moment making it explode in your own ass insteadthe game is pretty fun and enjoyable albeit it takes a bit of time to get into it and learn the mechanics however once you get into it you can truly enjoy them due to various perk combinations or wand tinkering letting you put the spells you yourself want to see onto the best wand you can find i for one truly enjoy the beauty of perks making dead enemies turn into friendly rats and mushroom kamikazesgives you a tiny weenie bit of that necromancer feelingwhich is exploitable as well since the creatures you summon this way can spawn more creatures if you kill them yourself before enemies get them can t say that this game is without cons however which are pretty much what i ve mentioned above for me the game may decide that you are having too much of a blast and spawn almost unkillable enemies at the start due to weird algorythm enemies may steal wands from shrines and then you could just fail to find them cause they d die somewhere near sand or lava and drop it into themor they may simply annihilate you cause duh you have a starting wand and they get some ultra harry potter stuff the game plays itself as well especially with perks for more hatred between enemies and sometimes it gets angry at you for not restarting the run after hearing some quakes since worms can eat through terrainand the most important con of all for some people perphapseven after reading the wiki and guides i still don t get what some things do still i highly recommend this game if you re a fan of random dungeon generation and explosions,100.3,133.0,15,Recommended,"June 13, 2021",Noita,Mr. Friend Skeleto

84905,2019 early access review don t get me wrong noita isn t a bad game which is the exact reason why i can t give it a negative review we just have to get few things straight this game is ridiculously hard and unforgiving after the first two caves you will need good spells perks and wands to succeed if you don t you will most likely die the enemies become so tough that simple 3 5 dmg spells just don t cut it lets talk about the enemies they have pinpoint accuracy later on the amount of them is just cruel and the damage is insane don t have a shield of some kind too bad they will rip you a new one they don t care if you are in a safe zone also called the holy mountain or not sometimes enemies will straight up bust into the safe room or they will form an army under the exit there are some mini bosses in the game whom will spawn minions to fight with them the bad thing is that there can be multiple of them in one cave and they spawn more minions every time you damage them one of my playthroughs ended because there was two mini bosses waiting for me when i jumped out of the safe room i managed to defeat the first two but not 30 seconds later third surprised me from behind a corner and shot me these situations don t feel too fair if you ask me perhaps i should have played better who knows but it s too late for that now also on the topic of shields the game is really rng heavy one thing you have to get used to is that most of your runs will end because r n jesus wasn t on your side maybe you didn t find any good wands or the shop didn t have anything worthwhile to use doesn t matter you can almost give up if you don t have anything when you get to cave three i m not suggesting that the devs should give us the best wands and perks right away what i mean is that the game should at least give you some kind of a chance instead of just screwing your sweet b tthole the first opportunity it gets so what do i think of noita i think it needs some balancing here and there the amount of mini bosses should be limited and the enemy zerging at the start of a cave should be stopped there is a reason why the game is in early access but as i stated at the beginning in my opinion the game is good there is so much more to do instead of the first cave you spawn in front of the world on the surface is filled with places to explore should you buy this game sure why not if you like hella challenge oh yeah i got a little hint for you be careful when you test new spells you are not familiar with and pay attention to the wands and how they function they can cost you your life,376.1,109.0,3,Recommended,"September 27, 2019",Noita,JustSay
84906,best to talk about the most important pain point first this game is absurdly hard if you are prone to anger when gaming i would honestly advise not to play noita i m not talking about a soulslike level of difficulty here but of something that approaches closely but never crosses the border of being unplayable there are a lot of ways to die in noita and most of them will hint at errors you made when playing finishing a several hours long run on this note is a very humbling experience and it s definitely something you want to be aware of before starting the game as you re likely to live that a lot completing your first run will probably take tens of hours careful reflection a lot of learning about the game s mechanics and a good amount of luck that said noita is absurdly good the simulation aspect of the game honestly feels impossible to compare to anything else every pixel of the game is simulated and various elements potions materials some enemies as well interact with each other folliwing alchemical principles the spell casting wand making system is impressive it takes a lot of time to understand how to properly use it and what you are doing exactly but its combination possibilities feel endless once you do due to the very high difficulty level each lesson you understand on the way the game functions the procedural generation the effect of the different potions and the best ways to use them the strenghts and weaknesses of the perks and the sequence breaks you can do with various elements among other topics feels incredibly rewarding noita is one of the best games i ever played if you feel you might enjoy this kind of gameplay experience then don t hesitate to give it a try it s not made for everyone but it s an absolute gem,309.5,98.0,1,Recommended,June 9,Noita,Rak
84907,2020 early access review okay time to finally review this i ve waited quite awhile and for good reason my opinion of the game sort of jumped back and forth alot for quite awhile sometimes i loved it other times i hated it no way i could write a review when i wasnt even quite sure how i felt about it noita is amazing in alot of ways but it does some really bizarre things that could really push some players away or that just make it really hard to get to that point where it clicks for you i have occaisionally referred to noita as the next spelunky when talking about it with people yeah in alot of ways the gameplay isnt really similar other than the fact that it s a platformer and you go downwards through a dungeon but what i really mean is the wild emergent gameplay spelunky is famous for being hilarious due to the bonkers things that might happen in the third zone for instance a yeti across the level might throw a rock which hits a ufo dude which plummets to the ground and then explodes sending a landmine flying which then hits you in the head stunning you and then it lands next to you on the ground and explodes it does stuff like this often there are so many hilarious death compilation videos of it on youtube the emergent elements of the game add to it in so many ways and they ensure that it s constantly funny instead of frustrating noita is alot like that for the most part the falling everything engine creates a world where every little particle can interact with every other conceivable thing and physics takes over from there heavy wooden beams liquids of all sorts fire explosive barrels giant tentacle monsters bloody stupid worm things all these things and so many more interact in ways that will constantly surprise you you ll die alot but boy will it be funny mostly and everything about the gameplay works with this you can use all these elements against your foes or against yourself if you re not careful on top of that you can build wands combining a bazillion different spell components in all sorts of ways to create tons of wild effects you have alot of freedom in how you go about doing this however like anything else in the game you gotta be careful with it lest you simply blow your own face off with some sort of boomerang deathray wands have lots of different stats as well and there are all sorts of perks for you to use to build your character in addition noita is stuffed full of secrets i cant remember the last time i saw so many in one game you start with the dungeon of course like in spelunky but it doesnt take too long before you ll find a way to go over that mountain or right through it and find yourself in the gigantic overworld that giant dungeon it s pretty darned small compared to what s out there there is so much to do noita is a big game and there are so many ways to approach it so with all that positive stuff why did i have such a love hate view of it well for every amazing thing noita does it then does something that can kinda ruin the fun for some players for example that wand editing pretty great and all but you can only do it inside of the temples between each dungeon floor and you cant really test those wands in there because if you damage the temple the gods get angry and you re in big trouble so you have to design your wand get your perk leave the temple and that s pretty much a one way deal and then if your wand experiment turns out to be bad well tough you cant do anything about it until the next temple this means that despite all that design potential the game heavily discourages players from experimenting because the slightest misstep in wand design could either leave you stuck with something pathetic that cant kill anything we ll get to that or something hyper dangerous that kills you when you try to use it and once you re dead well it s a looooooooong trip back to where you were speaking of not being able to kill anything ever played enter the gungeon you know how in the game enemy hp bloating just keeps making things take longer and longer to kill but without actually increasing the difficulty of said enemies noita grabs that concept and takes it up to 11 enemies have waaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much hp outside of the first couple of areas in terms of getting anywhere in the game one thing and only one thing matters sheer dps the game has all sorts of cool utility spells and such but they re irrelevant in the face of that monstrously bloated hp of pretty much every foe i ve had so many runs that i havent finished not because i got asploded but because i got bored and simply quit because i just couldnt find the things needed to do enough damage so that each fight didnt take 20 eternities of course you can also bypass alot of things by digging through the levels but that s almost entirely dependant on finding the extremely specific spell that can do that black hole which is a limited use spell by the way note that this spell is required to do most of the game s big secrets digging is really important yeah there s bombs but they cant damage dense materials in addition the game seems to place extreme importance on certain perks it often seems absolutely necessary for you to have at least 2 or 3 of the important ones while some other ones are mostly useless there s a bit too much rng here and too much potential for just a couple of them to totally break the game s challenge and then there s the secrets hoboy look i get what they re going for here but you ll find that many of them require a guide how anyone figured some of them out in the first place is beyond me want a good example look up videos on the game s hidden alchemy mechanic on youtube see how it works and you ll see what i mean many secrets are super cryptic and if there s any real clues anywhere as to those i ve never seen them while others are quite easy to find simply requiring you to go in their general direction and overall there s just too much dependance on rng you need the right spells the right perks the right everything and if the game doesnt give them to you well that s a road to frustration i say this as someone who has beaten the game numerous times and gotten multiple endings and some of the tougher secrets fortunately it s fully moddable with workshop support you can completely customize your experience so that does help alot dont like the whole angering the gods thing get a mod that turns it off want even more crazy content yep modders have you covered noita is a game that can be spectacular hilarious frustrating and bloody stupid all at the same time a game of incredible potential yet one that might have you throwing your monitor out the window in sheer frustration i strongly suggest watching some playthroughs on youtube before buying so you get more of an idea of what it s really like and whether or not you would like it this is one of those games where just looking at reviews doesnt quite cut it but if it does click with you you re going to keep coming back to it for a long time to come,60.6,75.0,3,Recommended,"March 4, 2020",Noita,"Misery

84915,2021 things you are expected to see upon immediately playing wands are initially un creative and simple monsters are simple and un creative the world is very linear high damage but low health limited wand creativityhowever the more you explore new spells and wands can be discovered monsters variety grows the further you explore especially off your intended route the world is infinite in all directions the limit is your computer resources there are ways to reduce damage evade negate and block damage then there are ways to increase your health if you play long enough you ll find a perk that will let you modify your wands anywhere additionally there are secrets and the developers have made these secrets very cryptic their are symbols tablets and books littered throughout the world there are strange interactions with mixing chemicals or eating specific things it s like layers of interwoven secrets i bet many of the people that have down rated noita probably never found the pyramid past the giant skull this is a game designed to reward explorers although a lot of the reviews say that your are bound to rng luck and you ll only survive if your lucky that is only true if you let rng control your luck there are some guaranteed combinations and all that s required of you is to use the knowledge you build through playing there are even a mod someone has made that let you experiment and learn wand combinations to help you learn these seemly secret interactions the most common thing that kills me in this game is my own greed,604.3,102.0,1,Recommended,"August 24, 2021",Noita,CATDesign

84925,2020 early access review imagine playing spelunky but on levels that follow the same rules as worms its incredible when you get a good wand and perk combo and you can delve deeeeeeep into the game its really exciting i have not yet come close to finishing the game but i can tell that it is oozing with secrets whats in the big pyramid what is going on with all the eggs what is down the dark passage that you can t seem to light up i need to know,208.6,112.0,2,Recommended,"July 25, 2020",Noita,rokin
84926,2020 noita is a wonderful game implementing lots of different spells magic alchemy and things for you to explore and figure out to your heart s content there s workshop and despite my hours i ve yet to find everything in the base game so far even in its current state it offers plenty to do by means of exploration and experimentation it s quite literally a magic sandbox from casting magic missiles to nuclear eggs the progression is incredibly satisfying but there are still shortcomings while i adore and do love the game i do think that it lacks actual purpose to why you should interact with the simulated particles sure i can set wood on fire create concrete concoct and combine liquids kick boxes and pour freezing liquids over enemies but there s ironically not much incentive to in the beginning you aren t given much in the way of actually doing this either but rather than spending 5 minutes setting up a trap or somehow breaking a part of the ceiling to kill an enemy i might as well use the same spells to kill them it feels like a novelty even if a welcome one and a much likelier way for you to die the first stage level in the cave is the worst of this narrow passages that offer nothing in the means of creatively killing an enemy good luck finding more than four ways to kill an enemy when you could just as easily shoot a spell at them and kill them under five seconds similarly it lacks actual incentive to properly explore there s purpose in general exploration but proper cave diving exploration feels purposeless i can spend upwards from 10 to 30 minutes on the first stage alone if i want to pick up all of the maximum health increases but for all i know none might spawn at all and i ve just wasted 30 minutes for nothing i have no way of telling if there are more health pickups chests wands potions or secrets on the first stage nor do i know if there s more i should be looking around for elsewhere personally i find this is a big problem given that you don t really need to do all of this either hell just skip everything and always go deeper until you find the portal you end up beating the primary final boss in less than 10 minutes sure that s definitely not where the game ends and there s a lot left to explore however by removing the redundancies of guessing whether or not i should explore more find more wands pick up more health accumulate more gold you effectively cut out most of the exploration and reason to bother with any of the levels stages maybe being my last problem i think the game is completely unfair in some parts dying to crushing yourself under a roof is fine suffocating in all of the water you summoned is fine nuking yourself is fine and so is summoning an army of companions that turn on you those are things you need to learn the mechanics of and can develop skill in not making the same mistake you can not get better at being polymorphed though you can not get better at being stun locked and you sure as hell can t get better at not being one shot i ve had countless amounts of deaths caused by my own mistakes but there are plenty more where things killed me which were completely out of my control i have been punted like a golf ball between enemies kept elevated and completely unable to move until i died a good ten seconds of being able to do nothing as a two hour long run is thrown in the bin i ve been polymorphed with my 900 health reduced to 10 by a fungal wizard bleeding and was easily one shot by any enemy in the vicinity with such little movement speed i may as well be serving my head on a silver platter i ve been blown up by some random enemy outside of my screen picking up a wand with a nuke on it i ve been killed by a ghost the one that is immune to all damage except the two lights spell in the whole game that phased into the safe room from the temple level i ve been killed by the witch ghost spawning on the first stage with 400 health and kicking me to death i ve been killed by the lightning ghost in the tower that stun locked me every time i tried running away or used any kind of spell the list goes on but you get the point it s that which makes me actually regret having spent multiple hours on a single run to have it reduced to nothing by something i couldn t use skill to avoid or improve at i write this review and still recommend it even having just come back from a 5 hour long run in which i was polymorphed and killed in under a second by a fungal wizard again to address some things i do realise this is a roguelike roguelite game however that doesn t mean that it s particularly fun to lose runs to things outside of your control in a game that doesn t use rpg esque mechanics i d expect to die from missing a single hit 30 times because of my low stats in something like tome or dcss but not an action roguelike roguelite such as noita where your aim is determined by skill and so is movement or your ability to dodge when it comes to the perks that give you a radar more like a sensor for treasure and wands those are also completely random and are null in the beginning since you start out with no perks suggested improvements to things like this is to for one add more ways to avoid being one shot or polymorphed if i m given opportunity to grab a polymorph resistance perk or a potion that grants immunity to potion effects suddenly that becomes much more focused on exploration prepping and not dying to something out of my control maybe instead of being juggled like a volleyball or being punted like a golf ball to my untimely death give me possibility to avoid this using an item or a skill somehow additionally why not provide incentive to using simulated particles by allowing them to do things like this why don t i have a spell that can create a temporary wall to block shots redirect fluids or cleanse me of debuffs i think inspiration can very easily be taken from magicka and how it handled resistances despite its rock paper scissors formula it makes sense to not be polymorphed when you re already set on fire or maybe you aren t knocked around when you re doused in sticky slime a liquid that has no purpose in its current state other than to provide inconvenience maybe it can give you electric immunity or physical resistance if it s like rubber to quickly add to this why does poison poison me when i ve not ingested it toxic sludge makes sense poison doesn t maybe it should be a liquid that increases damage from all sources instead but it s whatever in a game about magic despite all of this i do still recommend the game yes really it s lots of fun but i d warn you to expect a lot of frustration when it comes to things out of your control if you feel attached to runs like that channel your inner nihilism and realise that your resistance and perseverance against death is futile and i m sure you ll enjoy this much more than i did after losing my 5 hour long run,93.3,74.0,0,Recommended,"May 14, 2020",Noita,Tim

84942,2021 imagine if spelunky instead of ending on level 7 99 actually continued until 30 5 with a bunch more bosses with hundreds of different items and modifiers and perks and if you figure out the trick you could pickaxe between the levels revisit them dive under olmec s lair past the lava wind your way back up through the intermission screen and use your jetpack to finally hop that cliff off to the side of the intro screen because there s a whole other game over there now noita invites you to break the game mechanics even encourages it and hides the bulk of its content behind these opaque goals that aren t made evident only discovered out of your pure curiosity of seeing what lies over the horizon i beat the main boss after 50 hours but there is 80 more left for me to discover i try not to read the spoilers in the wiki but apparently there s an entire alchemy system that i ve never discovered for starters there s hundreds of different spells and modifiers and perks they combine in different ways that will kill you as easily as the enemy sometimes the game gives you a wand with a spell or configuration you ve never seen before and it s a trap it spawns an explosion right in your face or electrocutes you or opens a portal to the tentacle realm and beats you senseless you ded next time read the spell descriptions more carefully but take those wands to the intermission stages the refuge between the levels and you get a chance to reprogram your wands take the spells from wand 1 combine them with some modifiers from wand 2 and stick them on a wand 3 with a huge mana pool and rapid fire capabilities create all new spells of mass destruction and as you learn the mechanics over an excrutiatigly long time spells and perks that initially seem worthless become tremendously powerful when combined with others for example a spell to surround yourself in clouds of whiskey is worthless but wait what if you modify it so that the whiskey cloud spawns at the end of a short range projectile and what if we attach a fire trail to the projectile and cause it to move in spiral pattern now you have a remotely detonated fire cloud that spins around the map widly setting everything on fire including yourself then you remember you once saw a perk that gave you fire immunity aha spotting those amazing absolutely game breaking synergies is what keeps you retrying death after death another example i found a spell modifier that causes projectiles to spawn more copies of itself so if i shot a fireball off to the left it would spray more fireballs as it soared across the screen nice instead of the obvious application i applied the spawning modifier to a tnt crate tnt crates just kind of plop out of your wand and sit there they don t despawn after impacting a wall therefore combined with this modifier they just keep spawning more copies of themselves infinitely filling up the level with dynamite like a virus this wasn t an obvious combination at first but it absolutely deletes an entire level and anything contained within it drop a crate out of the entrance hatch wait 30 seconds and drop a match the cpu pegs at 100 for a moment you deal 500 000 explosive damage to anything below it s a world ender also i blew myself up restart next time i ll modify it so it safely shoots crates from a projectile and add tentacles for good measure every time you die your carefully engineered wands are thrown into a graveyard some data file tucked away in the game s folder the next time you play through there s a chance that your ghost will spawn wielding one of them it s a mixed bag on one hand you get an opportunity to reclaim a favorite wand on the other hand your ghost is using it against you i did eventually run into my world ender wand again and barely managed to get it off my ghost before everything went up in smoke but there s been plenty of other times i ve run into a ghost of a past run and recognized all too well the wand they were wielding noita is fun not everyone will like noita it s pretty unforgiving and even flat out unfair at times the first level becomes a chore you can rush through it the really interesting spells don t start in until snowland anyway enemies will snipe you from some darkened corner of the screen enemies will steal wands from their pedestals and use them against you the game will hand you a wand sabotaged to blow your face off a worm will anger the shopkeeper out of your control before you have any weapons capable of surviving the encounter and you will end many promising runs by building weapons that are too simply too powerful and dangerous to exist in this world you don t really start to feel like you have a handle on spellcrafting until dozens of hours in and many players will rightfully give up before then but each run i see new spells or see new things and the hope that next run i ll finally get a chance to try out a build i ve been working up in my mind keeps me coming

84957,2021 easily one of the best if not the best game to be released officially in 2020 noita makes the player suffer horrifically at first to the point where it feels like you ll never grasp how anyone makes it past the hiisi base however perseverance is it s own reward and after about fifty or so grueling hours of agony you ll begin to realize that you ve been doing it wrong noita affords the player a great deal of agency no matter what rng deals them it just comes down to learning how to use it properly you can spend hours tinkering with wands to try to find the perfect combo or just something that will let you live to the next level in the hopes of finding a better combo or spell greed is often the downfall of most players as they try to push beyond common sense and then die when they should have moved on once you start to grasp these concepts a lot of the difficulty melts away and most deaths can be chalked up to some genuine bad luck or a split second decision that went the wrong way for people who love to suffer and enjoy pressing on and beating the odds when the game tries to thwart them at every angle there s no more rewarding a game than noita and you never forget your first win,250.0,91.0,1,Recommended,"May 10, 2021",Noita,"Tweed

84962,2019 there s no way i ll be able to put into exact words how great noita is for me as it s just too spectacular to express over the internet but i ll try my very best i ve promised myself that i ll only write this review once i completed the game and after 90 hrs of hard work and dumb luck i ve finally done it noita is a pixel based rogue lite game and as a fan of similar games such as danball s physics simulation game enter the gungeon there ll be a slight bias in my review like saying how this game is a huge plus in my book the amount of different runs you can have is endless as the maps the enemies the perks the wands and even its corresponding spells are all randomly generated every round so the replayability of this game is insanely high almost infinite so you ll never find yourself bored i really appreciate every single detail of noita as every particle can mean a difference between life and death as there s alot of pixels that can kill you fire electricity acid lava poison and freezing vapour liquid so you ll be on your toes at every single second as the world around you changes that s another thing that i like about the game is that the world feels alive and you feel small knowing the world doesn t only revolve around you and there could be events happening around the map without your knowledge there was once an enemy got their hands on a wand that uses nukes and you could imagine my surprise when i jumped into a half destroyed map and even in the holy mountain you teleport to after you reached the end of the level can have threats such as the angry gods worms tunneling to your very spot or teleporting enemies you are never safe unless you press esc haha about the environment i really appreciate the randomly generated areas that could spawn in the map such as large containers containing helpful dangerous liquids bars cranes traps snowmans and structures that contain treasure in em so i hope future updates will see more of them i especially love the broken pipes in the frozen depths that emits flammable gas it really adds to the environment i also enjoy the background models as they do not obstruct your path but react to the environment around them such as ladders or plants that burns melts and explodes it really adds more to the experience and pleases me to no end the environment is also handy in turning the game around especially in the frozen depths where the enemies are killer more about that in the next para but with the abundance of ice growing around the map you are able to make use of them to crush the enemy with ease as they are very vulnerable to the environment so use that to your advantage to address the difficulty barrier of this game especially from the third level and onwards i think it is fine the way it is the hard part usually involve runs where all the odds are against you but as i play more and more i start to find the later levels manageable as you gradually come to adapt to the difficulty and figure out strategies to beat it without having powerful wands like using the environment to your advantage making use of bombs to fend off the enemies or perks such as glass cannon to aid you though for casual players this may be a hindrance to their gameplay so i suggest adding a mod that either reduce the hp or dmg of enemies so as to improve their experience and maybe a sandbox where they can play around with spells as this game could use a larger community i do understand that there are those who like to play games leisurely so i think this would be a good addition to the game to appeal to more folks but those who say deaths feel unfair probably has not played it long enough to understand the game mechanics and use it to their advantage and hence will suffer more than those who played it for longer as every death is a learning experience and you ll improve by avoiding past mistakes i also think the despawn time of the gold as good as it is as it makes the players decide whether they should risk their live to get the gold or not so it adds to the thrill plus every little detail of this game is amazing and to show you how great it is i ll list a few of my favourites ability to kick individual particles not a major thing but i like this little attention to detail enemies being able to pick up wands and use it against you faction kind of system in game as enemies are also hostile to each other such as the hatred towards rats by every enemy background models reacting to the environment through burning melting and exploding particles can react together to form compounds such as when lava and water mix with each other or health antidotes through the right concoction smart ai they can always find a way to get to you even if you re trying to hide huge map with different environments from frozen depths to the desert easter eggs around the maps scrolls and structures you can find off the regular map items and bodies sink into ice and coal this could make for some dumb deaths as they can hide bombs too and now to the only flaw of the game individuals pixels should have a weight to it so when it does not exceed the limit like 5 pixels then it ll fall as many small pixels around the map after explosions or water reacting with lava can be unsightly and hinder combat as they can deflect your shots and kill you just because you didn t notice that one tiny pixel there but that s not too say i don t like pixels it s just take it has to be taken down a notch and exclude pixels which are invisible to the naked eye and really disrupt combat all in all

84968,2021 when i first heard of noita i kinda dismissed it as a terraria clone with some cool physics stuff what i got when i looked under the cover was one of the deepest and endlessly replayable gaming experiences i ve ever had of course the physics stuff is a big part of the noita experience but i guess i d describe noita more like an alchemical rpg with permadeath i m hesistant to call it a roguelike because i feel like that term is a bit reductive and doesn t really sum up the gameplay loop of noita in a satisfying way to me forgive the comparison but noita has a darksouls esque crypticness to it you re thrown into a vast 2d open world with semi procedural environments loaded with secrets the obvious path is to go into the dungeon and keep going deeper until you reach the final boss but there are so many secret objectives secret locations secret bosses and secret endings to be found if you go off the beaten path which the game encourages you to do one of the biggest features that isn t publcized enough is this game has an incredibly deep wand and spell crafting system every wand you pick up has different stats that determine how spells are cast and how fast and regularly they are cast in safe zones you have the ability to tinker with wands by removing and adding spells from the wand s slots which all interact in a way that s almost reminiscent of coding more than crafting this comes from the minds of baba is you and as you might expect you can create absolutely insane combinations of spells that can come out in an infinite number of ways by the endgame you ll have a rapidfire wand that conjures rapidfire lightning bolts that jump from enemy to enemy and freeze them or a wand that summons goats that launch nukes that home on enemies it s really insane what s possible in this game it makes every playthrough exciting and unique the game encourages you to find ways to break it something that is really emblematic of noita s design is the fact that the game s saferooms you find the in dungeon typically close off when you leave them but if you have certain spells you can dig through the walls of the saferoom and make a tunnel to allow you to come back whenever you want this isn t an exploit because when you do the game punishes you by summoning a powerful messenger of the gods to stop your exploits it lets players control the way they want to play while presenting interesting risks to the potential rewards of breaking the typical flow of the game this is all just scratching the surface though this game is deceptively massive and i feel like i m going to be playing it for a long time and that s before even getting into the huge number of mods what a fantastic game unlike anything i ve ever really played before also btw there s a pseudo multiplayer mod that s really fun to play with friends check out noita together,176.8,72.0,3,Recommended,"May 30, 2021",Noita,Sophilautia

84977,2021 noita is essentially for a particular set of players some people who play this game won t enjoy it i ve seen that happen particularly with streamers who like to play the no backseating way the game while not necessarily requiring you to search up information in order to perform some of the various side objectives or even to understand wand crafting for that matter does heavily require you to spend a considerable amount of time to fully comprehend the deep functions of much of the world the enemies the secrets the spells the wands the items even the bosses and when i say considerable i mean tens if not hundreds of hours of time spent even getting to that point requires a great degree of patience and persistence as ultimately the game is also random and a hiisi enemy could end up picking up a nuke wand killing you instantly i think that s where the greatest divide lies there is a mod on the workshop that allows the player to go through a series of basic and progressively complex wand spell puzzles and this is a concept that i greatly would have liked to seen in the base game but due to this being the last major update i doubt that will ever be the case no form of greater tutorial or help it could be deliberate but really at the end of the day this decision much like the majority of the game is very very obtuse it s jarring to a portion of players and it always will be especially for those that expect a true rogue lite experience i ve met people who think this is the greatest game they ve ever played and i ve met people who simply couldn t get into it it s a divisive project at heart and further on i don t think that will change maybe with noita 2 it will if you go into this don t expect hand holding but also don t let that hold you back exploit the world break it create a tool of destruction the likes of which the world has never known think of it mathematically think of ways to survive use the practice mode i guess though it s pretty out of context for new players i love the game i really do but i m not going to sit back and say everything about it is pitch perfect i m not even going to tell you that if you can climb the slope of early play that there s going to be a rainbow on the other side but i personally do enjoy it i enjoy a lot of the depth of the experience and i enjoy how crazy things can get whilst also making you come back to reality on your fragility every now and then noita while not being my favorite game of all time is a game i will never forget,480.4,60.0,1,Recommended,"April 1, 2021",Noita,"Ambigant

84978,2023 noita is one of the best games i ve ever played at its core noita is a roguelite with falling sand style physics simulation you randomly acquire spells and put them together in wands with random stats while managing your health gold and inventory space to accumulate strength the wand building is deep and satisfying in a way beyond most other games i ve ever played spells have not just different damage speed and elemental effects but also statistical alterations and complex hidden interactions and these interactions lead to depth of play that never seems to stop growing if that sounds overwhelming don t worry as it simply gives you power from knowledge and many different ways to achieve your goals you can make an all powerful death wand with 26 spells if you want or you can use just 5 7 pieces for a different effect sometimes just as powerful as the 26 er depending on your pieces the world of noita is beautiful and brutal the simulated world means that every grain of sand drop of mystical potion puff of gas and pixel of metal is a potential obstacle or potential resource awareness is key as every biome has something that can turn what feels like an untouchable won run into instant death and that doesn t just mean the enemies locales and their inhabitants are strange often hostile and present a wide variety of both threats and boons don t be discouraged if you get vaporized early on as every bit of knowledge brings you power as you learn to exploit the world while avoiding death the soundtrack provides the perfect atmosphere for this environment sometimes psychedelic sometimes haunting sometimes frenetic and energetic always appropriate to every threat and safe place and amazing to listen to it s hard to talk more about noita without ruining the experience so all i ll say is that the game offers much more than it appears more than enough to justify the 300 hours i ve spent on it at the time of writing this review more than enough to justify the first sentence in this review the game captures witchcraft and mysticism in a way that no other game i ve ever played has by not only giving you the fruits of the arcane art but also the journey to obtaining those fruits every bit of the game makes you feel like a witch from the highs to the lows from the triumphs to the terrors from the power to the helplessness from the euphoria of knowledge to the obfuscation of mysteries seemingly beyond your comprehension it s incredible buy it,372.9,69.0,1,Recommended,"November 28, 2023",Noita,"bitflip

84979,2022 absolutely amazing masterpiece if the technology in this game was doable in a game 15 20 years earlier i think this could have been heralded as the greatest achievement of gaming i like winning as much as the next guy but after 100 hours and close to 420 deaths i have never seen the final boss i still keep coming back a good portion of the spells and enemies and perks i have yet to discover even as a fan of roguelikes and coming to appreciate difficulty this game is another kind of animal you think its just about killing stuff and going deeper but getting only to the next level is not all if you never discover anything and always die quickly i implore you to look up the magic wand mechanics and if you really wanna know just take a quick glance at one of the community created maps i m not gonna spoil anything but there s a lot and i haven t seen half of it there s more than the standard areas you see when going straight down but it s not frustrating to stand infront of this madness at least not to me it s an exercise in avoiding death a challenge to master you find a new wand that helps you survive that one place you died within seconds last time you discover a weird structure you see an enemy that you ve never seen before you kill yourself with fire because you didn t bring water you discover there s something inside that structure you saw before dying to a monster last time you got there it keeps going and you keep understanding new aspects of the vast sandbox but it s different to other roguelike lites for example one of my favorite games is risk of rain 2 you get items the right one make you stronger and time is pressing on or dead cells where you keep looking for weapon effect synergies and unlock things metroidvania like to reach the new difficulty noita is so much different to all of that you still learn enemy attack patterns but then things change you get wands but you can t keep all you get spells but some don t seem that useful you keep recombining them find a new great combination and that s where the power spikes come in you have all the time in the world to explore and collect gold but if you are too greedy and fight too many enemies you might run out of hp before getting to the next area and you understanding how things work will let you get deeper better not stand in a puddle of water when using electric spells better get rid of those propane tanks from a distance better not stand close to that enemy when it dies all these aspects make for an immense learning curve but also an incredible alive hostile world a simulated physics sandbox mystery marvel bonus points if you have a finnish friend to laugh at you when you die from min s sawblade if you can get past the first hours of confusion and quick deaths you have one hell of a great game to discover,117.1,69.0,0,Recommended,"June 5, 2022",Noita,"vietcovfefe

84995,2019 early access review been looking forward to this one for a while these are my first impressions from a guy who has loved nolla games output since crayon physics deluxe and loves roguelites in general first bear in mind that this game is mega early access at the time of writing this there are numerous elements that need polish such as fullscreen windowed pretty much just being standard fullscreen and so on the game is plenty playable or at least it was on my rig and runs very well especially considering its main gimmick speaking of yes the gimmick is awesome my concern with this game was that nolla games would just lean back on the gimmick and then just make a generic roguelite off it but no they really exploited this to the max and i am so happy here s just a small taste of what you can do with this system maul bodies to cover yourself in their blood to put out a fire light a gigantic gunpowder container on fire to burn the gunpowder and cause a cascading downwards explosion as a kind of artificial drill position an oil barrel by kicking it then pierce the barrel to create an oil jet out of it to fill up a pit of enemies with oil then shoot a lantern above to fall down into the oil and set it all on fire melt snow into water and then boil it into steam which can get a little chaotic in the snow zone where most of the environment is snow and iceevery single pixel is simulated and that really does add to the game on top of that enemies drop twice the loot if you kill them with the physics system instead of just relying on your normal weapons which is great speaking of though the wands these are also really awesome equipment is in two categories wands and items and you can carry 4 of each items are just that and don t do more than what they say on the tin but between each zone wands can be customised and the customisation system is very deep just on my first playthrough i quickly assembled a wand that fires a magic arrow that bounces once and upon hitting a target or a second wall it leaves behind an imminently exploding mine that blasts in a vertical cross shape and a constantly burning wand that can indeed set fire to stuff at close range passively but can also shoot a rolling fireball that s honestly more like a grenade launcher that resurrects everything it kills the customisation system is difficult to describe but i ll try each wand has a set of specific stats unique to that wand like how many spells it can hold how quickly it can fire its mana cap and so on however the actual spells it fires aren t set in stone and you can shuffle them around between the zones buy new spells for your collection ecetera you can strip wands for their spells then discard them or pick up empty wands with no spells because said wand might have really good stats so next floor you can make your b f g the spells themselves and their order determine the behaviour of the wand for example you might have your basic starter wand that s setup is 2 spark bolt so it fires two small bolts in succession and then reloads but if you apply a y shape behind those spark bolts it ll shoot those two bolts at the same time in a cone pattern instead there s also the items themselves which are mostly potions essentially some liquid that you can toss out at a moment s notice when you need to you can even drop potions and shoot them to create a barrel like leak effect spray a small amount of it at foes or just toss the whole thing and potion effects vary from teleporting anything in the liquid to a random location in the zone or turning anything into a sheep or literally just being lava and the liquid lingers so you d better make sure you don t need to traverse where you throw a potion or you might just be doing it as a sheep some other things to note that might affect your purchase decision noita currently has no progression system as far as i know beyond a discovery catalogue of the things you ve found i actually don t see this as a particularly bad thing as i m used to experiences like spelunky where your starting tools are essentially all the tools you ll ever get but if you really need goals to be working towards in a roguelite beyond simply improving your own skills you won t find it here at least not for the time being i think it s likely something will likely be added in the future like at the least different unlockable colour schemes for your wizard perhaps different starting loadouts or even new characters but not yet noita is definitely a more slow paced roguelite which is pretty unique in the genre while noita does have moments of action even these are slower than a lot of other roguelites and dealing with enemies well is more about planning and strategy than combat itself once again early access so while the game is very playable and very fun it s still something to keep in mind,189.8,63.0,0,Recommended,"September 24, 2019",Noita,"lexilogo

84998,2021 noita is one of the greatest games of all time this is an experience where get good goes far beyond the concept of learning that certain moves have iframes and memorizing a few telecasts it s one of the few games i ve played in my life that i think is just legitimately difficult as opposed to simply being of poor design nothing short of total mastery of every aspect of the game s systems will lead you to victory and to try to accumulate that knowledge spoiler free is one of the most intensely gratifying gameplay loops ever created this is a game that demands the player grow not the player character you will die hundreds of times on your way to your first win but every death comes with a lesson some valuable intel about how the game operates that is sure to help you do marginally better the next time you come across a similar situation every system in the game is stacked against you but there s enough systems that if you ve mastered them all you can almost surely find some way forward every time simply put as far as game design goes this is a one of a kind masterpiece and the absolutely enthralling visual style is just a cherry on the sundae for the fan of the roguelike this is an auto buy my complaints are minor and few first it doesn t do this game justice to call it a roguelite as its description states after 100 hours or so i finally found something that technically can carry over between runs but its far more accurate to call this game a full fledged roguelike second small ui ux hangups are irritating such as being unable to determine what the always cast effect is on a wand you are already holding the worst among these ux issues is that the screen flashes a violently bright red no matter how small of a damage amount you take even if it s less than 1 of your remaining health it s offputting for split second decision making finally the game does have some performance issues which it gratefully offsets by using framerate as its measure of time meaning the game actually gets easier when it slows down i won t condemn the game for my computer not being up to snuff but the inconsistency of the performance is what bugs me some runs will run at 60fps just fine while i summon oceans for the physics system to deal with other runs tank in fps from the getgo and i can do naught but restart until the client decides it wants to cooperate overall though noita is my game of the year for 2021 yeah i know it came out in 2020 and has been in early access since 2019 but it s just so damned good that i m actually going to give it game of the year for all three of those years it truly is a once in a lifetime type of game,986.2,83.0,0,Recommended,"June 28, 2021",Noita,Remula
84999,2022 let me be clear as far as i am concerned this game is impossible simply because i would get bored of it long before i could ever master the patience skill and luck required to actually beat this game with that said the journey is definitely the focus on this one it is a lot of fun to explore and discover new things and you will be thinking about it more then you would like to admit the shear fragility of the player makes it that much more rewarding when you discover new places or get farther then you ever did before only to have that joy thrown away because you die to some stupid reason where you don t even know what happened if you want to see the end of this game i highly recommend using mods though you will discover there is a special charm that you will lose by playing with mods something that truly comes from the difficulty of it i hope you are happy spending 100s of hours becoming a wizard knowing this game more intimately then you know yourself if you wish to reach the end in vanilla i simply do not have the time or care for that myself but i have a lot of fun playing this game i can certainly see myself picking it up again for a few runs even if the earlier sections feel like a chore after the 100th time trying to get through them never play noita hoping to reach the end and you will find fun in it as painful as this game is to play sometimes i cant not recommend it it has a lot of soul to it and is definitely a piece of art of a video game,99.8,69.0,2,Recommended,"January 17, 2022",Noita,"Astra (snowfall)

85004,2020 after playing close to 240 hours i think i am entitled to predict that noita will become the next evergreen classic do you ever get frustrated with punishing games i do and let me tell you noita is up there in terms of driving you up the wall i have died and rage quit a lot yet the magic of noita draws me back in to fire up a new run over and over again two reasons why i keep coming back 1 your fiercest enemy is not a critter it is your environment every run starts at the mouth of a cave leading into a randomly generated downward maze every pixel wood fire steel water and so on has a chemical reaction to the other many runs have ended in a vat of acid or by electrocution for example infuriating and hilarious at the same time 2 another feature that makes noita shine is your weapon customizable wands on your way down you frequently swap your wand for a more powerful one new wands come with 1 to over 20 slots most of these slots hold random magic spells and spell modifiers the trick is to re order these spells or ones you have collected before to make the wand work the wand spells combinations are endless so you really need to get creative here like a wand that shoots electrified homing mists or projectiles that trigger chainsaws on impact mastering wand building means mastering noita you just read a brief summary of the basics noita offers much more to explore so join us and get noita d edit 17 10 and with the 1 0 release the game got even better nominated for game of the year 2020,449.0,54.0,1,Recommended,"May 24, 2020",Noita,NomiosNL
85005,2020 this game is an exceptional rogue like nolla games like to around with physics decision making and puzzles crayon physics baba is you and this game encampsulates all of this in one wild and interesting rogue like where almost all your decision will backfire at you and it will backfire hard so you have to complete the game until your poor decision making gets you main game path consists out of several different stages and you have to get through them to get to the final boss and kill it making the gods proud of you how you do it by avoiding different pixelated hazards like toxic sludge flammable gases and many more enemies are also no joke after few first levels you ll find out that many new enemies will start using game physics against you deadly lightning bolts that will electrocute you if you re swimming in the water fire mages that will burn you alive in a little cloud of flammable gas that you accidently stepped in or enemy that has a projectile attack that turns you into harmless sheep for a few second that is enough for other foes to kill you the game is hard but you can put up a fight you re not some loser you find different wands scattered around the levels with various randomized spells thourhg advancing in art of wandcrafting and spellmaking you get to make deadly force that can oblitirate even hardest of enemies wand system is dynamic and interesting getting to know it better takes time but if you finally know what you re doing with those sticks you start feeling like at home but don t get cocky environmental hazards and your own poor decision making you really thought that firing an explosion spell near fast enemies is a good idea will get to you if you get cocky pay attention be careful and think a couple of steps further perk system will help you in avoiding dangerous world objects for example you can pick up fire immunity and boom your fire spilling wand becomes viable and you can finally use it with lower risks game also features alchemy system you can carry around various liquids and some times even powders and pour them into each other to get various results for example water converts toxic sludge into more water this is a game about experiments around with physics and getting to know how to use all of this to your advantage when you finally beaten the final boss what s next this is where the game really shines a couple of runs where you scout area more carefully will reveal new secret areas they ve been there all the time but when you focus on getting to the boss it s easy to miss them scouting for secrets is very interesting and if you google noita secrets you ll get to know that a lot of very specific actions will result in big amount of interesting stuff most secrets are not reachable without looking up in the google tho so you will have to find out it on reddit or youtube i highly recommend this game it s very interesting hard and relatively rewarding the game will you againa and again and you will like it or no that s up to you,111.3,49.0,3,Recommended,"November 28, 2020",Noita,"Yurenev

85014,2022 every noita run you will learn and gain something new it makes a stoic scientist out of you whilst occasionally sending you into fits of hysterical laughter disbelief or rage from witnessing how you died but then you make a mental note of how you died so that you don t die in the same way next time and fire up another run the online noita community inspires you enter the cave again and again hoping you ll survive until you can find more interesting spells and wands or stumble across wand components that synergise in fascinating ways you learn and tinker with different spell combinations like some alchemist scavenging and salvaging pieces of wands and spells hidden throughout each stage as you slowly become consumed by the manic thirst for knowledge of the noita witch itself this is not a game to binge noita is a hobby that is nurtured with time i found a single typical noita sitting to last 30 to 90 minutes i stopped when i found myself rushing through runs and dying sometimes i stop playing for a week but then i come across a youtube video of some ridiculous noita stuff so i return for a while again this is not a game to binge but one to enjoy over a long period of time hopefully one you ll keep on revisiting to have these nice moments too,138.3,54.0,2,Recommended,"May 28, 2022",Noita,a good brick
85019,2019 early access review like other reviewers and news websites are saying this game has some great potential visual and physics but unfortunately it becomes insanely hard from the third level enemies deal lots of damage and use hard to evade attacks yet you can t get defense abilities much unless you are lucky enough to get some defensive perks or shield spells raising max hp is possible but sometimes you can t find these items at all so yeah i think this game definitely needs some difficulty tweaks anyways i can still recommend this game because the game has tons of fun magic spells and features the difficulty is the only one yet pretty big problem of the game 2019 10 11 update the devs have made the game slightly easier the player now starts with a water flask so you can put out fire or remove toxic stain from yourself and third and fourth area became somewhat easier and you can gain 10 max hp from health full replenish item and so on the game is now fairer and even more enjoyable so buy this game right now,384.5,100.0,8,Recommended,"September 29, 2019",Noita,"Namsan

85028,2019 early access review there s a clear lack of polish to many elements there is not even a main menu and the game reboots to give you a new seed dungeon to explore the records after each run don t save you can t enter a seed however i haven t been able to put this game down beyond that the combat feels strategical and like everything is purely in your own control the spell customization is expansive and is easy to pick up but difficult to master it ll take me a few dozen more hours to figure out modifiers and multicasts the generated dungeons are expansive and interesting and destructible to the point where every corner is interesting despite being yet another mineshaft keep in mind though this game is difficult the first stage is kind of easy the second stage already requires a lot more to pass and the third one i have barely reached the fourth i reached once but instantly got obliterated by a skeleton wizard with a yet inpenetrable shield good luck,123.9,77.0,1,Recommended,"September 25, 2019",Noita,"Leah

85038,2022 do you enjoy roguelikes have you ever enjoyed games that give you no immediate understanding of the mechanics do you enjoy facing impossible odds made worse by greed fuelled mistakes do you hold a deep self hatred towards yourself that gets worse every time you consider your recent choices of course you do welcome to noita and enjoy your misery noita is essentially a full blown git gud roguelike physics based wizard simulator that forces you between two extremes of methodical decision making and planning ahead and split second panic choices that can end your run anywhere between your starting point to five hours in you will get lit on fire and burn to death before you can put it out you will get sniped from offscreen by a gang of enemies and inevitably you will try to open a chest in a small pool of water only to get electrocuted to death by the item that spawned from it your hand will not be held and you will need fanatical willpower or sheer insanity to continue after dying to a combination of unfortunate events comprised of poor wand and item spawns terrible perk rerolls and environmental hazards that enemies have no issues using against you to scatter your corpse across the screen but as you keep climbing up the mountain of knowledge this game requires and the spell system starts to make sense and knowing where to go and what to plan for becomes second nature you realize this game will still end you within a minute by your own hands and you ll start it again just to have something out of your control kill you the next time and you ll start again anyway,196.9,55.0,3,Recommended,"August 14, 2022",Noita,GPhoenix

85052,2020 early access review you re looking at my hours played and at the overwhelmingly positive rating and you re wondering why i m not recommending it well i m wondering too this was one of the very few games i actually felt hyped about and i bought it as soon as it was released i ve had fun with it and it s a competently made game with a fun central gimmick so what gives at its core it s pretty simple while noita is fun it s also really miserly when it comes to doling out that fun and that s something that just really rubs me the wrong way pay your taxesone of the frustrating things noita does is something more rogue like games do the game s mechanics are conditional under a tax you have to pay and that tax is you being forced not to use the mechanics in noita it comes in the form of a time tax and an inventory tax see when you start a new game noita isn t fun your starting items are garbage so you have to find good items before you can start having fun but the first level is purpose made to be absolute trash to navigate with a fresh character and the items you can find there are often poor there are other forms of time tax such as the character being really slow but most of it is that first level the other tax is the inventory tax see the point of noita is that you make your own magic wands from wands you find in the levels these are random and often not very good in standard play you can only edit items in the saferoom at the end of the level which means you always have to sacrifice one of your four and slots to carry found wands to the end of the level pray to rngesusyes yes i know complaining about rng in a roguelike the problem is a good run in this game depends on luck to an extreme degree for instance there s no real healing in noita with a scant few exceptions and you will take damage in fact the reason you now start with a flask of water is because catching on fire before you could get one was a run ending first level problem so your capacity to look for new stuff depends on your health which you can increase with an item found in the levels if you have bad luck and don t find many that s most likely a junk run for you can t find good wands or spells in the levels or at the saferoom junk run bad perk selection junk run bad luck in one level makes you much more susceptible to bad luck in the following level because it directly limits your capacity for exploration and it doesn t end there oh no there s a wizard enemy who can teleport your butt to random places on the map better hope it s not too harsh the worms that traverse the level can straight up destroy the saferoom for which the game blames you spawning a strong enemy in every saferoom that you have to fight it s even in the enemy placement because damage comes easy in noita clear an obstacle and see a lightning wizard good luck with your new run in the correct quantities these mechanics are all fine the way noita piles them up makes the game feel extremely arbitrary point and shootnoita s core mechanic is that it simulates every pixel being probably the first real game to actually have a good reason to have pixel art it s pretty cool not gonna lie the fact that you can empty a flask and dip it in liquid in the level to fill it up with is pretty unique but it doesn t really do a lot with this despite the environment being fully destructible you ll only rarely use it to tackle problems and then half the time only by accident there s very little interaction between the environment and the player aside from digging passages to get somewhere when you get down to it noita is basically just a sidescrolling shooter where you sort of get to decide what bullets you shoot even the kick your wizard can do to move loose objects is horrible there s a massive delay it s inaccurate and sometimes barely moves an object oh and enemies that are too close to an object when you kick it are likely to get no damage this all comes back to the game just plain not wanting to give you the tools to have fun the explosives in the levels are a good resource to blast passages if you have no digging tools or just blow up enemies with so why is my only way to move them around the worst kick in video game history while i m a bloody wizard you still here ok look noita isn t a bad game it s more what you d call a diamond in the rough but boy it s rough you re going to have fun with it no doubt about it but you re also going to get pants on head frustrated by it because it s a fantastic idea marred by execution that s both really arbitrary and really afraid to give the player too many tools oh and i almost forgot one of the new features added is a perfect example of my complaints your wizard can drink liquid present on the map if it s a potion or similar you gain its effects if it s inert it simply disappears previously you could keep doing it and it was somewhat of a tool to lower the fluid level somewhere the developers thought this was too powerful a tool apparently your wizard now has a limited amount of stuff he can eat drink i wasn t aware of this thing breaking the game in any way but ok it doesn t end there however no no no you also take damage if you overeat drink and overeating drinking reduces your already slow movement speed this isn t fun this is a garbage mechanic with no purpose other than to limit the player the only other game i know that has a similar mechanic is kingdom come that is a game with an autistic dedication to realism this is a game where you play a spellcasting wizard with a jetpack if i want to chug a trench of whiskey because the game hasn t deigned to give me proper digging tools yet can you just let me do it this feels too much like playing d d with a dm who feels threatened by your character

85069,2020 early access review there are four faces to noita noita is an entire world created by the use of particle physics the flash sandbox games of old were used as a blueprint upon which to mold a partially procedural rendition of a game map to explore sand and soil flow down hillsides water pours down through holes in cave systems in a flowing waterfall fire spreads across wood and organic matter and each element reacts with others in different forms while transferring between the three main states of matter lava will cool to rock when exposed to water and rock formations fissure and tear realistically when marred by an explosion it is a playground of physics and particle properties noita is a harsh unforgiving world of monsters and destruction as you step foot in the opening to the underground caverns you will be greeted with ravenous beasts lashing out not only at you but each other in a bid for survival as the mine tunnels are torn apart in the ensuing conflict you can be lit on fire in an instant or get coated in toxic sludge there will hardly be any means of recovering damage every nick brings you that much closer to death even with a full bar of health you will always be a mere few explosions or acid pools away from dying in an instant and no matter how deep you go once you are dead it s back to square one noita is a quest to get down to the bottom of the earth to uncover the secrets of the ancient wizards each new layer is more perilous than the last and you must prepare accordingly at your repertoire are numerous wands of different attributes and capabilities which you may tailor to your liking search the world and amass gold to collect a variety of spells and with a little ingenuity and trial and error on your part you can fashion a deadly customized weapon to combat the horrors below whether that wand is a reliable asset or a desperate loose cannon is on you you could rush for the end or comb each region for resources to empower yourself the holy mountains will grant respite and boons though you d best be respectful the gods look down upon those who abuse their utilities approach each new challenge and environment with great forethought and the utmost of caution noita is abound with hidden secrets and forgotten knowledge the gauntlet which many have fallen upon is only the bare surface of what the world has to offer to one who would tread the beaten path and poke into the farthest reaches of the land many mysteries lie in wait one door opens another and once you know where to look your understanding of the game expands forever every barrier each pit the shifting skies above and the elements strewn across the world hold esoteric powers and discoveries it was a simple mission get to the bottom and finish your work once that is done you deserve your rest and yet you ve already come so far should you stop now,121.1,46.0,0,Recommended,"August 6, 2020",Noita,"Syphilis the Sturdy

85079,noita is an incredibly unique roguelike one that has an incredible amount of depth and requires you to get fully engaged with its systems to truly succeed you can reach the deepest level and beat the final boss relatively easily but that s only the tip of the iceberg the game is expansive and full of cryptic secrets and puzzles and becoming powerful enough that you can mostly freely explore the world and figure them out is only the first half of the game within the game s main loop are also the two main systems that make it stand out wand crafting is essentially dragging and dropping blocks of code combining hundreds of spells and modifiers to create nearly infinite tools and weapons with the right creativity and a wand with generous spell slots and mana you can make almost anything you can imagine but it might also blow up in your face or melt you with acid the other main system which is what makes it so dynamic and fun is the physics and alchemy system every type of material in the game ranging from water to wood to various densities of rock to metal and coal has different properties everything interacts and you can interact with it to use the environment to your advantage and this means being smart about how you navigate the world is half the battle these systems combined with the world being procedurally generated on each run incentivizes you to be creative and take different approaches on each run you ll need to be creative because noita is hard opportunities to heal are scarce and enemies can kill you in seconds if you re not careful experimenting and exploring beyond the main path the game encourages you to go down give a real sense of discovery and are some of the most fun parts of it however the amount of time you can invest into a run only to die and have to start from scratch also makes it frustrating if you don t want to invest a lot of time if you re willing to though there aren t many games as rewarding as noita,356.8,34.0,1,Recommended,August 13,Noita,"The Ogrelord

85083,2023 insane amount of depth lots of variety and there s nothing quite like it out there that s noita and yet there are some design decisions here at play which will make it or break it for you i m not recommending the game because after 65 hours i haven t managed to even reach the final boss and trying to do so stopped being fun and while the classic adage losing is fun very much applies in this game i laughed many times after a particularly explosive death and even recorded gifs after a while i felt nothing but frustration since i just didn t feel like i m in control of my run now i m perfectly happy to be told skill issue git gut skrub and i d agree to an extent but hey i managed to get to the last area which only 12 of players have the achievement for doing so i think that perhaps this is not just a me problem anyway i have three main complaints about the game i believe all of them to be conscious design decisions which some people might like some people might not read the wikido you like games chock full of secrets that you have almost no chance of figuring out on your own and enjoy the community aspect of solving mysteries aka hanging out on forums discord servers and reading wikis this is such a game here are some vague spoiler free examples of what i mean many things require some specific obscure and very difficult feats to unlock there are many mechanics in the game that are only vaguely hinted at in stuff that normally would already be considered secretive and some mechanics aren t mentioned at all the only way to find out about them is either by accident or by reading about them and then there s the worst thing the sheer scope of noita is something that you ll probably never find out about by just playing the game normally in an intuitive way that s what makes me believe that noita is explicitly designed to be this way it s no coincidence in case this isn t clear i really don t like such design to me getting info from the wiki is like reading the detailed plot summary of the movie before watching it gaming is and always will be a solitary personal experience for me unless playing coop or something i know many disagree so just thought i d mention this here life is short game is longthe second problem is somewhat visible in the trailer it s astonishingly easy to die and not necessarily due to the enemies although that too absolutely you can misuse a spell get caught up in an explosion fall into a lethal liquid such as lava point is you re rather squishy and while there is a way to increase your hp it s tedious and somewhat random for the most part it s possible to avoid this issue with being very careful how careful well almost every step into the unknown has to be done slowly and methodically and groups of enemies are best avoided altogether unless you have some kind of big bada boom spell for that occasion fight them one two at a time from familiar ground hey no big deal that sounds just like dark souls and that was fun right here s the thing the game world is huge if you intend to explore in order to get better wands and health pickups as well as farm some gold to get better spells all of which you should completing even a single area can be quite tedious all because of how easy it is to die you have to be careful but there s so much ground to cover and that s only talking about playing the game normally mind over and over againand now for the final issue i mentioned that the game has crazy amount of depth and variety early on and yet in spite of this almost every run feels very samey there is a lot of cool enemies different spells that combine in crazy ways and so much more and yet because of how difficult the game is and how easy it is to die early on chances are you ll never see any of those things 90 of my runs ended before things got interesting and after a while you look in the mirror and ask yourself am i willing to start another run considering how big of a chance there is i ll die before things get good and you answer yes you promise yourself you ll be extra careful this time you take things even slower than before and you get a little further maybe or maybe it doesn t matter because you simply can t find a good wand or proper perk combination etc etc so you still die same as before even though individual areas are procedurally generated they re still made of recognisable pieces and after a while you ll almost be able to predict the layout okay not quite but so many setpieces repeat and considering how demanding this game is when it comes to repetition you ll end up running into the same stuff over and over conclusionwait that s all you have to say you did nothing but complain i m sure you re thinking and you know yes i did because in the end all the goodwill i had for noita goodwill that my first few hours generated melted away by those three fun killing issues do you like reading the wiki do you like classic roguelikes where successful runs can be many hours long are you fine with repetition then noita has a lot to offer you me well i think i made my opinion known curator page,65.0,66.0,1,Not Recommended,"January 1,

85086,2022 this is the one and only true spiritual successor to nethack a game that was designed to not be completed ever by most of the players who played it made many years before the modern internet could give you help noita follows this idea perfectly but because of the modern internet it quickly became an incredible community effort to solve some of the most esoteric and unexplained things in any video game i have ever seen the first time you find an area that is off the beaten path you will realize that this game is something far more amazing than it is at first glance as an important note this game features permadeath and is insanely difficult i would like to add that there is absolutely no shame in using mods to remove the permanent death system if you are a player who wants to play this and really can t get behind losing all your progress when you die i am personally far too stubborn to do that myself and because of that i have probably only experienced 30 of the entire game even with my current playtime so take that as you will this game feels like it was wished for not created by a team of people it is a miracle of coding prowess and deserves to be played even if you have to remove the one challenging system with mods to enjoy it do it play this nothing else is like it,273.1,44.0,0,Recommended,"November 22, 2022",Noita,Beep My Bop

85089,2019 early access review game of incredible capacity to make any situation crazy and enjoyable but also insanely difficult as a trade off noita a game with the best physics every part of the level can be interacted with by that i mean destroyed melted frozen set ablaze and so on every enemy can be smashed shocked buried frozen burned chopped you name it but so can you noita is a rewarding experience when something works out and it can be rewarding even when it does not but at the end of the day its fun either way or so i think positives physics literally anything can be used or effected in some way magic system wands that can have any kind of spells on them and can be edited to do spells that you want or find some shoot arrows some cause an earthquake some just summon a rain cloud magical flasks with weird properties stretching from simple water to literal polymorphing agent enemies range from small spiders big ones as well and zombies to robots hunters with rocket launchers and mages and anything that has hands can use wands as well making it interesting when a zombie decides to summon a lighting bolt in your face by accident levels each lair has its own troubles and interactions perks range from basic health increase to immunity to fire to making you a vampire negatives game can be crazy easy from the start or instant death from the start rng is a blessing and a curse more on that later since you a wearing clothes any liquid can stick to you and it can be an issue in a long term unless you obtain a perk to limit that no way to effect your start gear no real progression beyond finding things randomly be it spells or wands or health games strength is the ability to make any situation work and biggest weakness is in the rng of everything it can bless you with some awesome starts like a thunderbolt wand and immunity to electricity perk in the first portal with no extra effects or can send 2 fire elementals at you for you to die by or make 2 out of 3 portals be in lava pits or make acid eyeballs smack you at the start with no water around you the point is the game is in my opinion a bit uncontrollably rng based experience let me explain to me dead cells for example does something to create options to work towards you save up cells to trade in for an start upgrade to have random choices for 3 weapons 1 from each type you have unlocked this limits your start rng by a lot making the run more depend on you the game is rng based but you can manage it as you have options in noita that is not the case whatever the game decides goes you will get f ked a lot just because the games said so it happens even when you do nothing a worm can piss of the gods and the gods will try to kill you because a worm you had no idea was there destroyed their altar somewhere so they send a undead mage to expand your innards outwards just because sometimes the game gives you a wand with thunder shock bolts amazing you think they are fun and super satisfying to use unless you are not electricity immune and one out of 3 shots might shoot bolts around you blowing shocking yourself final thoughtsoverall its a game i love because of the potential i see in it but its a game that i can t even finish once that s what i do before i write a review of a game and most likely won t until i ll get lucky i enjoy it a lot but i feel like to make it a massive success like enter the gungeon or dead cells you need to look at some aspects of those games mainly progression and control of your start and incorporate your twist of those ideas into the game if you want to have a fun time with the most satisfying mage combat lighting bolt game on the gaming market and you want to support game developers that actually give a damm about making a good and enjoyable and unique game then get noita small improvements that would be amazing 1 i feel like the randomness should be more controllable at the start or at least give players more options at the start create a small village outside the cave with free wands or spells to use or make a system with unlocks to give you something to go towards to make future runs more controllable 2 make npc random destruction not anger the gods towards you its a hard fix i assume considering that npc s can be made to help you but would be fun not to be killed because a worm just wanted to eat a perk 3 add mini customization for your mage makes people get attached to their little meat slime explosion piles,88.7,36.0,0,Recommended,"October 14, 2019",Noita,"Inblood

85094,2021 i adore this game and have bought it for a few of my friends that i thought would also enjoy it they did at its core this is a game about learning and discovery you must find combinations of spells that you have found to be effective in your hands and keep those in mind as you delve and search for ingredients in the form of wands and the spells within them it is like learning crafting recipes in survival crafting style games except there is no recipe book and you can put any of the ingredients you want together to see what you get once you have twenty or more combinations that you are familiar and proficient with it becomes much easier to conserve your hp while searching for even better ingredients essentially this is a game where knowledge truly is power the more you know and understand about the game the easier the game becomes the game doesn t hold your hand through the learning process because that learning process is the game this is easily my favorite game that i played in 2020 i hope you give it a try and enjoy it as much as i have,658.5,52.0,2,Recommended,"December 23, 2021",Noita,Jacg

85100,2021 on a scale of frustrating roguelikes noita is firmly on the i want to punch a hole in my wall end you need to be patient to play this the core appeal of noita is of course the falling everything engine it works perfectly every pixel is simulated every pixel interacts with everything else and it all runs smoothly where noita really starts to shine is the kinds of things the game does with the engine basically everything you can think of is in the game liquids powders and objects react with each other and produce new materials or explosions in all sorts of ways along with realistic materials like water blood acid there s a bunch of magical liquids that have their own effects and reactions shovel gallons of worm blood down your gaping noita hole and see through walls melt steel with concentrated mana inherent to a system like this is a bit of jank sometimes your character gets blocked by a single pixel of terrain you can barely see or gets set on fire by a single pixel of lava it happens less often than you d honestly expect but often enough that it can be irritating sometimes the enemies and spells in the game similarly do almost everything you could think of there s mages that bleed lava and teleporting liquid there s flying crystals whose bodies are made of actual simulated pixels there s a guy who just has a shotgun the spells consist of everything from standard projectiles and stat boosts to spells that launch live worms summon seas of liquid and a straight up nuke you ll find yourself gravitating towards certain spells more often but they ve all got their uses cons noita is rng heavy in ways that are more frustrating than fun your max hp which basically acts like a pseudo timer letting you stay in an area until you ve taken too much damage and need to get the heal at the start of the next area is based on max hp pickups that spawn completely at random you can get a massive head start if one spawns right at the beginning of the run or get zero spawned in an entire zone healing spells similarly spawn completely at random and are extremely powerful if you get them the core gameplay loop of exploring till you ve taken too much damage and then entering the next area to get a full heal breaks down outside the main path of the game over half the game s content is outside the main path but there s like three places you can get a heal in all of it so you either find one of those randomly spawning heal spells or run out of hp and are just like guess i ll die overall brilliant concept for a game generally good execution with a few hiccups not for people who can t handle frustration difficult games or getting one shot after a three hour run because a puddle of polymorphine turned you into a sheep it s fun give it a shot,152.5,42.0,3,Recommended,"April 22, 2021",Noita,JuicedBananas

85120,noita is a game about one thing knowledge despite having lots of randomized aspects the game is very consistent in the way that it behaves every enemy acts in the same way wand building is purely logical even if sometimes it doesn t feel that way and the same key structures and regions will always exist when i was first playing through the game nearly none of my deaths felt frustrating or worthless because every death helped me understand how the game works it manages to strike a fine balance between being deeply complicated and being approachable and learnable as you accumulate knowledge about how this game works you will naturally achieve better and better runs until victory knowledge is the true meta progression of noita and it more than makes up for the lack of proper meta progression that it has relative to other roguelites and with your knowledge you can go beyond victory soon enough you learn how to completely break this game apart discovering the utility of each simple spell that makes almost all of them valuable under the right circumstances it s very very satisfying to take seemingly total control of the game after spending nearly a hundred hours trying to beat it just a single time new secrets become feasible and it s exciting to unravel them and learn how the game clues you into its puzzles every symbol has a meaning however the running message behind this game s narrative is that you are never completely in control which is reflected by the game itself no matter how strong you get it s very easy to get too reckless and lose everything by being transformed into a sheep or misunderstanding a certain mechanic you always have to stay somewhat alert even after becoming presumably unkillable there is also some really nice pixel art here as well certain environments and prebuilt structures are especially cool it s a great game,213.4,38.0,0,Recommended,April 24,Noita,"Desogran

85123,2022 i wish i would ve actually looked at the reviews instead of blindly trusting overwhelmingly positive a lot of people that recommend this game have 5 hours or less only 50 of players have passed the first area even less so have passed further areas try to do some research that steam s surface level information won t offer you noita is a decent game it s very well thought out and meticulous the game is absolutely gorgeous what it doesn t tell you is how difficult it really is this game is unnecessarily difficult in my opinion runs typically end in the first area all this stuff you see in the videos about destroying pixels is not available immediately the game does start you with a basic destruction tool but it can be very limited depending on rng there are loads of perks spells wands variations just about the only thing that s similar every run is the intermission shop area you can save during runs and pick up where you left off why i m not going to recommend it it s infuriating i realize its a rogue like i still believe it s unnecessarily difficult the game doesn t teach you how to deal with certain hazards that are quick to kill you there s no explanation on how things are done which leaves it completely up to figuring out things on your own you start every run with a potion some of which are capable of fixing or mitigating certain hazards the most aggravating part is how much you will end up killing yourself more than anything else i m not talking about spells that blow up in your face that will happen a lot too i m talking about how often you can actually find yourself on fire or poisoned with no where to clean it off or put yourself out both status effects will decimate your health bar maybe 1 4 every instance it damages for the full duration yes there are items or perks that make you resist said damage but taking those means you miss out on perks that could change your run from being a beat the boss run to a visit parallel worlds to become a god run i also can t begin to describe the feeling of narrowly winning combat with almost no health to find you get stuck in a small crevice created by said combat that you can t get out of because one small pixel in the middle of it is preventing escaping but your character slid into effortlessly and the only chance of getting out because a lot of spells don t break pixels without hurting you is blowing yourself up and ending your run this doesn t happen often enough to constantly worry about it but it has happened enough that i have to mention it overall i don t hate that i purchased this game i did have wanderlust in the first hour and enjoyed every minute of playing i will not recommend this game solely from my experience playing the only thing that prevented me from refunding it at 90 minutes is i wanted to know if i was missing something more i was but the amount of grief it caused certainly didn t make it feel worth it,262.9,94.0,11,Not Recommended,"February 27, 2022",Noita,Zahbuhdoo

85128,2023 a fantastic roguelike platformer where you ll scream at your monitor and swear never to play it again only to well play it again admittedly you need to put in some time to really begin understanding the magic behind it in a nutshell you re a little wizard dude armed some two basic low level wands some unenhanced spells a potion and that s it it s your job to make your way down from area to area while gathering gold swapping out old wands for better wands and learning the alchemy system for mixing potions or just using them as they you find them the controls are solid there is a large variety of enemies and each area is radically different to the last the special while the game encourages you to keep going down and using the portal to move onto the next area once you ve satisfied you ve gotten everything you can from your currently area there are many secrets to uncover once you decide to go off the beaten path this is also tempered with the need for survival get too low on health and you ll be faced with a risk vs reward decision as your health is replenished upon arriving in a new area the game changer wands and spells each wand comes with stats such as accuracy mana amount for casting more expensive spells recharge rate and fire rate wands also come with multiple slots which between levels you can remove the spells and effects that came with the wand for other spells and effects you ve either picked up or bought finally wands either fire spells randomly or in the order you placed them spell effects have radically different results depending on the spell type you re altering and as the game progresses the space wands come with for placing stuff in them grows allowing for completely bat sh t insane combinations you ll find that most if not all your deaths come from the player doing something catastrophically stupid such as attaching rotating fireball effect to giant buzz saw boomerang spells and then firing off that one in a tight enclosed area or drinking acid potion by mistake or trying to fire off an electrically charged spell while submerged in water or etc you get the picture it s great though that death works this way as you can almost never blame the game for deaths and this is i think the main reason we who love this game keep coming back because we understand that while it is insane it is fair and it s up to us to use our heads that being said sometimes we just want to go nuts and create a killeverything spell and when it backfires it s usually just as glorious as winning pretty sure my hours speak for themselves as does the overwhelming positive rating this game has on steam well earned and justified,362.2,33.0,1,Recommended,"March 20, 2023",Noita,TwoSocks
85129,game over or as i like to say you got noita d the game over screen in this game is a something that you ll very quickly get very used to seeing every enemy every spell every pixel is going to try to and will kill you a lot of people say this game is a masochists wet dream and whilst i agree to a certain degree i think a lot of the difficulty stems from the game simply being so uniquely unconventional it is common for rogue likes to not hold your hands sure but in noita the only thing the game puts in your hand is 2 wands a flask filled with water and a lil tutorial on how to kick things and armed with that knowledge it now expects you to travel to parallel worlds to become god or to recreate the sun and i wish i was making this up the depth this game has is insane which is great though i doubt anyone is going to be able to get a different ending or make the really really cool types of wands without using the wiki which might be annoying to some but speaking of wands the combat and wand crafting are insanely fun in the way that there really isnt a right wrong way to approach a boss or a hazard the game doesnt play by the rules and it demands you to do the same if you want to succeed you might sometimes make a wand which deals thousands of damage and think wow i can kill anything with this i completely broken the game with this wand im unstoppable and then a boss just says nuh uh and uses your own spells to blast you to death with them whilst also getting a 1 second shield which blocks all damage after each time you hit him but what if now you had a spell which homes onto yourself after you cast it and then have him copy that exact spell to try and shoot you with it i think you can see where im going with this and that s why i love this game it is an unfogiving brutal wizard simulator where each new discovery each new death teaches you a little more about the world and how to avoid all of its deadly hazards so what im saying is if you love rogue likes cool wizards and finnland lore and want to dive deep into an experience which will either leave you deeply traumatized or with the experience of being a god amonst wizards noita is a game for you though if you re someone who wants to find out everything by yourself or expect a coherent story i have to dissapoint you because this game if far too confusing to figure out most things by yourself so tutorials wikis are a must have but now all that s left to say is happy noiting,68.4,66.0,2,Recommended,March 24,Noita,"Hex: Moss(bag)

85132,2023 this game is a masterpiece i say that in the truest most genuine sense of the word this is the work of people who have absolutely mastered their craft and it shows masterpiece doesn t mean perfect but it s damn close are there bugs yes surprisingly few though are there balance issues sure will you get frustrated and curse the very gods when utter is thrown at you without warning absolutely is all of this a part of the totality of the experience that makes it so compelling you better believe it not only is the gameplay excellent but the mystery behind everything is captivating and the technical marvel that is this game s engine is absolutely unbelievable i still have no idea how the hell they managed to make a game capable of simulating so many millions of pixels with such ease in spite of the immense complexity of possible interactions even with the chunk system dividing the world up into manageable blocks and i first played on a now 11 year old pc without any serious performance issues barring some exceptional circumstances it s incredible one of the most emphatic themes of the entire game is that magic is powerful and mysterious but also extremely dangerous reckless use can and will quickly lead to your demise yet for those who do manage to successfully harness its abilities without self destruction it is entirely possible to become godlike and that s no exaggeration that said it comes at a high price and it s a difficult road to travel i normally don t like permadeath in games and i honestly do recommend playing at least at first with a quicksave utility since there s no native built in save system which is my one and only complaint that will allow you to learn things a bit easier and probably actually get through the whole main loop of the game but i can t really say i fault the game for going the roguelike route either and i recommend you refrain from backing up your save once you start exploring the deeper mysteries of the world trust me it really does enhance the experience unless of course your time is very limited then by all means savescum away without shame whatever it takes to experience this amazing world there are countless incredibly cryptic puzzles to solve here most of which i d never have managed to figure out on my own but thanks to folks who datamined and analyzed everything they could dig up which the developers seem to fully encourage it s possible to experience world altering cosmic mayhem firsthand you just might want to look up some guide videos unless you re the type who likes to really dig deep and experiment with very limited clues but even once you understand what to do actually managing to do it successfully is another matter entirely on top of all that there are dozens of high quality mods to further expand and customize the experience there s basically no reason i can think of to not recommend noita to anyone who likes combat experimentation creativity exploration deep lore extreme replay value or serious challenge it has everything and does all of it extremely well easily in my top 5 games of all time 10 10 without hesitation,830.9,35.0,0,Recommended,"October 15, 2023",Noita,Buff Skeleton

85166,150 hours in and not worth the time and energy tbh don t get me wrong it s easy to sink a bunch of time into the game and think you re having fun but it s addictive for the same reason plain gambling is addictive and not addictive because it s fun its strengths are overshadowed by its weaknesses and all of its weaknesses are some varying degree of frustrating or downright unfair mechanics here are some of the pros creative wand building great world and world gen lots to explore and discover pixel by pixel simulation is an interesting and unique concept mods which can fix some of the most frustrating parts of the game but a game really shouldn t have to rely on mods for that and here are the cons wands can feel samey unless you happen to find the right spells pieces to make a unique wand in a similar vein making a strong enough wand to get by sometimes relies a bit too much on finding certain staple spells e g chainsaw black hole luminous drill etc it feels bad to be barely scraping by on a run trying to find a missing piece that would elevate the run but simply not finding it and dying as you struggle to put the pieces of a good run together in a crappy seed i ve had runs where i m missing any sort of spell i can use for a good digging wand and being able to dig is pretty important to this game if you re going for a long run digging wands are also just incredibly convenient and helpful exploration takes a long time it s not a fast paced game at the start of a run you have to be pretty careful yet runs can end almost instantaneously and very anticlimactically at any time this combined with no form of metaprogression beyond unlocking new spells can really suck pixel by pixel simulation is interesting until you realize how much jank comes with it game crashes dying because you get stuck for a second on a single pixel you didn t see or get stuck in a wall liquids like acid or lava splashing up unpredictably touching a single pixel of fire and lighting on fire the list goes on enemies are kinda weirdly balanced one pet peeve is that many enemies will see you from much further away than you can see them love getting shot from off screen on some runs you ll run into a ghost carrying a wand from one of your previous runs if it s the beginning of your current run and that ghost is carrying a previous endgame wand well good luck with that overall i always feel completely over or underpowered compared to the enemies which doesn t make for exciting gameplay there is not a lot of guidance in the game it s simplest to use the wiki things like locations of interest or boss weaknesses resistances are purposefully cryptic this issue kinda comes down to personal preference but it s my opinion that in a game where experimenting and exploring new things is important you shouldn t be so severely punished for doing so punished as in going into a boss fight and dying in an hours long run because this boss is nearly impossible to fight with the current wand you re running also another hugely annoying feature is that you cannot modify wands outside of certain zones unless you have a particular perk that is nowhere near guaranteed to show up given that wand building is such a core mechanic and one of the most fun mechanics in the game this needlessly strict limitation is just annoying sometimes it feels like vanilla noita is a weird challenge mode of what could be a really awesome game because of limiting mechanics like this the game is just all around unforgiving for instance there aren t many ways to replenish health which gets frustrating in a game where there are about a billion little and hard to avoid ways to lose health like the aforementioned getting caught on fire by a single pixel even if you put the fire out quickly things like this slowly whittle your health away some perks you can get are downright bad for you i m not sure why they re even in the game unless you re doing some kind of meme or challenge run it s truly a one of a kind game with a lot of potential but it s really not for everyone because of its flaws enjoyers of this game often point out that any run can be won or any death can be avoided if you have enough experience knowledge and skill which yeah that s how all games work but you will bang your head against the wall dying in about a million ways before you get that experience knowledge and skill and even then the will sometimes be unavoidable there are so many unwritten rules in this game to remember and i personally just don t have the time it takes for all the trial and error to figure those out or find it fun to follow those rules at the end of the day you wouldn t really be wasting money buying this game and i can t say i regret getting it and the 150 hours i spent in it but it feels weird recommending it because it s one of those games you ll probably have a toxic relationship with unless you re a particular kind of player,149.8,46.0,6,Not Recommended,April 14,Noita,Gladish

85173,noita is a masterpiece at first the game seems very difficult but the interesting mechanics lured me in to keep playing i was originally looking for games like powder toy and powder game that used falling sand mechanics in an interesting way as a result i found this game day one and i ve loved it since even when the game didn t having over a hundred spells enemies and powers i loved the simple game loop of discovering what could be done with the different spells as a programmer and powder toy enthusiast this was the perfect game for me today the game has many hidden secrets that have even gotten me into cryptography and the strong community of players has really pushed this game far,641.6,42.0,2,Recommended,May 17,Noita,flaming
85174,2023 this game starts similar to terraria where you go underground and kill some simple mobs then you slowly learn how improve your wand crafting and spells you use and kill some stronger dudes in more dangerous areas and then you google map and see how much more there is start learning about different locations outside of main ones different quests you can have and a bit more about wands and spells and then you end up learning about spell draw rules and get into actual programming of wand crafting and read tens of guides on different topics and learn how to make 1m damage on a hit teleport to parallel worlds and destroy whole biomes with one shot of wands,168.7,35.0,2,Recommended,"December 31, 2023",Noita,"vidim888

85177,2020 tldr noita has fun parts sandwiched between incredibly punishing buns punishing in ways that aren t engaging in ways that you can t learn or improve from there s a thousand ways to die aka get noited many are sudden wands with electricity spells will emit sparks which fry you if you equip the wand underwater so you learn to respect lightning early game flask chucking alchemists can highroll acid and lava flasks which melt you in half a second so you learn to strike from afar when struck freeze barrels fly around propelled by leaking gas and can explode for more than your max health so you learn to keep your eye on the barrel end game wands have more than enough power to gib you with a ricochet so you learn to read before firing while such deaths may feel harsh they lead you to an improved approach for next time that s part of the gameplay cycle and i embrace it but then there s other times when the game gives you no choice but to die early game events totally outside your control worm spawns can trigger player punishment mechanics that spawn impossibly strong and practically unavoidable enemies into inter level safe zones the devs put in measures to reduce this but didn t remove it entirely interesting because it s not like they re being asked to solve global warming or cure aids this is their own game and they should have 100 control over it a not uncommon mid game enemy can stunlock you with huge painful aoe attacks extra fun when the knockback clips you into a few loose terrain pixels preventing you from moving the devs added a mechanic to free you from loose pixels but it doesn t kick in until after 10s by which point the ashes of your ashes have been reduced to ashes basic enemies can pick up and use world generated random wands instakilling you from outside your screen with a single long range end game spell there s no sensible counterplay barring possession of a real life rabbit s paw your best option for progress is to beeline to the next level s portal actively avoiding exploration in a game where exploration is ostensibly a core mechanic depending on your luck this paranoid approach may leave you pitifully unprepared for the final encounter and regardless of luck you ll have skipped much of the fun along the way nobody wants to end their hours long super careful run by getting their tits nuked off by an unseeable enemy it s frustrating and unfair to die unpreventably and as you get better at the game more and more of your deaths come from unpreventable causes you have no control you exert no agency you are no longer playing noita noita is playing you some hardcore masochists might tell you differently but i say this it s not the 80s anymore game technology has advanced to provide a better experience game design and philosophy should advance too,131.4,99.0,6,Not Recommended,"October 18, 2020",Noita,TwentyLetterUsername

85183,2019 early access review i bought this game the day it release into early access i guess i have to start out with saying this game will not be for everybody being a rogue lite this game will punish you like no other noita has only been out a week in early access now and i have already chalked up 40 hours well worth the 20 i spent and i am still going in games without permadeath i suffer from restart itis so this game is perfect for me the endless replayability is a key selling factor when i made this purchase coupled with the fact the devs have built such a unique engine i wanted to support them i would love to see what else they have in store for it this game is brutal you will die repeatedly i would say a good portion of my deaths were cause by my own doing as well oh this wand has a nuke spell well let s test it then and i m dead ooo this one shoots fancy blades hey these blades make the enemies bleed a lot more perfect for my vampirism perk i scored blade bounces off wall and lands in my skull ouch well i didn t like that wand anyway and i m glad i died i say lying to myself i believe the furthest i had made it was 800m down this game ramps up the difficulty like no other and became a practical bullet hell down that far this game is frustrating at times and i think everytime i closed it out it was me rage quitting and yet i still find myself firing it up again and again it has that one more go feel to it as well just one more venture into the depths you tell yourself but that turns into 5 more ventures because of a few unlucky runs that definitely didn t count oh look at the time i m late for work so if you like rogue lites and pixel graphics ain t a turn off for you then i highly recommend this game i cannot wait to see what it accomplishes in it s early access phase and i look forward to future releases from the noita team thanks boys and girls,89.0,26.0,1,Recommended,"October 4, 2019",Noita,Ghevd

85186,2021 this game has everything it needs to be amazing there s definitely no lack of content and the overall mechanics and level design of the game are solid it s a game i desperately want to love but i just can t it s just ruined by major issues that are so silly to me one of which is quality of life your inventory is so ridiculously limited and hard to manage in general in contrast to the immense number of things in the game most of those things are useless btw honestly a lot of skill in this game is just recognizing how much of what you find is junk or so niche that you shouldn t even bother with it but if you just wanted to have fun well you can t cuz you have no inventory to carry anything but the essentials speaking of which trying to have fun and experiment mostly just results in you dying let me tell you this game is so painfully slow that the comedy of your death does not outweigh the frustration of having to restart all over again this game isn t so much hard as it is you just progress so slow and die so fast it s not like you need to pull any crazy technical stunts i mean you don t even have a dash or sprint but if you aren t ultimately cautious all the time you can just drop in a second the oppressive difficulty and inventory constraints of this game make no sense with the vast amount of content that you could potentially experiment with you just end up doing the same thing every game cuz you literally have to to survive i just don t get it if you mod it i m sure you could turn it into a 10 10 game but as it is vanilla it s just not good i think for the first 10 20 hours you will enjoy it because your having fun learning what all the spells do and stuff but when you realize how limiting the game actually is in terms of what you should be doing to win and how you can t do anything fun because you don t have the inventory patience to backtrack it will probably kill you anyway you start disliking it more and more over time,244.1,43.0,3,Not Recommended,"December 21, 2021",Noita,Saint

85192,2021 noita is a lot of fun it s just not a great roguelike noita is part 2d platformer part twin stick shooter with roguelike elements inside a incredibly destructible environment but the one element that really stands out is the wand crafting each time you explore the world you ll uncover randomised wands that hold a variety of spells stats if you manage to survive each level you ll be able to swap the various spells between these wands the way these spells can interact can make for some insanely overpowered results usually ending in giant explosions of destruction combine a burning spark shot that on hit casts multiple lighting infused bombs or shoot out multiple projectiles that ignite the world on fire also cast black holes when they hit to rip the burning terrain apart the potential for building wands is huge it s the biggest draw for noita unfortunately i found the rest of the game to be a bit lacking in a normal run you make your way down through the levels to a final boss who by the time you get to can be a pushover one or two shots due to the overpowered wand you have made the world itself although somewhat proceedurally generated has the exact same biomes that extend out in more directions than just straight down there s some secrets to find the downside is it s a bore to traverse this extended world in multiple playthroughs it s tedious to keep travelling to pick up the same secret bonuses over over each run there s also no overall progression something that s desperately needed at this point to alleviate these downsides noita is still worth playing you ll have fun creating crazy wands destroying the environment however it just doesn t stand up in the other aspects because of this doesn t come close to the replayability of other more well constructed roguelikes,102.4,40.0,0,Recommended,"February 6, 2021",Noita,Bone

85206,2021 this game is not for everyone while i have spent at time of writing 200 hours on this game i would point out that there are aspects of this game that i have obviously enjoyed as i d hope to be the case for anybody that has spent a little over a whole week of their life playing i don t want people to be necessarily discouraged from playing this game by my review but i want people to know what exactly they are getting themselves into beforehand the issues i have will be listed in three parts in this order the games difficulty the time the game demands out of your life and the obtuse secrets involved but first a short rundown of my experiences before hand i had my first clear after getting about 70 hours of experience into the game i think i cleared with 6 or 7 orbs at the point of the map that i d explored and regrettably my rapid fire wand was also my drill wand i had to reset the game several times due to performance issues on later runs i learned that this could be offset by not making a luminous drill wand also shoot ranged bouncy projectiles while playing the game seems to encourage teleporting in out of holy mountains or drilling your way out of them so that you can come back later to edit your wands this means a ton of backtracking which i quickly got accustomed to after my first clear i decided to install some mods that would save me time such as more storage space for spells and items as well as a free tinker with mods anywhere perk at the start of the run i understand that this might seem like cheating to some players and i admit that aspects of this can at times feel a bit scummy but ultimately this level of cheating matters little in this game with how fragile the character is it doesn t matter if you re carrying around 5 tablets and 13 potions they aint gonna help ya tinkering with wands anywhere exists in the game and generally feels like a better way to play as you wouldn t need to spend as much time backtracking already explored areas this perk helps speed things up but if you can t find good wands or spells it aint gonna help you either around 100 hours in on a really successful and long run i picked up what i thought was going to be a spell and it was an elemental essence this started exploding things around me and i nearly died i turned off the game and installed another mod that would allow me to remove perks for a long while i d only used it the once but never actually removed the mod later i realized that using this mod would allow the gambling perk to generate infinite perks i did so once to see how op i could get didn t matter cause i got polymorphed and instantly died to exemplify my point about cheating while it doesn t feel good to do the game doesn t care and will still destroy you my max orb count is 21 and during that run i had started with every perk i could have wanted i d built god wands and had climbed a secret area twice for some special wands spent 7 hours doing this i just wanted to see what a max orb boss would have looked like to fight to see if i could make a wand that could beat him without looking online didn t get the chance polymorph and cheating aside let s talk about the main issues i have starting with that difficulty 1 difficulty i think that this is self evident by the fact that the game has weeded out half of the players before they were even able to get to the third stage everything can and will kill you you try to fire a wand you pick up and the spells are in the wrong order or configuration you re dead you step on the wrong pixel you re on fire spell bounces and hits a crate of explosives run over sometimes while experience can solve these problems sometimes things you can t explain or had no chance to deal with will end your run try to fire a wand that you know to be a safe wand at a distance but there is a single pixel that you couldn t see against the dark background that your projectile hit and you explode on the spot getting hit by enemy projectiles that spawn off screen or when an enemy unit picks up a wand that has an earthquake or nuke spell in it and fires it once these is nothing that can be done about some of these potentially game ending events 2 time investment this game doesn t care about your time i understand that rogue like games have permadeath and are supposed to be difficult but the sheer volume of content needed to actually complete the game takes so much time that you d have to be a monster to do it in one sitting which from what i can tell most rogue likes are made for the fact that you can lose everything after playing one file for over 7 hours is one of the most punishing things you can experience from a video game if you just want to get to the bottom and clear the boss this aint a huge issue but if you actually want to explore the bulk of the content this game offers you need to be fully ready to spend nearly a whole 24 hour day of your life on a single run some streamers that i have watched have taken 18 hours and i d argue that they are experts at this game to get the secret content behind this investment wall 3 speaking of secrets you won t complete any bonus content in this game without looking parts of it up you may come across notes on the wall in an area of the game and wonder about it but you d be suicidal to actually willingly explore the area the key is in without a purpose to go there i don t know if this was a glitch but when i finally obtained the musical notes i went back to that wall and the notes were gone i didn t think i d have to write them down other secrets are just as obtuse i don t want to spoil anything just in case what i ve mentioned so far seems like a great cbt time but there is a sequence of events involving statues that i thought were just decorations until i saw somebody kick one while i respect difficulty in videogames considering that i ve played vanilla and modded minecraft on hardcore several times in the past these traits tied together like they are in this game leads to a feeling that is generally more punishing than rewarding there are several things i think you must ask yourself before you ready yourself to sit down and play this game do i have a reaction time good enough to dodge projectiles fired from off screen am i smart enough or willing to learn the spell wrapping and speed augmenting wand building mechanics am i willing to let multiple hours of my life blink away instantly am i generally a lucky person if any of those are a no you might not have a good time with this game if you read my whole review thank you i don t mean to on this game but i don t know if i have much will to keep at it at this point i must commend the designers for making something that i got 200 hours of playtime out of was it enjoyment some of it sure maybe most but it s bittersweet update i have put in an additional 400 hours of playtime i have just now collected the final achievement i stand fully by everything i

85209,2019 early access review the game is everything that is advertised a great physics sandbox but after level 3 it turns into a very hectic bullet hell shooter and the fun of methodically interacting with the physics is pushed away because there is no time to pay attention to anything except for dodging enemies if they could tone down the bullet hell part so it does not get in the way of the main feature experimenting with physics then it would be one of the best physics based games in the last few years the game can still be hard at lower levels but the difficulty should be created from enemies slowly wearing the player down or cornering him so there is time to interact with the environment i like physics based games but i do not like bullet hell games difficulty should not be attached to speed of gameplay it should keep the pacing of the upper levels but make the enemies harder to kill without making their projectiles harder to dodge,125.1,468.0,45,Not Recommended,"September 28, 2019",Noita,c

85215,2023 there are exceptionally few games that i can recommend to the degree that i recommend noita the sheer amount of possibilities in this game is wild you can summon oceans of sawblades evaporate entire biomes or teleport across worlds there s no wizarding game where you feel as powerful or godlike as you do in noita while still being able to be instantly killed by all sorts of random mechanics you could never realistically never have foreseen this contrast is also what makes the game so fun being an omnipotent allmighty wizard holds no meaning if it s something you easily accomplish every restart the mechanics of wandbuilding in this game are so intricate that very few understand even half of it but you don t even need to understand all that much to have a great time the only negative thing i can think of is that there s not enough of the game although there s still probably upwards of 200 hours probably more if you do the longest quests in the game should you never consult the wiki with that said there s also quite a few content mods to be able to continue playing there s no reason to sit on the fence for this one,143.0,38.0,0,Recommended,"December 22, 2023",Noita,Exxu

85227,2023 short reviewthis is a game that i would highly recommend it s a fun experience with intricate gameplay fun mechanics and difficult enemies i have an issue with the bulk of the gameplay this game has to offer being hidden behind the secret post game but that isn t a big enough issue to not give this game a chance if you have a chance i recommend giving this game a try full reviewjust to preface this review all of my statements in this review are based upon my full completion of the game and interaction with all the post game content that the game has to offer with that out of the way i ll go into the aspects that i liked about the game and why i would highly recommend it while also giving a few cons here and there the pixel world interactions this is another one of the main appeals of noita you re in a world where every pixel has some sort of significance whether it be a benefit or a detriment to your well being you can have the ability to make new substances via some pixels have some substances increase or decrease your resistance to certain environmental factors have some substances influence your movement have some substances make you literally invincible one of the ways to access the secret post game and etc nearly every action you take in this game has an influence on your environment altering it for the rest of the playthrough something as simple as a fight with a basic enemy can create a death trap for yourself in the future or cause some substance to fall on you that near instantly kills you at times there are so many interactions that could be had with the pixel system in noita and it is hard to find a situation that is exactly the same between runs the biomes there are a slew of biomes present in this game actually a majority of the biomes are present in the secret post game rather than the main game so your average player won t get to see most of what this game has to offer in biome variety this is one of the main cons of the game that i will mention later but for now just know that this world is surprisingly vast there are secret chambers located in the depths of the earth housing powerful bosses vast landscapes hidden above the clouds in the sky treacherous environments hidden past the lava pools in the depths of the earth and many more goodies to discover the wand system the wand system is another one of the things that noita prides itself upon the system is ripe for the tinkering of creative minds each wand you find or buy has a base value associated with it and this helps determine the type of wand it should be tailored to for instance a wand with a fast reload speed and fire rate will likely be used for rapid sustained damage whereas a wand with a low reload speed and high damage will likely be used for high burst damage these traits allow you to make wands that act like gatling guns shotguns railguns miniature nukes black hole summoning death rods and many more varieties you will figure out what type of wand suits you best and the game enables you to cater your playstyle even further with your favorite wand type with the many shot types that exist the enemies bosses noita is very creative with their enemy design especially for bosses as you go through the different biomes they will have residents that are hard set on turning you into a pile of meat on the ground wall or whatever other surfaces your sticky remains would stick to the enemies in the harder biomes will make sure this happens very quickly if you aren t careful even if you have very powerful wands and perks heck even in the early game the enemies there will kill you very quickly if you play your cards wrong and i m only mentioning the basic enemies right now the bosses on the other hand are a different story if you aren t well prepared then you can expect a swift death bosses are a threat at basically all portions of the game you have a leviathan that lurks in the depths of the very deep lake to the west a dragon worm nestled inside an egg until you crack it open a deranged alchemist that can deflect any shot you hit them with on a whim and many more that are hidden or very visible throughout the map the post game this was quite the double edged sword for this game i would have to say a majority of my fun came from this section of the game but at the same time the method of reaching this post game is very convoluted and isn t explained well it is like the devs are actively trying to stop people from playing a majority of the content they ve made for the players i won t spoil how to access this post game however just know that there are likely not many individuals out there that could figure this out with the clues given within the game as before you reach the post game the gameplay somewhat punishes you for being too curious despite my qualms about the method of accessing and discovering the post game i believe everything behind it to be a joy it allows you to eventually ascend to proverbial godhood defeat new bosses enemies that you couldn t have beaten in the normal game have access to more perks experiment with more wand varieties and many more things it is a haven for experimentation and exploration but a hellscape for survival as a majority of this game venturing through the post game is very high risk but very high reward overall noita is a difficult game that is overly ambiguous at times but a very engaging experience many players that are fine with the difficulty will have a blast with the variety of enemies bosses the engaging wand system the interactive pixel environment and the bountiful biomes that are ripe for exploration i highly recommend giving this game a shot,63.4,21.0,0,Recommended,"May 16, 2023",Noita,"VinroyIsViral

85280,2020 when you start playing most of your deaths will be because you aren t skilled enough at the game s mechanics don t have a hang of the wand editing don t know all the physics interactions available etc etc after more time playing and you do know the mechanics when you won t be surprised by new enemies or combinations any more every death will be out of your control pick one of the many different ways the game has for instantly randomly and unavoidably ending a run get stuck on random invisible pixels while enemies hit you this is a bad enough issue that the devs had to add a feature to unstick the player by removing pixels nearby after you mash the controls for long enough without moving long enough to be killed before you actually get unstuck usually get shot with a wand from off screen or through a wall by an enemy you haven t seen yet get killed randomly in the safe area because a worm dug through it or because an enemy randomly teleported in and shot you while you had the menu open get insta killed because an electric enemy you haven t seen touched the ground off screen or behind a wall get suddenly doused in and insta killed by acid polymorphine or lava because the game teleports liquids upwards through ceilings floors including upwards through the floor of the safe area ie you can randomly get doused in liquids while standing inside the safe area doing inventory management the game also leans extremely hard into a lot of dumb git gud isms in its game design whose sense of accomplishment is almost entirely undercut by the fact that even after you git gud all you are rewarded with is the bs listed above i have beaten the game many times and done a decent chunk of the secret content once you understand the spell combos and physics mechanics it is actually quite easy usually there will be a wand in the last area or two which can basically 1 shot every enemy in the game including the final boss as long as you don t get randomly zapped from off screen on the way there or get one of the few extremely overpowered perks again a lottery i never felt any sense of accomplishment from this game even after my first win i knew it was mostly a result of the rng dropping good wands and not dropping any insta deaths in my path i played because i am a fan of traditional roguelikes and was a fan of the many powder games on the web back in the day and the basic physics and spell combination are still cool it is fun to blow up the little enemies and then kick their dumb little bodies around the game would be a lot more fun if it actually let you do this stuff in a way that it didn t punish you for it is a real shame that such a unique premise for a game had to be developed with such a terrible sense of game balance and such brazen disrespect for its players i regret spending the time i did with this game if you think the premise sounds cool my recommendation is wait and hope the devs open source it or modders can make some kind of total rework mod to fix its worst aspects because playing it in its current state will only poison your opinion of it until then edit played a bit more after the 1 0 and epilogue updates all the problems i mentioned still exist along with several new ones i guess my 1 0 review is amazing premise decent technical execution extremely poor game design,309.2,61.0,2,Not Recommended,"December 18, 2020",Noita,vede

85290,2021 noita is the best game i cannot in good faith recommend to you right now it s an interesting and innovative take on the roguelike formula and its myriad of good points can be found in other reviews but in its current as of now 1 0 state i have difficulty recommending it the cause is a game design choice that when it happens to you is borderline unforgivable and usually instantly run ending to the point of souring the rest of the experience in noita between the main levels of the game there is a shop rest area a temple where you can buy spells and wands and is the designated place where you are allowed to edit the spells in those wands the core of the game s decision making you re encouraged to do this here because there are training dummy statues that tell you the amount of damage your spells do and anywhere outside of the temple you will be unable to re edit your wands if you ve made a mistake unless you are lucky enough to find the relevant perk that allows to to do so the problem comes in the fact that in noita almost everything is destructible if you try hard enough the brickwork of the temple is remarkably resilient compared to the average material in the game but with determined effort and ingenuity it can still be excavated by the player doing this is a huge cheese on the game as it allows you to go back to previously visited areas keep your wand editing powers have a permanent safespot etc etc so in order to counteract this there is a system in place where if too much structural damage to the temple area occurs you will have angered the gods causing an extremely powerful and dangerous lich like enemy to spawn in the shop to destroy you in retribution that means you can do it but unless you re prepared for the potentially run ending consequences you re discouraged from breaking the game too hard all good so far the problem comes in the form that certain enemies and environmental hazards can and frequently do cause damage to the temple entirely without your interaction there are giant worm enemies that can spawn at any time and burrow towards sources of food the player and through any material including the temple there are spider like enemies in the jungle level that have the ability to burrow downwards to chase you acid burns through nearly any material and a sub type of enemy that can appear as soon as level 1 bleeds acid when you shoot it any of the following reasons or more can damage the temple beyond the point the gods are willing to tolerate often without your even having seen it causing said enemy to appear and more often than not kill you before you have a chance to form a contingency plan fun not fun the devs gave a token effort to remedy this problem in the form of crystal that repels digging worms in a small area around the shop but it is woefully inadequate at its only designated function worms frequently dig through the rightmost area of the shop farthest from the crystal despite it and the spider enemies and acid are entirely unaffected by it the lead dev has expressed in interviews that he thinks this random interaction can be a source of fun for a run and experienced players will hand wave this glaring issue with the game as acceptable because the strong enemy can technically be killed and even cheesed if you are experienced but with the overall length of time it takes to get a run going compared to the relative frequency of these occurrences i can t classify it as anything other than an egregious oversight in an otherwise refreshing and compelling roguelike in my experience with the game so far you will have a worm thoroughly ignore the anti worm crystal roughly 1 in 20 runs and if you get a run deeper down into the game to the jungle where the spiders hang out they will ruin your day while tinkering with your wands roughly 1 in 5 runs for a game where a good run can take 1 2 hours just to get started this is a huge blow to enjoyability edit from more play experience the other hidden danger is literally hidden information most good roguelikes do a pretty good job making sure any mechanics are well explained and information is not unduly hidden from you so that you feel like any deaths are strictly your fault and not the game s noita does a reasonable job providing useful information about its spells and mechanics but frequently hides critical hidden information from you about its spells and perks that can end up hobbling or outright ending a run this shouldn t be confused with me complaining about secrets which also frequently kill you or the usual roguelike self inflicted yasd or an unknown enemy one shotting you that s normal roguelike behavior for instance there is a perk that tells you it reduces spell spread at the cost of increasing spell recoil no problem there however if you pick it you may suddenly notice that your spells also take longer to cast a downside entirely unadvertised in my case it turned a tuned primary wand from my best combo weapon to non functioning all because i picked up a perk with hidden drawbacks wands can have similar hidden passives based on what spells they have slotted electricity spell wands will instant kill you if you enter water for more than a few seconds fire spells can set you ablaze from the flaming tip of your wand noxious gas can come from wands with toxic spells equipped none of these are advertised effects you will eventually die to one of them you didn t know about before or worse forget about one you ve already died to and it won t be your fault in addition for wands that have an auto cast spell you cannot hover over the tooltip of the spell to find out what it is unlike a normal slotted spell don t know what spell that symbol is too bad hopefully it doesn t get you instantly killed finding out my recommendation is that if you commit to this game you should break the unspoken rule of roguelikes and look up as much information about spells and wands as you can from outside of the game the spell lab mod is particularly great at this as it has a challenge mode that explains hidden spell mechanic interactions that can help you get the most out of what does exist in the

85293,2021 noita is my 2020 game of the year it s a rogue like fan s dream with 90 perks 330 spells 136 enemies procedurally generated maps and seemingly limitless wand variations that all keep every run feeling meaningfully different i almost always play warrior classes in fantasy games because magic just never feels as satisfyingly impactful as cracking enemies in the head with a giant hammer noita is the first game i ve played where magic truly feels like an absolutely devastatingly powerful force to be reckoned with that can easily kill the user if they cast the wrong spell at the wrong time spells in this game interact with each other in such an incredible meaningful way that it puts every other magic system in other games to shame i am just under 66 hours into this game have only found 203 of the 330 spells currently in the game and i still am finding new ways to combine spells for absurd and or op outcomes don t worry though you ll still find a way to fail your run even with the most op feeling wands i would consider myself generally good at video games and i have only won 2 of my 278 runs in this game that s roughly a 0 72 success rate my first win finally happened around the 50 hour mark this is a hard but extremely rewarding game according the the current achievement data only 11 5 of people who have played this game have beaten it and a winning run takes about an hour or less if the enemies don t kill you the environmental hazards will if the environmental hazards don t kill you your own poorly timed spell casts will it is unforgiving but entirely fair and every run feels meaningfully different even at the 66 hour mark i highly recommend playing it,102.3,26.0,2,Recommended,"January 9, 2021",Noita,"Final Contra

85311,2019 early access review this is how you design a roguelike game the game is everything they promised and even more my hope is that they improve the game to make it even bigger and better the gameplay is already incredibly fun but things i d like to see are different starting characters with pros and cons think about binding of isaac optional boss miniboss vaults more spells more perks more levels this is already a fantastic game as it is right now let s hope they can make it into a masterpiece edit every new update seems to add new spells and perks and the latest one was also mentioning a secret boss,71.1,29.0,2,Recommended,"October 5, 2019",Noita,RandomPal
85312,2019 early access review an absolute blast to play picked this game up after seeing a 30 second clip on twitch and haven t regret it for a single moment while playing the game gameplay is what you get if terraria and magica hooked up at a bar and had a roguelike baby that grew up to do crack while some people say it s somewhat shallow and too difficult i think it s just the right mix to where you can experiment but still play an incredibly fragile character the only thing that is stopping this game from being great is a lack of character progression i wish you could start with different spells or even something as simple as starting with a different outfit outside that and some very minor balance issues i have no gripes with this game and easily recommend it to everyone this game has a ton of potential and i m keen on seeing where it goes also i forgot to mention that the soundtrack to this game is absolutely great,191.1,23.0,5,Recommended,"October 8, 2019",Noita,"Fat Sacks

85346,with roguelikes being such a huge easy to make indie genre i often find most of them to be rather underwhelming but this one stands out as a shining diamond among the rough everything from the physics to the alchemy to the spellbuilder to the ridiculous vastness of the world encourages exploring thoroughly and being as creative as possible this game will be more than happy to kill you over and over but as you learn about the spell system each run becomes less of a matter of your luck and more a matter of being crafty with your wands and that craftiness is rewarded in kind as you become an unstoppable wizard god highly recommend,201.5,21.0,0,Recommended,September 1,Noita,FridgeDuck

85357,2022 at just under 100 hours and over 250 runs i finally beat this game last night by every rule of game design i should despise it the game hates you every pixel which you can use to your advantage can be used against you every cool wand you build can probably kill you as well i m sure that the devs were sitting in their chairs cackling as they added yet another niche mechanic that no one would ever discover or another enemy to one shot you at the wrong place and time or cool looking item that kills you with just a little wrong use and yet i love this game it s addictive the wand building is godly and the physics adds an extraordinary depth there are just so many mechanics to explore exploit and get killed by make sure you have the wiki open though,129.4,20.0,1,Recommended,"June 2, 2022",Noita,isloe

85367,2020 early access review the core gameplay is fine and the game may seem fun for a first couple of days but then problems become apparent the main one is there s too much randomness no matter how hard you try to beat the game random events always can screw up your run sometimes worms show up and anger the gods without your intervention sometimes a random ukko stun locks you from the dark and sometimes the game refuses to give you any decent wands if luck is not on your side your skills and tactics eventually become irrelevant level layouts are frustrating contain lots and lots of dead ends and require constant backtracking especially in early stages most of them essentially resemble labyrinths with no structure or plan so navigation attempts turn into meaningless random wandering the absence of a map doesn t help as well all seeing eye makes things better but it s pretty rare land exploration is boring due to large distances and overall emptiness there s no portals or waypoints to help you revisit places you ve been to and teleportation wands aren t a good replacement some world regions are boundless and if you wander far enough the game may crash as far as i can see this game is suitable either for absolutely hardcore players who are willing to invest large amounts of time in it or for very casual players who simply enjoy simulation and physics and do not care about beating the game only 13 of players killed the final boss which kinda proves my words,66.7,25.0,1,Not Recommended,"September 19, 2020",Noita,Van_Der_Lokken

85382,2023 game is fun some of the time early game takes too long try to speed through and you have no money to buy anything or re roll perks going slow and taking you time means you will find more hidden wands and items but by the time to get to the interesting weapons and perks you have been slogging for almost an hour finding anything interesting or useful is not guaranteed either plenty of people love the game look at the reviews and i did at one point but the tedium is becoming very apparent i think there is a good game buried under there that shows itself every one and a while but the time fun ratio is too off for me tl drearly game is too slow and boring for the amount of times you will be playing it mods might be able to fix but this review page is for the game not mods as a side note the physics of the world kinda become blah after some time a lot of emphasis on things burning and this also takes way to long tons of floating single pixels you will get stuck on you are also apparently wearing a nylon robe soaked in lighter fluid,79.5,18.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 21, 2023",Noita,"JS16

85386,2019 early access review note i made this review during early access so this may be subjected to change in the future you like those falling sand flash games you like roguelites do you like those two things slammed together with a hint of wizardry if so noita is probably the thing for you though still in early access it s surprising how much stuff there is in this game already while at the same time holding allot of potential for all kinds of new things too the main selling point of every pixel is simulated is what you would expect thing s burn freeze melt or react with stuff to create a domino effect of events to destroy the world around you some small key features such as the dynamic music sounds also make the world burst with life in some places the soundtrack has a trippy magic feel that you would expect in a game centred around wizardry or magic stuff every wand is not only randomised for each new world generation but can be highly customised with new spells to create either a powerful weapon or a horrible abomination that can even kill you one feature that i love from the rest is the game s world itself though you got the underground itself which is the main area of the game that holds not only many unique areas that contain their own themed enemies but also holds many small sub areas that hold their own style too if you are as curious as i am you d attempt to use the newly learned abilities with certain wands to dig your way out of the game s mountain and either go left or right both have their own unique areas filled with all kinds of secrets for you to find noita essentially creates an entire world for you to explore and piece together my only issue which is probably just my personal opinion is that there is too much open space and not many things to find besides a pyramid on the right and a wickerman on the left it would be nice to see things occur on the world around you like a small castle or a graveyard though that doesn t ruin my experience with how the game is played already not only does it have a good amount of replayability but a good challenge to go along with it with that being said i feel like this game won t be for everyone there are some that may not really enjoy game s like these or just don t like the difficulty and that s totally fine though i hope that doesn t discourage you from giving this game a try to put it shortly noita is great and though it has allot of stuff already for you to enjoy it also has allot of potential for future content though still in early access and may need some polishing around the edges the game is still enjoyable none the less tl dr noita in early access alone is surprisingly enjoyable and decently big though rough around the edges which is expected for an early access game,885.7,19.0,0,Recommended,"October 7, 2019",Noita,Sheep™
85387,2020 if i could give this game a neutral rating i would on a technical level this game is a masterpiece it s just like those 2d physics demos i played as a kid scaled up to an actual game and watching it in motion is something anyone will find enjoyable my initial experience with the game was very positive the systems looked deep and interesting and exploring was very fun i died a lot but that seemed fair since i didn t know to be cautious yet and starting a new game was very addictive 70 hours later i am starting to really regret putting so much time into this game the problem itself isn t that the game is difficult nor that some deaths are unfair the problem is how your enjoyment of the game is extremely dependent on rng once you understand the flow of the game very few runs are any fun at all because of how rare it is to find decent wands spells i will have runs go two ways 95 of the time i end up with a sub par wand that can t carry me further than the first few floors and i die a slow death while cautiously trying to find another and 5 of the time i end up with an op godwand that completely breaks the game this is mainly because very few spells are actually useful the spell system looks very interesting on the surface but once you ve played for a bit you ll realize how few interesting spell combinations there are most useful builds are either projectile with extreme rate of fire need to find a good wand or op spell finding lightning bolt early guarantees you can make it through most of the game on a similar note the perk system looks interesting and deep but there are way too many useless or outright bad perks that dilute the pool of available upgrades and seem to only exist to trick new players it feels like the developers wanted to make sure there was a ton of stuff in the game without considering much if that stuff actually added or detracted from the experience there are basically two ways to play the game you either take it extremely slow to be safe and explore this is how i would play initially which increases the chances of finding stuff but also increases the risk that you ll have wasted lots of time on a dead run or you rush past everything to the first area of the game where there is guaranteed to be decent wands i leaned more towards this approach as i grew more frustrated with the game anything in between will get you killed all of this wouldn t be such a problem if the early game was at least enjoyable but it quickly becomes a tedious slog because of how little variation there is in how the levels play out and a feeling of well i guess this run won t be fun either sets in very quickly unless you can find a good wand i don t know about you but i feel like if your game is only fun if a 20 sided dice lands on a 1 something is wrong it is very telling that many of the most popular mods reduce the amount of randomness and add quality of life changes such as hp pickups longer lasting gold and reworked perk mechanics i don t think the game needs to be easier but it needs to be more consistent i really really wanted to love this game but i feel like for how much time i ve put into it i haven t gotten a lot back,187.2,36.0,1,Not Recommended,"October 27, 2020",Noita,"Fewes

85389,2020 early access review ok where to start i played this game for over 60 hours and had a lot of fun but fun ends when you realise that almost everything makes you die in a split of a second dying in explosions only fun first 10 times dying in poison fun only first 5 timesdying because you stepped in teleportation liquid and i teleported you into cluter of enemiesdying because someone shot you with the projectile while you were flying over lavadying because you had a staff that sparks sometimes and ypu stepped into waterdying because something overhead exploded and a fallen rock hit youdying because creatures you summon expired their love meter and this really should be fixed one of the few things i am actually consider a bug i mean you can t even tell they are going to turn on you in a second you stepped in polymorph liquid you turned to sheep and they killed you instantly because as sheep you have like 10 hp you took an electricity perk you dead because all barrels now explode when you near thembut the most cases of dying is from your own spellsyou fould an explosion spell you dead you found a coolest barier spell that kill everyone that walk into it one pixel in front of you when you cast it you deadyou found a lightning spell you fire it close to the wall you deadgiga gravity hole or something kills you because it is doing damage unlike smaller version and you cast it on urself saw discs bounce from the wall to ur facegiga saw disc im not ganna spoil it for you last time i picked a wand with spells fireball droppler ball and something else exploding too thet wand would cast them all at once i knew all thouse spells so i picked a safe spot being in the air and casted i exploded for some reason maybe i had a pixel of earth in front of me or something and stuff like that happens all the time lots of this situations i had could be avoided if i were a bit more careful or used a special cast this spell some distance away modificators but before you get to level 5 you would die the silliest ways possible 50 times or you would play very boring or you luckysonofbitch i really don t know how to fix this because at the same time all this stuff makes game fun but you can t use it because it will kill you if you make the tiniest mistake only thing i can suggest to make some situations better is a spell modifier you recieve only x of damage when damaging youself with the spell edit most of the things above valid after going out of early access,66.0,28.0,3,Not Recommended,"February 21, 2020",Noita,toxast

85417,2023 noita is a game you should experience its ost is fantastic and you should give it a listen and perhaps even support the artists for their amazing work if you agree it s sold at reasonable price with a recent sale a few weeks before originally writing this on 2023 02 25 at half off making the price even more enticing it has a lot of similarities to metroidvania titles probably mirroring terraria the most but with an incredible sandbox in which you customize your own tools and weapons with the wand system the depth of the sandbox is exaggerated by every pixel being simulated and multiple tools the player can use to modify their world the roguelike has enough variation to provide endless replayability there s even a mod to play the game with co op so you can enjoy it with friends you should absolutely get noita and then mod the crap out of it save scum if you re frustrated the truth is this is a negative review because the review system asks would you recommend this game to other players and the answer is no i would not recommend this game to players i would recommend what noita can become with modifications to it from passionate players but not the noita we re sold it s unpolished with major bugs that directly interfere with the scientific gameplay this game otherwise encourages because of things being inconsistent or justified more by programming logic errors than by intuition or the emergent gameplay mechanics that noita shines because of noita can become a game worth playing so can borderlands 2 both share the attribute of requiring inappropriate amounts of effort from their players for the games to become what they should be already i am part of the group of people that loves borderlands 2 i have over 3000 hours in it i ve played bl3 for over 1500 since then and i ve come to realize that our relationship with bl2 can only be described as a form of stockholm syndrome i would not recommend anyone play bl2 without a save editor as doing so requires a supreme lack of self respect likewise i would not recommend anyone play noita without save scumming or mods noita will have projectiles spawn inside of you when they shouldn t from the other side of walls they aren t meant to be able to pass through from enemies that can t take damage because they re too far away the game thinks that means it doesn t need to process their collision anymore despite that they can still attack just before writing this review i killed the final boss twice in a row within a few seconds while in a fresh run because it came back to life after the portal meant to spawn upon its death had already appeared noita will leave harmful pixels in your path that you can t see blending them perfectly with the background and making little effort to provide an experience where what you see is what you get in those edge cases that are unfortunately all too common noita will have important objects from simple holy mountain statues to rare stones simply clip through terrain into oblivion never to be found again noita will crash and corrupt your save file directly punishing you for investing time into longer runs noita will ask a lot of you then give you very little with the probabilities assigned to important resources designed to yield many poor experiences before another good one comes along noita s idea of difficulty is to have enemies that are either invisible or so veiled by darkness or so far away or some combination of all of those that you can t see them sniping at you from well outside of your range and with enough power to obliterate you before you can react it s these enemies having reflexes that involve the player being shot literally the first frame they can have line of sight after rounding a corner usually because they can skip their telegraph animations at will it s having projectiles clearly meant to go in random directions just happen to always hit you from off screen at higher speeds than they normally travel it s having a single pixel of poly or ice that spawned inside of you and then the wasd spam escape system mysteriously stops working right when you need it most able to ruin everything you ve worked toward or giving you enemies from 4 stages ahead within the first stage or starting you off with a flask of acid a wand that runs out of mana immediately and another that doesn t have enough ammo to dig through all the vines growing everywhere just to spite you it s enemies that spew many of the infamously dangerous pixels when they attack you then bleed exponentially more of them when you shoot back it s having dangerous tanks hidden in piles of snow and electricity based traps guarding loot everywhere even as early as the first stage and that s not about the obvious traps with wires connecting to a power source that s opening a chest near liquid the game is unnecessarily cruel and not in a way that feels difficult but in a way that feels disrespectful and toxic for a game so heavily focused on experimentation experimentation is often punished with strategies that work well eventually no longer working without explanation or change of circumstance it really does not feel like the game is meant to be played as a roguelike and comes across more like the tired old arcade formula designed to eat your quarters major milestones in noita are achieved via concerning means advanced combinations of perks usually involve having an integer overflow or exploiting whatever the hell the perk removal altar is doing the length and value of runs is extremely constricted by the rng including for experienced and resourceful players even before considering that worms may spawn and tear apart important terrain or anger various gods without any consideration of the player s actions for many bosses every interesting mechanic that makes them need to be learned instead of steamrolled by the same build as every other is accompanied a cheap way they can ruin the fight and encourage the player to not bother with them until they can be defeated instantly it s even more of a requirement that bosses be defeated quickly when kiting them involves a real risk of the boss getting bored wandering off into some unfavorable terrain and possibly even becoming impossible to track especially if they re randomly teleported away by an unlucky displacement spell after all of that you ll get a run where an overpowered spell or series of them or reagent is available to you near the start of the run so the rest of the run feels automatic and uninspired the amount of spells perks and reagents to combine lets you experience a delightful curve of power growth with seemingly endless fuel for creativity found in all of the projectile delivery systems payloads and special effects that may provide raw power defense or some other utility i d be surprised if the game wasn t somehow turing complete with computers able to be built in noita out of strange logic gates made out of an awkward arrangement of entities and pixels of terrain and fluids i must reiterate how incredible the soundtrack is and that you should definitely play and experience noita but noita is a video game not an album of music it should be playable and too often it doesn t feel like it is it does however feel like the game s code is a whole kitchen full of spaghetti it s needed an update for 2 years now make the friend boss tanky again,282.8,45.0,7,Not Recommended,"February 25, 2023",Noita,"Hextator

85418,2021 most runs tend to peter out early on simply because no good spells drop so you re stuck facing continually improving enemies with a stagnating set of tools you can play flawlessly but still struggle flounder and eventually die an unsatisfying death simply due to sheer luck in many games where death is frequent the levels are so short that it doesn t matter however noita is a rogue like and a very long one at that if you want to do any of the interesting things anyway spending hours and hours hunting for spells that might let you stand a chance against the next onslaught only to die from a random explosion is incredibly frustrating worse yet are the many many times where you slowly bleed to death because all of the randomized drops are garbage noita can be exceptionally fun when it works but it rarely does there are a lot of incredible ideas here but it is impossible to really explore those ideas the spell programming gameplay is innovative and fun but held back severely by the randomized drops that often give you the same boring useless garbage a world of secrets and intense challenges would be fun to explore but spending hours and hours and hours repeating the same 4 5 stages just to get there is too tedious to justify ultimately noita does things that i wish more games did but not all at once,265.4,32.0,0,Not Recommended,"November 1, 2021",Noita,"Ambition

85424,2023 i believe that noita is probably one of the best games ever made if you don t value your time in order to get good enjoyment out of the game sacrificing time is required this starts to border on unreasonable when you need to spend hours getting out of the earlygame jail and a single mistake sends you back to the start if it gets better with all the ingame knowledge acquired this isn t known to me as i refuse to spoil myself to the game nor wish to bruteforce all the possible solutions for certain mechanics that time expended racks up extremely fast without either modding the game to make the conditions to learn things easier cheating the permadeath system by backing up your save or spoiling the game experience by using the community driven wiki additionally it sometimes doesn t feel like knowledge is truly power with certain bad starts i know it s a funny roguelike trope to just get bad starts dealt by the game but if you reach the fourth zone and get little resource it is usually faster to restart the run unless you just want a run w instead of trying to hunt secrets the gameplay is fun and when something clicks or you get actionable knowledge it is extremely satisfying such as basic alchemy for removing toxic sludge wand crafting likewise is fun basically a mini deckbuilder within the combat system the enemies are also quite good with the later ones acting as a soft deck check if you wish to explore the secrets of noita the time spent during progression however such as the abysmally slow earlygame is not you spend a high amount of time in churn imo noita would be significantly better as an rpg with how unforgiving the game can be the roguelike elements specifically permadeath and to a lesser extent the spell weighting system serve to be a deliberate pain point and causes a lot of start and stop if you hold no qualms about removing tedium or degrading the game experience by looking up resources this is a good game framework for the player to customize as they wish for context i haven t bothered killing the final boss a single time because i ve been more invested in exploring the game world i ve killed four of the world bosses so far i ve found out how to empower the voiceless key and found a handful of orb locations i don t consider myself far in,110.9,21.0,0,Not Recommended,"October 22, 2023",Noita,mik
85432,2021 it s not so safe a place in the underground world of noita expect to die a lot with little to show for it but what you ve learnt in your time below which is where it gets hard to review i like noita really like it even but i find it hard to give it a solid thumbs up there s just something that sits wrong with the game for me and i m pretty sure i know what that might be progression or lack thereof noita really does leave you with nothing to show for a previous run you ll gain no new abilities no new spells no attribute points or perks it s very much an entire reset each time you die this would make for a fun mode perhaps but for me and many others it can leave you feeling like there could just be that bit more to things i won t be thumbing noita down it doesn t deserve that at all quite the opposite but i do want to stress that noita is not a game to feel you ll make clear progress in you won t it s not a game where you ll get to prepare for another trip down and purchase better robes armour to protect you and more powerful wands spells to fight with maybe it will have that mode one day but at time of review it isn t that game that said noita as it stands is still fun and interesting to take a trip into give it a go if you like the look of it there s a lot to discover,205.7,53.0,1,Recommended,"January 1, 2021",Noita,"Data

85462,2023 this game really drives how just how god awful my rng is not helped by chat integration i get that it s not mandatory to turn it on but if it s there it s totally mandatory to turn it on so far i ve gotten to be good friends with steve learned that our character is made of gunpowder and found a whole ton of wand combos that don t work but it s fun it s addictive i ve gotten almost nowhere i ve run into bugs where my records reset constantly and aren t keeping track and found that a single unseen pixel can be the greatest enemy as you can get stuck on it still i play it i get a kick out of it and my chat gets a kick out of killing me though the game has been punishing due to my gut reaction of go deeper i m in trouble go down find the portal for safety response vs go up you cleared up there it s safe reactions the art is very simple but very good mechanics aren t really difficult but have enough combinations that it s able to give a deepness every time i play i find a new mechanic such as eating i thought i was filling the bottles faster but i was just drinking the fluids i was standing in i made my character sick by eating veggies and thus i had liquid i could use for fires which was unpleasant but useful so it s fun to have hours into a game and still figuring things out would i like more progress yes would i like some sort of check point system yes but i understand this kind of game doesn t do that really it s just hard to keep visiting the snow biome and getting sniped would probably be easier but my rng just beats me like i owe some cosmic entity money overall graphics are a style i personally find appealing music wasn t mentioned but when the music plays it s a great mix quite jazzy controls are very tight quick responses to clicks and attacks fps or performance is perfectly fine but i have a 12700k with 32 gigs of ram and a 2080 i did have people express concerns about acid but i ve had zero performance issues physics aren t bad when using attacks related to them arcs are okay ish for aiming or working with bounces variations in attacks are pretty wide i find a new spell weapon every time potions add a lot of variations as well for clearing things story what story oddly enough i have a lore aholic in chat who told me about this stuff it s using a ton from finnish lore we are essentially playing baba yaga we can eat anything organic and we are fighting other finnish mythos so finally this is an easy recommendation while i got it on sale it s still definitely worth 20 the built in chat integration alone makes this a great streaming game 95 hours i beat it once on stream with chat against me constantly and summoning steve worms lava and blasting me that didn t count finally beat it again with a wand i want to build again i almost died because the final boss dropped a floor of lava on me but thank goodness for the freeze field perk helping me out along with berserkium holy cow though 95 hours to get through the one i haven t even started on the other bosses yet ran into one at one point that i couldn t hurt with anything i had so i guess the journey continues,110.1,17.0,3,Recommended,"January 27, 2023",Noita,artimid

85487,2021 general premise is good from a technical aspect the game is amazing but there s way too much rng at play here for me to really recommend it to anyone you pretty much know before you get to the fourth stage whether or not you can actually get a win you either get good rng and get the items necessary to get a clear win or you don t and you die in hiisi base let me break this down a bit further so there are certain what i d call keys i suppose that the typical player will need to be able to make it to the bottom of the world kill the final boss and complete the basic game for a victory you need a wand that can inflict enough damage to kill your enemies you need a tool to dig and you need enough sustain to last between heals in the holy mountains there are a lot of ways to go about this but the game is completely random about what you do and don t get so on one run you might get unlucky get no wands that can inflict any damage that s notably better than your starting wand get no health increase pickups beyond the guaranteed 10s in the holy mountains and have no way to bypass enemies you can t fight by way of digging and simply die once the enemies become too strong and too tightly packed for you to run away from aka when you get to stage 4 hiisi base or alternatively you might get lucky get 4 25 health pickups and a wand with multiple black holes and another that s got 250 base mana 100 mana regen spark bolt with trigger 8 slots a multi cast and multiple instances of chain saw and be able to literally rip through everything up to the stage 6 or so all before you hit your first holy mountain there s very little space in between whether or not you get the necessary things to get a win and whether or not you get outscaled by the enemies there are a few hidden static perks that you can go get to weigh things in your favor you can easily get 2 25 health ups guaranteed before your first holy mountain if you re willing to put up with running around doing nothing for like 10 minutes and you know they re there but that doesn t really amount to much it almost always comes down to wands and perk luck in the end you might as well just go play a slot machine you d probably have better odds of getting a win and i m saying this as someone who s got an 11 orb victory under my belt and has gone for 32 orb runs twice i want to like this game and in a lot of ways i do thematically it s great but the rng is too much with over a hundred games under my belt and quite a lot of time invested in guides and watching extremely skilled players play the game i ve won three times that s with knowing where everything is in ng exactly what combination of wands are good and what aren t what perks to go for what to skip what enemies to fight what to run away from and when the game is just too random in the unforgiving way mods help with this mods that add more items to the shop in the holy mountain by default particularly go a long way toward making noita more fair if you re the kind of person that doesn t care about achievements then modded noita will probably be something very fun for you to play it s honestly better than the base game in a lot of ways,214.8,16.0,0,Not Recommended,"November 6, 2021",Noita,Last Seraph

85525,2022 1 even if you play like a god you only achieve the bare minimum and are still at the mercy of rng so it s just not worth it going out of your way to play well when rng is going to make or break a run 2 one of the selling points wand crafting is barely present most of the time i ve literally never been able to craft an interesting wand because the opportunity simply was never there powerful combos are more interesting than powerful spells but the latter s all i ever found 3 spells are not that varied after a while it got really repetitive a lot of them are useless which is only exacerbated by how limited the inventory and the wand crafting mechanic is 4 criminally underutilizes it s own tech simulating every pixel is largely inconsequential for the type of game this is and during gameplay itself really makes me wonder if a roguelike was the best choice 5 i understand there are material interactions involving liquids and powders but this is also something nearly impossible to use it also feels either underdeveloped or underutilized not to mention using potions is a big hassle for no reason which barely pays off i m surprised that i d find a game that just rewards the player less and less the more they play i d argue this game is actually easier than something like cuphead but playing it is just not rewarding enough for me it asks for way too much patience for something that is trying to entertain and if my 58 hours isn t enough to get to see some then i d just have to move because this game isn t worth the effort anymore edit lmao at the manchild defense force apparently bombing a freaking review,66.6,26.0,10,Not Recommended,"January 17, 2022",Noita,JohnnyBoya

85568,2020 noita is an abusive relationship you learn to walk on eggshells learn when to dodge and when to take hits you learn to avoid anything toxic you are addicted and can t leave but you want to you know better than to try to snoop or explore otherwise you ll be punished but sometimes you have to or you won t make it to the next day you learn everything that the game wants from you and execute it perfectly but still get beat you have a good run or day sometimes and everything is great but then you do something or maybe you do nothing and you get killed it s not a game for everyone it s not a fair challenge like say hades but a brutal and slower risk of rain 1 if it were a 25 cent arcade game you d spend 100 just trying to beat it take the 98 positive reviews with a grain of salt i ve only got 18 hours on record which about 3 5 hours of which is probably just screwing around on the surface and while i haven t beaten the game the victory achievement i ve gotten to the 6th level which has only been accomplished by about 6 of the players and only by being extremely careful only about 1 3 of the players have even gotten to the second floor and getting to the second floor is stupidly easy compared to the later levels people recognize that it is a good concept but few have put the effort or frustration in few ever will noita is a good game on paper it s engine is fantastic the lore is interesting though it may ultimately prove lackluster but it s brutal and takes a lot of time and dedication for very minimal progress it doesn t give two licks about you exploration and curiosity is often punished it s a game that i think wants you to push past the punishment until you make it work through gameplay knowledge and rng you will have runs where your rng is bad and while you might be able to slip past enemies and get further without finding a lot of gold or getting a strong wand setup you will ultimately die truth is only about 12 of the people who buy the game get to the point where they are actually able to play it and have more consistent success some people have died 100 times without a win so the question is is this a game you will actually enjoy with 25 or less you could buy hades or risk of rain and they would be much more immediately enjoyable and accessible rouge likes if you only had 25 to spend on one game and only planned to play one game for a very long while noita would be a fine contender if you don t mind having minimal story and slow paced brutal exploration as the core game play mechanic and don t mind a game that doesn t keep your progress in any way from run to run but there d be much better options if you didn t want to be frustrated 90 of the time,277.3,18.0,1,Not Recommended,"December 22, 2020",Noita,Red Bread Froggy

85573,2022 conceptually the game is interesting and the graphics are great full stop that is it all the right bits put together in all the wrong ways the game is far to rng dependent which is a staple of the rogue genre they are going for however in noita the quantity of absolute trash the rng can serve up far outweighs the worthwhile drops resulting in the system just giving you absolute trash 90 of the time while you can mitigate this to some extent you do so by spending an absurd amount of time grinding out the first two levels ad nausea and getting gud as the fanbois like to say which is code for memorizing the insane quantity of absolutely opaque haha gotcha now your dead for the 1000th time with no meaningful progress mechanics this game throws at you all the while this grind will more than likely take place in the first two levels of the game which after about the 100th time of slowly and tediously combing every inch of each on every run trying to find any useful wands or spells will make smashing your face against the wall seem like more fun that this game so in brief unless you are willing to pump an insane amount of hours into learning the opage bs this game throws at you and love grinding the same two level of a game for hundreds of hours with no meaningful change to the gameplay or scenery or anything else then this game is not for you,158.4,18.0,2,Not Recommended,"September 30, 2022",Noita,strikebackstudios

85616,2022 it took too long to start to enjoy the game i cannot recommend it as is because the learning curve is too steep too many game mechanics are hidden or not well explained you should not have to google so much just to figure out what s happening that said i am now having fun with it but i had to basically study a book first a few suggestions explain spell interactions in game i e chainsaw removes cast delay modifiers apply to all spells in a spell group regardless of where they are placed wands loop around the end with multicasts or modifiers etc the noita wiki page has a lot of information and much of it should be on tooltips in game always show what spells you just cast like the wall in the holy mountain perhaps at the bottom of screen but have a few lines so you can see the instantaneous single chainsaw that is tough to land on and wouldn t know was there otherwise more room to store spells and items beginners don t know what to save or discard after 100 hours of play time it might be no problem since you would know what synergizes but i think it would be a lot more fun for beginners to experiment with more storage room more gradual difficulty scaling the final 1 of the game is way more interesting because you can finally experiment with cool spells until you know all the ways you can die you spend 99 of the time with next to no perks and spells tinker with wands everywhere always beginners need to be able to experiment with a variety of spells and will rarely get this absolutely essential perk pause time when the inventory is open it takes long enough to finally acquire something fun to experiment with dying while editing wands is a bit harsh introduce a softcore mode with save points so that beginners can get a taste for the full range of the game in less than 100 hours add an in game map have a fog of war if you want so that mid game players don t have to constantly reference a website,78.1,24.0,0,Not Recommended,"March 7, 2022",Noita,"Poopsecks

85617,2021 this game substitutes rng for actual difficulty this game wouldn t be so brutal if so many aspects of it were not reliant upon rng giving you a less than optimal chance there are so many situations in this game where just happenstance and luck leave you in a position where you cannot come out on top this is not good game design mistakes should be punished not falling into some situation that i was placed in because of rng and i haven t been given the tools to escape here s two examples i was having an amazing run i had a wand with chain lightning and a couple of augments to it to make it absolutely amazing i was sitting really pretty i spawn in on the third level i fall down the shaft and find there is only one direction to move in and it is absolutely full i mean probably 6 or 7 enemies including the gunner mama ones that spawn more and i was pigeon holed and had to fight them through 1 very small opening there was absolutely no escape but up and that was still a dead end so i could see myself coming out of that on the other side technically surviving but the next example was just absolutely unreasonable i also had a good run where i had a good spell and augments on a wand i got hit by the first shot of one of the enemies that when they hit you teleport you i was teleported right above the portal to the next level and then when i spawned in immediately teleported out of the spawn area leaving me without the hp spell refill and the opportunity to pick my perk or new wands or spells and teleported directly into a large open space full of enemies i was not prepared to fight rng just absolutely blasted me into the single worst possible situation to be in and i suppose technically this was my fault but being hit a single time by a single enemy shouldn t end a run who do people think that just substituting rng and unreasonable circumstances is just substitution for well thought out game design if you re going to procedurally generate a game you need to put in fail safes to make sure that whatever is generated doesn t insta gib me,64.8,23.0,5,Not Recommended,"July 22, 2021",Noita,"Famous Coal Miner, Paul Bunyan"

85629,2022 a game that loves to punish you instead of rewarding and if that s your thing you re welcome to buy it the gameplay is incredibly fun the game engine itself is unique and impressive along with it s stoner music it s a great experience until you re dead for the 50 000 time the game is incredibly unfair i m fine with a game punishing you if make mistakes but you ll die even if you ve been the most careful and calculated as you could random exploding items wands that kills you if you try them once massive amounts of enemies that comes out of the dark from all directions and you won t be a able to see with many rouge lites it s common to die a lot but each time you play again you ll get better and get better items i ve played 70 hours so far and the game rewarded me almost to none you ll hear the quote after you play it 100 hours it s going to be great but why to wait such an insane amount of hours to get good with 70 hours you ve already beaten most rouge lites by now like binding of issac enter the gungeon risk of rain and such why couldn t this game be more rewarding with much less time invested in it with dying for the most part there are many secrets and the world is huge but should you really spoil the game for yourself by watching guides on the internet for the game s fault being obscure i m not sure about it and yeah exploration would reward you with death for 99 of the cases in it s core it s a good game but the amounts of fruastration and time wasted on it doesn t feel worth buying it,167.2,29.0,4,Not Recommended,"June 15, 2022",Noita,Pieminator

85668,2022 this game has so much potential but ends up being incredibly annoying in a death by 1000 cuts way 1 the game leaves single pixels around and you collide with them i ve taken so much damage from getting stuck on one little dot spotting pixels is not a skill i want tested 2 tiny amounts of liquid are enough to apply damage over time to you but sometimes it doesn t this behavior is frustrating and makes deciding on safe positions quite difficult i want to be able to know if a surface is safe to stand on at a glance 3 the foreground and background can share colors and can be poorly differentiated this results is hitting things you didn t think you would and not hitting things you thought you should 4 enemies can attack you from off screen with no possible way of knowing they are there in advance this is genuinely bad design that is fixed on the sniper with a laser sight other enemies should also have attack tells when off screen 5 enemies have perfect aim including accounting for velocity this is even worse when they have homing projectiles making dodging difficult if not impossible the only solution is to burst the enemies down 6 there is very little healing in the game this means that all those small amounts of damage you take add up over time slowly wearing you down throughout a level until you make it to the full heal at the end i ve been playing nethack for 20 years i love taking advantage of details to win a fight but that is a turn based game i can take as much time to examine everything as a wish noita is real time but has a similar level of information density and my brain just can t keep up i can play the way i want which is run and gun and i will never make it past the second floor if i am cautious i can make it much farther but that makes a run take a very long time exhausting and frustrating me by the end i love the terrain system and wand system so very much but the game built around them does its best to wear you down which is not a satisfying experience,412.4,29.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 29, 2022",Noita,"Graftax

85724,2022 after beating the game a few times i ve come to the realization this game is too inconsistent to be considered a good game the amount of patience needed to have a good run is absurd for how quickly and unforgivingly this game can just instantly ruin all of it and 80 of the time you won t have a good run anyways since you ll just consistently get tier spells wands and modifiers that won t even mix well then the fact you need to be at a holy mountain or otherwise have a perk to edit wands is the stupidest ever if you do manage to make a good wand and all that it becomes how long will i be able to survive before i get one shot by something completely random and out of my control rogue legacy dead cells gungeon binding of issac risk of rain monsoon slay the spire and even 20xx are far better rogue likes even at their hardest difficulties since at least you can work with bad rng in those while in noita it s literally just going to erase you and make you restart the grind again good run or not i m aware there are good players who have insane patience and are willing to wait 20 or more min camping on a rock waiting for enemies to kill each other or die of random hazards or spells they re throwing down at them that s not an exaggeration pro s will literally camp on a rock for 20 straight min game is fun sometimes when you get something good going but reflecting on my overall experiences i feel like there s more frustration and bad vibes with this game than there are the few good ones when you get something decent going also the community from what i ve seen just likes sucking this game off saying it requires patience and just keep trying but i wouldn t recommend listening to that i wasn t able to beat the game til about 80 hours of playtime after which i just wanted to find other bosses and hidden things but it s so terribly boring and tedious and it doesn t feel like there s an actual point i just can t be bothered anymore,328.3,20.0,5,Not Recommended,"February 4, 2022",Noita,TheWrathofSolace
85798,2021 don t play this game if you respect your time while complex and impressive at some points most of the game is endless drudgery and the rng s repeated betrayals the loot quality in the game varies so much that the player s skill and or diligence does not matter at all past the first few hours not to mention the many instant death mechanics that mocks your time investment,929.4,19.0,2,Not Recommended,"April 14, 2021",Noita,Aluminum
85827,2021 i am writing this negative review because of a fundamental flaw with its game design people play games for various reasons will pick what games they play to fit their interest in that regard noita is definitely worth playing if you are interested in interactive environments exploration however the rules perimeters of the game seem to be set up to punish you for doing the very thing that the game does best the game has a wonderful system for designing wands but only allows you to tinker with them in a confined room that summons a powerful enemy if you damage the room the game has interesting environments that interact with both the player enemies but if you extremely limited health will die instantly to most interactions now you might excuse these elements as difficulty that is supposed to challenge the player encourage them to improve do better on their next run but if the end result is that the player deliberately avoids taking risks or interacting with the games systems what was the point of programming them in the first place if the correct way to play the game is not fun or more correctly only fun to a limited amount of players the game is failing to live up to its own potential it also supposes that it is impossible to have multiple difficulty settings something that the game already has but only to make itself even harder if you however for some reason beyond my comprehension like difficulty in the form of randomly generated traps i would recommend noita,252.8,21.0,0,Not Recommended,"June 25, 2021",Noita,grimmgrimur

86696,there is something great about this game there is a hand crafted world to explore in a hand crafted engine explicitly for it that has everything i wish terraria was there are so many cool things to go find unfortunately you aren t allowed to do any of that and are forced to repeatedly play the most streamer rage bait rouge like i have ever played imagine the binding of isaac but opening a chest has a small chance of just instantly killing you no matter how many hearts you have killing some enemies just has a chance to fill the room with lava or toxic gas that instantly kills you not does a lot of damage kills you people will tell you that learning is the fun of the game but opening a chest thats in water and having it spawn an electric item that instantly domes you for 200 damage when your starting health is 100 and health ups only give you 25 health is not learning i don t need someone to hold me down and whip me and tell me to keep having fun,97.6,16.0,9,Not Recommended,July 26,Noita,"phoenixfreeze
