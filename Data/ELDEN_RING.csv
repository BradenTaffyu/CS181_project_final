10171,elden ring was my first soulslike it was kinda overwhelming when starting but i had tons of fun in my first blind run like that s the great part of elden ring you don t have to be this awesome souls veteran to be able to enjoy the game you can just take your time with everything explore the beautiful world enjoy the view and smaller bosses the game doesn t push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere in game you re not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on until you re strong enough to continue your journey you can just keep exploring will eventually level up in the mean time if you re not getting any further with a specific boss then you can just leave it be for now and do hundreds of other things instead,535.7,771.0,5,Recommended,April 23,ELDEN RING,"Newtox

10181,2022 this being my first fromsoftware game i was a bit nervous about the difficulty as i m not usually a fan of hard content or very good at it but to my pleasant surprise it wasn t as daunting as i d thought it d be and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games the worldi can t remember the last time i had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game s open world and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming i spent something like 50 hours exploring limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls if i had trouble with a boss or an area i d just go somewhere else on the map until i felt ready to take it on and there s plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss creature summons were also a huge help and i was very happy with the options available trying out new weapons was fun and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all the gameplaymy first playthrough ended up being something like 300 hours long though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard to reach places to enjoy the view or leaving fellow players a message i also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies i wasn t quite yet ready to take on and there were two specific bosses that i had a really hard time with but finally beating them felt so satisfying and it was worth all the rage i d felt when dying repeatedly to them the multiplayeri asked for help from some friends at times and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others it s also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon when you re in a boss arena you can t be invaded so if you re worried about that you just have to limit summoning other players to when you re fighting bosses though honestly the invading wasn t as scary as i d expected especially when you have the option of asking a hunter for help i have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded times where we got absolutely decimated but also close calls that made us whoop or sigh in relief ending thoughtsi loved the npc s although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly also i don t care what anyone says fia s hugs are nice and warm seeing my character in cutscenes however few felt very satisfying especially as i can t help but dress up for that purpose alone lol the only bad experience i really had with the game was towards the end i absolutely hated a certain zone farum azula cough and it was the only zone i ended up trying to rush through moving around the environment was annoying especially because of the enemies it s also the only location where my game crashed multiple times i have to say the location boss was awesome though as was every main boss honestly the optional boss in the area was also one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game other than that i had a few stutters here and there but nothing too disrupting to my experience even if the game seems difficult i think giving it a chance is really worth it the game gives you a lot of options if you re struggling and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go suffice to say i m super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and i highly recommend the game also sometimes you really just do need to git guud i never did git guud myself tho,571.3,473.0,13,Recommended,"August 5, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Pippzu (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)

10187,2022 i bought this game out of spite because one of my best friends convinced me for the 5th time in a row that soulslike is for me even though i could barely be bothered to play up to the first boss in previous entries he s not wrong that the game seems perfect for me a character customization heavy arpg that actually makes the player work to play better not farm harder with mysterious lore gritty aesthetic and rogue like punishment yet time and time again as much as i want to be enamored by the game i find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving and default to things that are more forgiving i am weak but when i walked out of the gates and saw the lands in between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor i immediately identified multiple places i wanted to explore and i felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it of course the first thing i investigated reassured me that many things could in fact stop me from doing it that s actually what i realized i needed from other soulslikes i don t mind a linear path but i don t like feeling trapped in the same mistake when i m playing elden ring if i can t figure something out i don t feel like my entire experience is blocked i can walk away and go check out something nearby maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me i m always progressing even if i walk away that option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre what kept me was all the stuff i d hoped to get out of the other games the characters are vague but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder i actually feel like i m a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war i didn t feel important at the start but i slowly started to say wait you think i m not tough after i took down redacted i actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and i worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose and it was fun doing it i felt this way when i was a kid and played the legend of zelda for the first time the storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things going places but doesn t flood you with details dungeons are fun to explore and you know you ll get something out of them there are clear rules to getting to the end but your path there is mostly up to you it s wonderful now to be clear there are some issues i have the ui is pretty unintuitive the important things are difficult to recognize as such but honestly they re so small compared to the highs i really don t care if you want your hand held you ll hate this if you want to feel like you re discovering a new world that will constantly have you wondering if you can survive the next encounter and push a little further every day this is for you,125.5,651.0,12,Recommended,"April 19, 2022",ELDEN RING,SavvyKangaroo

10204,2023 welcome to elden ring a dying simulator this game delivers the entire experience in a way i ve never quite seen i m new to the souls like genre and fromsoftware games here are the thoughts i ve spent 200 hours in this game as of writing this and i ve barely left the starting area limgrave my nightmares consist of runebears traversing the mist and boss fights i ve been startled pillaged rekt and absolutely confused many times but i wouldn t change any of it i remember the first time i saw a giant i had attack on titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner captain levi it s just a blast an absolute blast the greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt you can feel your ability your reaction time your muscle memory coming more and more into play as you practice and it creates a thrilling experience struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you ve gotten is a very rewarding experience i was a bit nervous about the difficulty as i m not usually a fan of hard content or very good at it but to my pleasant surprise it wasn t as daunting as i d thought it d be and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games i can t remember the last time i had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game s open world and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming i spent something like 50 hours exploring limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls if i had trouble with a boss or an area i d just go somewhere else on the map until i felt ready to take it on and there s plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss discover new dungeons cave hidden item secret spells underground mini bosses etc summoning spirit were also a huge help and i was very happy with the options available trying out new weapons art was fun and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all even if the game seems difficult i think giving it a chance is really worth it the game gives you a lot of options in open world amazing quest beautiful scenery that is pretty enough reason to try it if you re struggling and there are plenty of play styles magical spells build as well to play with this is the game which actually teaches you that quitting is not an option but dying is,334.5,217.0,16,Recommended,"October 13, 2023",ELDEN RING,Rozain ZeuriC

10217,2023 being my first souls game i was convinced i would be wasting my money and that the first boss i encountered would kick my ass and i was proven right in no time by the grafted scion but you were expected to be defeated by that one you say worry not the tree sentinel was also quick to put me back in my place once i had built the tiniest bit of confidence after beating the tutorial boss the game is fantastic it got more and more rewarding as i progressed and i was happy to beat the game a second and a third time finding out new secrets during each playthrough there s no compliment i can come up with that hasn t already been used to describe this game there are so many weapons with so many different builds to try bosses can be frustrating but there s so much fun to be had even what is considered to be one of the toughest fights looking at you malenia is incredibly fair and fun and the spectral horse you get is most likely the best horse i ve ever ridden in any game ever if i had anything to complain about are the platforming sections but after looking it up a bit apparently fromsoftware never really knew how to do those and they are so few and far between that s hardly a reason not to buy the game i could also complain that i was unable to romance boggart or blaidd they re so cool 10 10 the dlc cannot come a day too soon,323.8,297.0,16,Recommended,"April 10, 2023",ELDEN RING,"Frostbyte

10226,2023 since the release of skyrim on 11 11 11 i have been craving an open world experience with rewarding combat build theories crazy beautiful aesthetics and a real sense of accomplishment items dungeons completed etc this game delivers the entire experience in a way i ve never quite seen i m new to the souls like genre and fromsoftware games here are the takeaways for me 1 combat is extremely rewarding by being unforgiving at first glance it s hard but as you delve just a little deeper you realize that combat in this game is an art form that takes practice and then more practice the satisfaction is higher than any game i ve played in the last decade the light attacks heavy attacks blocks parrying sprint attacks sneak attacks all play a little different and allow you to really pick your method or avenue of approach 2 items in game from armor and weapons to craftables and ashes are each individually potentially game changing or build changing and can really flesh out a build it s rewarding to find items in game as any one of them could be the weapon of choice for your desired build 3 open world is absolutely stunning and feels very scary yet very exciting every new enemy seen needs to be studied practiced and learned for optimal combat new enemies can be scary as you don t immediately know their capabilities boss fights are hard some more than others and many enemies are the type that require you to come back at a later time when you have stronger tools or more hp or you git gud roaming new areas is thrilling and you begin to truly have to balance and manage your hp fp and stamina while in combat the lighting in caves with torches or lanterns is immersive and you feel the danger 4 character building is straightforward you level up as you beat enemies and use the runes xp currency as you see fit to either purchase things or level up etc and you can decide what attribute to increase trying new weapons new armors is both fun and interesting the need to knows 1 game won t hold your hand you are in a labyrinth with many things that all can kill you you will not know exactly what you re doing where you re going or why you are existing 2 everything you see can kill you if you become too careless slow and steady usually is the best method slow is smooth and smooth is fast 3 ashes of war summoning and crafting must be experimented with to understand again no hand holding 4 you will ask yourself how in the world am i supposed to ever be able to complete this many many times 5 puzzles and secrets abound exploration and a good memory are key 6 while there is a multiplayer experience pvp and pve it s a bit confusing and from what i ve experienced so far not necessarily mandatory the single player experience is strong with this one i ve spent 42 hours in this game as of writing this and i ve barely left the starting area limgrave my nightmares consist of runebears traversing the mist and boss fights i ve been startled pillaged rekt and absolutely confused many times but i wouldn t change any of it i remember the first time i saw a giant i had attack on titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner captain levi it s just a blast an absolute blast the greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt you can feel your ability your reaction time your muscle memory coming more and more into play as you practice and it creates a thrilling experience struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you ve gotten is a very rewarding experience,304.3,522.0,8,Recommended,"September 20, 2023",ELDEN RING,Floppily Doppily's

10242,2022 fromsoftware said hey we ve never done an open world rpg i guess we can take a whack at it then they delivered the best game of the genre in over a decade perhaps ever everything i dislike about modern owrpg games is gone from miyazaki s masterpiece other aaa games just keep copying the success of skyrim but having bigger and bigger maps with wide open level design 1000 map markers telling you exactly where to go and what to do at all times and combat systems that are generally pretty lackluster and simple elden ring shatters all of those contrivances with a fresh approach the world of elden ring is admittedly massive but unlike other games in recent memory no corner of this map ever feels empty or boring the level design is lightyears ahead of most open world games verticality labyrinthine platforming and environmental puzzles are back on the menu after being abandoned by the hundreds of skyrim clones this past decade the legacy dungeons as they are known here are on par with the best of fromsoft s dark souls series which is famous in part due to its long track record for stellar level design the combat system and character customization are familiar for fans of fromsoft s previous entries but in the new context of the ow genre it feels better than it ever has the addition of jumping mechanics simple but satisfying mounted combat and exploration and a heavily customizable weapon skill system compliment the play style of a huge game like this weapon balance has been a bit shaky since the launch of er but recent patches have helped every playstyle feel satisfying and powerful without sacrificing the challenge speaking of difficulty this game is difficult more difficult than people unfamiliar with the developer would expect from a game of this genre but not quite as difficult as the more punishing examples from other souls like games the game does not hold your hand or litter your map with dozens of quest markers and points of interest if your map is marked it s because an npc just told you that they would mark your map or you ve just discovered a new fast travel point the game subtly guides you to the next major objectives through unobtrusive visual cues and context another way the game accomplishes this task is by avoiding the shortcut most developers take to level the challenge to the player s current level elden ring allows you to go wherever you want to go but if you enter an area that you are not supposed to yet then you will be punished by 15 foot tall hyena beasts giant demon crows and plagued wolves that will bleed you out in seconds you will either naturally gravitate back toward the areas appropriate to your level or you will rise to the punishing difficulty and be appropriately rewarded for your determination every area feels rewarding discovery is an element that is difficult to get right even in some of the best ow games ever made the lazy answer to reward exploration is to create 200 collectible items hidden in obscure locations that award trophies or minor character progression elden ring makes genuine exploration feel rewarding nearly every time somehow they have significant secrets hidden nearly everywhere if you spend 5 or 10 minutes striking out into the unknown you are almost certain to find sexy loot a secret dungeon an interesting enemy or npc etc but none of it feels like hooray you found your 147th korok seed a few points of criticism are the performance issues that have been present since the launch despite having graphics that feel more like they were released late last generation there is some persistent stuttering even in the most powerful rigs so a consistent 60 fps can be a bit elusive while the art direction and style are phenomenal as always the graphics themselves are a bit dated this is most likely due in part to the long development of the game and partly due to fromsoft insisting on using their same old engine instead the newer options some long time fans may find the gameplay systems to be a rehash of soulsborne and have heard some fans say that they wanted more variation this time around i personally do not agree with this take as i ve played every single fromsoft game since demon s souls on opening day and elden ring did not strike me as stale but i do understand why some would see it this way i see these drawbacks as very minor in the greater scheme of this game and they do not take anything away from the spectacular execution on virtually every level of game design though i may be slightly biased in favor of fromsoft if i am trying to have a modicum of objectivity i am comfortable saying that i think elden ring is one of the best open world games of the last 15 years in the same tier as the likes of skyrim breath of the wild and the witcher 3 however my more subjective view is that this is likely my favorite game of all time either way this game is an easy 10 10,636.8,711.0,19,Recommended,"October 21, 2022",ELDEN RING,K1llerKatfish

10264,i first played this on console when it released and quite enjoyed it having made the switch to pc gaming i wanted to replay it on steam to be ready for the dlc some people will tell you that elden ring is the easiest game from fromsoftware and well they re right to some extent this mainly lies in two things first the open world structure allows you to skip a boss if you re feeling overwhelmed to come back later after getting more levels and gear that s something you couldn t really do in their previous entries also you have access to a variety of powerful tools weapons skills builds and summons that can make your journey much easier you want to do it the hardest way possible great skip those you re in for a challenge you could use some help use them or summon a friend to assist you i can perfectly understand that some people have busy lives with work and kids and don t want to spend their game time wiping dozens of time on a boss but still want to experience the fromsoft touch there s no better way just play the way that gives you the most fun the game is exploration with a capital e no symbols to tell you where to go no quest diary it can be intimidating specially if you tend to have fomo the good part is that by closely looking at the map you will find clues to places of interest the play area is huge so is the content at times i felt like it was too much but at least you can t accuse fromsoft to deliver you an incomplete game some graphical assets are heavily reused that s true but it didn t really bother me that much speaking of graphics if you like dark fantasy atmospheres oh boy you re in for a treat that game is making fromsoft accessible to a wider array of players and it s perfectly fine with me,98.2,217.0,2,Recommended,May 27,ELDEN RING,Vonsid

10276,2023 i had never previosly played a from software game before elden ring i had very little experience with souls likes my only one being code vein which i had been playing on and off at that point and never ended up finishing by all accounts this is not a game i ever thought i d be interested in but there was so much excitement about it on launch it looked amazing a friend had taken a week off work just to play elden ring and so on an impulse i purchased it too playing elden ring for the first time was one of the best gaming experiences i ve ever had elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by kitten setting the gold that enshrouds the heavens the great tree which begets the pillars of light o tarnished hasten to the foot of the tree elden ring is set in an open world of the lands between it s jaw droppingly beautiful diverse and most importantly very good at encouraging and rewarding exploration i will not say anything more it happened more than once that getting into a new area would leave me in awe and it is really worth experiencing on your own with minimal spoilers elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by kitten gameplay combatthe gameplay loop in elden ring is fairly simple you explore you kill monsters you get stonger by acquiring gear and levels and use all this strength to beat big bad bosses to become the baddest boss of all the elden lord combat feels nice and smooth and it s pretty easy to get the gist of even if you re new you have your normal melee weapons you have bows you have magic and each weapon also comes with a special strong ability called ashes of war and all of it works and looks and feels absolutely amazing elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by kitten and if that s not enough the game offers an ability to summon npc spirits to aid you in battle specifically in bigger fights and boss fights this makes elden ring very accessible to newer players who are trying it as their first from software game don t get me wrong though it is still very challenging best part due to the open world nature of the game if you re stuck somewhere or just don t like the place you can simply turn around and leave return later or not at all it s really up to you controlsyou can play with the controller or on keyboard mouse setup the latter of which works very well so you don t really need a controller if you don t already own one i ll actually go on a side tangent about controls unlike ds3 where it is impossible to get the ui to display keyboard controls which makes playing on kbm an absolute headache of confusion ui in elden ring fully supports kbm you just still need to find how to switch it because the controller controls are considered default sigh and the game itself is nicely optimised for kbm controls not perfectly just nicely you can do everything you can on the controller you may just need a bit of time to figure out some ashes of war with double component there s some clicking trickery involved conclusion all i wanted was to fight to fight as a warrior to the last so why why o guidance of grace will this door not open elden ring is a game that i really want to recommend to everyone but i m sure that despite what i think about it it might not be everyone s cup of tea my boyfriend is still not letting me live that recommendation down but if you enjoy beautiful worlds poetic and enigmatic storytelling and engaging exploration and you aren t afraid to try something scary and new maybe this is something you should really really give a go 10 10 best game ever,369.1,141.0,3,Recommended,"November 22, 2023",ELDEN RING,"kitten

10277,2023 tldr elden ring while imperfect is the best implementation of an open world action rpg that i ve ever played it feels like the culmination of every iteration of fromsoft s souls games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue struggle and eventual triumph genre fantasy third person open world action rpg souls gamegameplay elden ring is basically dark souls 4 or dark souls but now you can sneak jump and ride a steed around the open world areas you start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats e g astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer or samurai to be a katana weilding dex melee build you progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain runes that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops sites of grace are the bonfire equivalents in elden ring and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses there are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately elden ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons secrets hidden away in every corner of the map it is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether the open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts ashes of war or an npc standing around waiting to offer you a quest with the introduction of a day night cycle there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you but offer unique drops as well graphics performance elden ring at launch was pretty shaky in terms of pc performance i personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs amd fx 6300 rx 480 averaging 40 50 fps at high settings i encountered no game breaking bugs detrimental fps hiccups in any playthrough though the only issue i encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area but they were still lock on able and would render again when i got closer killed some of the group this is probably just because my cpu is ancient in terms of graphics elden ring doesn t break new ground when it comes to overall presentation but it is a very colorful game compared to previous souls games you can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky landscape dramatically changes as well dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well story the long story short is the elden ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them you are a tarnished which is basically a pseudo undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the elden ring put them back together and become elden lord in order to bring the world back to order all of the details in between for npc s and items is basically found in npc dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together or until a genius puts all of the information together in a youtube lore video strengths combat feels the best it has ever been for souls games sneak attacks jump attacks ashes of war npc summons mounted combat guard counters power stancing and everything else feels very very good touching more on ashes of war they basically allow you to add and remove later a unique skill to most non unique weapons in the game they also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice if you also have the right whetstone so you can make a weapon scale with int or fth even if it originally didn t boss encounters are exciting and challenging if you feel underprepared you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself also feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible it is a game mechanic after all you can build a character however you desire whether it be dual weilding greatswords holy knight melee spell casting wizard or pure archery there are lots and lots of weapons to try leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough the crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat you can even create bow crossbow ammo which is very neat just when you think you re near the end the map expands further and there is even more to discover compared to the other dark souls stories elden ring s story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset weaknesses pc performance isn t stellar if you are bothered by occasional fps spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens not game relevant but the game doesn t fully exit when you quit out until a while later early game bosses reappear as mini bosses or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content there is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid game to the late game it feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1 5 of your hp in damage to 1 2 of your hp in damage ui could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items online connectivity can be hit or miss sometimes when you are summoned to another world you get a connection error and the game boots you back to single player be wary of hackers when playing co op pvp previous exploits have occurred where upon death you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop that exploit was patched but we all know how hackers don t just give up not a negative for me but maybe if you like pvp you can only invade other players if they are participating in co op basically unless a host uses a specific item invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios note afaik fight clubs are only affected in that of summonable participants is limited i don t invade but i ve seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way so many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who e g godwyn vs godfrey vs godrick great runes are pretty underwhelming in terms of power although i enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame it is still to your benefit to just read an npc s quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track numeric score if you care 9 9 10 easy recommendelden ring has set my bar for open world rpg standards the added gameplay features like jumping horse riding sneaking etc make the game s action much more interesting and fun than previous fromsoft games the game kicks my ass at every step of the way but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it though it is not without fault i love this game and can t wait for future dlc,362.5,334.0,14,Recommended,"February 16, 2023",ELDEN

10295,2022 i have 59 hours in this game and i think i m still 5 10 hours from beating it lol good one it took me about 80 hours to beat my first play through and then i kept playing i found two new areas after i had beaten the final boss i have done nothing since 4pm on thursday february 24th but wake up play this game and go to sleep if you are concerned about not liking open worlds but you like fromsoft games just give elden ring a chance i swear it will be worth it most open world games for the last decade are full of nothing they look nice but have next to zero substance elden ring s open world is comparable to breath of the wild and no game in since botw s release has made me feel the way botw did every way is the right way there is insane new stuff around every corner you ll think you have dementia because every 20 minutes you ll find some insane new thing and forget what you were actually trying to do beforehand it s not a graphical marvel but fromsoft has never had the chance to apply their style to a fully realized world and the lands between are jaw dropping at times and always stunning regardless of your location while at its core its still soulsborne it s hard to compare to the rest of the series because of how much of a difference the open world makes elden ring was worth the wait and is easily one of my favorite games of all time this game is worth full price and always will be and you should support fromsoftware and buy this game at 60 if you can afford to do so hopefully they will be making memorable and creative games for the forseeable future if you are worried about the pc performance issues many people have complained about here is my input on them i have a 2070 super 32gb of ram and an amd ryzen 7 3700x 8 core processor 3 59 ghz it only occasionally every 15 30 minutes maybe stutters when i m in a large open area or when there are lots of particle effects on screen it s not unplayable it is a second or two of reduced framerate it has never gotten me killed or made the difference between life or death in 60 hours it is locked at 60fps which is not a problem to me and it shouldn t be to you either like i said fromsoft games have never been graphical innovators the difference between 60 and 120 frames is negligible and fromsoft has made it clear they re working to optimize it as much as possible there has been noticeable improvement from day 1 even you could probably run this game just fine with a 1070 as the recommended specs suggest it s not unplayable unless you re a complete snob in which case i suggest you remove the graphics card from your rear end,369.9,938.0,75,Recommended,"March 1, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Thiqqy

10303,i m only writing this review because shadow of the erdtree was finally announced and i want to go on the record for anyone who never got around to playing it yet for whatever reason if you heard about the dlc and are thinking yeah maybe now is the time i ll finally dive in then this is directed at you elden ring is not for everyone if you don t respect the grind then it will kick the out of you without remorse there is no easy mode no save scumming no cheat codes and absolutely no hand holding yeah sure you can rely on youtubers and wiki pages to tell you what some of the ultimate builds might be but even if you re relying on a crutch like that you still have to put the work in and git gud when it s all said and done it also takes a while to even get access to all the weapons gear that those guides expect you to be using not to mention earning the experience needed for the build to be viable so my suggestion to you is to worry less about building an exact carbon copy of a character that some other person already played as and just try to take it all in and experience it for yourself first i got every achievement defeated every boss and it was the most rewarding grind i ve ever embarked upon in a game i made a lot of mistakes along the way but i learned from every single one of them i got my ass kicked every time i booted up the game but every triumph i celebrated was unlike any other thanks to all of those ass kickings from the hardest boss fights to the most annoying mobs you truly feel every single victory and that s where i got hooked because the sense of accomplishment you get from progressing in elden ring i m telling you it is the ultimate dopamine shot now i personally loved the story but it s definitely a subjective experience elden ring is a mythological story about gods and demi gods and if you take the time to read through the item descriptions look closer at the game world and try to fill in the gaps kind of like a detective would then you will probably enjoy it too if you are expecting the cutscenes to be the only thing you have to pay attention to in order to know what s going on you might be disappointed without a quest menu or anything like that to keep track of things the game forces you to do your own due diligence and keep track of the npcs you ve spoken to and to really listen to what they say because completing side quests isn t like most open world games that just plop a waypoint down for you to walk to after you ve skipped all the dialogue you need to listen and think about it and if you ve already progressed through certain points of the main story then you might not even get to experience some of the side quests this aspect of elden ring can be a bit frustrating because you really aren t given any indication if you ve missed a part of a quest or if you missed a quest entirely until it s too late i will just say that if you re bee lining it straight to the main bosses you are definitely missing a lot of what makes the game so good and you re also missing out on side quests that lead to valuable items and experience so if you don t want to miss anything my advice is to take it all very slow and just try to clear regions and talk to everyone you see before moving on to new areas if you think you missed stuff keep in mind that you can always try again in ng multiplayer is completely optional but opting in to allow invasions can be rewarding because testing your build against actual players is pretty fun plus you get to also see what other people are doing with their characters sometimes seeing someone else in action can inspire you to try new stuff or it can make you aware of a flaw in your own character i will say that i personally played with the player messages turned off though because i didn t want to read possible spoilers and i felt reading messages left by other players all over the place broke my immersion but to each their own if you ve never played elden ring before and are finally considering a run through the game for the first time i truly envy you because i would do anything to wipe my memory and play it again for the first time it is a game like no other and it will test you in more ways than one just don t get discouraged when you hit a wall because we ve all been there all you have to do is learn to overcome it once you do i promise there is no greater feeling in all of gaming,498.5,736.0,25,Recommended,February 23,ELDEN RING,"Mordax

10306,2022 the lands between me and the elden ring this is going to be a long one go get a cup of coffee if you care enough about it you know that feeling of being completely hooked to a brand new thematic world elden ring manages to do it just as you start your journey in the lands between fight your journey through dungeons and catacombs find treasures get to know your enemies and discover brand new areas each containing new lore and development that can be discovered by various meanings talking to npcs reading items descriptions finding patterns that links the bosses and lords of that area to the creatures there it s everything we always wanted in a classic fantasy medieval rpg for the first days if i could i would not have stopped playing this game by any means i just wanted to discover more and more and unravel it s secrets so much fun especially when you have friends to talk about and when you realize they are in a totally different area that you don t even got to explore yet but the game gives you that freedom you are allowed to do what you can in order to progress by your own pace and your own way the combat got much better from previous titles in the soul series being able to jump is amazing and having your horse to battle along side you creates a feeling that the other games simply couldn t give you the hitboxes are better the battles are fluid when you don t have that fps drop from nowhere but i ll get there and i truly believe that everyone can enjoy this game you are the one who defines the actual difficulty of the game there s a reason people can beat this game without getting hit and even though of course many bosses are tough especially if you want to play a certain way you can and will git gut take your time after you are done with that annoying boss the adrenaline rush you will have will be worth it the soundtrack and the world sounds are just amazing you can hear the noises inside dungeons the miners banging their pickaxes against the rocks the screeches of the creatures the mad whispering of the anguished souls the water flows the birds chirping everything feels natural and involving everything made so that the world feels alive and true to it s nature as far as the lore goes it s a souls game it will be cryptic but this one gives you much more to know about it hints you about it s mysteries and what s happening in a way that feels more natural and approachable and all the endings and ways to get there will allow you to speculate in your own way if that happened because it had to be this way or you couldn t really do anything else about it letting a lot for your own mind to imagine and distinguish you ll have your own theories at the end of the game wondering what could possibly follow your decisions what will happen to that world after that lowly tarnished changed it the ring was a bit broken though well not everything is as amazing as it could be being very straightforward some recycled bosses felt a bit underwhelming and the optimization could be much better after the first patch things got better and it s far from being unplayable but the game still struggles in some areas and that it s not dependent on hardware rather it s probably related to the way it was programmed hopefully the will keep following with the intended patches and keep improving that segment as much as they can conclusion all in all it truly is an amazing game and i m happy that it managed to keep up with our expectations it s certainly a title that ill keep coming back to play more in the future it s hard nowadays for games that have an open world to not feel empty and to not make the player feel tired they sure managed to do it in a much better way than other recent titles could and that alone is something that i was sure looking forward to,155.6,358.0,14,Recommended,"March 16, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Shukran

10346,a man may be destroyed but not defeated ernest hemingwaythis game is the first souls like game that i actually played from the start to finish i tried other titles but gave up on them quickly after a couple hours so first thing i want to say is this game feels more welcoming to the genre than other titles i don t know where to start about talking this game rich open world very rich combat interesting lore amazing designs it has been a while since i really really felt excited to keep playing one game i wanted to push further my character my equipment my gamestyle as i progressed through the game and see different bosses especially the satisfaction you get from beating a boss after using your equipment optimally is unmatchable i actually felt that i rose to elden lord title from being a tarnished that others has been looking down at lot s of the content is actually optional to progress in the game and i usually skip most of optional stuff in other titles because they are mostly unpleasant chores i felt different while playing elden ring i actually tried my best to not miss anything at all i wanted to see what every loot is what enemies or mini bosses i could see and what missions i could progress i could agree that npc quests are a little bit hassle to follow and usually you might need to check wikis but i assume that is a standart for the genre even that really didn t bother me all because i liked npc s too they were pleasant to interact with and see how they progress with you as their quests go on even if you don t care npc s i think anyone would still be excited to see what loot a dungeon contains in this game because there are lot s of fun stuff out there i found combat fun it is still hard but they were aware about the game they were developing just go out there and grab those different items spells armors swords consumables first it might be a little confusing and overwhelming but you quickly get used to managing items then fight anyone however you desire to they gave you freedom with such a rich list of items as you get better and your equipment gets better you feel the improvement on your way to kill your desired boss if you are a hardcore souls fan you can also beat anything with a stick too whole lore is actually pretty interesting but also hard to follow and learn this is one of the things i assume genre standard so it didnt bother me much game doesn t tell you anything much you read it all from items descriptions npc dialogues and other stuff like that you also actually don t have to learn lore to follow the game though and just play for the combat experience another thing is game does not really lead you much at all so it might be really confusing and overwhelming you can play it blind and keep wandering around till you find a lead or you can pop up a wiki page and follow it too you might think looking at wiki s might destroy your fun but to be honest as someone who finished their first souls like game it really didnt kill my joy because it is better than being stuck somewhere for hours you know this game is a long journey and you ll get the hang of it you just might need a little bit patience and help first couple hours recent open world games mostly felt 80 empty for me but this game is different almost every part is a delightful adventure i am both content and happy with the money and time i spent with this game which is a rare feeling actually nowadays especially with the new titles even if you are not acquainted with genre just don t hesitate and jump for a pleasurable adventure go wander out there and find your favorite equipment find your favorite boss to fight with just sit and enjoy how a spirit of fighting rises within you as you progress through game i am sure most people can enjoy this game as i think this game is really a welcoming and pleasuring one i personally liked this game so much that now most of the other games that i play now feels dull i am planning on buying the dlc now a protracted and tough adventure awaits you tarnished warrior do not give into despair and keep fighting be assured that you will soon be blessed with contentment,97.9,137.0,4,Recommended,August 25,ELDEN RING,"Redoko

10367,2023 arise now ye tarnished ye dead who yet live the call of long lost grace speaks to us all elden ring is the best selling fromsoftware game the 2022 goty and one of my favorite games of all time many think that elden ring is merely dark souls with an open world twist but trust me it transcends that simplistic comparison note this review is entirely spoiler free any potential spoilers will be concealed in black boxes so feel free to read without concerns about plot reveals the first stepelden ring s character creation stands out as the best among all the previous souls games developed by fromsoftware the face visuals are more detailed and there are additional customization features the effort put into character creation really paid off providing players with more opportunities to craft unique and distinct characters the opening cinematic in elden ring a tradition in souls games left a strong impression on me the art style quality and voice acting exceeded my expectations making it one of the best introductions in video games for those new to this gaming style elden ring may be challenging initially while i having played many souls games didn t encounter such issues my advice is to be patient the game s difficulty is fair if a boss feels unbeatable early on it means you re not prepared explore more level up get better gear soon the game becomes more manageable surprisingly elden ring felt the easiest among the souls games i ve played from fromsoftware at least until malenia kicked my ass for 7 hours straight before i beat her the lands betweensome folks argue that mixing an open world style with the souls formula messed up elden ring here s my take it s a bit of both having a huge map is cool but it s tough for devs because they can t just copy paste empty areas so they filled it with stuff like ruins and caves the downside some bosses start feeling a bit repetitive i get it s hard to make a big map and balance it with creativity at the same time but meeting the same mini boss a bunch of times got a tad boring even though i got used to it on the positive side the open world showcases stunning landscapes with distinct vibes in each region the immersive atmosphere especially at night is captivating elden ring s design featuring captivating night skies and distant beautifully crafted structures prompted me to capture numerous screenshots an aspect i genuinely adore however the open world setup also poses challenges with quests side quests are easy to miss especially for those playing blind elden ring s vastness means npcs can be overlooked without exploring thoroughly while some give hints it s not foolproof not everyone may value these side stories but they play a significant role in the game as i ll elaborate on in the next section the caves and catacombs scattered throughout the vast lands offer an enjoyable exploration experience enriched with puzzles and mazes i relished navigating through each one and the inclusion of a cooperative element by summoning a friend to explore together adds another layer of fun to the exploration process i was able to live as my own person side quests in elden ring are essential for me adding significant depth to the overall experience without them the game would be less enjoyable while some may not prioritize side quests i encourage giving them a chance personally when i invest in a game i want to explore all aspects delving into npc stories enhances the game s coherence as these side quests are intertwined with the main lore skipping them means missing a deeper understanding of the story while you can watch them on youtube experiencing them firsthand is incomparable the uniqueness of each npc s story in the side quests was something special in elden ring going through them step by step and keeping track of each character s journey proved to be incredibly rewarding emotionally these side quests had a significant impact on me and i strongly advise against ignoring them if you decide to play the game i know it s tough to keep track of all of them but i managed by using word and doing some google research i did get spoiled at times but for me it was better than missing out on these rich and engaging stories altogether the fallen leaves tell a story elden ring s lore is truly beautiful and well worth delving into the game is undeniably complex especially for newcomers like myself however once you start paying attention to item descriptions and npcs dialogues connecting the dots the story unfolds into a masterpiece that s unique in every way initially i chose to remain ignorant avoiding youtube videos and online articles to steer clear of spoilers still i eventually had to seek out essential lore to grasp the basics without ruining the experience i stumbled upon a spoiler free reddit post explaining the fundamental lore aiding my understanding of the game despite this help my first playthrough left me perpetually confused a familiar feeling i ve grown to love from previous souls games after completing the game i turned to vaatividya s youtube videos the souls lore guy for a deeper perspective this transformed my view prompting a second playthrough on the same save file now i appreciate the interconnected details as an example even the design and symbols on the enemies armor carry meaning i have never known defeat bosses are undeniably crucial in souls games determining the overall quality of the experience while i acknowledged earlier that the game has repetitive mini bosses scattered throughout the vast lands the main bosses are a different story each is uniquely crafted presenting a special and distinct challenge not all of them posed significant difficulty for me except for two late game bosses but i genuinely enjoyed every fight regardless of the level of challenge however my disappointment lies in the lack of memorable soundtracks during boss fights a departure from the impactful music in previous souls games despite logging 178 hours for now i struggle to recall a single boss theme even for the main encounters the final boss fight is an exception elden ring fell short of my expectations regarding the musical accompaniment to these pivotal moments lay out your arms let s get smithing elden ring introduces fresh mechanics such as ashes of war and summoning spirit ashes along with a wide array of weapons an excellent addition to its expansive world while the gameplay remains familiar to previous dark souls titles the added features enhance the overall experience making it feel even more engaging final thoughtsthe game is so vast that there s a lot more i wish i could discuss in this review like its online features and the different endings however i ll keep it short especially about the endings due to steam limitations elden ring features multiple endings and some players choose to end their journey with the default one which i personally find less interesting therefore i strongly recommend pursuing the other main endings as they offer a much more captivating experience than the default one as i conclude this exploration of elden ring i encourage fellow tarnished to venture beyond the conventional and embrace the myriad tales this intricate world has to offer may thou journey be filled with discovery and triumph in the lands between,307.4,232.0,9,Recommended,"December 23, 2023",ELDEN RING,"mohdd

10368,2022 yeah pretty good some advice for newer players and veterans alike upgrades to weapons matter more than the stats they scale on get your quality of life stats to a reasonable number vigor to 30 at least preferably higher abuse the new guard counter mechanic if you re playing a more melee focused character with either a shield or a two handed weapon the jump attack mechanic is more powerful than ever before and does additional poise damage use it don t get overly attached to your runes deaths will happen so don t let yourself get all worked up because you lost a bunch remember to breathe and take breaks magic can be extremely powerful i m sure everyone has seen the get op in 10 minutes clickbait nonsense videos what those don t account for is player experience and skill while you can follow those guides to get a good lead the game isn t going to roll over for you get comfy with the idea of losing to a boss a few times so you can figure out its moveset and openings sorcery players the amount of intelligence to equip certain spells and gear is outrageous in elden ring don t let an equip requirement of 70 int distract you from your qol stats get your vigor and mind up your qol stats will carry you harder than that fancy new spell or staff i promise and don t be afraid to upgrade weapons you don t necessarily love weapon upgrade stones are plentiful and you can purchase more of them from npcs once you find the items to unlock them in shops just beat ng 2 and got all achievements happy to answer any questions,329.8,125.0,2,Recommended,"March 16, 2022",ELDEN RING,Raven

10376,2022 if you are thinking hey this game still cost full price after almost 1 year consider that they released a finished game no particular blockin bugs can be played solo or coop and also pvp has a lot of replayability hundreds of hours of gamplay no microtransactions lot of modsand name any other game achieving 3 of these results in 2022 the value you obtain for the full price is huge and it will still be for another couple of years that being said the main downside i ve found after my first run of the game is that we are also paying the price of some qol updates added from the dark souls saga namely 2 spirit ashes and golden effigy now we can almost matchmake to find a game to join or to find coop partners and we have upgradable npcs that can be summoned during boss fights as opposite of ds you don t need quests or requirements to have them so basically you can get free help in any boss fight these things sounds very cool and they are when you are roaming the open world and fighting flying dragons as a melee fighter but especially in the last segment of the game the boss fights are clearly designed around these helpers and making them full solo doesn t require a git gud ds attitude but a git godlike one and as someone who has beaten most of ds3 bosses in solo i m fiding this a bit disappoiting especially with extremely punishing bosses like the fire giant,201.4,304.0,5,Recommended,"October 18, 2022",ELDEN RING,"moebiusmania

10387,2022 short version pros amazing world building and lore stellar locations and landmarks brimming with enemies and wildlife exploration feels rewarding responsive and satisfying combat outstanding amount of content tons of replay value epic soundtrack superb visuals splendid voice acting challenging boss fightscons limited janky co op play horse combat could be better long version elden ring is an rpg developed by fromsoftware inc and published by bandai namco entertainment it is an ambitious game that attempts to bring the dark souls formula to an open world setting i really enjoyed dark souls i and iii but i was never the sort of person to pre order any of them and would always wait for a massive sale with elden ring i remember watching the reveal trailer and thinking it was not for me because of the huge open world i have grown tired of the ubisoft open world formula so i lost my interest immediately fortunately some gameplay videos came out and they looked glorious so i decided to give it a try turns out it ended up being one of my favorite games of all time just like other fromsoftware s titles elden ring s approach to story is interesting you play as a tarnished on a quest to become the elden lord you get introduced to some events and characters on your journey and must rely on side missions item descriptions and character dialogue to know more about this world this might discourage some players but i found the whole setting and story to be epic holy that looks stunning a screenshot of elden ring by good guy nick elden ring s gameplay is great the core gameplay loop has remained untouched you go from checkpoint to checkpoint called sites of grace in this game disposing of enemies on the way earning runes currency and allocating them to numerous stats that increase a plethora of things like hp mana stamina immunities etc if you die you lose all your runes and must go back to pick them up if you die before getting to them however they are gone for good every time you rest at a site of grace all your healing mana items come back but all enemies respawn too exploration feels way better than before as you now have a responsive dedicated jump button additionally you can now ride a swift and nimble horse named torrent to quickly travel through the huge open world plentiful sites of grace where you can rest and level up also allow you to quick travel with ease exploring further but also revisiting areas is always encouraged as there are always useful items and gear just around the corner combat has also received a facelift it feels more responsive and fine tuned you still have a myriad of options when it comes to weapons armor and other trinkets you can focus on swords whips staves crossbows shields you name it these have their standard attacks but also activated abilities that add versatility into the mix the sheer amount of personalization present here is awesome you can pick from an absurd amount of armor and talismans mixing and matching with different sorts of weapons the options for weapon gear combos are endless enemies are as relentless as ever and feel super satisfying to slay some might feel impossible to beat but there is always something you can do a different approach you can take a different weapon maybe coming back after you are more experienced there is always something to do in elden ring the open world nature of the game allows you to visit whichever area you desire this might end up killing you but you might also find a new weapon or upgrade materials to make yourself strong this might be a double edged sword for some players personality i loved it i managed to find a spot that had considerably easy opponent to beat that were worth a lot of runes after a few visits to that area i managed to level up a great deal of times and felt quite overpowered for a good portion of the story mode thankfully a lot of the side quests and bosses put me back in my place by killing me repeatedly elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by good guy nick there are two more aspects of gameplay i must touch on and i will start off with horseback combat mounted combat is fine but i feel like it could be better i have been told by friends that it really depends on what kind of weapon you are carrying and that makes sense but at the same time the camera can get in the way if you lock onto targets and the whole combat aspect always feels a bit janky and unsatisfying you can certainly cheese a few bosses while riding torrent and you will get more skilled as you become more experienced but i do not think it is as enjoyable as regular combat the final feature i want to mention is online co op it is present but i think it has been poorly implemented summoning other players might not always work as i had trouble finding my friend when we finally got to play together the summoned player would always return to their world after someone dies or after defeating a boss i can see why some people enjoy this but i would have loved to be able to complete the story with a friend and not being sent back every time we kill something furthermore you are bound to a single location while playing co op as the game summons walls of fog to prevent you from going to other areas you cannot ride your horse either which is very unfortunate you could say it is due to technical limitations but in this day and age i do not think that is the case it is not a deal breaker obviously i actually prefer playing these games on my own for the most part but adventuring in such an epic world with a friend employing different strategies to overcome amazing bosses sounds terrific and you only get a small portion of that which is very disappointing invasions serve as the pvp component of elden ring and these are fine they do not happen too often and you can disable them entirely which is nice the game also includes some story driven invasions that give you an extra challenge to face elden ring a screenshot of elden ring by good guy nick i always say that dark souls game do not have great graphics but feature stellar art direction well in elden ring the graphics are absolutely stunning and the art direction is flawless environments are distinct and masterfully exude feelings of beauty peace rot and desperation sometimes at the same time really i spent so much of my playtime just taking in the gorgeous vistas it is art sound design is up next another win in my opinion sound effects are amazing hits feel visceral and impactful and ambient noises make the world feel lived in it is beautiful voice acting is top notch every single delivery is spectacular and elden ring actually made me care about the fate of a few npcs something that never happened in any of the dark souls games i will protect roderika hewg miriel and sellen with my life the soundtrack is immaculate there is something so thrilling about crossing a wall of fog and coming face to face with a towering monster while epic music plays it really hypes you up and gives this grandiose feeling to the whole experience so yeah i am a big fan of elden ring i want to play it even as i write this review i played it for 100 hours on my first week with it and i cannot wait to start a new playthrough it is an easy recommendation that will give you tons of high quality content it fixes the problems i have had with the open world genre by offering a map filled with objectives that do not feel grindy the gameplay is great the visuals are breathtaking and its sense of scale is of legendary proportions final score 9 5 out of 10 if you enjoyed this review please consider following my curator page,159.2,205.0,7,Recommended,"June 23, 2022",ELDEN RING,Good Guy Nick
10389,2022 there s been a lot of talk about size and scale particularly in open world games elden ring defies the normal and correct criticisms that open world games are full of dull tasks and extensively copied content it s a game full of mechanical choices systems in play and rich environmental storytelling no area of the game feels completely alike and so little feels wasted elden ring is likely to be challenging for most players it being a from software game it has many of the trappings of the other soulsborne games but based on my own experience you are given more varied tools to deal with problems you might be having my favorite thing about the open world nature of the game is if you are having a lot of trouble with a specific spot or boss just go somewhere else for a bit there s always something new to find the final few hours of the game are in my opinion weaker overall the bosses get dirtier stats are scaled against you much more heavily in comparison to the rest of the game as well elden ring suffers from what i believe is an intentional design choice that has been made since dark souls 1 but it s a choice that essentially results in first half of game ends up feeling better than second half overall basically elden ring is an extremely impressive achievement in open world game design and succeeds in being a culmination of all of fromsoft s work up to this point whatever that means to you should govern your decision of whether or not to play it i had a great time and maybe someday i ll pick it up again for new game think i m good for now though,149.5,169.0,3,Recommended,"June 20, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Maro_Type: L

10407,2022 a 9 5 or 9 8 but not a 10 for melet me get this out of the way first elden ring is amazing game of the year without contest and probably the most impactful game release of this entire decade the open world genre has been stagnant and formulaic to a fault with massive maps full of absolutely nothing of value even critically acclaimed entries in the genre like breath of the wild while excellent games still all fail in giving their open world much meaning other than scenery breadth of an ocean depth of a puddle that defines the open world genre today and elden ring has come along and stomped every competitor into their graves it is the pinnacle of design for an open world rpg and will be what we measure newcomers and previous efforts by it is also a culmination of everything dark souls since they first released demon s souls on the ps3 so long ago now every lesson they ve learned over the time from software have been releasing games in this style has been put to work making their magnum opus and it will be exceedingly difficult if not impossible to improve that said they also keep making the same mistakes and that will likely not ever change a 9 5 or a 9 8 for sure but it cannot be a 10 for me you re free to disagree or even troll the comments but i do have the achievement for all the achievements here i ve done nearly everything of value and substance and have combed the entirety of the game despite the fact i love it dearly and am still playing the game has some problems i take personal issue with so since you know the game is life changing and amazing as was already fairly obvious i will now talk about what i dislike poise has become what seems like a dirty word at from software since dark souls they ve gradually removed its effect and importance over the game releases to the point it feels like there s no reason even show it on your character sheet i can wear the heaviest armor in the game swing a colossal weapon and equip the one talisman that provides poise to the player it doesn t matter because startup frames for any weapon of any size and any weight will be interrupted constantly by any enemy at all even the smallest and weakest even the wild deer and sheep can interrupt you if they hit you during startup frames i m not asking for the ridiculous poise we had in dark souls where we chugged estus and spammed r1 in front of the endgame boss while donned in full havel s gear i just want it to have meaning why would you give us a wealth of amazing incantations that summon literal dragons and have anyone and everyone able to just smack me out of channeling it vigor is a more vital stat than ever before not only do the bosses ramp up in damage dealt to a ludicrous degree but weapon arts from special weapons and certain ashes of war from players can have astronomical numbers moonveil the peoples champion right now can two shot most players with the weapon art and all you need is int to pump the damage 40 vigor and preferably 58 is needed to stand a chance against lategame bosses because as you ll have seen from many complaints the bosses can kill you quickly in just two or three hits sometimes even with soft capped vigor it s not very fun and wasn t at all needed in prior entries to make the fights against bosses meaningful and difficult having to play near perfectly just to see a phase change or a second health bar or another boss immediately is not very fun call it old age but i did get the achievement for all the achievements bosses and enemies also have attacks with barely any if at all startup frames which will hit you instantly and cannot be prepared for or dodged without luck you re just going to take damage whenever they feel like it and you not to mention the true evil of all from software games where it s utterly embarrassing they can t manage to fix it ever input queues branching off the way bosses are designed a lot have overly cheap abilities or relentlessly quick attacks worse still the game has input reads did you think the boss was simply relentless no it was meant to end its combo string and take a moment to pause and let the fake stamina bar recharge instead you take a sip from your flask and it triggers and immediate combo from the enemy almost no matter when or what they are you can test how ridiculous the input reads are in this game at a fort in caelid there are two large lion enemies with blades on their arms that can t exit the doorway you can target them inside then turn to face the wall extending outside and cast spells into thin air into the wall every cast nearly they will do a large jump to the side to dodge the projectile not based on being targeted not based on the projectile being near just because you hit the button this actually makes the sorcery which summons blades from portals the best in the game for some time because enemies will dodge the input and forget the spell effect still hasn t happened it s a horrible system and an amateur level oversight from someone like from software all in all these are fairly nitpick problems and they can easily fix things by adjusting numbers be it in damage or turning off input reads and queues or giving poise meaning and an actual effect all numbers problems easily fixed with time if those issues got resolved then i d likely amend this review and give the game a 10 out of 10 but with all these mistakes from software should and does know better than to make it almost feels intentional when it feels intentional i can t help but feel it s personal which is baffling considering how amazing in every other respect this game is 9 5 or 9 8 but not a 10 sadly,354.7,778.0,59,Recommended,"March 10, 2022",ELDEN RING,Random | Wholesome Degenerate

10411,2023 i don t think there is anything that hasn t been said about elden ring at this point it is the grand adventure everyone calls it out to be the new benchmark for open world souls games or any that will try to follow when i learned that elden ring will be an open world game when it was announced i was scared that it will ruin the amazing world complexity and architecture that the previous games had this was always one of my favorite things about the souls games the logical interconnectivity between the different areas and thankfully i was proven wrong fromsoftware succeeded in every aspect to make an enormous open world without sacrificing any of the atmosphere we all love there is more to do more to fight more to discover than in any previous game and far too much to even name here while i personally don t think the game is much or any easier than the previous games it is far more accessible through various quality of life additions like the ability to mostly teleport to a grace or the spirit summon system tl drelden ring is the new peak of the souls series a must play for every fan of the genre and a great first game for newcomers to the franchise,142.4,104.0,2,Recommended,"April 15, 2023",ELDEN RING,"Miss Luny

10426,2022 byte sized review the one ring to bind them all review performance issues aside the recent patch has dealt with some of the stuttering but the 1 second freeze frames still exist although they do occur less and less the longer you play elden ring is a masterclass in how to build an open world and fill it with tons of interesting things to fight and discover without overloading it with countless repetitive checkbox tasks that feel more like work than entertainment taking a leaf from nintendo s the legend of zelda breath of the wild the player is set loose in a huge expansive environment teeming with all manners of dangers and discoveries and the game basically tells you to go find it yourself and it does so with an art style that is simply unmatched there is minimal hand holding in terms where you should go and what you should do next think the elder scrolls skyrim but the game does provide you with some guidance through grace little glowing lights that emit from the ground and point in the direction you should be heading characters you meet along the journey will give you clues as they dish out elden ring s back story but don t expect lengthy cutscenes and page and pages of dialog like you would find in other rpg s the joy here is the joy of discovery and boy oh boy does elden ring contain a treasure trove of discoveries for you to unearth each one even more satisfying than the last fromsoftware have ensured that there are many tools at your disposal to succeed so those initially turned off by dark souls franchise s difficulty should fret not the introduction of summoning ashes the ability for the player to summon in npc aid and the scattering of golden runes across the landscape which the player can crush for the games currency that enables you to purchase items and upgrade stats is plentiful and should definitely aid the player who is struggling co op also makes a welcome return and is now more easier than ever to play with friends elden ring is still a difficult game lets make no bones about it but these changes to the formula go a long way in ensuring that everyone who is playing is actually having fun without trying to sound like a fanboy elden ring truly does live up to the hype and then some i never knew i needed an open world dark souls and to be honest i wasn t sure the formula was going to work because fromsoftware generally excel at tight linear level design and not sprawling open world levels but they have left me greatly impressed i have about 40 hours spread across both the pc and the ps5 version and all i can say is elden ring is poised to become my favourite game of all time it plays out like a fromsoftware greatest hits compilation but on a grand and engrossing scale i can t recommend it enough one word or phrase to sum up the experience masterclass in open world game design performance bug related incidents performance on the pc is not great at the moment the game suffers from quite a bit of stuttering and freezing the latest patch released yesterday remedies the stuttering somewhat but i am still getting the occasional freeze frames the freeze frames do seem to become less and less the more you play don t purchase the game if these sort of things bother you rather wait until all the issues are resolved similar to games dark souls sekiro shadows die twice bloodborne suitable for teens and up score would be a perfect 10 if not for the performance issues and will get changed to a 10 if they sort the freeze frames out rating essential community created artwork for steam artwork by the dogfather essential games are games i would have normally scored within a range of 9 10 10 10,856.7,387.0,12,Recommended,"February 27, 2022",ELDEN RING,"The Dogfather

10445,elden ring every review is subjective and aligns with the perception tastes and or interests of the person writing it i m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression which is why i do not assign a score i don t believe art can be measured or quantified i ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible elden ring is essentially a culmination of everything fromsoftware has refined over the years in their previous titles wrapped in a vast open world that invites exploration and discovery if i could describe elden ring in one word it would be lost like other fromsoftware games this one is filled with moments where you re not entirely sure what you re doing who the enemies are that you re fighting why they re there where you should go or what the correct path is yet that sense of being lost isn t frustrating it s a driving force that pushes you to keep going there s something magnetic that urges you to press forward to explore every corner of the map in search of an npc an item or any clue that might give you some direction but as you progress things only become more convoluted when you finally defeat an enemy a tougher one appears when you think you ve grasped a part of the lore new information emerges that forces you to rethink everything the game constantly keeps you in a state of uncertainty wondering whether you ve taken the right path or strayed into a dangerous detour the only clear indicators of progress in elden ring are the boss fights a few scattered dialogues and some of the graces placed across the map the sense of accomplishment from defeating a boss is unparalleled it serves as a reminder that despite the confusion and challenges you are making progress one of the standout aspects of elden ring is the sheer size and richness of its world in open world games i ve always enjoyed exploring every last corner of each zone and this title was no exception the world s vastness both visually and in terms of content is impressive the thrill of discovering a new area or finding a well hidden secret is what drives me to keep playing however as i explored i encountered one of the game s most criticized aspects repeated bosses while it s a common practice in some games i expected fromsoftware to maintain their unique touch of originality perhaps the decision to reuse bosses was driven by the ambition to make the world as large as possible in their first attempt at an open world game personally i wouldn t mind it as much if these bosses became increasingly challenging or had new attack patterns but in most cases the fights feel nearly identical despite this shortcoming the overall experience wasn t tarnished xd i thoroughly enjoyed every battle striving to improve with each encounter erdtree the erdtree expansion brings new mechanics and a narrative focus that complements the base experience of elden ring when i first accessed the expansion i thought it would be similar to the dlcs in the studio s other games having a high level would be enough i was wrong erdtree introduces a unique mechanic that intertwines with the game s lore if you choose to ignore that detail be prepared to suffer like never before what s fascinating is how this expansion not only adds content but also manages to maintain the essence of what makes elden ring special while expanding its world in a way that feels natural despite all the new content both elden ring and erdtree are in my opinion the most accessible and to some extent the easiest experiences fromsoftware has developed that s not to say they lack challenge but the open world design with its emphasis on exploration and freedom somewhat softens the experience in conclusion i can confidently say that elden ring is the best game they ve created in terms of ambition design and execution however interestingly it s not my favorite despite everything i ve mentioned i don t feel the desire to replay it cause it feels like a one time experience this contrasts with bloodborne my favorite game from the studio which i could play over and over again despite being technically inferior in several ways bloodborne has an atmosphere and design that i find more appealing and invites me to a better dream,275.6,89.0,7,Recommended,August 19,ELDEN RING,-Lalo-

10447,2022 upon booting up elden ring you re immediately given a glimpse of what is to come through the brilliant soundtrack starting off with a few disparate calm strings the main theme slowly morphs into an epic melody of grandeur valor and unrelenting ambition despite having already heard this track in trailers i was blown away shattered even i knew i was in for something special blissful explorationwhereas previous soulsborne titles had you trudging through claustrophobic sewers and maddening towns elden ring is a far bigger more ambitious adventure reaching across numerous regions the lands between are massive and filled with things to discover even after 20 hours i was still finding new things in the first area perhaps i had missed a cave tucked away in a canyon or failed to peruse a nearby forest once i even stumbled upon an expansive underground area that you could easily miss it s magical really much of the wonder comes from the design ethos gone are the myriad of question markers and intrusive quest logs you would find in other titles instead replaced by something as simple as your own curiosity fromsoftware uses this as a tool to compel you forward when you see a fort in the distance you will feel urged to go there and the best thing is that it was you and not the game that decided so elden ring relies on your participation and i love that the lands between stretch far and wide see that castle off in the distance that s an entire level filled with memorable encounters a screenshot of elden ring by illuya as you traverse these lands it s hard not to be impressed by the topography uneven hills and deep gorges combine to create a world that cannot simply be navigated by holding down your left joystick its gargantuan structures serving not just to undermine you but also as waypoints on your journey it made me realize how flat and easygoing the landscapes in open worlds often are in the lands between even the geography is your adversary constantly bending and defying rules my first 30 hours with elden ring were some of the best i ve had in gaming and i was ready to name it fromsoftware s magnum opus but then a realization dawned wait haven t i seen this church before there are many reasons to love the soulsborne titles but one of them is the handcrafted quality that permeates throughout every corner of the world feels like it was designed with a specific purpose in mind one that you would probably understand through your ponderings and each encounter offered a new challenge these were games that not only encourage you to explore but also feature enough secrets to warrant doing so this still rings true here but for every two surprises there was a moment of utter disappointment reused structures and bosses are frequent to the point where every foe not overtly important to the narrative will be fought multiple times it also undermines the sense of discovery since you can only happen upon so many identical dilapidated churches before you wonder if it s worth it this is truest for the many dungeons and caves they all have the same visual identity and rarely differ in terms of enemies and i have a hard time naming just one of them since they all blend into one large portion of copy paste tedium eventually i began looking at these as optional bonus levels rather than integral parts of the world and honestly i think that is the best approach it is also in this repetition that the developers misunderstand what made their bosses so special in the first place like telling a joke these encounters require careful build up a harrowing walk through a town gone mad or slowly making your way up a castle the bosses were never the main attraction they served as final send offs stages of thrilling and heart pounding action to juxtapose the relatively quiet exploration this still applies to the linear locations but once you step into the open world miyazaki starts hurling bosses at you like he s a kid training for a sports match that s not to say the boss fights are bad when you come across one of the more sophisticated fights and composer yuka kitamura starts sending symphonic shockwaves through your ears this game is delightful with a few exceptions the mandatory encounters are consistently astounding and satisfyingly grueling rounded off by exquisitely rich and repulsive visual design these moments are truly special say hi to margit one of the first roadblocks on your journey community created artwork for steam artwork by illuya elden ring keeps on going just when you think you ve seen it all it turns out there s still another half of the story left had it featured enough content to sustain this length it could ve been a monumental achievement unfortunately that is not the case there s an entire region where the only unique foe is the boss at the end the rest being awkwardly recycled enemies and one of the best places in the game suffers from a similar issue yet i can t help but love elden ring for weeks i was enthralled by its world and when i wasn t playing it i was thinking about where to explore next or how to approach the boss i was stuck on when i present these criticisms of the game it s not because i despise it it s because i care had this been a disappointment i would ve just shrugged and thought little more of it beauty and hostilitythrough the lands between fromsoftware toys with an interesting dichotomy while the landscapes are gorgeous and downright breathtaking they are far from safe mercenaries in tattered armor oversized crustaceans draconian soldiers the size of giants and even living jars everyone and everything is out to kill you even if there aren t many enemies specific to one region there are still plenty of creative enemy designs the open world also gives you a lot of freedom in how you approach these you could sneak your way through an enemy camp get up close and personal with a comically large greatsword or ride in on your horse slashing wildly at anyone in your way this makes the notorious difficulty far more approachable and i d imagine that more people will finish the game because of it the combat system itself is akin to dark souls 3 but there are enough additions to make it not feel worn out and dreary sekiro s posture system where an enemy s stance can be broken to leave them vulnerable has been subtly integrated the enemies don t have wavering stamina bars over their heads but this means you aren t pressured into a style of play the stance mechanic is there you can use it if you want but it can also be ignored entirely this severed hand is livelier than one would expect but a well timed guard counter can put it to rest community created artwork for steam artwork by illuya when combined the stance system and guard counter result in battles coming across more as duels than the old hit and run affair there were times where i had to run away either to heal or get a break from the heat of battle but i spent considerably more time facing my enemy head on you could argue that not enforcing these improvements leads to some players resorting to the tried and tested tactics but i like the freedom it brings another enemy you will face is the performance while the game runs at 60fps most of the time there are some drastic problems with frame pacing and stuttering i didn t find it too distracting but those on lower end pcs might be more affected it s hard not to compare elden ring s selection of enemies and locations to previous fromsoftware offerings but part of me believes we should look at it through a different lens for while it is like these in certain departments it s also a title that seeks to provide a different experience one much more flexible in its design contours and of a much grander scale rather than scold it for the ways it compares we should appreciate it for the ways it differs visit a cup of thoughts for subjective reviews with a touch of

10452,2022 a dark fantasy for the ages elden ring is an absolute masterpiece having mastered the art of showing without telling it is vastly different from other open world games i have experienced such as the witcher 3 and skyrim which are story and questline driven from the get go elden ring does not impose any particular playstyle or route on you you are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game you can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses it truly is up to you with no outside influence this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game is refreshing not to mention elden ring has also mastered the art of subtlety for example for a game like skyrim there are various elements such as the character dialogues leveling system and various landmarks that i could clearly point to in contributing to the game s success however this is not the case here it is hard to place a finger on one specific thing that makes elden ring so enjoyable many times i have gone in to play this game for half an hour only to become immersed losing track of time and playing for hours on end i believe that the game s features i e the combat system transportation landscape lore storytelling etc complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing at the same time these elements come together in such a fluid manner that i as the player cannot notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that i have not felt from any game before environment this game has one of the most enormous and intricately detailed worlds i have ever seen in gaming i have not had a single moment where the map felt desolate or empty there was always something to see and explore the castles cities and fortresses that you must traverse in this game are truly awe inspiring they are all massive unique and filled with a plethora of secret areas just waiting to be uncovered the landscapes of the world are also astonishing the sheer variety and scale of the environments are a sight to behold players can expect to explore vast mountains forests fields deep caves ancient ruins and even hidden underground civilizations it is clear that a great amount of work went into the design of all of these areas as they are all exceptionally detailed and have complex lore realism and beauty to them that makes them a joy to explore combat the combat in this game is utterly masterful blending elements from many of fromsoftware s previous works including dark souls 3 bloodborne and sekiro to create an extremely tense fluid and customizable combat system the amount of variety in terms of different playstyles build variation and weapon types are enough to make the combat in this game endlessly enjoyable you also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous souls game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch walking which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit there s now horseback combat in large open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right handed weapon but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages and most substantially you can equip ashes of war to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill the ashes of war system essentially combines two elements of prior souls games weapon affinities and weapon skills by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments for example let s say you find a really good rapier and like the moveset but are building your character with a focus on the intelligence stat which means it won t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon if you find an art of war that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon you can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon thereby giving it intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the ash of war has best of all if you eventually decide to re spec into a different build you can still keep the same weapon and just put a different ash of war onto it of course you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities but it s nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons bosses the boss roster of elden ring is also extremely difficult and unforgettable most of the boss battles are remarkably challenging rich with lore and breathtaking the complex fighting style of the bosses cannot be overlooked many of the bosses have extremely intricate fast and punishing attacks that are both tough to avoid and fun to fight against this makes the battles against the bosses feel like a dance as you rhythmically dodge their devastating combo attacks before finding small windows to go on the offensive this is nothing new as this style of boss encounter is exactly what the dark souls series pioneered however elden ring perfects this age old formula by giving the bosses bigger movesets greater speed and more complex combos than ever before some of the bosses can hammer you with 10 hit long combos with little margin for error and the player must master a boss moveset if they ever hope to come out on top when you combine this with the grotesquely stunning visual design you get some of the tensest and most engaging boss battles in history on top of all this the epic scope of the boss encounters and vast areas is further heightened by elden ring s stellar musical score it perfectly conveys the emotional connection that you should have with whichever boss you are fighting many of the soundtracks in this game are utterly blood pumping in a way that few other video games can match conclusion overall in my opinion elden ring more than lives up to the enormous hype surrounding it proving to be one of the most memorable challenging and complex gaming experiences of the last century score 9 8 10was this review helpful

10476,2022 elden ring is the latest game developed by fromsoftware a company well known for its souls franchise this time fromsoftware took a departure from its standard linear semi open world approach to its game development instead it opted for an open world approach with heavy reliance on souls game mechanics after i learned that elden ring would be developed as an open world souls game i was worried about how the game would turn out however elden ring turned out to be something far better than i had imagined pros a vast world filled with activities secrets sidequests enemies and bosses that will entertain players for hundreds of hours a wonderful sense of exploration that is unparalleled in its scope and design boss battles that are difficult yet extremely satisfying beautiful graphics that show noticeable improvements over older titles such as dark souls 3 and sekiro great map system that guides players in the right direction and helps them search for secrets and activities a wide variety of weapons with different ashes of war that allows for diverse gameplay an intuitive and efficient weapon upgrade system a wide variety of spells incantations talismans and armors to choose from stellar aesthetics art design cons performance issues micro stuttering and framerate drops that got better compared to the launch version but still need more work while enemies bosses are mostly fair a few of them are overly difficult and can feel a little cheap overall i think elden ring is a masterpiece that offers new possibilities to an open world genre which has become somewhat stale in recent years similar to what breath of the wild did five years ago elden ring proves that the open world genre can evolve and become something truly remarkable,121.9,112.0,3,Recommended,"March 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Anowi

10484,i wanted to wait to write a review until i was a good ways into this and at 185 hours i m only just getting into the endgame on my first playthrough and with a game of this size and scope i think you really need to get pretty far into it before offering an opinion i ve played all the souls and soulslikes and i went into elden ring with expectations based on those experiences but what i ve found is that it s not really a souls game it s dark souls 3 meets skyrim and necessarily more skyrim than souls but with less structure than either of them that s not necessarily a bad thing there s nothing wrong with mixing genres but i think that a lot of players will find their expectations challenged no matter which direction they re approaching it from you could be an rpg gamer looking for an edgier skyrim or a souls player looking for something similar but a little less demanding so it takes some time to get used to the unique feel of the game but beyond that initial learning curve it s a game with very broad appeal it s a huge open world game and coming at it from the i want dark souls 4 direction i ve found progression to be slow and a little confusing i ve gotten bogged down at times exploring doing side stuff but then that s not really any different than what i did in witcher 3 a game i loved and other rpg s i ve also found that when you focus on progression the difficulty ramps up a lot you re clearly expected to take your time poking around killing birds for arrow feathers checking out dungeons and so on it s this mixing of genres that s the essential concept of this game in terms of other aspects of the game like combat mechanics elden ring doesn t reinvent the wheel the combat is pretty similar to what souls players are used to going back to the first dark souls it has a plot very similar to dark souls 3 requiring you to kill a list of bosses in a series of different areas in order to unlock the final area and final boss what s different here is that in dark souls 3 the vagueness of your goal isn t problematic because you re going to be channelled along in a linear manner but here you re just presented with a huge world and told to figure out how to accomplish your overarching goal on your own without any direction so if you re a big fan of open world games and you just want to have a lot of fun roaming around exploring fighting a few bosses without being pressured to get to specific goals then elden ring works beautifully and particularly if you have limited time for gaming you could happily spend months exploring the lands between and players looking for a more structured experience can also have a good time here provided you keep an overarching goal in mind and stay focused on that and as long as you have some sort of a plan for how you re going to get there so one player may spend a lot of time dungeon crawling to get the runes souls needed to keep levelling and another player may just skip all of that and go farm for a while works both ways and that s the beauty of it it s intended to appeal to a lot of different gamers and it s done a very good job with that particularly in drawing in a lot of players who haven t played a souls game but are looking for something similar but more approachable they clearly put a lot of thought and creativity into it and you have to admire them for what they ve accomplished here it s not a perfect game there are problems the various pieces don t always mesh well but it s a unique experience full of interesting content and after a lot of thought i very highly recommend it,257.0,57.0,2,Recommended,April 14,ELDEN RING,"dxmc

10509,2022 well i did it i finished a souls type game am i glad i did it yes i think so would i go back and do it again if i could no probably not not for a very very long time anyways seriously it s obviously a well made high quality game but man does it have some issues warning this review is more of a vent than anything i actually do think it s a decent game just not worthy of the hype it s garnered the combat is based almost entirely around timing and learning enemy attack patterns this isn t a problem in and of itself the right kind of player would love learning the precise time to press space against each kind of enemy however i am not that kind of player i like to play base builder type games and occasionally mix in some hack and slash rpg and shooter titles when i don t feel like thinking too hard if i m going to put in effort to master a game i like to do it by planning my moves ahead of time and experimenting with the tools i m given not by mastering each in the moment micro twitch movement if you re like me and flip flop between games like team fortress 2 and factorio i d recommend staying away from this one however i think that the timing based combat where one of the game s first huge problems rears its ugly head for a game so heavily based on timing and careful movement it has some awfully laggy inputs dodge roll one of the most important moves in the game has a delay on it about a half second between when you press the button and when your character even starts to move in the middle of this game s tightly timed fights that s huge it took me hours upon hours of wondering why dodging felt so bad before i realized what was going one after looking at some online guides i learned that this delay is apparently part of every souls title and that most players simply consider mastering it to be part of the challenge i suppose they re right but think about it anyways a significant portion of this game s challenge finds its source in intentionally poor laggy controls i m also not sure that the developers ever heard the phrase quality of life when designing this game there are all kinds of weird inconvenient things in this game that simply defy explanation why aren t the all important health and mana potions bound to a unique key why can we only use the special effect on our right hand when we can just briefly unequip it to use our left hand weapon why do equipped but unused weapons add to your carry weight if you re quick with the menus it s perfectly possible to keep your auxiliary weapons hidden in your inventory and then only equip them when needed so why make us deal with the carry weight issue is rapid clicking through menus supposed to be another combat skill we master and i think i would be amiss if i didn t point out the poor early gameplay progression of sorcery intelligence characters i picked the astrologer starting class since i felt like playing a spellslinger i booted into the game and started looking for better gear but nothing i tried everything i could think of i followed the path the game sent me down nothing i headed east to the higher level area no new spells no new staffs still nothing it was beyond the twenty hour mark that i finally got a new staff as a random drop from an enemy in the high level area and it was garbage literally worse than my starting weapon unless you happened to be using one or two ultra niche rock breaker spells and i only found them found those hours and hours later still it was only when a friend clued me in to their location that i was finally able to get my hands on some better spells although they were actually pretty close to the starting area there s nothing directing you there if you happen to miss the one particular set of ruins where the vendor is hiding you re screwed no new spells for ages even then it was probably past the fifty hour mark that i finally found a staff able to replace the starting staff which by then i had upgraded to be better than most non unique staffs and hours more before i hit the minimum level to use it let me emphasize something my friend told me where to get better spells i started this game determined not to look at the wikis i tend to be really bad about that using wikis to look up secrets however this was not the game with which i should have made that resolution because to paraphrase that same friend s words this is a game meant to be played with the wiki open on a second monitor now we reach the crux of the game s design flaws this entire game is made of secrets like seriously i m not sure that it s possible for a single player to complete a single side quest in this game without looking up instructions on the wiki at least not without spending hours upon hours upon hours scouring every last corner of the map for the next arbitrary npc location and talking with every character second and third times to make sure that some new dialog option hasn t appeared even characters who supposedly actively want your help will barely tell you what they want or even why you should help them e g one character upon first meeting will ask for your help in her war against the erdtree at this point in the game i still barely even knew what the erdtree was other than really tall and glowing there is no option to ask her why she wants a war against the erdtree or how even her cryptic assassinations quests help to combat the erdtree that character was nothing but a small contributor to what i consider to be the game s single biggest problem this game is so cryptic so utterly and incomprehensibly obtuse and obsessed with secrets that i don t think i could have told you what the plot was had i not read it on the wiki everything else i could have forgiven if the story had just y know made sense what s your character s motivation when you start the game you are greeted with a cutscene instructing you to become elden lord why who is my character why did they just wake up in this temple was the voice in the cutscene something my character experienced as far as i can tell this is the story of some psychopath who wakes up and immediately goes on a rampage killing half the remaining lucid people in this undead wasteland and subjugating the other half part of the fun of an open world game is supposed to be learning about the world meeting its people and seeing how they live in elden ring though the world seems to be nothing more than setpiece a pretty backdrop while you ride between dungeon to boss fight to dungeon there are people who like this stuff lore junkies who will spend hours making crazy theory videos on youtube however if after playing through a whole game i can t identify any motive other than go kill stuff and get stronger so you can sit on the chair next to the big tree i think there might be a problem the game s problem s can be summed up in one fight maliketh apparently you fight him to get something called destined death what is that it s never explained cryptic lore he moves incredibly fast and your attack windows are comically slim janky timings forget malenia this is the real hardest boss in the game however there s a secret item that exists specifically to fight him you d be lucky to find the item without going to the wiki and looking it up and even if you did find it you d be hard pressed to figure out how to use it wiki on other screen he kills you quick fights tend to last less than a minute however the nearest respawn point is a thirty second walk away there is no reason it couldn t have been right next to the boss door it didn t add any challenge all it did was make the boss take longer quality of life tldr if you just want to git good at fighting big bosses in a pretty landscape this game is for you otherwise maybe don t believe the

10528,2022 first of all i want to congratulate from software on the amazing job they did on this title even my wildest fantasies over this game would shy over what the product actually turned out to be is it perfect nothing is but it s my new standard for what perfect should aim for this is from software s first attempt at a truly open world game and you would never be able to tell from the game itself from elden ring you can expect a solid open world experience with refined souls like combat and a great world to explore on top of your spirit steed torrent a mount not everything can be done as soon as you find it and sometimes leaving and coming back stronger and or with better tools is a better strategy the game somewhat suggests to you where the direction for the main story is with light rays that stem from most grace the checkpoints but it s merely a suggestion know though that these games are by design not heavily guided as to offer you an experience that is about discovering and conquering this world at your own pace and timing filling in the blanks so be prepared for it it s not your run of the mill open world game where you follow one objective marker after the other and there is no hold my hand mode either failure is part of the experience a new world painted i believe from software often talks to the player through its narrative in dark souls 3 there is a dialogue that strongly rings this bell for me with this i will paint a world twill be a cold dark and very gentle place and one day it will make someone a goodly home i think this can be seen as a metaphor for us players entering this new world that while evocatively familiar won t be the same in this specific example leaving behind all the rot or baggage that comes with making sequels to an already complex lore stagnancy a topic dark souls 3 and sekiro touch on a lot elden ring is a new world written together by miyazaki with george r r martin writer of game of thrones mandatory where is winds of winter from software in the years showed their community how they don t need to stale over the same ip for 12 mainline entries to sell copies or maintain a fanbase the way they develop their stories and worlds benefits from not having sequels and leaving some loose ends it is not incomplete 95 of it can be understood just by paying attention and the 5 remaining is up for speculation by design as custom the narrative won t be front and center instead inviting you to read descriptions listen to dialogues of npcs connect the dots and find your way around you might not be able to do everything in a single run but there are not many elden rings out there and a game like this should be savored and when possible replayed nowhere to go but forward elden ring while open world did not ditch its detailed world building and beautiful level design alongside the open map there are legacy dungeons which are more like a classic area in any souls game but on a scale never seen the best example is if the bottom of anor londo has ever made you wish you could explore it in elden ring you can the longer i played elden ring the more i noticed how from software repurposed some old ideas but with a better implementation dark souls 2 had some interesting features like how rolling in water would lower your lightning and raise your fire defense or rolling in poison would stick to your clothes and slowly build up poison status these were good ideas but inside a game that barely used them in a gigantic open world though there will be more opportunities to make use of these mechanics and so it was nice to see them return stronger than ever during the development of bloodborne miyazaki said how limiting was for him to make the chalice dungeons which had to be procedural this requires rooms or tiles not only to be interesting but also to be able to combine them in multiple ways elden ring takes what they learned from that and instead has static dungeons that have unique loot inside and unique minor bosses bigger and better this game is huge and it felt magical to realize how big it is the map is obscured from the start and can be discovered with fragments that will show its features but not unlock its contents there are many points of interest on the map that can be spotted from looking at the map itself even if there aren t icons immediately shown like ruins and dungeons caves that you ll be able to explore as you drift away from your main objective to be immersed in this world something open world games often suffer from is loot fatigue but it was never a problem for me as there is unique loot as a reward everywhere rewarding your curiosity from new weapons and armor to spells incantations ashes of war and spirit ashes there s always a reason to explore new are the ashes of war which are weapon skills or unique moves that can be equipped for all but special weapons you can find them in many ways and once applied to a weapon can also make you choose with which stats you d like the weapon to have affinity with any katana could now scale on strenght with a heavy ash and that allows the player to truly play however they want lastly spirit ashes can be found as loot which when used summon a specific creature as an ally to fight for you during fights or anywhere where a purple tombstone icon appears the game also has a co op system that allows you to play with friends but sadly it s just the same as in previous titles and chooses to block the use of the mount and some activities on the map something i wish was different in an update a pvp arena was added as free content adding a one place stop for pvp players in different modes r 1 r 1 r 1 swordplay i ll get a bit more technical here one of the biggest complaints of the souls series especially dark souls 3 was that while the movesets of weapons were well done during a boss fight there was no reason to use anything but your r1 aka the base attack the player also feels discouraged to use a shield the better they got at the game or use jump attacks and charged heavy attacks as it would lock you in long recovery animation this is not the case in elden ring first and foremost weapons have now a combo system spamming the base r1 attack won t swing a theoretical sword left and right doing a 1 2 1 2 but it s a 1 2 3 4 5 where all numbers are different moves and 5 is a combo finisher that has a higher recovery time so per s spamming while possible won t chain infinitely until there is stamina additionally two weapons of the same family can be used together for dual wielding movesets and shields could be ditched for staffs to make a mage warrior moreover a jump button has been added like in other games so jump attacks are easier to perform and deal more posture damage bosses can have their posture broken with heavier attacks but rarely with just r1 even blocking with a shield now is a useful tactic as you can counter attack after shielding a hit from an enemy with very generous timing which will also deal more posture damage you can also summon your mount during fights in the open world and attack from it i won t go too much into detail over the boss fights to avoid spoilers but i will shortly say they were all really good and i found some that have possibly become my favorite in all from software games there were one or two bosses that did not tickle me right but in a game with this much content not everything can conclusionthis game just like dark souls the first time i played it set new standards for me i strongly suggest it to people who want a fair challenge in a beautiful action rpg open world fantasy experience it feels like any number wouldn t be enough but if i really have to it would be a 10

10532,2022 elden ring was released almost 3 years after the first announcement but i can easily say that it was definitely worth the wait till the end i think it is an excellent upgrade to dark souls 3 i loved mechanic of the ashes of war big open world and build variety quite there are badass and cool bosses like malenia maliketh mohg etc but i have to say dark souls 3 has cooler bosses like slave knight gael sister friede and nameless king pve i have stopped counting after the 15th run lore in the game is beautifully and smartly designed pvp it is hell of a fun but please don t use hp estus in the middle of the duel guys come on in addition maybe u can show some respect to people who duel by not interrupting their fight these criticisms are for people who play that way so i don t blame people in general or the game itself long story short elden ring will be on the top unless bloodborne 2 elden ring 2 dark souls 4 releases this game is a blessing to the world this is the sentence i have been telling to my friends since it was first released and my opinion has never changed at all my recommendation rate is 11 10 one more thing to say i hope we can get a dlc soon,771.3,30.0,0,Recommended,"April 18, 2022",ELDEN RING,"RespecT

10547,2022 a brief introductionlet s get a few things straightened out here you know what elden ring is i don t have to explain it i have fully beaten elden ring twice i think it is overall a good game but it is not a masterpiece like you may have heard it has its amazing upsides but significant downsides as well i want you the reader to decide if this game is right for you in depth analysisgameplaylet s get started with the basics elden ring s core gameplay loop is the fromsoft souls classic you attack the enemy and roll to dodge through attacks however it is also sort of an amalgamation of all previous popular fromsoft games the stealth from sekiro returns as well as the jump button the speed of combat returns from ds3 and bloodborne with enemies faster than ever before and long forgotten mechanics from the underappreciated dark souls 2 return like powerstancing the ability to combine two weapons of the same class for a unique dual wield moveset frankly there are too many mechanics to cover in a review that has a character limit but the core of the combat is still the same as before if you like dark souls bloodborne or sekiro you ll most likely like this however as you know elden ring is open world a first for fromsoft this means that enemies can come from anywhere at any time you have to be on alert constantly or else you can easily find yourself stuck in a massive ambush on the plus side this means a lot of player engagement and freedom but on the other hand it means a lot of content is missable or frankly not worth your time any dungeon you encounter can either gift you with your new favorite weapon a core spell for your arsenal or even a fantastic new talisman or that same dungeon could give you something completely irrelevant to your current build like a katana for your strength pure or a faith weapon on your sorcerer this makes exploring and discovering a treat but also somewhat tedious and often kills replayability what s the point in going through an open world full of secrets when you know every secret and know 90 of them aren t important where the game truly shines are in its legacy dungeons giant sprawling fortresses and cities reminiscent of sekiro or the levels of the souls series the perfectly paced enemies dense layout and unlockable shortcuts and checkpoints make them a joy to go through but on the negative side the rest of the dungeons range from alright to outright miserable the vast majority of them follow the same cookie cutter design of cramped tomb tunnels or dug out caves and they get old pretty fast that leads to a core criticism of the gameplay as a whole while the core loop is quite enjoyable you ll soon realize a lot of assets get reused throughout the game many minibosses are simply late game common enemies with a health bar that give mediocre rewards on defeat some enemy types are continuously reskinned to suit the new area as an example the basic soldier enemy is reskinned to be a regional soldier for nearly every single area in the game with little to no change in moveset regardless of their army or colors some minibosses are re used up to 10 times and it gets very tiresome to see the new flavor of the month reskin after reaching the end of another copy and paste dungeon but the biggest criticism i have for the game is the bosses with bloodborne ds3 and sekiro fromsoft showed they have the true talent for making a memorable and difficult but balanced boss experience sadly they dropped the ball somewhat for elden ring many bosses are rather cheap in nature relying on insanely heavily delayed animations to bait and catch rolls or on input reading an ai tactic where the enemy reacts the same frame you press a button to give them the perfect response at your detriment and beyond any human s possible reaction time endgame bosses especially feel heavily overtuned either crammed full of gimmicks like spraying lingering bleed inflicting flames on the ground healing on every hit and inflicting hp drain or simply having gargantuan health bars and dealing 900 damage on every hit turning even a glancing blow into a sudden life or death situation sometimes the input reading and cheap tactics of various enemies outshines the positives community created artwork for steam artwork by xenos i still think the gameplay and bosses as a whole lean more on the positive side but they distinctly have their flaws and players need to remember to use every tool at their disposal even though it plays like a souls game it is not balanced like one and will severely punish you for assuming you can approach it like one storyas for the story it is quite excellent those familiar with fromsoft lore can expect the usual vageueness bits and pieces of scattered story to be found elden ring definitely has a much denser history compared to the souls series but that makes it more satisfying to piece together elden ring s story is arguably the hardest to understand of any fromsoft game but still has excellent story beats and lore to unveil a screenshot of elden ring by xenos and thankfully fromsoft provided us with a key npc gideon the all knowing to provide us key information about who we need to be killing and where they are his addition is invaluable as a player resource visualssimply put the game looks absolutely phenomenal i do have my distinct issue with the color palette that it clearly needs to remember colors other than gray exist in some areas especially in dungeons but the special effects and enemy designs are 100 on point the open world especially looks reasonably believable and realistic with every region having its distinct atmosphere that sets it apart from the others you can load into the game anywhere and immediately know where you are just based on your surroundings the best bosses of elden ring give such a spectacle you can t help but remember them community created artwork for steam artwork by xenos the remembrance bosses especially hold absolutely nothing back with strikingly unique designs and insane levels of sfx and color variety they alone help the game stand out audiothankfully no criticisms in this category weapons feel meaty attacks have weight and the music is still up to the historically excellent fromsoft standard not much needs elaborating look up the ost for godskin apostles or mohg lord of blood you ll be hooked in seconds technicalgeforce rtx 3050ti 4gb intel i7 16gb windows 10 elden ring is very demanding in the specs department and to top it off its capped at 60 fps even with good specs like mine i would still suffer frame drops in areas most concerningly the elden ring multiplayer servers at the moment are an absolute mess at pure random you can suffer a connection error and completely disconnect from your host whether you be invader or ally this is thanks to the horrible implementation of easy anti cheat i cannot physically count on all my digits how many times i was helping a host beat an endgame boss and got booted out of the session with zero warning either a mere minute after joining or significantly into the fight solo play using spirit ashes or npc summons is unaffected but temper your expectations if you re a career invader or sunbro conclusiona great game with some big flaws at the end of the day i had a net positive experience with elden ring the world was very enjoyable to explore and most of the major story bosses that actually had some thought put into them are very memorable and exciting however if you decide to play you need to be prepared for the rotten apples in the basket be willing to use every tool at your disposal to win because elden ring certainly will follow our curator page ocg curations if you like and want to see

10548,elden ring is arguably the best game in the series delivering an expansive and fascinating open world that s a joy to explore the landscapes are breathtakingly beautiful truly some of the best visuals seen in gaming each area is packed with secrets and challenges that keep you engaged for hours the bosses are a standout feature they re brilliantly designed and offer a tough but fair challenge although a few do repeat throughout the game devs really nailed the climactic feel with the last two bosses both feel like true final bosses and provide a satisfying end to an epic journey i enjoyed elden ring so much that i couldn t stop until i had unlocked all the achievements it s a masterpiece that s not to be missed,109.2,60.0,4,Recommended,May 6,ELDEN RING,"Evoliver

10556,2022 coming up on 300 hours of play and beating the game multiple times in a market where games keep releasing unfinished or stay in alpha beta forever this game has had the best release i can remember people like to compare elden ring to darksouls 3 which is pretty accurate darksouls 3 was one of my favorite games of all time and elden ring does it quite a bit better lets start off by talking about the strengths of elden ring the massive world elden ring s world is huge maybe too big you see a mountain in the distance you can climb that mountain you climbed that mountain and now see a castle or ruins in the distance you can explore that area too the thing about ds3 after thousands of hours played the levels start to seem very small i don t think this will ever be the feeling elden ring players will encounter the map is also very detailed and enjoyable to look at and make markers for character creation 10 10 its amazing since it has so many settings to play with you can also change your appearance and name later in the game one of the best character creators i have had time to tinker with if you tried you could probably make your character look like your real life avatar the graphics and optimization er has many settings to be tweaked and seems to do a good job running on older machines some of the game does have some optimization issues but they are resolved and unnoticeable for the most part the graphics on high maximum are pretty amazing for the scale of the game might not be as good as demon souls remake quality but then again the world is massive and something had to give the art is amazing new weapons skills and tilesets of course they reuse many things from the old souls games which is actually smart considering the scale of the game if you consider all the new art they added the reuse of old material is welcomed by myself the music and sound for the game are next level i actually feel myself being unnerved by some areas music so much so i am hesitant to go back and find items in that location i play a ton of games like escape from tarkov or warzone so i know about bad sound lol the developers will put sound cues on many important items like scarabs these sounds work well for training players who want to discover secret areas to listen to less prominent noises crafting is a new mechanic to the game and is done very well the game is huge and being able to interact with the environment through harvesting definitely makes it slightly more immersive the crafting motivates players to look all around hoping to find an ingredient for cure poison or scarlet rott coupled with the ability to make detailed markers on the map you can set up some useful crafting routes ui and controls can be finicky especially if you are new to the genre i am glad they kept the same as the past titles but some other people will not like the double bound controls personally i am use to this department the multiplayer this is where er could shine quite a bit more er has decoupled summoning players and the stat boost from the effigy arc rune i think this is a good idea the game is meant to be played with others which is why they added ash summoning ash s can be very strong sometimes better than a co operator great addition but what is really disappointing is the 4 player maximum count ds3 you could get up to 7 players in your game this was great for fightclubs or just playing the game and being invaded i understand the decision to reduce to 4 maximum players was probably made because of network instability even with 4 players its unstable i know they are working hard to resolve this and have talked about it openly this is not the only problem though there is also no multiplayer pvp arenas like ds3 and ds2 this is kind of mind blowing considering how many arenas you come accross i am hoping this is resolved through dlc kinda like they did for ds2 the mutiplayer has some weird hitches people don t understand as well you can t summon a co operator with duelist in your world you can t summon a duelist if you are invaded you can summon a co operator then a duelist and then be invaded however the sequencing for who enters the world of the host is very important 2 players cannot connect to a host world at the same time this is problematic since invasions are out of the hosts control and sometimes occur at the same time as a host trying to summon a player which results in unable to summon or a disconnect once the disconnect occurs there is also a cool down before summon signs will appear again once i figured out how it works i resolved 95 of the disconnection issues balance is another controversial er topic there are a few builds which are abusing some mechanics that make pvp not so great fire s deadly sin incantation is mostly the root of these problems but some other builds using blood hound dodge can also be very frustrating to fight against i am sure fromsoftware will fix it but its still something that needs to be talked about if you are trying to duel and use a reasonable build around sl 130 you will probably be disappointed with the results i am not saying its impossible to have good fights but the chance you go against a great oak shield or eclipse shotel is high don t even get me started on moonveil katana and bloodhound step users though xd conclusionall in all the game is not far from perfect in my eyes the game just released and it was a near perfect release from my experience the balance will get ironed out so no points deducted to my score for the game in that area i do have to deduct some points for the multiplayer i am sure these issues will also be resolved or lessened when the community learns how to do the workarounds relative to other game releases for the past few years i think 9 5 is a fair score its almost perfect and soon with a patch or 2 or dlc it will be there very rarely do we get to experience a work of art like this game i do recommend trying to play without a wiki or guides but more so use them as a tool to point you in the right direction this game is so full of wonder and mystery most the enjoyment is just discovery or being awe inspired by the view of an area thats new huge and you get to explore 9 5 10 best release i can remember,801.4,101.0,4,Recommended,"March 11, 2022",ELDEN RING,GrindcoreTHRALL

10561,this is without a doubt best game i have ever played in my entire life game developers should learn how to design an open world game from elden ring the map is filled with secrets after secrets dungeons after dungeons and many more meaningful activities that directly affect your character and progress it s simply a genius game design i never got bored throughout my 70 hours of playthrough not even once what made me fall in love with the game was it s universe i have always disliked the japanese style of story telling that how the world was just too weird and were filled with silly and out of place jokes combined with cringe characters i just couldn t handle it on the other hand western style story telling was more serious and had more intriguing concepts but were executed poorly and lacked a soul to keep me interested this game is the perfect middle ground because this world was created by george r r martin and the game was done by a japanese studio only downsides of this game are it s ui awful and they couldn t calculate torrent s fall damage but those two are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and can be easily disregarded also how about giving an option to respec before starting an ng or atleast a warning overall 10 10,70.0,146.0,10,Recommended,June 16,ELDEN RING,"Yek

10569,after playing the ds trilogy exclusively back to back i decided that the next game should be elden ring as it is close regarding the gameplay the game started and it was from the beginning very familiar given of course the new stuff and the items that were similar to those from older games that worked however differently to an extend and it felt like it was going to be an amazing adventure already and it was the numerous locations were very different from each other thus giving a big diversity from one location to the next the weapons available seemingly having an endless variety and the smaller details like day night and the weather really made a big and good impression i decided to approach the game like every other open world game i have played in the past explore as much as possible in this case finding as many sites of grace as possible and then start exploring and did i explore searched every little corner every hole every dungeon every plain and every castle excited to see what i am going to find very nice variety very nice ambient music interesting enemies and amazing epic bosses battles and for the most part the game was great but it was just that normally with a game of that genre like i did with the ds games i would describe my experience but this game is too big to do that so i believe that just being one more voice stating how good the game is is good enough however i would have to note some aspects that i didnt really enjoy and some that affected my time with the game in a bad way starting with the worst one i played the game on steam deck and during almost my whole playthrough i was being put in offline mode which after some search about it found out it s a problem of the game a problem that it hasnt been addressed yet i didnt experience not even one invasion for example the other kind of issue i had with the game is mostly based on my point of view what i didnt like was that although i enjoyed it very much the npc variety i found it lacking i understand that this kind of games dont have npcs as a main point in their narrative but still i would expect more from an open world game thankfully the world building change of day and night enviroment weather item descriptions and statues and the epic battles thoughout the whole game made a much bigger impact and when i finished the game i was left with a similar feeling like with the dark souls games elden ring was great but i was left wanting more of course more to do more to explore but also more to care about since the plot wasnt that interesting and i never felt engaged maybe everything being more despite we wanting that or not open world is not the the way this kind of games thrive in it felt like bilbo baggins said feels thin and stretched like butter scrapped over too much bread and the reason the bread felt still tasty was due to its many quality components an amazing game overall nonetheless and highly recommended to everyone because of its nature maybe also even more to newcomers of the genre transferred my game over a pc and doing summons for people that need help for the final boss of the main game daily eest 20 00 21 00 except wednesdays,155.7,23.0,0,Recommended,September 9,ELDEN RING,"Fingolfin

10572,try fingersbut holepickle on a more serious note this is genuinely one of the greatest games i ve ever played and not putting it in my top 10 would be criminal after the hours of enjoyment i ve had the world is breathtaking there isn t a single area of the game where if you stop and take a breather for a second or two you ll be hitting f12 a couple of times the variety of locations are insane i won t say much to avoid spoilling but i was often shocked at the amount of ideas they managed to cram into this world without it feeling unnatural there are some traps in the game that teleport you to late game areas and you ll be shocked at how big the map is how cool the areas are and how the common dog just one taps you it makes it so when you actually reach these locations through progression it feels really good to not get one shot or actually one shot the enemies that were giving you such a hard time besides that exploration is fun and feels actually really good usually in your skyrims and copy pasted ubisoft open world titles you just look at your compass at the top of your screen and hold w in the direction that has the most appealing icon sure you re exploring but you re not actually looking at the route you re taking in elden ring the compass only tells you the cardinal directions so if you want to find anything you either have to look at your map to see if there are any points of interest or actually look around using your eyes to spot interesting things this gave me the same feeling i had with breath of the wild a few years ago where i m supposed to do one thing but i just see another cool thing after another i just get sidetracked for hours the bosses are what you expect from a soulslike tough maybe rage inducing if you suck but fair if you haven t played a soulsbourne game like i have before this one this is easily the best intro you could have to them all the bosses are great the build variety you can have in this game is seemingly limitless if you struggle too much on a boss you can just go into the open world and come back when you re better the only flaws i have with this game is that it s in a serious need of a questlog it s not normal that i have to have the wiki open on my second monitor just to remember what a npc said 60 hours of gameplay ago and it could take the ultrakill way of death what i mean is that if you die you click r no loading screen you spawn right back into the boss room i hated the commander niall runback,125.2,86.0,2,Recommended,March 11,ELDEN RING,"BeND4R1N0

10573,2023 after over 300 hours of getting killed i think i can now qualify to make a proper review on this game the only con i ve got is that the quest system is very confusing i got locked out of so many npc quests i later realized that there are online guides to help aide you for these quests everything else is a pro i am a type of person that just sticks to what i know and that s swtor because i ve been playing it for years been part of the same guild for years and i m a late bloomer when it comes to games so i ve never really ventured beyond that but nothing has prepared me for elden ring and when i started playing elden ring all hope died hope as in real life because this game will suck many hours of your life but you will love it i fell in love with this game elden ring it is also my first game i properly play for souls i admire how you can explore and you don t need to no rush on boss or story you have freedom to collect and loot and enjoy every single dungeon and kill all that comes in your path and do this game at your comfortable pace enjoying the beautiful views you see along the way the scenery is beautiful the music is beautiful the voice acting is beautiful i love everything about this game i started playing it thinking i could not progress because it was too difficult for me but now i am wearing malenia s armor and blobbing along having as much fun many hours later as i did when i begin highly recommend beautiful game,928.5,48.0,3,Recommended,"January 14, 2023",ELDEN RING,"ღx̸̘͍̙̒̐͑a̴̢̼͔͌͘v

10575,2023 this is my first fromsoftware game but not my last the world is expansive horizontally and vertically very few times is there a load screen as almost all of the world is one giant map given the size it is quite impressive the plot well you will need to be a sleuth online guide reader or completionist to really get what is going on i really just got the main plot but even that was over 90 hours i bought it slightly on sale which is great but any dark souls fans will get their monies worth out of it epic grand open world that is dark forboding and creepy not for everyone but as of this writing over 20 million copies so maybe it is for everyone you will die alot8 10,93.7,55.0,5,Recommended,"February 25, 2023",ELDEN RING,"TheRealCelticBatman

10576,2022 after getting 100 i can safely say this is in my opinion the best soulsborne game everything is viable there are plenty of astonishing skills spells weapons and armor to try when you see a video with a title op x item i can assure you there are 100 others just as good or even better play how you like it will carry you through the game also the scenery atmosphere and music are so good it is hard to fathom that this game actually exist it was also a bit harder game for me at least at start few of the bosses are absolutely brutal in melee combat but i managed to ugs my way through eventually and now for a few bad things some things are still bugged arcane scaling weapons and performance issues and occasional crashes otherwise was a smooth run edit now that those few things are mostly fixed the game is just a masterpiece 10 10 would die to instant curse or bleed again,193.3,87.0,4,Recommended,"March 7, 2022",ELDEN RING,"HenkkaKhamon

10577,2022 update this is my vote for game of the year elden ring is an emotional roller coaster that is both challenging and rewarding the game was mostly problem free of technical issues and nothing game breaking beating the game was a joy but there is a great deal of content that can be missed with only that in mind the story is not in the main boss fights alone but in every element behind ever hidden wall in every item description and in the choices that you make elden ring is an epic that your character lives through and not just a series of cinematics and narrations the graphics are fantastic while they are not cutting edge realistic like some games they are complete artistic and beautiful elden ring is a masterpiece of art as can be seen throughout the elden world and all that resides within there is a clear passion seen in the many spells incantations as well as the combat actions and poses the controls are fantastic and yet a little frustrating there is a learning curve to the controls due to a small delay to input and character reaction this is due to the way that the core of the game operates it is not a long delay but if you have fast reflexes you will find it impact how you play you will have to train yourself to be more patient and treat combat with a slightly different approach once this is mastered the combat is very fun there is a great diversity with numerous weapons having their own style timing and bonuses many hidden my favorite aspect of elden ring is the story the story is simply beautiful and something that i believe reflects well the history of humanity maybe even the present possibly the future as well i will not spoil the story but it is worth experiencing and very well done there are many characters to be introduced but they have decent depth and the voice acting is done very well my one dismay is the soundtrack i found it to be lackluster and some of the songs to be headache inducing overall it is mostly neutral and you can just as easily forget it is on except for the few that have a constant high pitch tone that just repeats in short elden ring is a must play while still early in the year elden ring is the game to beat for game of the year and i am doubting anything will come close,598.5,38.0,1,Recommended,"April 11, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Old Man Gamer (OMG)

10581,2022 elden ringlet me start by saying this was the first game i played created by fromsoftware well except for killing the first boss in ds3 which doesn t really count does it i wasn t caught up in the elden ring hype and i wasn t really interested in the game even after it s release it didn t even come up in my mind to even look at it as i thought it wouldn t be the right game for me and oh boy was that a mistake about a month ago i finally decided to look into the game and almost instantly decided to get it not being interested in the game from the start actually made me enjoy it that much more i wasn t hyped up from any trailers media or rumors i went into the game with a clean slate and it was amazing from the first time hearing the awesome soundtrack in the menu to exploring the crazy world of lands between and let me tell you i barely scratched the surface of what the world has to offer the world really feels alive it s crazy how from previous mostly linear games the devs managed to create such an impressive open world the map is huge and there isn t an area which feels empty and out of place each location really feels different and tells it s own story there are some let s say tedious locations i m looking at you mountaintops of the giants that get a bit annoying after playing through the game several times nevertheless even these snow covered depressing hills deserve a special places in any gamer s heart i won t mention any other locations because it would be a sin to spoil any of them locations being behind us let s move onto the people inhabiting the lands between the npcs are there for themselves not for the player that makes them feel really alive you ve never met this guy well he certainly doesn t care because he was doing his thing anyways and that s crazy the world is constantly evolving and the npcs are too and not just that the people you meet during your adventure are as interesting as it gets there weren t many times i could certainly say okay this npc is good pure hearted and they will surely stay that way the craziest thing is you might not meet even half of the npcs if you re just playing the game for the sake of reaching the end bosses will kick your ass and those bastards will look cool doing it damn i wish i was born a cool boss too but hey tough luck foul tarnished get some shiny gear and kick their ass for a change after all you re ambitious and surely not foolish at all margit the goat fanboy elden ring has 6 unique endings that s all i m gonna say about that though don t expect to be an elden ring expert after your first or tenth playthrough the lore is as fromsoft is known for hidden in every possible way there is you get a new weapon you thought it s lore in disguise you got a completely useless pot which is completely useless oh wait it s got ten paragraphs of lore in it s description honestly if you really want to know atleast a bit of lore or you re interested in a certain character i recommend you to look up external sources about them such as youtube videos or useful lore sites but be warned there are still numerous mysteries which even the most notorious loreheads are still uncertain about but hey that s the beauty of it all isn t it i have to say i don t think there currently is and for a long time will be any better entry point to fromsoft games even though elden ring still doesn t exactly help you get through and still kicks your ass every chance it gets it s a fun ass kicking and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone even a bit interested in the genre or in the game itself it might even be time to announce a dlc reveal what do you say fromsoft pretty please tldr game of the year do i need to add anything else wait actually i do there are waifus fromsoft boys truly outdone themselves,141.1,23.0,2,Recommended,"November 26, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Prajz

10586,2022 well now that i ve beaten it exactly at 100 hours over the span of 3 4 weeks i think i can give a penny for my thoughts elden ring is great the scope of the the world is expansive and daring for fromsoft to challenge in comparison to their previous games i d say they nailed it the world is pretty fun to find yourself wandering about and finding meaningful content that such as loot quests lore etc of course if you re not an open world fan i can see this still being a game that you d be reluctant about playing however i d say give it a shot if you can and see it for what it is like there are various ways of tackling elden ring you can spend your time exploring and getting more stronger and making things more accessible or you can choose tackle only the legacy dungeons areas that are more traditional to the souls games and enjoy it that way any and every way you choose to tackle elden ring are all valid don t let anyone else tell you otherwise there s also pvp which i ve only done a few hours doing and well it s a mixed experience for me especially with players spamming the same build moonveil or rivers of blood katanas at soul level 150 but perhaps you can find a better experience than me with pvp later on as more people experiment more with builds the game also has some glaring issues performance most of all being the worst offender even after the patches i m running a rig quite above the recommended setting and the game loves to dip frames below half of what it s capped at being 60 it gets incredibly frustrating when your fighting a boss then your frames decide to tank making you vulnerable to hits and possibly ending your run doesn t happen often but when it happens it s noticeable another thing i d have to say is a pain in ass is the camera there are many times where d you have to fight the damn camera since it loves to adjust automatically especially when you re fighting giant bosses on torrent your mount it s very frustrating and was not an issue in the previous fromsoft games ds3 bloodborne because it was a setting you can turn off aside from these two main issues i have with the game which are fixable i think it s a very enjoyable game and a good entry point for newcomers to the fromsoft souls games definitely worth 60 if you ve got the rig for it have fun and git gud oh and of course ranni best girl,135.0,55.0,4,Recommended,"March 19, 2022",ELDEN RING,Ambrosius

10596,2022 i know many will handwave away any criticisms of this game as salt or reply with git gud but as a fan of fromsoft games since demon s souls this game has felt like the most punitive and least satisfying of the games while the setting is undoubtedly beautiful and there is a fascinating story and interesting characters the design philosophy of this game is especially punishing to put it mildly this game feels as if the character has the moveset of dark souls 3 with the additions of counter guards and jumping attacks while the enemies have the moveset of bloodborne foes and the tracking of sekiro enemies foes in this game are more punishing than ever with delayed attacks enhanced tracking and better ai while this works it feels like a bit too much in some instances it feels like almost every enemy has some 2880 degree combo spin move giant area of effect explosion or some mix of both in addition to these challenging attacks to deal with enemy attacks are harder to read than ever with many different combos having the same start up or coming out incredibly fast while this may be a product of the performance issues of the pc port some enemies feel as if they are fighting with a lag switch even if the game is not dropping frames or otherwise functioning normally i have had numerous occasions where torrent your trusty steed will suddenly drop dead seemingly out of nowhere or instances where enemy health bars will strangely refill or moments where i will seemingly be dead angled by attacks hitting me head on these factors are compounded by the damage enemies can do it is not uncommon to see some field bosses or more challenging opponents doing 900 damage in an attack which is a death sentence for numerous characters especially when these attacks are also fast swinging and usually accompanied by area of effect damage simultaneously the game feels very starved when it comes to runes while numerous rune farming areas have been discovered it is surprisingly disproportionate regarding difficulty and the number of runes enemies drop some of the easiest foes in the game that can easily be stunlocked and killed without difficulty will drop over 1000 runes meanwhile literal giants that can on occasion pose a threat drop similar rates of runes it feels bizarre and unrewarding to see genuinely challenging regular foes drop so few runes instead of the commonly farmed areas speaking of being unrewarding while this is probably a personal problem i do not feel accomplished from defeating bosses in this game i remember the hype of beating ornstein and smough gehrman pontiff sulyvahn and isshin the sword saint when i power through and defeat a challenging boss in elden ring i feel annoyed despite some of these bosses taking all of my skill and ability to beat a boss in elden ring i do not feel the same excitement i did in previous games i do not feel like i have accomplished something it just feels frustrating i am not entirely sure what causes this but the game does not feel rewarding still i will continue to play and i will beat it perhaps once that is done i will update my review and give a final score however this has been the least enjoyable of the fromsoft games i have played for now if you personally enjoy it that is great and more power to you but i have found the game unrewarding annoying and far more draining than any previous games rather than being left with a sense of accomplishment after clearing any milestone in the game i remain left with a feeling of annoyance as if i have completed a tiresome chore rather than an epic boss battle update it is a shame i am not playing salt and sanctuary for this review has been a lucrative salt mine update 2 it appears this review has gotten quite a few responses welcome as mentioned before i will finish this game sunk cost fallacy or not i paid for it and i am far too deep to refund it now as of the writing of this update i am currently a level 90 pure strength build i abandoned my original level 60 character after feeling like i had hit a wall with a two handed quality build at the moment this character has hit a bit of a wall with commander niall if this information helps with your headcannon about me you are welcome update 3 final thoughts now that i have become elden lord i still stand by most of what i have said while there are moments of the game i genuinely enjoy bosses such as the fire giant and the godskin duo are pretty emblematic of this game s boss design and philosophy tedious frustrating and more of a chore than something that can give actual hype while there are genuinely great bosses that can get one hyped up and good early open world design that allows the player to roam around without being walled off i think many of the bosses feel less like a test of skill and more like a war of attrition a war that you can lose highly quickly however it is a war i ultimately won a feat that at the time of this being typed 8 of players on steam have achieved i abandoned my first character after over 20 hours of gameplay and managed to beat it at level 110 in a little over 34 hours after some experimenting there are good elements of this game the world is beautiful the fashion souls are as great as ever and the customization has been taken to the next level at the same time though the boss design is in my opinion some of the worst it has ever been simultaneously there are many reused bosses and enemies even for a fromsoft and or open world game this has always been the case in fromsoft games but this goes beyond even the dark souls 2 pursuer level of reuse there is good here in the game and moments of hype and excitement however it feels especially punishing for certain builds and playstyles at the same time you don t need to git gud to beat many of these bosses if you ask me if you check in on any guide the answer seems to be most of the time you simply need to git bleed or perhaps git spells update 4 seamless co op mod since i first played this game until now elden ring has had several significant patches and quite a few changes real ones will know the pain of 1 0 radahn however with the advent of mods especially the seamless co op mod the game is substantially more fun the co op has been a saving grace of many souls games not necessarily because of how it can make things easier but also the fun community shenanigans that can occur while i still think that on its own this is probably the weakest entry in from s current line up the waves of patches that came in have made the game decisively better and furthermore the seamless co op mod has allowed something genuinely magical to come about the game is substantially more fun and a lot more wondrous in my opinion having a constant companion to play it with faq q a did you try to adapt to elden ring mechanics yes i used consumables the mimic tear ashes which is borderline mandatory in some bosses jumping attacks torrent followed the advice of seemingly everyone on the planet and got a bleed weapon and i even dipped into faith to take a helpful incantation these items can certainly make certain bosses more manageable especially bleeding since we are getting to the point where bosses regularly have over 25 000 hp max hp damage feels more and more mandatory to make the game feel more playable will you continue to play the game i might i am thinking about maybe playing a character that focuses more on incantations or sorceries i also desire to help struggling players against bosses i have beaten and be a friendly summon that can hopefully make their game less frustrating to be honest this is the only real grinding that i enjoy no maidens i rushed through the game from a story standpoint not an exploration standpoint so i did sacrifice her to become elden lord,321.2,460.0,46,Not Recommended,"March 2, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Knight Mayfair

10598,2022 i would give a mixed review if i could elden ring has a lot of issues that could be a deal breaker depending on your preferences i ll list the positives first and then the negatives positives the story is quite good if you re willing to put in the effort to read all item descriptions and carefully listen to all npcs the world itself looks fine depending on how good your pc is the unique bosses are mostly fun to fight and the combat is as it always is in a souls game there s a variety of weapons and spells to use which gives a lot of choice in playstyle negatives the largest issue with elden ring is also its main advertised feature the open world the open world is too large and there is too little to do there there are so many open fields with just 3 4 crafting materials in it and nothing else that is worthwhile it feels incredibly empty furthermore there are way too many copypasted structures in the open world every church every shack every ruin is the exact same the bosses in the open world are usually copypasted and you ll encounter the same bosses in multiple areas sometimes even a unique major boss is repeated in an area where it makes little sense the open world also causes many issues with npc questlines which are harder to keep track of than ever and the use of a wiki is pretty much required to follow them while the world does have a lot of dungeons and caves to find these have many of their own issues anyone familiar with the chalice dungeons in bloodborne will immediately recognize that the dungeons in elden ring are much the same they are all copypasted and just not worth the time there are around 4 5 unique dungeons which you ll then see repeated literally everywhere it s so boring going through the same dungeons over and over again the same enemies can be found in all dungeons as well mines will have the same miner enemies catacombs have either skeletons or gargoyles there s no variety at all the boss at the end of the dungeons is copypasted and the same bosses can be found in different dungeons just with health differences the reward at the end is not worth the time in most cases either this leads me to my next point which is that the performance of this game is really bad if you have an older cpu be prepared to run into a ton of issues that are caused by the game not using the threads of the cpu properly invisible enemies the world not loading correctly bosses not appearing these are all things that can happen because the optimization of the game is so bad the online connectivity of elden ring is also incredibly poor i played dark souls 3 on release and never experienced any of the problems that elden ring currently has playing co op with more than one person will result in one of the summons randomly disconnecting very frequently playing co op with one person is more manageable but there will still be random connection errors even during boss fights the connection problems also affect invasions with invaders randomly encountering connection errors the last thing i want to mention are the current balance issues with sorceries require intelligence and incantations require faith many powerful sorceries can be found from the very start of the game making an intelligence build the easiest way to play from the early game onwards sorceries can easily deal twice as much damage as incantations good incantations can be found only in the late mid game to end game and even then they still aren t as good as sorceries the early to mid game has around 5 6 sorcery focused areas while incantations have absolutely nothing until the late mid game these balance problems could be solved down the road but currently it really sucks that one build is clearly inherently better and easier than other builds conclusion if you don t care about copypasted structures enemies and bosses then you might still enjoy elden ring you should also forget about long co op sessions or consistent invasions however for me these aspects ruin some of my enjoyment of the game and make me hesitant to recommend it,210.1,44.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 26, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Sumwan

10607,2023 i hated elden ring i gave it 24 hours on my first try and concluded the game was too hard the controls were terrible and the whole thing was confusing and unfriendly to non souls like players and i never touched it for many months after that however there was always a nagging feeling that i should try this game again so besides trusted friends opinions i also started remnant 2 and found i enjoyed the difficulty and it reminded me of elden ring so here we are it turns out er has one of the most impressive open worlds i have ever experienced in a game it never holds your hand and it gives you nothing for free in fact you will have to endure a lot of pain to progress and start to feel like you are not dying to literally everything you encounter quests and storylines are not laid out plainly on the map for you there are no markers for the next tower or collectable and important areas can be so hard to find to the extent some are behind invisible walls most people would miss the more you discover the more you realise how absolutely massive this game is in fact there is an entire world underground that is almost a game in itself and there were so many times i had to just stop in awe of a new area that opened up to me simply from wandering almost aimlessly and the game rewards this kind of exploration there are only very subtle indicators as to where the game suggests you should go but it mostly allows you to just explore and put yourself in areas you are far too weak or strong late game to be in they really made something that completely rejects the standardised open world formula we have become accustomed to and while it can be immensely challenging and confusing it is also very rewarding and made me want to explore every area and check every corner to see what i might find i can t recall the last aaa dev made game that made me want to explore so much because the world itself was just so fascinating even if some creatures are repeated throughout no wonder many mainstream devs hated on er so much it really shows up their boring and safe standardised formula the sound is amazing and i particularly liked the voice acting of some bosses who use what i can best describe as biblical terminology that really fits in with the demi god characters though many of the human characters mouths flap around rather than in time with their dialogue which is pretty lazy while the graphics are not next gen they do a great job of making the most of what they have with some truly breathtaking scenery that had me hitting the screenshot key many times however the game defaults to 60fps on pc which is a joke in the 2020 s there is also no ultrawide support and while they added ray tracing that looks really nice even at its lowest setting i found it wasn t worth running as the impact on performance is brutal and they didn t add dlss fsr to help and it isn t like i am running this on a low end system so is er absolute perfection as the fanboys would have you believe well no no it isn t minor issues first the controls for pc are a lot better than earlier souls games i have tried and refunded but they are still quite awkward which i guess is why a lot of people recommended i use a controller the lock on system is mostly fine but at times it forces weird camera angles or will lock on to a goat or flying insect rather than the enemy wrecking your face also why did they make it so if you want to resurrect torrent your horse mid battle it asks you if you want to use a petty flask and defaults to no lmao so mid fight you have to choose to bring torrent back quickly press arrow key to select yes then wait a second or two for torrent to come back i died so many times to this stupid confirmation mechanic alone i also hate how you cant view the map if a random enemy has you in sight i get that they probably want to stop you from fast travelling out of bad situations you get in to but why cant i at least view the map to find out where the hell i am it brings back memories of the mud crabs in skyrim where a random one you cant see would spot you and prevent you from fast travelling until you tracked it down can we all just agree that the key for the map in rpg games should always be m rather than g now to the controversial part that many get very upset with if anyone dares to mention it the difficulty now i knew this game would be challenging and indeed it is but some of the boss fights particularly later on felt for me that they crossed a line from being difficult to just plain frustrating and very un fun also some of these bosses are repeated the strongest ones aren t thankfully and or doubled up which just feels cheap and lazy to me some of their moves are so difficult to react to and can one shot you doing the same boss fight dozens of times over may be others idea of fun but it certainly isn t mine at times it felt difficult for the sake of being difficult rather than providing interesting strategies from bosses in each encounter again the lock on system can put your camera in very unfortunate positions so it can be a case of toggling that on and off to get around it bosses attacks frequently clip through walls or pillars etc and in a game this difficult i feel being hit from behind a concrete object or even one shot killed is pretty damn frustrating some of these bosses gate keep you from progressing further in the story and while i agree there should not be an easy mode i do think it is a shame that 2 3 of players appear to give up if achievements are any indication it s a shame because there are a lot of late game areas that are just as amazing as ones earlier on but many will never seem them and to be honest i totally understand why some would say screw this and quit the game they do allow co op summons and npc allies to assist in fights but as a solo player many will struggle without additional help while apparently far better than previous souls games there can be occasions where you have an annoyingly long trek back to a boss fight the stakes of marika are apparently new additions that act as close spawn points after boss fight deaths and they are great but there were several fights where i had to trek annoyingly far and when you die over and over that gets a bit tiresome it was only through perseverance and grim determination that i managed to get through er my first true full souls experience even at this point i have items in my inventory i do not know what they do character story lines i have no idea if i finished or not and mechanics i don t really fell i fully understood there is a reason people have 1000 hours in what is essentially a single player game the depth is staggering i have tried to do every non essential boss and quest and complete everything possible though i will copy paste my 90 save game to get all endings but i am sure i have still missed countless hours of content elden ring has been one of the most challenging infuriatingly frustrating yet mind blowingly beautiful and memorable gaming experiences i have ever had hence the long rant lol while it is not perfect i feel if you have the patience and persistence it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences ever and it makes me want to go back and revisit previous souls games i am so glad i gave elden ring a second chance,772.3,19.0,1,Recommended,"April

10609,2023 wow i simply cannot do this game any justice by attempting to write a review on how incredible this game is but i will try my best elden ring is an enormous game with so much for the player to discover even now 200 hours in i myself am still finding new hidden areas and secret bosses quests i ve missed in other playthroughs as someone who is completely new to souls games i was slightly nervous coming into elden ring after hearing the difficulty of certain bosses and areas however being an open world game and allowing the user to go to different areas level up or just come back later gives any new player a fair chance and doesn t make certain encounters unbearable like other games from the souls genre personally i find the graphics lore characters storyline all to be 10 10 elden ring doesn t just feel like a game it s a story where you a maidenless tarnished rise up the ranks slaying gods legends and shardbearers to become an elden lord but will you go for a happy ending maybe you like destruction and chaos and want to see the world burn elden ring lets you decide the fate of the lands between i d highly recommend this game to any souls fan as it s proclaimed as the best in the genre ever any open world game fan as there s so much to explore whether it s dungeons caves forests mountains or any gamer who likes a challenge want to test yourself against some of the hardest bosses in gaming try malenia on for size in conclusion this game stands alongside skyrim as my favourite game i ve ever played and it truly is an 11 10,200.0,32.0,3,Recommended,"September 26, 2023",ELDEN RING,"JamesGreenTTV

10610,2022 elden ring is undoubtedly a generation defining game it turns the open world meta on its head removing the pointless filler quests and npcs that make you get things for them that they really should be getting for themselves exploration is encouraged and rewarded you aren t held to a linear path and if you git gud you can take on end game bosses while hugely underleveled the world is beautiful it might not have the best graphics but the art direction is incredible i ve often found myself on a cliff edge just looking out at the view seeing how far i ve travelled and how far i ve still got to go combat is challenging but once you ve learned an enemies move set and figure out how to beat it there s a real sense of achievement you can beat any boss with any build so you can play the game how you want if you don t want to take the time to learn a move set then a cheese is usually available enemies are numerous and varied and you won t get bored fighting the same enemy over and over again even where enemies are copy paste jobs they generally have an additional attack that you weren t expecting as you progress in the game which adds to the flavour a common criticism is that the game has no story but it does it just isn t given to you you need to go looking for the story and complete side quests to understand the implications of your actions and how the characters fit together there s also a lot of visual storytelling in the game and taking in the world around you helps to understand what s happening in any particular area there are a couple of negatives it could do with a few quality of life improvements e g a more liberal use of map markers and slightly better menu navigation and sorting options there are also some small balancing issues later in the game and one particular boss with a specific move that relies a little too much on rng to get past these issues don t take away from what elden ring is it s a masterpiece and you should play it,379.3,57.0,1,Recommended,"March 24, 2022",ELDEN RING,Alan Partridge

10616,2022 just to lay down my bonafides since every negative review here is instantly spammed with git gud or some cringe 2011 type beat i ve 100 ed every dark souls game i ve done speedruns challenge runs the whole lot when i call things in elden ring hard it is not for lack of experience elden ring has a lot of minor flaws sparse armor early game some jank w teleporting field bosses boring crafting boring catacombs the hundreds of spirits and flowers i will never use but i can basically forgive all of those because the game at the start is honestly incredible however about halfway through the development budget totally falls out and every area is now a ten mile corridor full of enemies that can 2 shot you alone the placement feels almost random at times and it gets tilting fast there is an entire lategame subcontinent with three graces that means if you die to any of the 2 shotting wolves or patrolling archer hordes you have to cross the entire thing again the two areas after that are nearly as bad to the point that sprinting through is the only viable option once again i can totally forgive some bad levels every game has some but the larger bosses feel like pulling teeth trying to beat every shardbearer major boss you ll find at least two that are literally unplayable one early game that is easily cheesable starscourge radahn and one lategame that is entirely unforgiveable malenia blade of miquella the latter has an attack that is almost entirely undodgeable with a half second tell that only helps if you re 30 feet away and takes me from 1500 to 0 in a second after all the shardbearers you get the semifinal boss a damage sponge who can 1 or 2 shot with every attack who has an entire phase where every attack is a room filling aoe and who then phases into a grab machine that will instakill you with its comical grab hitboxes and 12 attack combos if you can beat the aoe grab machine you get the honor of fighting the final boss which has a fun if unfairish first phase followed up by a ridiculous final phase full of camera breaking nonsense and a very childlike idea of cool final boss which singlehandedly ruined my belief that the writers had any plan for this endgame like we had a cool final boss in phase one with radagon but they got swapped for the idea of the elden ring like a ridiculous soul of cinder parody once the comical humiliating damage sponge is taken care of you get your pick of ending there are effectively two with one obviously bad third choice where you literally burn the entire world because why not and overall we leave with very little idea what any of this was about what our ending choice even means for the world or what we ve really done in the first place yay game done after 90 hours i feel totally numb and ambivalent to this there are a lot more things to talk about like how finnicky quests become with an open world but i think the worst thing i can say is that i spent all of elden ring planning new runs and build ideas and now that i ve beaten it i just feel tired and let down but the ost does 100 slap and i do love torrent as well as a lot of the npcs 100 a for them you can hug a woman which is more than i can say about my love life edit there is actually precisely one thing from the comments i d like to add to this review if you see anyone saying elden ring has six endings let me break them down for you there is the basic ending there is the true ish ending there is a bad ending then there are three more endings these are all the basic ending with a color filter over the cutscene and a single word of dialogue changed nothing new is added and they amount to become god become god but bad grey become god but very bad red and become god but catholic these feel like extremely late additions and they only highlight how vapid the difference in non apocalyptic endings really is they re meaningless enough that elden ring basically only has three endings also i only learned after writing this that the game features a field boss who is literally the first shardbearer the dude from all the trailers just shows up in the field with a different name and you fight him again elden ring s copypasting problem is seriously everpresent and i ve not touched on it as much as it deserves especially considering how mandatory catacombs are to the game it s fun for one run but by the second playthrough i d really prefer if spirit tuning components were just distributed throughout the fun parts of the game,237.2,303.0,40,Not Recommended,"March 7, 2022",ELDEN RING,"kasenra

10617,2022 elden ring isn t perfect comparing this game to other fromsoftware products one aspect after another it s clear that elden ring isn t as smooth as sekiro doesn t have bosses like dark souls and its story isn t as good as bloodborne but looking this way at anything will make no sense you simply do not order salad in subway and then put one star review saying that they refused to sell you a salad elden rings lore and story game s still fresh vaatividya still works on lore and so far we barely can piece together coherent explanation to what happened before we set foot in lands between it offers some similarities to ideas that dark souls used before and it s open for speculations as much as for the story of the game we re thrown in fractured world only hundred years after the shattering war that no demigod came out victorious leaving lands between in stalemate we re tarnished once stripped from the grace of greater will and exiled coming back to lands between resurrected and yet again guided by the very grace we were stripped from with one goal to become the elden lord world of elden ring to summarize how big lands between are i will say only this there s always more elden ring world is made up from five main parts on surface level this already sounds like enormous place but wait there s more each part has legacy dungeons big structures that player can get lost for hours and still be surprised revisiting the place there are also catacombs minor erdtrees ruins villages and so on it is very densely packed and it gives hours upon hours of additional content to go through still not enough there is literally 3 major underground locations each bigger than the last one and for the dessert whole legacy dungeon floating above the sea near the coastline of lands between it is big but is it pleasant to look at to answer that we can go back and look at last two games made by fromsoftware sekiro and dark souls 3 and precisely fountainhead palace and irithyll of the boreal valley fromsoftware seems to like dragging players through countless swamps and catacombs difficult bosses and whatnot to build up the hatred towards another location that we might need to go through to finish the game and then every negative emotion leaves the body because we re presented with what s called the best area in the game aesthetically that s the case with irithyll that s the case with fountainhead palace and that s the case with nearly every legacy dungeon in elden ring progressing through the world of this game is like going the best location in one souls game to another best location from different game i think there also is beauty in elevation and elden ring does exceptional job at that too lands between are not flat they re constantly changing elevation as we progress through the game but not only between main parts of the map also between locations in those parts fromsoftware creates dark fantasy and i personally think that currently there s no one in the industry better at doing so gameplay of elden ring the most important part for some especially if advertised as action rpg just a reminder you re tarnished a nobody with a simple task to become the elden lord against various demigods with a stick and wooden shield the game is not easy it is not the hardest fromsoftware game but it s still hard especially for newcomers what to expect dying a lot elden ring like any from game has no difficulty slider there s one difficulty get gud fortunately for tarnished elden ring provides a lot of different mechanics to ease the pain such as magic summons broken status buildup bleed cold co op cheesing and last but not least for pc modding there already are mods to change the difficulty by lowering health and attack damage of nearly everything in elden ring to experience the game the best way though is to go through it yourself learn to fight optimize your build and try again because there s no better feeling in fromsoftware games than beating hard boss yourself will you get bored i don t think there s a chance to get bored in this game even with such simple combat mechanics because there s also variety of builds with easily over 200 probably even more weapons over 100 armor sets for your fresh elden bling and many more configurations with new addition ashes of war if that s not enough let s talk about variety of enemies remember seeing total of 19 enemies in god of war from 2018 winner of game of the year there s over 140 unique enemy types in the game that are vastly different from each other except for reskins not many of them though also rats are back now with madness status to make your life even more miserable there s actually a lot of enemies that you will hate with passion you will go on reddit and vent about it and you will see that vast majority of players also hate them i am malenia blade of ashina and hasitation is defeat tldr the game is the only rightful choice for game of the

10621,jaw dropping experience not the best combat out there you will die and i mean a lot elden ring is so rewarding so fulfilling you will have to go back and forth multiple times because you are probably under level but that s why this game is so unique and special i never thought i would like souls like games but exploring this open world is something i have never seen in any other videogame ever before it is truly remarkable every location you explore is incredibly built and designed with tons of secrets hidden places and doors multiple precious items and incredible views to see i truly think everyone should play this game atleast once in his life it is simply incredible something taken from fantasy books just have in mind that you re most of the times the victim you will have to farm exp kill a lot of mobs get good gear and upgrade it until you get stronger in order to go into new areas of the map search a lot online you will probably need it as zones have level caps but this game wont tell you anything literally anything but well i guess that s the beauty of it be patient do not rush enemies study their moves and patterns first then take your move and kill them dodge or parry exactly in the last second remember this is elden ring exploration is key if you cant beat an enemy do not worry come back later for 3 times i thought to myself i m not ever playing this again but i was wrong try it best love hate relationship there could ever be,102.4,46.0,0,Recommended,March 30,ELDEN RING,"Bhzzz-

10627,2023 overall elden ring was a positive experience for me the variety of spells and equipment it offers and the amount of builds you can do makes it one of those games worth revisiting despite its length while the non linear structure of the open world allows you to make your new adventure flow completely different from the previous one unfortunately elden ring is not without its issues and at least for me personally there s quite many i won t go into every detail since i admit that a lot of them may come down to a preference but here s two big problems i believe most people who ve also played the game will agree on by the second half of your playthrough it will become very noticable how the game almost crumbles under its own size which results in repeating enemies dungeons and bosses not to mention the fact that fromsoftware already reuse some of the content from their previous games i understand that it was a compromise to keep the world as big as it is but it also doesn t make interacting with those on repeating encounters any less dull the quest system in this game is pure nonsense and no this isn t me advocating for the introduction of quest markers first in many cases once you progress a quest to the next stage the npc you re looking for will move to a completely different place on the map without giving you even a slight indication where to find them secondly the directions they give you for their tasks are often vague at best too and often you won t even realize you did or found something that can prompt another interaction e g sorceress sellen s quest line basically the probability of you finishing some of the quests in elden ring comes down to pure luck unless you re following a guide it s the opposite extreme i m not a fan of but fromsoftware pretty much force you to choose between the two i could go on and on about the issues i listed above as well as some of the more subjective ones but i think this review is long enough as it is like i said in the beginning i had a good time with elden ring and despite its problems i think the game is well worth your time and the asking price,295.9,43.0,2,Recommended,"October 30, 2023",ELDEN RING,Uriziel

10629,do you know what s worst about this game apart from the repetitive bosses and toxic players the open world and basically elden ring can be your first easiest or most difficult game from fromsoftware and it s up to you which solution you choose it took me a while to understand that i don t have to run where the site of grace shows me and i don t have to fight every mob or small boss i meet on my way there are so many elements that allow us to trivialize the game and bring it to a critical state where we can defeat the boss on the first try and the game becomes easy at this point maybe too easy there are so many easily accessible items scattered around the map just waiting for you to find and collect them that s why the experiences of elden ring players differ so dramatically and it turns out later that someone completed the game with a weapon that wasn t fully upgraded walked only on the main bosses and only on 6 estuses and i could explore look for side bosses upgrade my weapon to the maximum level and the number and power of estuses and have no major problem completing the game and the experience is immediately uneven this only shows that the game can be difficult but it doesn t have to be as i got more and more interested in the game i easily noticed that part of the elden ring community is a kind of special social group of sweaty little guys who have epileptic seizures when you say that you defeated the boss using summons or generally didn t do it the way they did which means probably harder with no hit and with a stick people are able to insult you up to 3 generations back for using normal mechanics in the game which are absolutely not forbidden and are optional gamer culture is pure rot and no matter how you play people will always find a problem with something this game has quite a lot of lore and it will take us some time to understand all of it and it will allow us to understand how much we could have missed while playing the game but it will also allow us to understand the stories of the characters we have to face in the fight the way elden ring is told requires reading items listening to all the dialogues with understanding and connecting the dots and yet most players will end up on vaatividyj s channel looking for the meaning of the fight with a given boss but in a nutshell elden ring is really a big family problem however i don t think elden ring would be a good soulslike for someone who has not had anything to do with this genre of games before because i think the open world can quite easily overwhelm and lose a new player and also make each subsequent soulslike seem too easy or too difficult it s all depends how you ll be playing this game boje si eldeniarzy,89.7,54.0,3,Recommended,August 13,ELDEN RING,El Sin Nombre

10633,what i like about the game in all honesty i think the game is great played it a year or two ago and completed it it was super fun with all the different builds you can do and all the endings to go along with it there are plenty of boss fights with different sort of weakness while you also have yours along with what i ve stated above i would also say it s fun because of the open world and caves you can discover and off course the lore of the game things i never found fun the elden beast boss fightdesign and phase aside a lot of players mostly took issue with the mechanics of the elden beast the boss is large moves constantly from one side of the arena to another literally makes most of the fight require the player to chase the boss rather than fight it at a distance the boss can also spam spell attacks which makes it super unpleasant to fight the communityi think there s an amount of players and fans who are cool but sadly i would have to say that it s ruined because of brain dead people who tell you what s the right type of way to play and have some sort of god complex over a video game most of dark souls community over the years have been known for being egotistical narcissistic and think that they are above other players because they are playing a different build or whatever grow upconclusionif you can avoid the type of players above i would recommend this game 100 as i said in the first paragraph for the open world and all different ways to play i think this game has a lot of replayability and i don t think one stupid boss fight should ruin that experience get the game and stay away from cringe lords,106.2,49.0,0,Recommended,August 1,ELDEN RING,"Impoluto

10665,2022 first sections of this game were fun exploring both limgrave and liurnia was a joy and you could tell a lot of care was put into these zones my enjoyment really started to fall off after these areas however as the problems of the open world and from trying to one up themselves on difficulty started to become apparent i had to go back and play the original dark souls a bit to make sure i wasn t crazy and wasn t simply tired out of the formula bosses combata big draw of these games the bosses are simply unfun and tedious in elden ring here from has given so so many bosses combos that are way too long normally this wouldn t be too big of a deal however they can cancel their recovery often enough to add extra hits to the combo if they feel like it just to screw over your attempts to punish too often in er i feel like i m standing around waiting for the enemies to finish their epic chain combo before i can even maybe have a chance to land a hit in compared to the original dark souls where enemies had explicit combos they could pull off and gave the player time to punish and strike back it is also entirely unforgivable how many times i ve gotten to the end of a dungeon or catacomb only to fight the same half dozen or so bosses for the 4th time only this time around there s two of them or there s accompanying minions it s also exacerbated by the skyrim levels of copy paste that every catacomb mine and cave have going on they all look and feel identical to traverse npcs storyi m 100 hours in and i still don t know what it means to be tarnished or to be elden lord i don t know why i would even want to be elden lord meanwhile in dark souls it s laid bare who you are and what your goals are there in the intro you re told you re the chosen undead destined to ring the awakening bells link the flames and save the age of fire in er you re told nothing outside of the npcs in limgrave or liurnia they have a horrible habit of never telling you where they are going or what they expect of you upon completing a quest they will thank you and say they are continuing their journey and that s it the open world design might ensure you never run into or see this character again as they are now hanging out in a zone you cleared and have no reason to return to overall the game is interesting to see and explore for a while but the open world has really worked against it and the combat just isn t fun anymore many enemies have such insane speed and long combos they feel like they belong in a different game and it not fun standing around waiting for them to finish these moves just so you can have a chance e to play the game too,96.3,167.0,5,Not Recommended,"April 8, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Jallad

10666,2022 product received for free erdtree update ill buy the expansion when they unlock ultrawide that has been here since the base game launched as they just letterbox it see original review section for details on that updated review i played the base game for about 5 more hours i feel like they have fixed a lot of the networking though have not played long enough to try more secluded locations i am now playing under modded conditions with the seamless co op mod i can now direct connect to my son and now his friends whom have picked up the title just don t have invasions while i have mixed feelings on this as some jolly pvp can be fun it s kinda refreshing to just know we can sit down for 2 hours get into game and just do what we wanna do and not have to struggle with getting wiped and resummoning because of seamless coop i am able to fix ultrawide and it is glorious honestly it was coded into the base game you can tell once you play a while with it unlocked i couldn t go back to 16 9 i am leaving this review as a thumbs down untill they unlock base game ultrawide support it should not have to be modded to this extent p s as i have seen this argument before adressed in comments as well no ultra wide is not pvp breaking it s no different than using suround sound headsets to pinpoint your opponents location by sound no amount of debate will change my opinion on this original review son got me the game for someone to play with so i m playing it it s fine as a single player game however the multiplayer system is so broken about 75 of the time i get failed summons or people will get summoned into my game only to get disconnected near right away or shortly after when they do get disconnected it soft bricks my game it makes it so i can t ride torrent any more i hop on and then hop off right away like the game thinks i m still in co op and then for some reason the game won t let me quit it greys out my quit button on the menu so i hard close out the game only to log in to it nagging me about not quiting properly every time i get that stupid message i m about ready to not quit properly forever then there is no ultra wide support and because of eac i can t fix it myself unless i play offline only with how broken multiplayer is i could just do that however it defeats the purpose of trying to play with my son i have had the game load up for a good minute in 32 9 with vignetting so it is programmed in the code to work with ultra wide screens they just disabled it for some stupid reason it was glorious for the short moment it worked i dunno if this next complaint is tied into my rant about multiplayer not working or not but i personally feel the open world aspect hinders the game more than it helps it really the world is so big that the players are so spread out that i see few to no summon signs near boss fights and dungeons could be a fault of the networking when you finally do get the multiplayer to work it has that dark souls magic that is really fun but fighting most the time to scrape out some chunks of fun ain t all that fun lol also due to the massive world size multiplayer should have been handled differently this time around the sign system don t really cut it 1 stop around with summon signs it works in the more linear titles but not this signs could remain as a system for picking up randos however 2 let us just connect directly with friends and literally hook into their world and play together all players also need use of torrent as trecking this massive world on foot is a joke and ya just opt not to and play by yourselves also 3 stop kicking friends back to their own game after a boss is defeated with a project this scale and there being lesser world bosses after we beat something we should be able to continue our treck to the next open world boss or next keep castle all it s doing is adding another attempt at summoning each other that will probably fail and soft brick the game again it s just silly it all just proves to me again to stop buying games at or near release i literally have a 1 year policy where i don t touch any new games for atleast a year and elden ring was gonna be the same if my son had not bought me a copy now i m near 100 hours in my son has pretty much quit due to the fact we are rarely able to play together and i m too invested to quit so here i am frustrated at a boss room writing this review as i look at 3 summon signs on the ground that i know when i activate them they will fail sure do love this new world of games we have had the last decade or so where devs just release broken titles with intent to patch it later sand no it s not my internet every other game works like a champ we are a 4 person household with over a dozen pcs a hand full of tablets phones ps4 5s and switches you name it we got 1000 down and 200 up with 10 50 ms latency and any device that can be hardwired is hardwired also rocking new mu mimo wifi 6 mesh network basically my review needs a middle grey dash option but since steam don t have that i m giving the big red thumbs down button til the matchmaking is fixednetworking issues aside i d say it s a pretty decent title wait a year or more for patches or get a goty version with xpacs bundled in,179.8,118.0,9,Not Recommended,"April 9, 2022",ELDEN RING,Digital_Survivor

10669,2022 performance fix to gain fps and stability disable easy anti cheat is probably bitter elden ring is not sold on their platform so they sabotaged it lol turn of your internet while playing crazy but true somehow the online portion eats up tons of resources maybe some sort of spying software is running did all the tweaks in this video youtube video elden ring dramatically increase performance fps with any setup best settings for any pc views 733 270 how to increase fps in eldenring with the best settings for all pcs and specs optimize elden ring for more fps fix lag reduce input latency and stutter with the best settings better fps i can t run the game at 1080p 60 before even on the lowest settings but with this tweaks i can now run the game at 1440p 60 high and some max settings still wont recommend as doing this method cuts you out of the online mode of the game performance is super poor stuttering a lot cause of inconsistent frames and world loading constantly some particle effects takes a huge hit on fps as well fps is also poor in the open world area 40 45 fps on 1080p all low settings gtx 1080 with trees flickering and pop ins game does not even look that good even on the max settings do not know why it needs that much resource maybe a deal from card makers we don t know they should have added fsr to alleviate this fps issue but hey they probably will sell more cards without it similar open world games like assassins creed odyssey phantom pain death stranding etc etc works flawlessly on release and looked better as well with tons more goinf on in them fromsoft games always has this issues but hey they will fix them later right can not rebind separately sprint and dodge walk button is also always forgotten in this types of console port also auto center wont ever have a toggle to turn off in this type of ports as well fans will still defend this game to no end and its us who is at fault and not the devs that have been babied by these fans for years that is why this is happening constantly on every release of their games they will never learn because they are being enabled by this fans maybe that is why reviewers leaves this stuff out or just sets it aside as they don t want any backlash from the tons of fans this game has which to them the game does no wrong and so apologetic about this issues or just blame the victims,132.2,84.0,7,Not Recommended,"February 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,KyrenCross

10675,2022 i really really wanted to love that game got hundreds of hours in ds 1 2 3 and pre ordered 2 copies of er dark souls open world sounded like a dream come true the biggest initial problem with elden ring is indeed the lack of adaptation of the souls formula to the open world concept this is essentially dark souls 3 with huge open spaces fromsoft decided to apply its same old dying hostile world concept and the result is you soon realize this open world is nothing but stretched out dark souls levels with random mobs scattered around once the illusion is broken it s impossible to unsee it and you spend the remaining 3 4th of the game experiencing the open world as mostly a dash and run chore on your horse actual dungeons worthy of fromsoft s legacy confirm that game development companies cannot reinvent themselves at will stormveil and leyndell royal capital are where the game truly shines at last fromsoft gets to display what they re actually great at intricate inter connecting challenging level design the problem is you have dozens of hours of frantic horse riding and petty dungeons in between those by the time you reach haligtree and farum azula it s way too late in the game especially after experiencing the lackluster endgame regions the time spent on those should have been spent on fleshing out the first 2 3rds of the game i m not even sure what to say about the post capital areas except it s obvious reviews would be really different if they were the starting ones they are simply rushed and unfinished endgame in general makes you realize how rushed the game actually was and how it needed a year minimum to be somewhat close to what it aimed to achieve recycling of content is one of the banes of this game you ll have pretty much met everything you will ever fight til the end before you reach mid game bosses included except for a few exceptions this is another huge stepdown for fromsoft and another clear indication the game needed more development time it doesn t just stand for enemies either you will inevitably encounter the same graves and catacombs churches shacks and ruin models over and over again this harms the entire premise of a believable living world immensely the saddest part of all might be that even the gameplay is subpar to previous games i can honestly not believe this isn t being brought up more by the souls community input buffer is messed up and anything that isn t an attack doesn t register half of the time resulting in your character just standing there after their animation recoveries as a result you end up spamming inputs to make sure they register which is pretty much an insult to what used to be fromsoft s gameplay standards the removal of the one button press to switch from 1handed to 2handed is also a huge downgrade and renders using the new 2 buttons combo virtually useless in battle as you have to wait for your character to recover from any animation before using it there s a weapon swing combo limitation which renders your character unable to continually swing more than 4 times in a row even with stamina left over all of this coupled to the fact jump attacks become pretty much the only viable option to deal sufficient damage for melee builds make up for a subpar fromsoft experience overall balancing is all over the place in every aspect they clearly intended elden ring to depart from previous games by giving more options and versatility to players which would have been fine if they had actually followed by balancing the game for every build type like they always had so far as it stands though it feels like the game was tested and optimized solely on the basis of a handful of op mechanics that make using anything else feel like self punishing melee veterans in particular will experience the strange feeling of playing an underperforming ds3 character against legions of the most beefed up enemies from the same game pvp of course suffers even more from it with a handful of op builds still reigning supreme 2 months after release this again reinforces the feeling that the game needed more time to be fine tuned bosses are for the most part the least solid fromsoft have designed ranging from too easy to broken hard by design the game starts off nicely with tree sentinel and margit but from godrick and onwards you realize bosses pretty much follow the same pattern of increasingly long stun locking combos followed by aoe attacks except for the ones being straight up gimmick fights like rykard there are a few exceptions like the fallingstar beast that genuinely feels like a souls boss pretty much all of those bosses of course get re used several times throughout the game even many of the major ones paradoxically decreasing the game s scale of grandeur the more you expand it and this is the end note you face as you near the end of the game what seemed grand and full of possibilities when you started has shrunk in size the more you ve played it rehashed content after rehashed content making you wish in the end it was smaller shorter but richer i ll end on a special note on multiplayer this is by far the worst experience me and my friends ever had playing a fromsoft game in that aspect the constant disconnections unjustified invisible gates gating off of entire regions once random bosses are defeated and broken pvp made playing with friends a very unpleasant experience there again fromsoft should have adapted their decade old model to this new genre they decided to tackle but they didn t they slapped what was an already convoluted system on a completely new game concept and it works worse than ever on top of it the dark souls 1 2 3 servers are still down after months and might never come back which is insult added to injury to their old fanbase i won t touch too much on the pc performance as many others did but it is pretty bad indeed it is also clearly bad optimization as the game is roughly ds3 with unremovable filters and the latter runs a lot better the eac anti cheat bandaid they applied to fix the exploits discovered pre release is for sure partly to blame on top of it it prevents you from installing any harmless mod if you want to keep playing online so if like me chromatic aberration filters hurt your eyes tough luck because there s no official options to remove it finally what a shame the game is beautiful and full of ideas and potential it would be unfair to not state it did take my breath away numerous times i was actually ecstatic in my first 20 hours but the feeling never stopped degrading after that except when i reached the capital only to fall from even higher after it again i really really wanted to love it and it was that close the game needed more time more development more fine tuning as it stands it is ultimately a mess if you look at it in it s entirety i would have chosen something more neutral than not recommended if it was an option but it s not obviously this review focuses on negative aspects as i feel those aren t shared enough i think the game desperately needs criticism after the ridiculous flawless 10 10 official post release reviews it s really not,208.3,115.0,4,Not Recommended,"April 28, 2022",ELDEN RING,Rabouk

10679,2022 best summary for this game the more you play it the less you ll like it elden ring starts off as a superb engaging exploration of a wide world with many fixed encounters that you learn to navigate and overcome but eventually overcoming challenges only means finding one of the various cheesy weapons and spells available and spamming the hell out of it this issue overflows in pvp where despite a wealth of equipment available you will always face off against opponents using the same few strategies because cheesing is encouraged by the core mechanics of the game and doing anything else becomes increasingly drawn out and frustrating you ll burn out and some point and start outright skipping normal pve encounters because they aren t worth the time and resources they take you to defeat and you just don t care anymore i ve played every souls game before and while each had a level here and there it never felt generalized like that elden ring seems to be lacking this unique quality present in previous souls game where you could do fairly well with any equipment that you felt comfortable with both in pve and pvp it may be because some ashes of war and spells are simply too good too spammable in this game while previously you mostly relied on basic attacks and movement no matter the weapon special moves were there but didn t take center stage enemies didn t need to be so numerous and spongy pvp didn t need to be a cheesefest the few offending weapons were patched and many people who beat you were actually good and deserved it i m still gonna play elden ring for a while but i think their design decisions are such that this drawn out cheese to win design is irreversible and won t be mended until their next game it is because because i know that from software can do better that i am posting this negative review feel free to play and see for yourself,420.3,364.0,32,Not Recommended,"April 15, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Piellar

10682,2023 so the game in my opinion is fantastic and i do not regret buying it but it does have some severe flaws which the community defends with their lives i m not great at writing reviews so forgive me prolarge worldopen worldran flawlessly on my system at 4k though i have a 4090 and 13900k so that s not saying muchweapon selectionmultiple combat stylesgreat charactersbeautiful scenery and graphical modelssense of progressionmultiple endingsconsendings were basically the same and very short very underwhelming after 100 or so hours of gameplay the inventory system is the worst i have seen in a long time very difficult to compare item statistics despite their insistence on weight being a major part of the mechanics you seem to be able to carry every weapon and armour i the game on your person i actually didn t realise having heavy weight was severely limiting my dodge mechanic until 10 hours in at which point the game became significantly easier i found the consumables in the game generally useless i ended up using a small lantern for dark areas and health potions the other items i just hoarded without feeling the need to use them i listed weapon and armour selection as a pro but i found that i didn t really use them my starter armor vanguard and an early game sword carried me through the entire game differences between the armour seemed mostly aesthetic i didn t really feel i had the opportunity to play with other styles of combat due to heavily investing in my current style of gameplay yes you get the option to respec later in the game but by that point i was comfortable and didn t want to suddenly change to a spell caster from melee combat despite the ridiculous amount of spells i was obtaining no journal or list of completed objectives some people can t be glued to the game day after day there is no excuse for this missing ui element especially due to the very poor quest line progression and to have it is not hand holding little to no guidance on npc questlines despite what people say on the forums you can accidentally find an npc in a random location get perhaps a hint off them of a quest line and if you are lucky you will encounter the next part of the quest but then not realise its a part of a quest these quests may only be completed in some scenarios once you have discovered 90 of the game by which time you may have even forgotten the interaction with the npc at the start of the game you can inadvertently lock yourself out of certain quest progression miss it completely or with lack of guidance break the quest or fail it instantly i will give you one example which may be a slight spoiler but it demonstrates the point well there is a non human npc that wishes to become human the npc attains this goal and when you chance upon this npc and try to interact with them you get three dots rest at a site next to this npc and they will be dead i looked this up online and it turns out you have to get a random item from a specific set of circumstances which you must activate next to the npc to prevent this completely random with no guidance there is also another major npc at the start of the game you can miss because the only way to find them is to perform an in game emote which you first have to obtain at a certain location then there is the fact i almost completely missed a major section of the game the haligtree is a separate area which is optional to get to this area you must use a medallion at a certain location which is also used with another medallion to progress the main questline it is not obvious at all that you must use your d pad to switch medallions to get to the optional area i even think i missed this as i didn t have the haligtree medallion complete at this point and location became useless after you discover the next bonfire again i only discovered this as i approached the last boss of the game and was confused about not encountering certain bosses a game should not require you to look up questlines online even if the community defends it by saying you should be more observant you should keep a notepad and write things down what ridiculous statements the start of the game is incredibly difficult i don t mind this i actually enjoy it but once you start levelling and getting used to common enemy animations the game becomes progressively easier to the point of tedium with the exception of bosses which are compensated with much larger health pools or difficult to dodge aoe attacks i didn t really dabble in much pvp i tried it a couple of times as i was forced to from single player content but i ended up being almost 1 shot everytime so i m not sure what s going on there that experience put me off exploring that aspect of the game completely i wish there were some npcs i could enjoy consistently interacting with or keeping the company of there are a couple of npcs i liked but interaction felt shallow end game none of the npcs really mattered

10685,2022 i got my brother in to playing this game which is not much of a feat but he seemed dead set against playing a souls game to be honest i m no fan of souls games either but the rpg aspect gave me enough hope to give it a try so far i have cursed out loud more times than i care to admit this can get real embarassing when you are living in a hotel for work purposes and you come out of your room and people are just like what the hell man my brother summed this up this game perfectly skyrim on insane difficulty this is the highest praise i think he s given anything if you haven t picked up this game and you are thinking i don t like souls games take heart this has souls like aspects but it is not a souls game this is a very good rpg pretending to be a souls game if you took an rpg and took out all the hand holding and fetch quests then ramped up the difficulty took away the easy mode indicators oh he s level 40 i should wait and said do what ever you want you would get close to this game graphicly superior to many games i ve played recently there are still some funny graphical situations things like don t look at the trees too much in the wind they look like giant dusters all moving randomly though i don t buy rpgs for graphics alone i do expect that modern rpgs have modern graphics there is no real reason for 8bit characters when the world is capable of so much better sorry small tangent sounds including music are well thought out and placed i normally turn the music in games right off this game i leave it on the music is subtle almost not there but it adds to the atmosphere rather then distract from it many times i only realise there was music after i ve died most likely or i won the fight i m getting better but this is still the lesser the last thing i say is don t be disheartened when you die it will happen you will lose a lot of runes this game makes you git gud time and again i ve fallen to the same enemy but the joy you feel when you defeat them unmatched in any game i ve ever played you feel like you ve actually accomplished something if you like rpgs especially the old style where you didn t have your hand held the whole way buy this game you may curse me in your sleep but you will enjoy yourself,535.1,16.0,2,Recommended,"March 31, 2022",ELDEN RING,StealthSnowball
10686,2023 tldr elden ring while imperfect is the best implementation of an open world action rpg that i ve ever played it feels like the culmination of every iteration of fromsoft s souls games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue struggle and eventual triumph genre fantasy third person open world action rpg souls gamegameplay elden ring is basically dark souls 4 or dark souls but now you can sneak jump and ride a steed around the open world areas you start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats e g astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer or samurai to be a katana weilding dex melee build you progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain runes that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops sites of grace are the bonfire equivalents in elden ring and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses there are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately elden ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons secrets hidden away in every corner of the map it is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether the open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts ashes of war or an npc standing around waiting to offer you a quest with the introduction of a day night cycle there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you but offer unique drops as well graphics performance elden ring at launch was pretty shaky in terms of pc performance i personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs amd fx 6300 rx 480 averaging 40 50 fps at high settings i encountered no game breaking bugs detrimental fps hiccups in any playthrough though the only issue i encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area but they were still lock on able and would render again when i got closer killed some of the group this is probably just because my cpu is ancient in terms of graphics elden ring doesn t break new ground when it comes to overall presentation but it is a very colorful game compared to previous souls games you can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky landscape dramatically changes as well dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well story the long story short is the elden ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them you are a tarnished which is basically a pseudo undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the elden ring put them back together and become elden lord in order to bring the world back to order all of the details in between for npc s and items is basically found in npc dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together or until a genius puts all of the information together in a youtube lore video strengths combat feels the best it has ever been for souls games sneak attacks jump attacks ashes of war npc summons mounted combat guard counters power stancing and everything else feels very very good touching more on ashes of war they basically allow you to add and remove later a unique skill to most non unique weapons in the game they also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice if you also have the right whetstone so you can make a weapon scale with int or fth even if it originally didn t boss encounters are exciting and challenging if you feel underprepared you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself also feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible it is a game mechanic after all you can build a character however you desire whether it be dual weilding greatswords holy knight melee spell casting wizard or pure archery there are lots and lots of weapons to try leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough the crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat you can even create bow crossbow ammo which is very neat just when you think you re near the end the map expands further and there is even more to discover compared to the other dark souls stories elden ring s story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset weaknesses pc performance isn t stellar if you are bothered by occasional fps spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens not game relevant but the game doesn t fully exit when you quit out until a while later early game bosses reappear as mini bosses or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content there is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid game to the late game it feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1 5 of your hp in damage to 1 2 of your hp in damage ui could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items online connectivity can be hit or miss sometimes when you are summoned to another world you get a connection error and the game boots you back to single player be wary of hackers when playing co op pvp previous exploits have occurred where upon death you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop that exploit was patched but we all know how hackers don t just give up not a negative for me but maybe if you like pvp you can only invade other players if they are participating in co op basically unless a host uses a specific item invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios note afaik fight clubs are only affected in that of summonable participants is limited i don t invade but i ve seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way so many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who e g godwyn vs godfrey vs godrick great runes are pretty underwhelming in terms of power although i enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame it is still to your benefit to just read an npc s quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track numeric score if you care 9 9 10 easy recommendelden ring has set my bar for open world rpg standards the added gameplay features like jumping horse riding sneaking etc make the game s action much more interesting and fun than previous fromsoft games the game kicks my ass at every step of the way but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it though it is not without fault i love this game and can t wait for future dlc,194.8,22.0,1,Recommended,"January 6, 2023",ELDEN

10687,2022 having a dark souls game as an actual open world was always a dream for me i can only complain of the game performance being the only issue that i struggle to play with especially if i want to try and play online with a friend or help people i have spent already around 60 hour simply just lost the track of the main story or the main path of the game events just roaming around exploring every ruins caves and buildings simply to get weapons armors skills and what so ever i finally decided to go on the main path and i been highly addicted to just wake up and have some exploring around the game world i quite recommend everyone to give elden ring a try the difficulty can spike a little at some areas i can say more than previous dark souls series but it s doable the game is quite friendly to new souls players who hasn t played previous titles as well in short this is defo game of the year updated you can simply play and be anything you wish to be in here with more options to rebuild your character i will give even a more detailed review about the game as a whole when i finally decide to finish it which i doubt it will be anytime soon,155.0,29.0,4,Recommended,"March 4, 2022",ELDEN RING,Leathium

10702,2022 elden ring is a good game but unfortunately it s very poorly optimized i kinda dismissed the other reviews saying how bad the frame drops are thinking they re exaggerated but i experienced them myself throughout the whole game i m not sure whether it s just bad optimization or because of the easy anti cheat but the frames stutter constantly some areas more than others but it s just something you have to deal with through the game this is also something i heard from pretty much everyone i talked to this is not an issue of hardware rtx 2070 and ryzen 2700x elden ring takes a lot from fromsoft s older titles and improves on most of them the game is way more accessible with a lot of ways to make the experience easier and also some very welcome quality of life changes which i hope they will continue with and expand on future titles being an open world has it s draws though as if you re a fan of dark souls old world design then you re not really gonna find that here another thing to note is that there is some cut content that s still half in the game and while it s not much you do notice something s off as well as a few bugs here and there online play is terrible in coop and especially invasions you re gonna have a bad time if you even manage to connect and stay connected throughout the whole thing one time i even got an inappropriate activity detected error and was booted to the menu unable to go online this probably was caused by some sort of false positive in easy anti cheat as i understand it happened to many people during that time and was later fixed but still an unpleasant experience as much as i like fromsoft i expect better from a triple a product,228.9,148.0,5,Recommended,"February 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Biiox

10705,2022 this game is amongst my top 3 favourite souls like games the open world innovation definitely takes a positive step in this direction and does not hold the player s hand for guidance the boss design level design in certain areas and the soundtrack make the entire experience very memorable the build variety is unlike any souls game released and you will most likely find a build out there that suits your play style 9 10here are my pros and cons for elden ring pros amazing soundtrack throughout the entire game bosses are incredible in terms of design and spectacle legacy dungeon areas are perfect with tons of exploration being possible as well was some being non linear main progression route has flexibility on what the player decides to do which is a great feeling massive variety of builds to use which all feel unique and fun some being stronger than otherscons it can be easy to over level early on due to the map being open world kind of expected and can t be fixed many of the catacombs or caves will re use bosses which can feel repetitive the open world areas can sometimes feel empty but this isn t massively noticeable occasional lag spikes when going through areas caelid leyndell etc overall an amazing game to play definitely give it a try,256.1,52.0,1,Recommended,"November 19, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Archill

10716,2022 introductionelden ring is a souls like action rpg by the legendary fromsoftware the developers of the dark souls series where the main goal is to expand the genre by allowing you full access to an open world environment players will have treacherous traps to bypass devious bosses to decimate and epic distances to travel on their path to becoming an elden lord positives negatives classic souls formula where combat prowess determines your progression large selection of weapons and armour the sheer scope of the open world is overwhelming a well written and captivating storyline new crafting mechanic is intuitive and easy to use all damage types and builds are viable a truly terrible launch where many bugs and issues still exist in the game there is no tangible balance between different builds mechanically boring boss encounters an abhorrent amount of recycled content especially in the latter half of the game unannounced patches fixes completely break builds this forces you to either farm levels to make up the gap or re assign attribute points at your own cost to fix it storyin elden ring you assume the role of a warrior derogatorily known as a tarnished a being whose existence is an affront in this land where gold and power rule all you soon find out that this world has been torn apart by countless wars and that very little of its once noble kingdoms remain you must use sites of grace elden ring s bonfire replacement to guide you across these lands and seek out the great rune bearers with the hope that you can eventually restore the elden ring itself and assume the mantle of elden lord but this is no simple task as over time these great beings have become lost and confused in a power fuelled madness and they will do anything to ensure the runes remain in their grasp elden ring s story is mostly masked in fog and intrigue and to truly understand it in its entirety you will likely need several playthroughs and to explore every inch of its world to unravel it what is explained to you however is beautifully written and flows exceptionally well for the entirety of the game such a grand cinematic fight a screenshot of elden ring by preator gameplay analysisa world where power is taken not giventhe heart of all souls like games is inevitably the combat where prowess and skill determine whether you are victorious or suffer a crushing defeat elden ring is the same for the most part combat is more forgiving than previous fromsoftware entries especially compared to their previous title sekiro where even minor mistakes could cost you a dozen hours despite its fairer scenarios you will still require some finesse to progress combat is smooth and for the most part pretty fair although there are some cases where it can feel clunky or just plain broken you have far more freedom here to build your character exactly how you want to with limited respec s available to your character as well as a plethora of weapons and armour to choose from combine all of this with both the new and improved ashes system where you can enchant a non unique weapon with a specific skill and a completely rebalanced magic and ranged system you have a fairly dynamic gameplay experience there is also a newly implemented crafting mechanic while i didn t use it to its full potential i can see it being useful to the player who wants an edge for boss fights or difficult encounters most crafting materials are freely available in either the open world or as drops from specific enemies like butter spread too thin on toast this is the best analogy i can give to the game s open world experience in truth the scope feels extraordinary with every visible location in the distance being a place worth investigating it saddens me that this falls short of expectation as the game s format doesn t fit this kind of experience it feels like a flattened and rolled out version of the original dark souls formula without updating it all to compensate for the vast distances this is made more evident in the latter portion of the game where it s riddled with recycled content bosses and enemies you have already fought will return to the fray with slightly more health or a higher damage output which honestly is just lazy game design and it entirely detracts from the atmosphere intended there can be no victory if the war was lost to begin with veterans of the genre will be glad to see the vast quantity of bosses and enemies this game has to offer from monstrous dragons to overwhelming giants this game has it all so it disappoints me greatly to play through the entire campaign completely unimpressed by the lack of boss mechanics tactics and overall strategy there are obviously exceptions to the rule but the overall experience fighting most of them felt uninteresting and stale the side content isn t much better where you are literally just riding around looking for copy paste dungeons or crafting materials to bolster you against the next boss fight audio and visualthere can be no denying this game is stunning a real treat for the eyes in nearly every aspect of its design the world is gorgeous the vistas are cinematic and the bosses are heavily detailed in a way telling you a story about themselves by just standing before you my only major concern is the sheer amount of golden visuals that encompass your vision no matter where you look one of the many beautiful vistas in the game a screenshot of elden ring by preator the audio falls into the same boat with most of it being recycled from previous games it immediately feels a little stale there is a notion of nostalgia here for sure but i think an entirely fresh experience would have done wonders to contrast this perfectly the soundtrack is just something to behold absolutely one of my favourite soundtracks ever orchestrated with each boss and zone bringing entirely new compositions to the fold and elevating the overall atmosphere pc performance and specificationswith settings set as high as they could go i ve had only minor fluctuations in frame rates with my current build below game launch had an astronomical amount of issues some of which were heavily performance based most of these have since been rectified volumes of bugs and crashes experienced in under 100 hours of gameplay some texture tearing and clipping issues were present ram 32gb under load usage 39 cpu i9 10900ka 3 70ghz under load usage 42 gpu msi ventus rtx 3080 under load usage 49 4 final thoughts very goodreview chart here elden ring is a well written and gorgeous adventure that also proves without a shadow of a doubt that you can t simply take an existing linear formula and force it into a new open world shape without it losing some integrity a vast array of new and improved mechanics as well as the large catalogue of weapons and armours you can choose from basically ensures that no challenge is insurmountable and will keep you build crafting for many hours there were quite a lot of bugs and performance issues at launch but these have been rectified for the most part overall a decent game and one that definitely caters to a larger audience than ever before i can recommend this game in its current state but if you havent been a fan of the genre in the past perhaps wait for a sale follow our curator page summit reviews to

10719,2022 i was quite excited for this game since announcement and it surpassed my expectations i had really good time with it even though i was stuck in some instances but eventually managed through i did not expect game world to be this massive at all there was so much freedom to do anything anywhere i was lost multiple times exploring the world huge variety of summons even though mimic was a great idea but that summon should not exist makes other summons almost obsolete there were some stutters and hiccups on my pc occasionally maybe 5 6 hard crashes but did not bother that much i understand that such big world was difficult to fill with hundreds of different bosses so they were recycled multiple times but i think fromsoftware should just remove boss health bars from many mini bosses and treat them as elite enemies legacy story bosses were incredible ok gonna stop before this becomes an essay just wanted to say that game was a blast i had totally great time really well done fromsoftware thank you other open world games have big shoes to fill now cheers er wave,633.7,16.0,0,Recommended,"March 6, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Freaky470M

10723,it s a great game but i can t help but feel disappointed and disillusioned with the direction in which they re taking these games these games now have such a large focus on boss fights specifically and the combat still isn t particularly interesting or deep to engage with you re still just rolling attacks and counter attacking with little depth and variation possible there is still a large divide between spell casting and melee combat now with a more prominent third option being summoning that being through spirit ashes there have been attempts to lessen the divide between these playstyles but they re still so far removed from each other that the difference in combat between them is practically another game bosses have completely meta game attacks that have unnaturally long startups to throw off your dodge timing excessive tracking obvious input reading obscured attacks due to visual effects or have such a specific way to dodge them that i m no longer sure they were even designed with a deliberate defensive maneuver in mind all of the bosses still suffer from a variety of technical issues and other issues that were mostly already resolved in sekiro losing lock on being unable to lock on to bosses even though it s an analog choice input buffering still being inconsistent etc there have been definitive improvements to the combat ash of war jumping crouching stealth horseback and stance breaking are all notable additions but their implementation all leaves something to be desired spell casting also didn t get as much of an improvement and still feels clunky and antiquated with the way you cycle through memorized spells critiquing the implementation of the open world feels wrong as it s relentlessly impressive and in many ways the best part of the game considering it s their first attempt it s incredibly commendable and it s led to some of the best moments i ve had playing their games that being said it s disappointingly formulaic and isn t particularly interactive either a lot of the time it serves as a large impressive landscape to meticulously comb over so as not to miss anything meaningful since the meaningful stuff is packed right in there alongside some of the less meaningful stuff the intended progression path through it is also unintuitive and leads to you easily to being underpowered or overpowered this game really is a sequel to dark souls 3 more than anything i didn t like that game much for a lot of the similar reasons i have issues with elden ring with each new game they release in this style we lose more and more of what made them so unique in the first place some of the most unique features and ideas of the earlier games never got the privilege of refinement this game really is great but in a lot of ways it s far removed from what made me really fall in love with the originals and that just always leaves a bad aftertaste,445.0,82.0,3,Recommended,July 30,ELDEN RING,"palmleafcooking

10728,2022 elden ring is a commendable game where you will most certainly get your money s worth however it falls well short of a masterpiece there are too many flaws of significance for me to consider this one for this spoiler free review i will go through the main features that constitute an er playthrough and souls games in general and break down what er did well regarding them and what it did poorly 1 map design and explorationpros huge map one of the biggest games you will ever playwell made legacy areas areas which are similar to the more linear sections of previous souls games exploration is rewarded a lot to unlock and discovercons open world gets samey quick a lot of obvious reused assets and structures you explore over and over again 4 5 of the open world areas are the same thing but different color palettes the open world never really felt alive and dense once you ve encountered the same ruins and soulless mobs for the fifth time in an hour you realize most of the space is empty no matter what kind of illusion fromsoft fs tried to make they could not trick me into believing the open world areas were truly alive it was only alive in the most abstract of ways these are creatures people that are only there for you to mow down on your way to getting more loot it is kind of tiring to see that these are the only type of dwellings fs is capable of making decreptic villages mindless soldier camps ruins on a lake etc abstract entities for you to visit and then leave never living no innovation same stuff since dark souls 1 the side caves and dungeons get old quickly they look way too similar despite fs s decent attempt to diversify and increase complexity of these optional side areas later in the game the aesthetics and atmosphere felt plastic past day 1 of playing these optional areas become complete fodder once you ve been through them once you know which option open world areas have good loot most don t and the magic of exploration is gone this hurts replayability 2 combatpros excellent combat as good or better than any of the souls games fs did a good job further evolving from ds3 by incorporating some stuff from sekiro such as a posture system where you can break most bosses and mob s posture for a critical hit riposte the addition of a guard counter makes shield play more interesting as well overall the additions make er s combat more in depth and diverse than its predecessors a ton of interesting weapons to try out and find with each weapon class feeling pretty different to play powerstancing dual wielding is also reintroduced into the series and offers more options for your builds spells and ashes of war customizable weapon abilities are stronger and cooler than ever a lot of builds combinations to try out that can each play out quite differently solid diversity of mobs to encounter even though quite a few are reused or re colorized throughout the game above average job a fun summoning system that offers a wide range of diverse spirit characters to help you in most boss and some mob fights this system called spirit summons offers flavor for roleplaying and is another way one can adjust the difficulty of the game to fit their needs since the quality of the summon can make the fights somewhat easier to much easier cons powerstancing isn t balanced properly the extra weight and stamina usage is too little of a drawback compared to the massive damage buff weapons abilities and spells are not balanced not too big of an issue concerning pve elden ring on average has the worst bosses of any fs game i ve played there are probably only four great bosses in the game two being main bosses and two being side content optional bosses despite the game touting 125 bosses there are only 9 truly unique major bosses the lowest of any fs game the rest are reused assets with small tweaks and or gank fights not very creative many of the bosses felt like they were not playtested and the fairness in the dance between the learned player and a boss has been perverted the poor boss designs often force players with less time experience or skill to depend on the spirit summons to make a fight less frustrating i highly recommend this yt video someone else made that i agree 95 with youtube video elden ring bosses an unbalanced disappointment views 801 364 subscribe to join the demodcracy top 10 s and rankings playlist twitch discord 3 characters art direction and world buildingpros quite a few of the most memorable and lovely moments in my recent gaming have been through the side quests and npcs of this game some of the best designed characters you will ever meet in gaming are in this game i still think about them every other day the fact that these characters are vehemently discussed and memed upon even months after release goes to show you the lasting legacy of this part of the game despite the painfully obvious reused assets and foundation pieces of the game the art direction did a good job of improving the boring samey world each area in the game has its own unique vibes and color palettes there is one open world area the only one of the 5 open areas that i didn t feel was poorly copy and pasted that is one of the most creative and interesting locations i ve played in any game i was shocked when i discovered it and truly thought i was transported to another world if one looks at the concept art which was as thought provoking and splendid as any other fs game i think fs did a solid job at bringing it to life good lore despite being difficult to piece together probably my favorite lore of the fs games i ve played remember to read the descriptions for everything you loot for lore tidbits cons frustrating and archaic quest design i respect and like miyazaki s approach to quests but fs needs to make them easier to follow and more accessible keep the organic approach but with more clues on where to go next and a journal for tracking extra comments audio and background music did an apt job in contributing to the atmosphere typical like any souls games i was disappointed in the boss music too few stood out pvp kind of sucks worst of any fs game i ve played too much to say for this review i think fs made a mistake with coop only invasions a feature where you can enter the game of another player and try to kill them since it will dwindle the activity level and health of the pvp long term we are already seeing it happen lack of solo invasions also means less people will experience pvp and get hooked further harming the health of the game long term poor weapon spell and abilities balance there are a lot of op and broken things you can do that still have not been patched concerning technical issues i have a mid tier setup and was able to get on average 50 60 fps on every setting on max at 1080p however the game is still unacceptably poorly optimized my stuttering issues weren t bad at all overall a smooth experience my cpu runs er an average of 5 degrees celsius hotter than other games and the increase in fan noise is noticeable this high temperature issue is a common one upon further internet research there is sometimes crashing on the loading screen and when entering multiplayer this is better than before with patch 1 04 but not completely fixed,556.8,63.0,2,Recommended,"May 22, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Bachian

10748,2022 is this the best souls like game ever maybe not probably yes but i can whole wholeheartedly say that this is an amazing game it will probably be my 2022 goty yes it has some problems here and there especially the online connectivity but i have enjoyed every minute while playing it the open world gives me plenty of space to explore and find interesting things the story is the most fleshed out of the latest from software games except sekiro that one has the story told in more conventional ways but the combat makes up for that here are so many characters in this game and each on of them has so much dialogue it is a lot easier to make out the story in elden ring than any dark souls bloodborn or demon souls and oh my god the worldbuilding is so vast the gameplay is the well known souls like gameplay but this time the player has so many more tools to use to overcome hardships in the world of lands between from better spells with longer range to ashes of war that can be put on almost any weapon and summoning ashes to help you during boss fights or while exploring the world i think even the co op experience is a lot easier than in the past games now you have basically infinite resources to call other players to help and you can no longer be invaded if you play alone invasions also have no great rewards so i think most people won t even invade yes some people hate that invasions are mandatory for co op and i respect their opinion but i don t agree with it the game offers a vast array of bosses and weapons which can be further customized with different ashes of war this makes the game feel very diverse i ve played 3 different characters from start with two of them i ve completed the game close to 100 3rd playthrough is still not finished and i have to say that it felt very different every time elden ring is one of those games which i will never delete from my hard drive and will always come back to it and play some more,571.4,54.0,3,Recommended,"May 29, 2022",ELDEN RING,Adi

10765,2023 hands down undoubtedly the game of the year the sheer scope and grandeur of the game along with its sense of exploration and wonder are just simply unmatched among the very best that games have to offer it plays as a truly great game for the first 2 3rds of a typical playthrough after which i am dumbfounded by how sharp the drop off is how can a game provide 40 hours of near perfect experience and be tarnished by 20 hours of uninspired and truly baffling decisions at the end from poor use of repeated content and poor late game balancing to truly boring and at times truly unfair late game bosses it s frustrating how sullied my experience is with the game because of how padded and unnecessary certain sections and bosses during the late game were youtube video essays such as joseph anderson vg matthew and neverknowsbest s do a great job detailing these more than any review you will see here this game is well worth playing it s an experience that almost universally is agreed upon as near perfect at least until the late game however the joy of finishing the game is simply not there for me i didn t feel that sense of triumph in overcoming adversity and culminating in a fitting end to the story instead i am simply glad that it is over along with botw this has shown me what a truly great game is like at least in some aspects i am glad that this game has inspired me to get into playing more singleplayer games where competitiveness is not the be all and end all 8 10,61.7,62.0,5,Recommended,"January 7, 2023",ELDEN RING,"ArchydaCookie

10767,2022 quick summary first i ve played every game from fromsoft starting with dark souls and i view bb as the best i have roughly 1400 hours across the series and have done everything in this game elden ring fails as a souls game and it is with this opinion i would not recommend despite that it could be a great open world game it has fantastic visuals and the world is interesting sometimes but it has awful repetitive bosses copy pasted enemies with different coats of paint zero direction for the player a useless crafting system and unrewarding exploration the story is easily missable as the exposition dump character only appears at certain graces and only if you notice the talk to her button appeared i normally don t have an issue with the story in these games as the environment and item descriptions do the telling but not knowing why i need to become the elden lord or how the world got the way it did kinda sapped my motivation which consisted of exploring and find a new thing from what i can tell its the same thing as dark souls with fire being integral big trees and really boring naming convention eld erd every name starts with a m seriously we have marika mohg mohgwyn malenia melina miquela millicent miriel and runes instead of souls not having a scooby where to go is par for the course with the series but is exponentially worse with the open world as the graces only point towards the nearest lord not the medallion you might need some legacy dungeons are horrific stormveil comes to mind i couldn t imagine being a new player and experiencing that fresh hell as the game encourages you to go there first instead of the nice southern area to get 3 tears having three secret areas within itself is some dumb design the consecrated snowfields the haligtree and the blood area can be missed despite the fact they each hold one of the lord bosses that drops a great rune the reward for exploring is pitiful see that item behind the illusionary wall and protected by a hard mob it s a crafting flower that has an infinite respawn area you just killed a hard boss useless ash summon for you 90 of the armour i had was farmed by enemies or bought from merchants i honestly think dark souls 2 has a better enemy variety which was lambasted as dudes in armour in this game when i go to a different area it is the exact same knights and footsoldiers in different coloured armour and composition of allies i get that some enemies have to be reused but seriously i should not see them in every area oh and some reskinned mobs from previous games make a visit like the demi humans are reskinned monkeys from sekiro the world looks phenomenal especially the underground environments like nokron despite some goofy stuff that might be a reference but takes me out of it like the nights cavalry aka nazgul godfrey joestar blaidd who is literally guts the crafting system brings nothing of value to the formula i think i crafted one stack of arrows and an item discovery boost as arrows can be bought and are of better quality buildup resist items were never necessary firebombs and the myriad of variants were borderline useless as hitting the thing with a stick is quicker and less likely to get you punished for missing usable items only challenge runs should be more interesting now the bosses are horrific there are multiple slightly beefed up mobs with a health bar and name gank fights happen too often to artificially pump up the difficulty some bosses are too big for their arenas so you fight the camera tree spirits suck some can fly so high you can t see them so dragons consist of please dive bomb me don t breathe fire most unique bosses have fast high damage attacks glue like tracking multiple distance closing attacks most standard attacks have aoe effects think twin princes overhead from ds3 or lawrence from bb some form of delayed attack like the nameless king now can you see the issue bosses went from most of the time playing on similar rules as the player as big weapon long reach big damage slow even bloodborne to a lesser extent understood this like ludwig aoe attacks used to be limited to 1 attack that had an easy tell a fast backhand attack would do little damage but now borderline one taps even if you overleveled vigour not a single boss was enjoyable no memorable greats like o s artorias gwyn maria or friede gael soul of cinder genchiro fume knight ludwig i went through this game praying for a good boss and the closest i got was malenia who while fast and stupidly hard hitting felt fair until she spammed one bs attack killing her was pure luck that she never used that move every other souls game i looked forward to the next boss and learning the fight like a dance now it was sheer dread as to what flavour of lawrence will kill me this time with bloodborne being my favourite game high speed gameplay is what i love but this game suffers for it as you don t have the mobility to keep up with the bosses apparently the optimisation is also rubbish worked fine with me but your mileage may vary this game was not meant for solo players it was very clearly designed around co op and spamming ash summons which goes against everything i knew about the series i honestly do not want to play it again unlike the others where i was excited for ng now because i went against the almighty miyazaki i expect to

10769,2022 elden ring is a good game perhaps the best game fromsoft has made give or take sekiro there are a lot of people who are going to play it and love it unfortunately there are also those who will read the ridiculous aggregate reviews rife with some unseasonably lofty claims and forget that this is absolutely a fromsoft game i came into elden ring as someone who has never really enjoyed fromsoft games hopeful that this would be the one that finally snags me i mean look at the reviews right despite my distaste for the sub genre i ve played and beaten each game at least once for reasons more to do with social circles than aught else so i feel like i have experienced enough of fromsoft s content to be well versed in how each game flows i was thus expecting elden ring and its open world to be the major shake up the series gameplay desperately needed in my opinion sadly this was not the case essentially in place of an engaging rich open world i found a dark souls themepark it s vast and overflowing with dark souls things you can do everywhere you look dark souls under that rock in that cave look at that castle on the hill guess what s in it that s right dark souls if you like dark souls you are going to have an absolute blast elden ring is an incredible unforgettable dark souls experience in fact for you this review should not be taken as a negative but as an overwhelming positive that said if like me you have not historically enjoyed dark souls don t expect there to be much gameplay left beyond that classic loop to make up for it elden ring is a dark souls game through and through the rooms are just wider edit horse is pretty cool tho,93.3,151.0,12,Not Recommended,"February 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,Scyke

10824,2022 i had enormous expectations having put a thousand hours into dark souls 3 alone sadly er is tainted by design decisions not fully thought through and a refusal to question the ideals of a framework first established with demon s souls in 2009 and i ended it wishing i hadn t played it at all more on this later or that steam would finally add a neutral rating for context excluding a discarded run and multiplayer my completionist and almost entirely guide free solo run lasted around 150 hours beating every boss barring malenia without summons let s open positively elden ring inherits ds3 s dna particularly combat the same crunchy brawls responsive controls and top tier animations that characterised ds3 aided by expanded enemy weapon and ability variety with magic being more diverse than ever from s signature storytelling returns requiring piecing together environmental details item descriptions and other vague information to decipher the full picture avoiding interminable cutscenes or overbearing hud notifications the lands between is geographically impressive it fuses aesthetically and mechanically diverse biomes into vertiginously stacked layers threading interesting discoveries through challenging navigation aided by a time of day and weather system that adds subtle gameplay changes so why the thumbs down ds3 is great because it s meaningful it s an incredible fantasy brawler but shines with its premise of a cursed world having its blighted existence artificially prolonged by an age of fire unnaturally lengthened by gwyn and his tragic legacy s followers the ringed city dlc literally warped and smashed the series together until only ash remained at the end of the world and time itself in a manifestation of cosmic decay from a realm prohibited from moving on its creatively defiant metacommentary rejected a pop culture engorged on commercialised nostalgia and humanity s obsession with the past impeding a new better world being built using from s own ludography to show stagnation blocking progress it had to innovate to avoid hypocrisy so it repurposed old combat mechanics and weaponry into new rhythms and tonally shifted from quiet hope in the face of graceful sadness to crushing desperation not to fix its cursed world but to euthanise it and start anew instead while retaining the series unrelenting melancholy and heart of gold er ignores that it retroactively invalidates ds3 s message of moving on from an unsustainably tired world by repurposing years of content and when it does deviate it does so uncharacteristically clumsily for from this is why i wish i hadn t played it ds3 made me laugh cry and stuck in my mind for years and was ultimately about something bigger than itself and powerfully resonated for it er contradicts ds3 s critique of wheel spinning by indulging repackaged nostalgia in the same way disney s maligned star wars trilogy has left people feeling worse towards the franchise than if no new films had been made at all the story is shockingly conservative with almost identical plot points settings characters and themes to from s back catalogue we again have well intended rulers cursing the world in an attempt to save it religious fundamentalists spurned vengeful offspring agents of chaos and a tarnished now literally player enforcing a new world order the biggest change is a bloated chain of divine command expanding ds demigods with empyrians fingers the elden beast aliens and cosmic gods but it brings few new ideas this is the reanimated corpse of a concluded story that meta commented on such narrative necromancy and is immensely disappointing for it worse what little new exists is often explicit and definitive trading the intriguing mystery of ds s nebulous motivations and history that still produce seismic theories a decade later for a story nearly entirely resolvable in a single playthrough there is a tonal shift from quiet tragedy to bellicose grandeur of divine infighting exploding into total warfare but if anything interferes with deep emotional investment it s unlikeable middle managers arguing over who deserves the office promotion conflict between irredeemable villains is a far cry from the turbulent power of ds s greek tragedy particularly in a setting largely morally binary and with a less charismatic cast standouts like rya or blaidd don t impact like solaire s devastating misfortune or siegward s surprising nobility characters were the emotional core of ds but are neutered here by worn tropes and the meandering pacing inherent to open worlds gameplay is also a missed opportunity ds3 s combat is great but sekiro s is easily the best ever in a game of its type yet we re back to ds3 s unbalanced weapon classes and abilities inconsistent magic and same old movesets lacking sekiro s thrilling posture and counters mechanics dual wielding ashes of war and guard counters are small improvements rather than an overhaul that had six years to materialise and the camera is as bad as ever content suffers from repetition too dungeons keep cropping with the same music bosses and presentation occupying a huge chunk of a completionist s playthrough and the non dungeon biomes feel interminable as you re incentivised to be extremely thorough in these needlessly enormous areas in search of equipment lore and quests quests are as obtuse as everyone s saying borderline impossible to complete without guides a from staple magnified by the overwhelmingly gigantic map diluting quality even further er s first areas are exciting but fifty hours in become tedious particularly with the second half s environments primarily being single level plains with occasional repeated giant assets the initially impressive scope grows tiresome in its enormity and leads to a game that s harder to balance and populate with unique content particularly evident in the later difficulty spikes and clearly unfinished areas and encounters including final bosses that pale in comparison to the thematic or mechanical significance of ds3 s soul of cinder and slave knight gael bosses are just bad across the board most movesets chain four or five attacks together leave you waiting for an opening far longer than actually fighting and many require specific builds to overcome damage sponges homogenising combat into a wait wait wait wait single attack wait loop 150 bosses is too many for from to make each interesting fair memorable or downright enjoyable er s multiplayer is also from s worst since ds1 hits can sometimes take over ten seconds to register and disconnects prevail reduced summon counts neuters fight clubs invasions are overly unbalanced and spawns are terrible and with covenants gone so too are the emergent player dynamics and roleplay finally er s presentation is mixed its style is outstanding characters are strikingly creative and full of personality environments are dense with detail and sound effects are as satisfying as ever though the music rarely reaches ds3 s heights and is often repeated but from s ambition far outpaced their technical capacity er is graphically antiquated but the elephant in the room is the worst shader compilation stutter in years paired with disappointing framerates considerable crashing and cheating aplenty the stutter single handedly ruined the first third of my playthrough dissipating after about 70 hours but never fully resolving and is bad enough to alone make this review a thumbs down er wavers between being a retread of old ideas and a failed attempt at new ones it s such a missed opportunity if all you want is killing enemies in brutal combat it s great the ds template alone earns er inherited praise but if you re after an emotionally and philosophically challenging story pick up ds instead,242.5,18.0,0,Not Recommended,"March 1, 2022",ELDEN RING,The Jules

instant now it s very much not i checked with my friend who played before and after he also noticed the same furthermore now i see stutter in some indoor ares whereas before i had it mostly in the open world areas outdoor areas are not working any better for me too basically i have worse experience than before the patch original reviewok the core of the game is brilliant sadly i can t recommend it now as of patch 1 02 i disregarded all the technical reviews where a lot of people complained about performance most of them didn t run the game on the highest end hardware so i thought hey my specs are better certainly my hardware will manage no this is definitely not subjective not specific to only my software hardware as you can see all over the internet people with 20 series and 30 series are having the same problems as i am i have strix rtx 3090 oc i5 12600k 32 gigs of ddr5 and wd black sn850 i also have the latest video card drivers the ones that explicitly mention elden ring support the latest windows 10 updates the game manages to drop frames as low as 40 on pretty much any settings i also have vrr monitor and it helps but not much i can perceive frame drops without any fps counters as it reflects on the gameplay it s especially noticeable in the open world areas and affects not only the visual fluidity but also the flow of the battle for me basically not only the frame rate drops make it harder to time a dodging roll just because the game suddenly stutters right during a boss attack it also directly translate to input lag where pressing a button does not immediately result in a corresponding action this game requires precision and the stutter cripples that in dungeons literal dungeons or areas behind the fog it runs pretty well for instance i had no problems during the margit fight and enjoyed it a lot but fighting tree sentinel was so choppy i just had to quit the game for good edit after playing more godrick the grafted which is not open world and is not optional fight was pretty awful performance wise most of the time it was smooth but at random times when i was very close to the boss and he would do some attack the game would stutter only because of that it took me almost twice as long to defeat him now on the same hardware i can run dying light 2 with all the ray tracing effects on at 4k with dlss with locked 60 fps well it drops very very rarely and i can see it only from the counter it doesn t affect the actual gameplay if i disable rt in that game it runs so well my pc is dead silent doesn t stress anything enough to engage fans to make them audible enough this is mind blowing i mean elden ring looks great but it doesn t have any of the interesting technical effects i wouldn t call this game next gen in any sense it doesn t have photorealistic textures of horizon forbidden west it doesn t have incredible shadows and illumination of dying light 2 sadly i can t refund this anymore more than 2 hours played most of that time i spent trying out different video configurations and going to different areas of the game finally i went on and bought the game on xbox series x in performance mode it looks good never scales up to 2160p in open world so it s not as clear on 4k display as the pc version and runs perceptibly better it does have fps fluctuation but it doesn t effect the gameplay as much as it does on pc furthermore xsx runs the game dead silent while my pc is very audible in open world areas as the game makes the gpu card clock speed go to the maximum frequencies are higher here when in dying light 2 with all the rt please don t support this sort of attitude from the developer with your money i regret that i did this is the only new game that runs worse on my pc than on the current generation of consoles it s beyond ridiculous if you have the chance go for the console version if you don t just wait for some patches some additional information for more clarity geforce driver 511 79 has game ready for elden ring in the release notes things i ve tried in the game settings changing pretty much every setting from lowest to max 2160p resolution 1440p resolution pretty much the same issues i mean on rtx 3090 what the bloody hellnow it s a d2d12 game so it has direct access to low level apis which means i had little hope in any of the suggestions found online would help but it didn t take me too long to try so i did the high performance thing in graphics settings of windows unlimited shader cache size in nvidia settings disabling microsoft device association root enumerator none of the above resulted in a smooth experience basically whatever is causing the stutter would cause the stutter no matter what settings i had i can run at 1080 with lowest settings and get stutters at exactly the same places as with 2160p and maximum settings the game is not bottlenecked by any of my hardware it s something wrong about the way the developers used d3d12 it seems out of curiosity i ve underpowered my gpu from power target 100 to 80 lowered gpu boost clock from 1860 mhz to 1674 mhz listen to this no effect on the performance whatsoever i mean elden ring was actually utilizing the gpu to the max and stuttering now it works absolutely the same with significantly underpowered gpu now as for comparison to xsx version as i ve played it a bit more now initial loading time continue from main menu is twice as slow on xbox series x as on my pc this is a bummer looks like loading time on death are slightly better than the initial loading but it s still much slower than that of pc in open world the resolution is very noticeably lower than 2160p furtermore the frame rates are very eager to drop my current go to for testing is the very early tree sentinel fight on pc it s jarringly bad on xsx in addition to having sub 4k resolution the frame rate here goes pretty low but it doesn t feel that bad with vrr i actually almost killed the boss with the initial level character on my first attempt on xsx on pc i struggled to kill him even after gaining levels and downing margit only because of the major stutter in conclusion please don t give money to this kind of developer i see already that the game sold very well on pc and it s sad i mean who forced the company to release the pc version without properly testing it i am awfully sure they were aware of the performance issues when they released it otherwise they had zero testing which is even worse why not release the console versions first and delay the pc version also i scanned the steam forums reviews and there are still plenty of people claiming they have a smooth experience at this point i don t believe they do by now i know some people tend not to pay attention i ve seen plenty of people before current gen consoles claiming they are totally happy with 30 fps in their games and saying that 60 does not improve the game now look since the ps5 and xsx started having plenty of games supporting higher frame rates the console crowd is loving it and complainign about new games running at 30 fps now people are saying that anything higher than 60 is unnecessary and not even perceivable yeah right in a couple of generation the consoles will have 120 fps in plenty of games and people will enjoy that,151.4,21.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,"NeverwinterMoon

10865,2022 i like the game however it is a stuttering mess even on the best rigs also the effigies that are suppose to let you play with your friend failure to work on launch which is really disappointing honestly that i would forgive but they have got to patch the stutters and all that bs stuttering while fighting a souls boss as you can imagine can make the game feel like dog crap imo just wait till it runs better and all the features work in a month or so with a patch save your money for now,299.5,16.0,2,Recommended,"February 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,SNAFU
10872,2022 product received for free read my full review here www gamebyte com elden ring is simply put one of the best open world games i ve ever played it has all the dna of a soulsborne title but brings in new features from other genres to give it a little bit more of its own identity there s a bit of breath of the wild in there a bit of shadow of the colossus it s more approachable than the other souls games because its designed from the beginning as a more accessible experience there are plenty of little changes from the older soulsborne games that make this a great on ramp for new players and i m not talking about easy mode i m talking about actual features level design character systems etc that keep the game challenging but not as difficult for bringing in new players gaming is for everyone and it s nice to see how the core fromsoftware experience has been retained while also providing a more enjoyable experience for more people i think it s a real masterpiece check out the full review linked above for 2 000 more words on why that is,140.5,44.0,3,Recommended,"February 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Olly

10889,again and again i entered the violent lands of gold facing crashes and frame drops twice i respawned in a world with not a single soul in it only strange moons over the empty wastes power washed by storms and god rays then i perished in a sapling why couldn t i hold a grudge for starters the black knife goth gf of gaming possesses a pornographic level of mass appeal 80s fantasy ost exquisite architecture and every detail has a clear purpose the prettiness of flower fields the sick armour sets the towering spires the suffocating catacombs nothing is over designed vistas are money shots but a random room can resemble a painting and the game looks awesome in action all these flashy animations and effects dramatic lighting how the water splashes when a leviathan octopus leaps into the air waving its tentacles abyssal woods gargantuan hands tremendous poop in my pants diminishing returnsevery playstyle is valid but i have preferences i went with polearms and faith buffs for versatility no summons or mimics these tend to break bosses and broken souls are a sad sight after all what is the adhesive binding so many people to these cruel worlds suffering seeking something that would ease it is part of it souls forfeit easy mode and blaming it on the community s elitism is reductionist your advantage is built in i m a scrub and i found mine if given the tools to express yourself through boundless gearing and stat options you refuse to figure out how to mitigate the pain hurt on alas the balance is delicate when you overlevel you may miss good fights radahn was a pushover by the time i checked on him half of leyndell was f cked i got carried away seduced by exploration to be punished for it mercifully things evened out as i restrained myself to play on curve before losing more game loreto parse a souls game s narrative is typically its biggest challenge i always fell for the poetry of fragmented storytelling so consonant with the shattered realities having said that here the meaning isn t as codified your avatar a lowly tarnished their kindred exiled by the god queen in the past returns to the lands between to fulfil a bitter prophecy undergoing a vibrant kind of decay much the land got encrusted in the blooming buboes of rot in your absence the beauty one s eyes find in such a disaster evokes a semblance of guilt leave it to the righteous dogs on your hit list akin to a gloating viking you charge at the brood of demigod royalty take their heads and melt down their golden idols and the ring what of it maidens i d do it for a donut while the plot is relatively clear the quest design is obtuse reflecting on the uncaring world i guess you ll be gently guided by detached characters who either dismiss your ass or die for it they reappear at random reluctantly sending you on obscure missions just to get rid of you for a while or so it seems this isolating alienation is so compelling who knew we longed for a dehumanising angle left for dead with our incomplete self at last we become unstoppable vessels of senseless dedication is this a vengeful voyage of hope or the freedom of losing it maybe it isn t alienating at all instilling a sense of being sheltered instead imprisoned placed in a pocket realm of someone else s misery to soak it in like a napkin for this intimacy i play offline sike my internet is trash the lands betweeni played for the sense of discovery coming with trespassing in liminal spaces taking in the esoteric structure that s close to shadow of the colossus with its hurtful grandiosity don t get too sentimental complacency gets abused by unfair monster placement traps pits everything getting to know this world is like walking in heavy rain despite the efforts not to wet your socks soon there ll be nothing left to lose the rain pours on everyone but you re so drenched you become its integral part revel in that sad freedom the world was designed for agency not to waste your time it knows how to fuel your greed for progress and adds that gambler s ardour to the process of not so aimless wondering there s always a shortcut to unlock an upgrade something to meaningfully interact with or delve into lush castles of intricate designs underground cities wuthering heights ruins brimming with spoils and dungeons that keep the records of my failed platforming the rampant recycling gets old after a while you ll see the same bosses and crypts many times a big open world invites big concessions but it also lets players decide if they wish to participate don t like a particular boss or area leave it be for now think laterally to digress in search for power is only diegetic and it never wore thin for me everything is interwoven stapled by the hardships deepening what could otherwise be a laborious checklist ordeal a good fightthe complex synergies between the mechanics carry the combat system on their shoulders i jokingly describe its stamina based nature as chain smokers break each other s arthritic joints but it s a perfectly gamey concession a good fight forces you to learn thy enemy s patterns while leaving room for reaction and preparation it s a game of delays and commitments that teaches you to make split second predictions and hone hard earned improvisational skill at higher levels of play but your best skill is patience enjoy dying until you go slo mo and your efforts culminate in a spectacular catharsis after doing most things right most for you don t have to fight clean healing flasks allow for mistakes and you re given a bunch to facetank like there s no tomorrow regardless combat is tactical and visceral reminiscent of dancing rather than a brawl a good fight looks like a chaotic mess initially with each attempt come more recognised patterns often the only thing it changes is that you die with a smug expression on your face the violence is so good it makes one emotional except killing mini bosses like trolls and dragons quickly becomes stale how a hyena takes down a rhino stick to the nutsack there s never a reason to leave their crotch areas and the same tactic works for most i pity the giants of this world seeing them used as cannon fodder slaves or food now this all the thrashing beasts are lovely though tree sentinel mvp and the main bosses are as good as they come some suck but the general consensus is that they rocked everyone s world all have banger themes and balletic attacks of hypnotic grace most of them behave evident telegraphs ample openings okay hitboxes short runbacks modest grabs and tracking attacks not a lot of cheapness like adds or pits margit is body pillow material i loved hated malenia both mohg fights are superb rennala is mid albeit her knightly sister rellana paid her family dues in full dlc

10918,2022 this is basically a negative review for people who like soulslikes and all previous souls and sekiro games if it s your first game it might be fine for you albeit very hard on the main bosses i ve played for 13 hours beaten about 2 3 major and 4 6 minor bosses and i want to say that it s honestly underwhelming firstly as usual it recycles a lot of previous enemies and bosses from dev s games however what new it adds makes very little sense and does not feel thought out at all at times as if this game was composed by ubisoft so now we have crafting what it does it do you can craft arrows and some consumables after hunting down some animals and searching for plants is hunting animals fun you ask no is looting plants fun no in previous games you simply bought all the stuff but honestly you usually didn t bother at all because consumables aren t required for progress then there s open world it s basically same as crafting as in i have no idea why they added it now there s maps there s monster camps of sorts and there s dungeons we get on this one later maps are aquired very easily and only reveal landscape even without it there s no difficulty in navigating but the problem is once again there s no real fun to be had interesting encounters are almost non existent and there s nearly no good loot to be found and even if there was you can t tell if your search will provide you something useful i must say the dungeons are obscenely bad all dungeons are structured similarly and their bosses often are very halfassed there s next to none story or interesting feel to the dungeon usually it s just some random caves or crypt with cruelly placed enemies and single obscure item in the end other than that this is basically a ubisoft game which was built over the stronger ds3 base you want more of ds 3 then you can get this you want something closer to sekiro or something more original better get nioh 2 it s way more fun honestly i m surprsied miyazaki did such a poor job on the new mechanics he decided to implement but i also have some faith that latter parts of the game will be better than what i saw so far edit after 60 hours so as i m closing to the finale of the game i have a better grasp of its problems basically the closest comparison i m willing to give it s a dark souls 2 all over again some parts are better some worse but it s basically underwhelming to the premise the core problem of the game is that it tried to go open world and adapted the worst parts of it without addressing the ingame issues which make this awkward many of those aren t seen intially but become apparent the more you play this is not true openworld er has no quests as in visible trackable quests you can do for fun no activities barely any feel of exploration worst of all the areas are very restricted at where you can go there s also no cool movement stuff like glider graphook or really anything but basic horse i d not really like to present this as an issue except for people who genuinely wanted an open world game but as er was advertised as such the intention has clearly failed worse even by trying to go open world the game plays very awkward after you progress a bit and go into areas which clearly were planned to be progressed earlier and there s a lot of those the game has astonishing amount of repeating enemies and bosses there s probably like 10 dragon fights which have same model and similar movesets there s about 6 or more golden knights it s actually easier to name a boss which wasn t reused multiple time through the game the enemies aren t very different either remember how every skyrim dungeon had draugers this is it same stuff different hp and damage everywhere before i finish i want to name some more issues which really should ve been fixed but didn t why not every boss has a respawn point by it just look at sekiro why you introduced new respawn points which are terribly hard to see in a murky pallete why not make it glowing why weight system wasn t reworked so player would not have to juggle stuff like bows and torches out of their inventory just look at nioh 1 2 why not make souls autopickup when entering boss room which also does not alloiw you simple escape anymore to save it just look at nioh 1 2 why not allow us to use runes items at the campfire shop why close the inventory after you ve used 1 why weapon damage system wasn t reworked the problem with ds weapon system is that you can t realistically know how good is the weapon later on without upgrading it and having stats for it so more often you end up with a weapon you ve started with or planned to play with you can t switch weapons most of the time because anything you find will be unupgraded this is simply bad design for an open world game with a variety of cool weapons just look at nioh 1 2 i d also like to critic the combat system but i m willing to accept that it s a dark souls 3 system and they are unwilling to change even though i believe sekiro is vastly superior but at least fix the management systems speaking of some stuff i quite enjoyed and welcome summons are kinda cool concept even though it s very stupid you can only summon them at specific points like why talisman pouches memory slots is a good concept even though they were already existing in like hollow knight weapon arts are really cool albeit fairly imbalanced also the ability to change your weapon enchant for free for your current situation at the camp site is great similarly buffing potion is good albeit pretty weak,197.3,138.0,5,Not Recommended,"February 25, 2022",ELDEN RING,Mave

10937,2022 elden ring is an absolute masterpiece i haven t beat any souls games previously but i did a lot of grinding on dark souls 3 as well as dark souls 2 and 1 i really enjoyed it and had a blast creating my character and grinding souls so i figured i would try elden ring it was definitely worth every penny to start off the graphics are absolutely insane i am playing on my xbox series s and having no issues at all it has a steady frame rate and the loading times are minimal not to mention it s a treat to look at the foliage sky sun water everything looks surreal and hyper realistic not to mention enemies look very detailed and bosses are extremely intricate in terms of bosses i finally beat the first one margit after about 10 15 hours of grinding runes this game wants you to either explore or find a good farming spot and rewards your effort for either option i really enjoyed looking for a good farming spot and then collecting runes and leveling up my stats when it comes to building a character you have a lot of control over your build it s very extensive and makes it so you can control your play style i started off as a samurai and leveled up my katana and that s been my main weapon for most of my play time however to my delight i also found some wolverine claws which are awesome to use some weapons also have specific skills that come with them which makes it very cool to find new ones and experience on top of that there s also some great looking armor sets in this game that will truly make you feel badass this game has been a blast and i haven t even really gotten anywhere in the story yet although to be honest i don t pay much attention to the stories in these games it s all about the challenges and experience that i enjoy i know this review is not incredibly detailed or really structured however if you are interested in a game that will reward you for your time as well as teach you it s inner workings this is definitely for you if you enjoy exploring depth worlds and fighting monsters this is definitely for you,305.2,16.0,0,Recommended,"April 7, 2022",ELDEN RING,"DRACER

10944,2022 my first fromsoft game and this is a 10 10 imo i m not great at reviews so here are my pros and cons pros exploration amazing there seems to be something in every inch of the map this can range from rare items located in spots you wouldn t think hidden bosses dungeons quests or just really cool set pieces i m 40 hours in and i feel like i ve hardly pushed the main story due to getting side tracked combat b as i said this is my first fromsoft game so i had no experience with the souls franchise outside of watching streams it s fun a lot of fun there s a slight curve but it mainly comes down to knowing timing for attacking and dodging parrying bosses can be dominating but it s great that you can leave explore come back and sometimes the fight just clicks co op while not ideal i hear this is a fromsoft staple it can be a lot of fun it s slightly tricky to set up at first one player makes a sign the one who wants to join and the other uses an item to see that sign in the same location the host if you are brought to someone else s world your flasks are cut in half so keep that in mind co op is built more for defeating big enemies if you beat a boss or maybe a main boss only the session ends rather than exploring as you can t use mounts in the open world when together but this doesn t mean it isn t fun to run around with your friends visuals just 10 10 story it s there and very interesting but like other soul games you have to dig a bit outside of main encounters and cutscenes to get the full picture there are a few locations that tell a story based on npc placements buildings etc which are very cool too cons i don t have many but the big one is that currently performance is hit or miss in a huge range for different pcs while it seems everyone gets frame drops it s a shame but still playable imo some get massive screen tearing a friend and i with similar pcs had wildly different experiences mine being the more stable only frame drops now and then the other thing is that if you don t like dark souls as a concept you most likely won t like this one bosses are punishing it can take hours sometimes to figure out the strategy and timing that works for you but this game does help with that frustration a little bit because it s an open world leave level up explore and come back when you feel like it all in all this is my goty,287.2,18.0,0,Recommended,"February 28, 2022",ELDEN RING,TaizerBeam
10946,2022 i wish there was a neutral recommendation but whatever the game up to lyndell is awesome but then the quality of the game drops substantially recycled unbalanced enemies and reused dungeon designs for example the open world has beatiful landscapes but there is not much incentive at story level to go through the dungeons or the loot is bad if you are not caster also fs should have improved the gameplay like they do with bloodborne or sekiro but they choose to keep the old school ds movesets the thing is that the enemies attacks were improved lol i m looking at you malenia anyway 6 5 10 for me a really really good game but with serious flaws some of them from previous games like the camera against giant enemies,195.5,242.0,31,Not Recommended,"April 3, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Motorgrinding

10948,2022 obviously a great game but the technical issues are fairly crippling playing with a rtx 3070 on latest drivers yet the game consistently has issues from dropped frames to full freezes especially during enemy encounters which is about as frustrating as one can imagine in an already punishing game game will be close to perfect once these issues are fixed but i d recommend waiting until then to play on pc,70.4,364.0,37,Not Recommended,"March 2, 2022",ELDEN RING,"squelch_muscle

10997,2022 update finished the game after 60 or so hours including the secret areas i ve skipped some optional ruins and minor dungeons gonna leave the original review below for reference again this review won t talk about performance and optimization issues widely acknowledged by everyone and still hopefully to be patched sooner or later first the good it s always nice to be back to souls games the formula behind these games is a winning one addicting charming challenging they are good games and with the right mindset very enjoyable ones elden ring is no different in that sense it manages to deliver the same engrossing experience we all came to love during these years for the record i ve been playing souls games since demon s soul which remains still one of my favorites now let s tackle the issues i ve got with elden ring the gameplay formula is my main gripe here there are other problems i will address later but this here is the true source of my frustration which inevitably spoiled most of the enjoyment i had people say that it all started with ds3 but personally i believe it was a slow process of memification of the souls genre gameplay the git gud mentality behind it all which steered all design decisions towards what i consider now a pure cbt and ultimately unfun experience the perfect summary i ve read around is it feels you re playing dark souls while every enemy is playing bloodborne slow uncancellable animations are sometimes so annoying it feels you re playing with 500 ping all the time most of the bosses and even enemies are hysterical aoe spamming madlads with perfect hit tracking inconceivable hitboxes and so many aoe moves that sometimes they feel copypasted imagine pontiff sulyvahn on crack not enough ok now imagine zoning aoe bosses sorta like laurence of crack that s 90 of how i felt my experience with elden ring and it makes me sad to think about bosses like rennala it felt like i was fighting a real witch the fire giant aoe monster but slow and earth shattering or even the stupid mimic how unique and interesting they felt even radahn had an incredible concept but holy mother of god in the end it became spam y to summon meat puppets and dodge the oneshot hits i m not gonna talk about malenia i m not gonna do it too soon said that the other secondary but still quite perceivable issue i ve got here is the amount of recycled content and how derivative most if the world feels is the open world empty not really but i believe they ve chosen quantity over quality the more i played the more i felt diminishing returns in exploration and boss fighting enjoyment some bosses appear again and again during the game sometimes as minibosses sometimes as slightly reskinned new bosses sometimes oh wait there s two now areas start repeating themselves very soon and biomes only offer some respite in the creeping familiarity that inevitably kicks in after a while the most jarring example of this is the siofra river area and boss design absolutely incredible gameplay of the area not really a fan of aimbot snipers but hey it s easily rushable so whatever boss simple fascinating one of the most memorable music track in the game they basically copypasted everything from lightning the beacons to unlock the boss fight to the boss fight itself with a couple of added gimmick moves why not only it feels cheap but it manages to take out the beauty and uniqueness of the area you encountered the first time so yeah i confirm my suspicions of my early review elden ring feels like a step back for from software compared to a bloodborne or a sekiro not only it s their comfort zone it s the festering blight town comfort zone where the souls franchise is now sitting in semi stagnation open world and jumping are not enough to call it the most daring souls ever made good game yes mediocre souls also yes original review elden ring is a classic souls game exactly what you d expect which is why i find it disappointing i find the raving reviews talking about the most daring and ambitious souls game ever misleading compared to the dark souls franchise s gameplay elden ring doesn t feel much different i frame rolls parries critical attacks jump attacks are just another way to trigger them poke and repeat bloodborne a game from 2015 tried to innovate the formula in a more meaningful way and it felt different at least a tiny bit sekiro released before elden ring completely revolutionized the formula and soaked it in crystal meth how can you say that elden ring is the most ambitious souls game when older souls game tried so much harder to shake things up sadly to me elden ring feels like a step back the open world aspect feels gimmicky a way to follow nowadays trend where every game should have a crafting system and a faraway mountain you can go to the world so far has felt empty just a bland grassland linking together various areas and dungeons some of which are truly wondrous siofra river anyone but most got me saying i ve been here before all souls game feel like rites of passage with sweat and pain you git gud and when you git gud you are able to delve deeper in a mysterious world or enjoy a gorgeous new scenery or have the chance to wreck a new abomination s ass this time the suffering is starting to feel a bit more pointless which is a shame is it a good game yes is it a good souls game no so far i ve found it uninspired and bland one of the weakest of the franchise,80.8,81.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 26, 2022",ELDEN RING,Siormax

11031,2023 elden ring is just worse than all 3 dark souls games the only thing it does that dark souls doesn t is the open world and while that is really nice at the beginning it gets old pretty fast but the biggest problem of elden ring are its bosses there are only like 5 unique bosses the rest gets used over and over and over in various gank setups in the increasingly caves as the game goes on and the worst part is even the unique bosses aren t that good fromsoft said they want to make the game more accessible and lower the requirements on coop and it shows it shows so badly most bosses just attack nonstop or teleport around their arenas so you either summon help or you use one of the broken builds and just trade hits with them the boss design is just so boring for the last few achievements i just used the mimic tear summon and went like 50 levels higher than i originally planned to just to finally get it over with closing thoughts elden ring is a huge disappointment most of the time you ll feel like a ds2 remake with the amount of reskin gank bosses and the few main bosses are very poorly designed the open world is nice but gets old relatively fast and very early into the game you ll just ride by everything,64.3,31.0,4,Not Recommended,"August 14, 2023",ELDEN RING,Kili

11058,2022 soulslike done rightif anyone is going to do a soulslike and do it right it may as well be the folks responsible for demon s souls and dark souls much like demon s souls connection to dark souls elden ring is not a continuation of either series yet the game borrows a lot of elements all the same from combat to the overall tone and look while adding in its own unique flair to make it still seem like something original with new enemies a new story and a completely new way to explore this massive new world a whole new worldelden ring takes place in a world called the lands between a really big world brimming with both life and death at every corner i won t go into story really to give away any spoilers but rather say where dark souls is overly dark and dreary a lot of elden ring feels sort of the opposite full of light and wonderment that is not to say though that a bit of elden ring will not bring you the same dark morbid uneasiness found in a dark souls game oh it will but you will also find areas lush with life and i mean wildlife too this is a world that seems to have a mixture of both hope and dread at the same time one minute you ll be in a magical forest with twinkling lights and cute and fuzzy critters and beautiful floral scenery and the next you might find yourself in a dark gothic hellish landscape with half rotted corpses crumbling buildings and doom at every corner it s wonderful how well elden ring connects these themes in its world filled with massive castles poisonous swamps huge open battlefields mystical forests and more it would be hard to explore everything in one playthrough given how many nooks and crannies are scattered about there are tons of dungeons hidden bosses secret areas and some avenues completely locked off unless you meet certain quest requirements but as big as the world is and as non linear the path is you ll be hard pressed to find yourself not finding some new discovery each time you boot the game up i m personally at around 100 hours so far and still plenty to discover and am still finding new things on current plays even revisiting old areas i thought i fully explored before since elden ring is as big as it is the game does include a map which at first will reveal itself to be rather small despite the opening area being so massive as you explore more areas the map will grow in size and each site of grace essentially the new bonfires will allow for fast travel between them one thing elden ring does not do like you find in most open world games is hold your hand when it comes to quest progression most open world games usually have a logbook with all of your quests elden ring does not it does not usually point you in the right direction on side quests other than through conversations with npcs or treasure maps it s up to you to figure out where to go that said though the sites of grace usually clue you in on where to go for the bigger picture being the main quest but it s not so fun to just focus on those directions the game offers so much more that you will find it more enjoyable to go off the beaten path and do your own thing combat evolvedthis is one the areas where elden ring is going to feel the most familiar combat you have most of the same mechanics introduced in demon s and dark souls with only a few omissions but some new tricks added to take the place of those combat varies based on your left and right hand load out where your right hand is usually the dominant for weapons the usual layout would be a weapon in the right hand and some type of shield in the left but you can mix things up any way you want and a lot of the weapons even allow for dual fisting for different and sometimes more powerful attacks at the expense of less defense you can also equip ranged weapons such as bows and cannons yes cannons and also magical staffs and amulets for a wide variety of attacks buffs heals and more of course much like previous souls games the items you wield come at a cost which is based on the stats you have so managing how you spend your skill allotment with each level gained is crucial luckily later in the game you can respec in case you have any regrets but these skills mixed with the loadout you use can make for a wide variety of playstyles if you want to be a pure bruiser you can if you wish to play a more stealthy ranged attacker you can if you want to play an all powerful battlemage you can do that too while you are given a limited number of themed starting characters ultimately you can switch it up to any playstyle you wish as you progress some of the new things added to elden ring for combat really make for a much more interesting dynamic for starters you can now crouch this allows you to add in a sense of stealth which is perfect for things like backstabs or just to survey an unfamiliar room you can also jump well technically you could jump in dark souls but it was a little convoluted and mostly ended up being used for navigating and not so much in combat in elden ring you have an actual dedicated jump button that you can mix with attacks to get an aerial advantage a great maneuver for catching enemies off guard on top of all of this a majority of the game s open world will be playable on horseback and with your trusty steed torrent you will also be able to have attacks while mounted there are a lot of different ways to utilize the combat something for everyone so when you feel one approach might he too difficult you might want to take a step back and figure out a different approach luckily elden ring has you covered on options it s not dark souls it s so much better elden ring may feel unforgiving at first for those not familiar with from software s other works mainly dark souls first hand but for those who are this will be a delight to put it bluntly this is not dark souls but at the same time this is best experienced if you know dark souls the dna of the dark souls franchise is baked into elden ring in a way that will make it familiar and wholly accessible to fans of the series while still giving you a completely fresh and original experience while this may not be dark souls it is safe to say this is something better this review is a work in progress,302.1,17.0,1,Recommended,"March 20, 2022",ELDEN RING,"GRIMM

11131,2022 here s an interesting ordeal about elden ring the souls formula it s very much there entertaining gameplay very much there cool bosses very much there unfortunately for a title that really does have all the potential to be the game of the half decade it falls short in the qa testing and qol department how let me give you a list of reasons for some reason fromsoft decided that certain things such as having a check that ll have the game basically insult you for not closing it correctly was more important than fixing crashes guess what causes that check that makes the game insult you for not closing it correctly crashes guess what elden ring likes to do crash crashing can also corrupt your savefile and if you re not lucky enough that steam made a cloud backup you re permanently screwed over and have to restart from scratch say goodbye to your 100 hour character did you know that players can place a message at the bottom of a ladder and grief you by making it next to impossible to climb they can do that same thing for the top of the ladder i certainly hope you didn t fall down a pit in a certain mine and were scrambling to try and find a way up while a giant iron maiden with saws for hands was trying to murder you because you ll get to it be unable to climb it and pressing the interact button will just bring up a message from some moron that reads try fingers but hole as the giant 10 fullmetal killing machine grabs you from behind and kills you instantly why did they not pick up on this in qa testing again oh by the way you ll find this at nearly every ladder where something will be trying to kill you while you re climbing it because people are morons fall damage is terminally inconsistent there are sections where you can fall ten stories and survive without a scratch like in some towers there are others where you ll jump off a five foot high drop freeze then die upon hitting the ground stutters i run this on a computer that could theoretically be taken from nasa s server farm and i still get random times where it ll freeze for five seconds or drop to 1 5 frames for several seconds guess when this likes to happen during boss fights and times where things are trying to murder me were you a victim of dark bead mage twinking in ds3 guess what they didn t solve twinking you better be ready to get invaded by glass cannons that ve dedicated their entire build to int for using moonveil or str and arc in order to wield the pair of swords that create an instakilling gravity nuke that has an aoe the size of a debate hall are you not ready for them guess you re never playing multiplayer then because they re the most common invader types you ll run into and they re literally everywhere looking for build variety in pvp sorry everyone s either using bleed proc weapons or the gravity nuke swords you will occasionally find a person with a normal build otherwise it s going to be pain and suffering all the way down they re using bleed proc because bleed proc is one of the few ways to compensate for boss absurdity by the way if you re co oping with buddies whatsoever you re agreeing to being invaded and as you may see from the they didn t fix twinking up above take my advice you should get to the next boss fight fast because every second you linger is a second closer to another glass cannon invading and oneshotting you and your friends the grind to level up is horrendous after you clear level 30 hope you re alright with having to farm in excess of 10 000 runes for a single level and losing all of them to an invader or an enemy or boss you weren t ready for by the way there s a guy in a certain castle that ll just straight up steal a massive chunk of your runes every time you die and you have to kill him to make it stop does the game tell you this no so even if you get them back you re losing progress also he s apparently bugged to the point where his rune stealing will happen anywhere you die on the map have fun with that also on the topic of the grind looking to play legitimately sucks to be you pal you re going to be getting invaded by glass cannons twinks and people who are nonstop running rune farms left right and center which means you ll have to run rune farms to stay competitive which means you ll be spending more time farming than actually playing the game expecting bosses that have attack patterns that make sense sorry one of the first ones you fight is literally a twelve foot tall guy with superheavy attacks that moves like a ballerina and won t stop faking out or hesitating on his attacks which makes learning his patterns infuriatingly difficult this will happen a lot there are multiple spots in the world where you ll just be minding your business and fromsoft will happily drop an enemy far beyond your level and equipment rating atop you as a boss get ready for a lot of it s about skill not gear while you re fighting enemies with an instantly casting hitscan spell that drives your character to madness and kills them instantly also get ready for deathblight a thing that exists solely to kill you instantly and all the people running deathblight invasion builds for this exact reason really people are incredibly fond of saying skill issue when fromsoft casually drops what is effectively an ancient deity of chaos and madness on you in the overworld when you re sixty levels below where you should be to fight it by the way on the topic of that skill issue a heavily upgraded regular sword can take upwards of 50 successful hits to kill the first major boss while a slightly upgraded katana can do it in around ten swings and two bleed procs still about skill it never was equip bleed and watch a quarter of the health of a boss or 3 4ths the health of a pvp invader vanish once that procs it s a great game with plenty of merit clearly it has something to it because i ve played 43 hours at the moment of writing this review and i m still coming back but the problem is that there is so much rough around the edges missed bugfixing worn spots that need polish and rust that needs to be buffered out which fromsoft have either accidentally or willfully overlooked maybe you ll take it like everybody else and say it s your game of the year i have to disagree i m having fun playing it but that fun is directly tied to whether or not me and my friends can go 30 seconds without being invaded by another moonveil twink who has found the most optimal route to instantly kill three people with one use of its special attack the second they exit bonfire range,122.1,26.0,5,Not Recommended,"March 7, 2022",ELDEN RING,A Phantom Pain
11138,2022 the game is great the multiplayer is not i bought this game so that i could play with my boyfriend same as we have in other games first of all you do have to farm items to continue to summon your friends there are a lot in the starting areas but in some others there just aren t any materials to do this so you must backtrack this is annoying as i have somewhat limited time to play on top of that you frequently experience crashes and disconnects you have to either backtrack if it s possible to collect your friend again or they need to rush the area what we discovered today drove me to write this review if you kill enough or a certain boss in an area i have no idea which one it is multiplayer is disabled for the open world in this region i cannot play with my friends anymore because i killed something still don t know what this is archaic and stupid for an open world game which has so much to explore we have maybe 1 3 of the dungeons left to do in that area and now we just can t do it together completely outrageous and i may have refunded this game had i known sooner or at least i would have skipped bosses and rushed them at the end another thing to mention is the invasions which can t be turned off if you want to co op since it s an open world game with free progression most of the invaders have been able to oneshot us from substantial range whoops there goes another multiplayer resource time to backtrack and well i ll just forget about my souls after doing all those other chores edit there is now a seamless coop mod use it it s great and what the game should be,84.8,80.0,18,Not Recommended,"March 2, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Incendas

11141,2022 i m sorry for leaving a negative review but i feel like this game is going to be the first step in a long downward spiralling road for fromsoft people are playing this up as a masterpiece of fromsoft s when the issues are even more glaring than when people were screeching about ds2 s faults i don t want this to become the gold standard for fromsoft pun intended my complaints have nothing to do with the open world and though i wish there were less carbon copy bosses i think it was fine to reuse them a little every now and then to fill out the sheer size of the place constant boss duos was miserable though please stop doing that godskin duo magma wyrm and the falling star beast particularly were just awful bosses that i loathe to even remember nigh undodgeable shockwaves that every large enemy constantly spams also really doesn t help long combos punctuated by the boss delaying for 13 college semesters allowing you to write a dissertation and graduate summa laude with a doctorate s in patience before he decides to hit you for all your hp 3 times over in the span of a millisecond with fromsoft s patented funny tracking tm also leaves a bad taste in my mouth the health and damage scaling in this game is unlivable everyone is doing the same 4 cookie cutter meta builds just to survive the game let alone do pvp there is no room for build variety in this game even with so many gosh darn weapons and armor options i had to ditch the mace partway through for the sword of night and flame because ordinary mundane weapons just don t survive into the late game except for maybe the same greatswords that have been equally busted ever since ds1 even with all the weapon upgrades ordinary one handers just fall off in damage and the way bosses execute combos with blinding speed or with stupidly long delays making windows to attack tiny it s just not worth having a faster swinging one hander instead of a hard hitting two hander i am sick of being buried as a sword and board build in every game on top of that dying in one hit to one attack in a boss combo if you aren t actively dumping a third of your total levels in an ng into vigor is unacceptable if there is a previous game that had this issue then correct me but i have never seen it be so bad in a fromsoft game before especially with how this game packages bosses in a way that they fight like bosses from sekiro while giving you dark souls iii movement and controls it is a recipe for disaster i have never before now had the issue in a fromsoft game where when i kill a boss i think thank god that s over instead of that was a cool fight with neat atmosphere of course there a few black sheep bosses in every fromsoft game but i have felt that consistently with every boss after godrick i personally liked his fight it is a chore to fight bosses especially when their health gets insurmountably high and one single mistake in a fight with them means instant death people saying to upgrade summons kinda proves my point because the game is so unreasonable in terms of boss health and damage unforgiving combos punishing you for punishing enemies and etc that you are forced to play a very specific way if you want to reasonably win i don t like games that have only one way to be played especially when one of their biggest consistent selling points is offering you a wide range of customization options also for god s sake please add a left handed option ds2 allowed me to beat the game left handed and it drives me insane that a game touts customization but then refuses to have an option for people who make up 15 of the freaking population that s gotta be enough to warrant a left hand option if devs caved to the pressure of the 2 whole people banshee wailing about replacing gender with body type i ve got a lot of time in all of the fromsoft games ds 1 3 sekiro i ve even cleared all the king s field games except for the first one with a buddy i wanted to love this game it looked like a great co op adventure and i was willing to overlook the design decisions inspired by george r r martin the kinds of stories he writes just don t fit with fromsoft s history of design in my opinion george writes too much about sex and political intrigue and the lore with mohgwyn and the lover s spat between radagon and whats her face just didn t feel like it belonged in my opinion but this game just really made me sad i was repping this game all the way up to release all in all bok the seamster was my one refuge in this game i truly loved his character he was delightful that s it for my review,221.8,253.0,55,Not Recommended,"August 16, 2022",ELDEN RING,Dave

11208,2023 i have very conflicted feelings about elden ring on one hand i spent more hours than i would like to admit going through the giant world that elden ring offers and enjoyed searching for hidden paths and loot in particular for the first say 20 hours i thought there was a lot variety with enemies bosses and environments on the other hand i ended up being very frustrated with the design of dungeons enemies and gameplay as the game went on reused assets and uninspiring level design became increasingly apparant and it felt like the game overall started to crash under its own weight while the lore at first was interesting and there are elements that i still like much of it felt cheap and unsatisfying the more i dwelled into it the memories of good experiences were increasingly soured by these faults and more in terms of presentation the game looks great and there are stunning vistas spread around the world and many of the enemies look and sound great it is not technically out of this world but definitely very satisfying to look at and listen to gameplay wise i initially experimented a lot of different tools and weapons that the game had to offer i played very melee focused and had a lot of fun in finding out how consumables and enchancements could change the efficiency of weapons and customize my equipment and strategy for each boss further into the game though i figured out a combination and strategy that ended up dominating more or less everything else i tried i tried out using magic as well but it didn t work well with the spec i had and using spells were also not that fun there was also an increasing amount of enemies and bosses with attacks that were more tiresome to deal with instead of being thrilled from beating a boss i felt more relieved of not having to deal with it anymore there was a great deal of reuse of enemies as well which made new encounters increasingly boring traversing the world as well became increasingly boring as it is very big but lacks ways for you to interact with it there are some interesting parts with hidden ledges and paths that lead to secrets but they are far between and you do not readily unlock new abilities or find equipment that significantly changes traversal in the big open world i was also initially intriged by the world and wanted to explore of it and learn about its inhabitants there are some serious issues that kept getting in the way however quests often involve talking to npcs in particular various locations sometimes you will get a hint to where the next part of the quest take place but many times there will be no hints at all while i understand the rational behind this design to make the world seem less gamey the open world format makes it likely that you will not find that place or so much time will pass that you forget about details regarding the quest on top of that i found a great deal of the stories and quests to not really have that interesting outcomes with little to no consequence in the greater scheme the main story itself also ended on a somewhat dull note and there more i look into it the more pitiful it becomes there are some elements though that i am still find interesting though which i hope get fleshed out further in dlc down the line all in all i end up with a negative feeling from elden ring which is a shame considering the good times i actually had i think it comes down to my desire to explore every nook and cranny which while fun in itself was ruined by repetitiveness if you choose to not do that you might have a much time with it than i did,269.5,42.0,3,Not Recommended,"June 30, 2023",ELDEN RING,"Pchan

11338,2022 i m so conflicted on this i love this game genuinely i ve already spent nearly 200 hours on it i want it to be the most amazing soulslike experience out there because the potential is there there are so many things that the game exceeds at and what keeps pulling me back in for more playthroughs i ve beaten every boss gotten every rememberance i m currently trying to beat the game without summons and without wearing armor that s how much i love playing this game but the flaws in elden ring are too great and that s what kind of stings it really does feel like fromsoft started to get high off of their own reputation as that one company that makes the insanely hard games so much so that they made a game that s just completely there s a difference between something being hard and something being challenging dark souls 3 had so many amazing bosses that were difficult but were so challenging engaging and generally all around fun the final boss of ds3 for me is probably one of the most amazing boss fights in the entire dark souls series i absolutely cannot say the same about elden ring gank fights valiant gargoyles commander niall godskin duo that weren t made with consideration at all with respect to how they would be able to fight with you so you just end up being unfairly attacked on all sides bosses with utterly insane combos malenia morgott maliketh that force to i frame through 20 different attack and give you half a second to punish or leave you too much out of stamina to even attack the insane input reading crucible knight godskin duo draconic sentinel that causes the enemies to attack you the instant you let go of the heal button nigh undodgable aoe attacks valiant gargoyles commander niall godfrey completely ludicrous difficulty spikes everything post leyndell where even if you have 45 vigor enemies will just two shot you i m being genuine when i say fromsoft is trying too hard to appeal to their reputation for being the company that made dark souls the thing that made dark souls 3 so brilliant was that almost every boss was fast and punishing but made with perfect balance so that at all times you knew exactly how you messed up and how you can learn from next time in order to beat them i beat every boss in ds3 feeling proud of myself i beat every boss in elden ring just stewing in frustration what challenge is there in trying to juggle two unabalanced gargoyles or getting instantly killed by malenia s waterfowl dance there is none there s nothing to learn for a lot of people they don t feel like they overcame a challenge they feel like they lucked out because a boss didn t use a completely broken moveset compared to dark souls 3 or sekiro elden ring just feels so lazy why bother crafting a perfect boss experience when you can just give malenia hyperpoise every time she attacks or have the godskin duo punish you every time you try to heal as much as i hate to admit this i think a lot of the issues i have with this game stems from fromsoft trying to stretch a dark souls game into an open world game which is a shame because the open world is what i like most content recycling is rampant the same few catacombs are repeated over and over again through the land i think after leyndell there are no unique enemies that even appear it s all enemies you ve seen before i think the most egregious is that out of the 165 boss in this game only around 5 10 do not have a duplicate boss somewhere else i was so excited exploring in limgrave because all of the boss designs were so unique in interesting it was so exciting just randomly exploring and suddenly encountering a boss out in the wild that feeling quickly faded once i encountered my sixth ulcerated tree spirit or 4th tibia mariner the most insane is them reusing astel and godrick in completely unrelated areas completely robbing those bosses of any uniqueness they had genuinely the game should ve ended after leyndell or at least should ve left the mountaintops of the giants an optional area you didn t have to go through in order to beat there are so many things i love about this game and i wish it could be so much better because the potential is there but the world design in the second of half of the game becomes so much more stale and the bosses in the game are even weaker than the ones in dark souls 2 in a it s a dark souls like game so let s just make things insanely difficult for no reason kind of way i really hope that a major patch fixes some of these issues or they improve their design in the dlc because i am not at all excited in the direction fromsoft is taking themselves as a company that tries way too hard to play up to their reputation for difficult games that they forget to make it fun first i saw a comment in a youtube video a while back that said once the hype dies down people will talk about this game the same way they talk about dark souls 2 and i fear they may be right too many flaws bog down what could ve been a 10 10 game,337.2,438.0,82,Not Recommended,"August 11, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Deathenfield

11475,2022 this is a frustrating release and a shame because its game play is excellent but it s technical performance is woeful for every high that it offers like the thrill of exploration and the joy of slick combat there s the lows of frame rates plummeting far beyond any weaknesses of your hardware since every version including the consoles or beefy pc s has stutter and serious hitches i m running this on lower specs than the minimum hardware and yet after a driver update that got rid of intrusive graphical glitches it s fairly smooth running this with high settings they don t seem to be that much of a burden on the gpu and even a 970 is capable of running some hefty outdoors scenes at between 45 to 60 frames a second indoors can be pretty much a smooth 60 fps but with very little happening onscreen it will tank to the low 40 s and on occasion plunge into the 20 s undoubtedly some of this is my hardware but it will drop with very little going on and since this is known across the board clearly something is fundamentally wrong with the engine performance seems like it should be fixable in time so this negative review is purely a reflection of it s current state it is far worse than any of their other games and whilst it may be their response to a security problem discovered in their engine if so it s had a disastrous effect on how it handles if you persist with the game as i have well it is generally playable and it is a great evolution of the dark souls template the world is huge but lacking in lore this isn t a skyrim type experience where you meet npc s and they talk your ear off with tales of how they took an arrow to the knee verbal exposition isn t a big thing hereelden ring is a third person combat rpg that is less focused on it s narrative and quests than more talkative titles like the witcher 3 if you re familiar with dark souls this is a tweak and refinements to that experience in a much less linear manner than before the open world is a quite liberating element for me if you re unfamiliar it s a responsive but measured mixture of melee and ranged options with the player free to mix and match how they progress in a world that s a big playground for your skills with the only limitation being that levelling up becomes harder and harder and your proficiency in combat will be limited by your stamina or how much magic you can cast or number of arrows crossbow bolts etc further tweaking of your weapons and armour can also boost your capabilities so paying attention to what you have in your inventory is a big part to survival it rewards choice and whilst it lacks depth mechanically whatever build you make it doesn t really change the fact that most bosses are just simple combo s but hit really hard it is very engaging trying to unravel it you roam in one one direction and some beast or neer do well kicks your arse so you travel elsewhere and some other beast or neer do well kicks your arse and so on and so on until you come across something where you think to yourself i m taking you down and maybe just maybe you prevail and can start to level up once various abilities are learned or obtained by defeating bosses it starts to flow more smoothly chipping away here and there to get enhancements and then going back to some gargantuan fiend that smushed you in one hit before and now you can have an epic battle that gets the adrenaline flowing rather than getting instantly squashed like an insignificant bug that feeling is great but you have to work to achieve it you have to explore to find it s surprises and secrets and often you will be left to figure out things for yourself which will either be great if you re a free thinker or bad i guess if you want your hand held and not to have to think when the game opens up there is probably the best smoothest example of this genre to date every facet of it s game play is fine tuned and beautifully executed the tragedy is that the game really handles poorly enough albeit on occasion that it undoes the otherwise solid level of performance there are times when tons of stuff is onscreen and it has no issue then you can be walking down a corridor of a self contained area and the frame rate falls off a cliff for seemingly no reason i honestly think that even with my 970 this will eventually see a patch possibly when they can remove easy anticheat from being needed that will see a much more stable game as it really feels like it ought to be better since the game isn t that much of a looker or doing stuff that other games couldn t manage at higher frame rates compared to other open world titles like mad max rage 2 the witcher 3 even monster hunter world which was dubious itself this struggles keeping up my expectation is that will change but for now as disappointing as it is no recommended despite it being goty material when these problems are hopefully fixed it is a great game and also a bad one for those who are made of sterner stuff it is still quite playable but no hardware no matter how powerful will resolve it s performance issues,388.1,51.0,7,Not Recommended,"March 1, 2022",ELDEN RING,"jb2097

11526,2022 the short i didn t really think what everyone was clamoring for was the ubisoft ification of dark souls the long pros jump button music horse combat mostly fun addictive cons shockingly laggy movement is jank the world seems very empty stamina consumption feels random graphics are often ugly and washed out ditches many of the better systems from previous games walked back some of the better ideas from the network tests flailing you need the wiki where did my legs go why did my monitor stop working it crashed again mostly it s dark souls 3 but bigger and with extra tat tacked on and yet somehow the whole thing feels a bit cheap it s a big mostly empty open world with dodgy traversal mechanics the few hours i played were mostly hiding in bushes collecting flowers the new sneaking around can be fun in an assassins creed way but in the one camp i found enemies tend to be in line of site of one another and the backstab is slow enough to leave you open from what little i saw you can t really build a character around stealth before too long i found a gatehouse where the archer can spot you through cover and bosses boss adjacent monsters really won t let you get away with it like in the aforementioned ubisoft sandboxes really the game is done no favors comparing it to assassins creed as it s often a very ugly game assets pop in creatures disappear and all the colors feel very washed out that s not uncommon for from software games but from the character creation screen it looked like a marked improvement over ds3 sadly in game models are low rez with larger ones having hard corners that show the limited poly count many assets seem to be copy pasted giving the whole experience a very cheap feel not helped by the fact that the prolog is a slideshow makes me wonder what could be causing all the lag i don t mind dyeing in a souls game but when lag keeps killing me i m gonna be a bit cross it s very odd too i have a pretty high end pc and can run much much better looking games on ultra without issue the early on supposed to loose fight bugged out so badly that the thing faded to black before i took any damage it stayed that way long enough that i thought it had crashed until i saw the loading symbol for an uncomfortably long time that alone would be an issue worth waiting for a patch to buy but the controls are janky too there didn t seem to be analog sensitivity adjustment so had to keep switching out controllers until i found one that didn t interrupt me walking across the room in a straight line how could this have happened they nailed this before yeah so the elephant in the room here is sekiro not just sekiro but we ll get to that traversal stealth and combat improvements miles above any of the souls games were all there but they ditched them for some reason i m not saying we needed a grappling hook but why make the jumps so awkward and imprecise all the low ledges and walls seem to encourages jumping but it s very unclear as to what can be vaulted over like sekiro it does embrace the idea that movement doesn t consume stamina sort of it does when you re in combat though that can be somewhat academic due to the poor stealth system and other factors i couldn t place sekiro also nailed parrying blocking and dodging and by that i mean they were balanced enough so that they were all useful the perilous attacks system was a spectacular way to engage foes unlike most soulsborn games you really had to parry yet for some reason we are for the most part back to dark souls 3 style block dodge and parries so inexact your better off not bothering reviews keep saying it s a culmination of all from software has learned but it s seems more like a pick n mix of middling ideas even if you didn t want to pull from sekiro for the combat why ignore the other games the only presence from dark souls 2 seems to be the double weapons nice to have but hardly that game s best feature they seem to keep doing this dark souls was great for it s time but dark souls 2 and bloodborn greatly refined the formula yet dark souls 3 seems to have contained none of what made those games better and here again here as in ds3 we are awash in samey weapons i though bb taught you a dozen well designed weapons are better then way way too many swords parrying especially needed to look to these three titles ds2 made nigh everything parryable and gave you a big window to counter bb made parrying at range possible and sekiro made it fluid enough that it was always a strong option here we re back to ds3 s parrying is here but blocking or dodging is still more viable in truth this game is proof to me they failed to learn from themselves but they re not even looking to what their peers have done during the network tests leveling strength gave you the ability to wear heavier armor as in the nioh games which let mutable stats dictate this but they switch it back to only endurance granting more carry weight why it makes more sense for the strength based character to have heavier armor strength scaling weapons often have slower windups and longer punishes as a result you may have to soak a hit to land a blow it was a good idea it had been proven to work in other souls like games and they cut it out on that note where s the rallying system got to that was such a great feature i ve seen it crop up in many other games is it hidden somewhere in this overstuffed mess i could go on i played this game for about five hours and while it felt longer than that i don t think i really got anywhere in point of fact i think i ve already gone on too long but it s all kind of moot as my primary issue is that it s just kinda boring i mean haven t we been here before i ve never started a new from software game and within hour i m reaching for a podcast i want more sekiro more bloodborn heck i d even take more dark souls 2 but just don t want whatever this is update after many hours i did get into it the horse combat helped as it is largely very fun but everything comes with a caveat the mounted sections are good until you get arbitrarily knocked off your alpaca now that is admittedly annoying but what s worse is there s nothing you can do about it there s no barding you can equip on your beast and while the game says putting points into dexterity helps keep you from falling off i m at 60 dex and i don t see much difference also it would only sort of mater if there was a huge difference as you can t as far as i can tell actively do anything to increases your fluffy friends hp getting knocked off your horse is often instant death as you just lie on the ground for an age waiting to be mauled it s not unlike you ve had the controller torn from your hand and it is held out of reach until you are ether killed or are obscenely low on health and just to put a cherry on the alpaca manure sunday when your fine beasty does inevitably die you have to use a health potion to revive them by way of a menu prompt asking are you sure you want to bring your only chance of survival back from the dead at the megger cost of one of your many easily replenished items yeah i m pretty forking sure elden ring except don t bother because i died battling with your superfluous text box again keeping with caveats the bosses are often quite fun despite their copy paste nature but some just won t let up i d say learn their pattern but that only maters if they ever take a break dark souls 2 got critisised for having too many foes per encounter but i ll take that over half of them having a hyper combo by far your best option is to find your favorite utterly broken spell consumable ash of war etc there s no shortage and use it as a crutch when the game decides to change the ru,398.9,104.0,6,Not

11543,first of all i think the game is not bad and it should be played the reason i am writing a negative review is that i am fed up with the stupid design choices that have been continuing since dark souls 1 and no one is talking about the obvious problems of elden ring i will point out the game s flaws in my own way hoping that maybe even if it s just a small chance other players will do the same and they will make this quality game even better npc questlines the same classic silly setup that has been continuing since dark souls 1 persists in this game as well the difficulty of completing npc quests and coming across them let s admit it 90 of players complete these quests by looking at guides but even if i overlook that the progression of the quests is the same we press the interaction button repeatedly with npcs who stand like statues after doing this three times in different locations the npc quest is completed sure at the end of some quests we fight and so on but the process is the same press the talk button then press it again at the next location and continue i wonder if anyone is genuinely affected by these mostly depressive npc stories there are no cutscenes or cinematic settings they are just immobile statues this needs to be improved open world elden ring has a much larger map compared to its previous games but this beautiful and large map is filled with many repetitive bosses and identical dungeons even the creatures inside the dungeons are the same however the thing that most undermines the sense of exploration is this you re traveling in a location defeating enemies specifically placed to frustrate the player and the result you are rewarded with crappy material or an item you won t even remember the name of instead of these useless items they should include enemy armor sets weapons and items with different low drop rates this would make the sense of exploration much more satisfying and save players from meaningless and unenjoyable grinding storyline and narrative d the bosses the bosses in elden ring are really great both in terms of design environment and patterns generally they are good but it s clear that some are filled with unnecessary aoe damage and sometimes excessively high damage just to make the boss fight very difficult and frustrating for players i m not saying the bosses impossible to beat i believe the aoe combos they should be balanced and the damage they inflict should be slightly reduced the end despite its many flaws elden ring is a high quality game and i will continue playing it if we as players criticize these obvious issues we can indeed make this already high quality game even better,293.6,30.0,1,Not Recommended,July 6,ELDEN RING,FuckTAA

11597,2022 wonderful at first takes a nosedive once you start paying attention if you re here to complain about me playing this game more after reviewing someone in the comments pointed it out just fine all the other souls games have no online features and i enjoy coop multiplayer this game has gotten only worse the more i play it and i have finally uninstalled it this piece of crap game honestly my first 40 or so hours with this game were gorgeous i loved riding around the open world on the horse just faffing about and seeing the sights doing a small dungeon every now and then and throwing myself at the first few main story bosses then as time went on things started to feel off bosses get copy pasted around enemies get reused as mini dungeon bosses mini dungeon bosses become normal enemies and the further you get the more annoying the encounters become then it all culminates in castle sol at which point my honeymoon phase with this game just crashed and burned although to be fair this was already starting around leyndell and i started to see this game for what it really is a wonderful massive open world filled with filler and copy pasted with too few enemy types and bosses to populate even half the areas and encounter designs that remind me of dark souls 2 where killing you is more important than creating a challenge balancing in this game is whack the areas rarely fit your character s level and half the builds are simply not viable in the later game areas which was especially disappointing since from games like these kinda stand on the whole choose your own build principle the game seems to try to fix this by throwing handfuls of respec items at you bosses have chain attacks that hit stun you longer than their pause between attacks animations have unintuitive delays and very clear roll catch feints that were already annoying me in ds3 there s some attacks that wind up so slowly you can attack a boss multiple times between the opening tell and the attack going off and damage done by the late game bosses and enemies is so stupendous that leveling vigor is now as important as leveling adp was in ds2 you either do it or you don t get to play the game late game encounters are also not enjoyable at all the later areas are usually filled with enemy spam summoning enemies enemies that have infinite stamina and aggression high poise and ridiculous damage enemies hiding around each and every corner very powerful miniboss enemies grouped up with jobbers enemies that are programmed to try to push you off ledges all of the childish haha we killed you things and in the end i would prefer just running past the reused enemies since fighting them was not going to benefit me at all one of the things about this game that annoys me the most is how it subtly lies to you about its own design malenia s healing strikes also heal when she hits your shield which is entirely counterintuitive to a mechanic like that which usually works like lifesteal where she heals when she does damage mohg s curse can be negated by a wondrous physik tear except the tear barely works and he still gets to heal most of his health and do some damage and you can t roll through any of the curse animations there s some hero s dungeons that have dark phantom versions of enemies you need to lure onto seals of holy light to undo their invulnerability except using holy attacks doesn t work on them this is especially annoying as from is expected to pay attention to detail and reward observant players both the phantom and chariot versions of the hero s dungeons are awful btw and the godskin duo fight pretends to be throne watcher defender where if you kill one the other summons them back except if you kill both in quick succession they just get summoned back anyways without either of them needing to execute a summon animation i feel like mentally engaging with this game is just a waste of effort and since this is a fromsoft game that is incredibly disappointing this game could have been wonderful but it collapsed under its own scope the map is so big and they wanted to fill it with so many small dungeons and gaols and encounters that they ended up having to copy even main story bosses mohg astel godrick loretta gets used twice so does margit and morgott is just margit with some extra moves same for niall and o neill just to fill them with it s embarrassing and this game is nowhere near as good as you ll hear in general discourse about it as a bit of a qualifier i will add i have beaten all the main bosses including malenia collected all of the great runes put god knows how many hours into this game and think i have a pretty okay grasp on most of the boss s patterns and timings i have beaten the final boss es and the only boss i used online coop to beat was the actual mohg fight the one with the curse of blood since i was simply not going to deal with that i enjoy some things about this game there are a few bosses that i find magnificent radahn is one of the coolest thigns i ve ever encountered except they nerfed him for some reason maliketh is an incredibly well designed boss and lots of fun to fight godfrey and radagon are also really good fights and i still enjoy going back to help others fight them in coop and i can safely say that i find the open world gorgeous to look at and still enjoy riding around it on the horse sadly the rest of the game exists around these good aspects and drags everything down with it after thinking about it some more and reading some of the comments on this review i think i have some more thoughts to give they are more on the technical and engine side of criticising the game since i m running up against a character limit i will put them in a comment multiple comments

11969,2023 one step forward two steps back i ll start by addressing the elephant in the room you have 300 hours in the game how can you not recommend it well let me do a breakdown of how those hours were spent 150 hours duplicating progress in my own world for sections that i already did with a friend 80 hours riding around the open world and fighting copy pasted enemies exploring dungeons and fighting copy pasted bosses and enemies 40 hours the actual fun part of the game legacy dungeons these areas follow the format of the previous souls games and feature carefully crafted closed off areas with interesting enemies and well designed bosses 30 hours arena pvp invasions co op with randoms so overall that makes 70 hours of fun content and 230 hours of filler if you re planning to buy this game to play with a friend be prepared for a 7 23 ratio of fun to filler content now i d like to get into my criticisms with the game itself open world the open world is honestly really beautiful and engaging in the first 3 areas limgrave liurnia and caelid you won t be able to explore it as intended on a horse while playing in multiplayer but that s not a big deal these first areas have a good amount of content packed into them and you ll be seeing enemy varieties for the first time so you won t be bored of them yet the problem begins 1 3 of the way into the game at altus plateau this area is really beautiful as well and probably my favorite visually but you will start to notice some really empty areas and a lot of copy pasted enemies in the open world after you get through leyndell you arrive at the worst part of the game the mountaintops of the giants this area has i think one single new enemy that is not just copy pasted from the previous areas with a different skin it s not even worth the words to describe how bad this area is if you buy the game despite my negative review here s some advice hop on your horse and ride straight to the boss because there s nothing worth exploring here right after this is another empty snow area but the devs use an innovative trick here most of the area is covered in a snowstorm this expertly hides the areas that they didn t have time to finish so you can t see how devoid of content they are multiplayer first of all the netcode for this game s multiplayer is absolute trash connecting to your friends fails or hangs about 10 of the time and invading requires you to use the item 1 30 times before you ll successfully invade someone as far as anyone can tell fromsoft is basically still using the same netcode that they used back in dark souls in 2011 just with a couple of bandaids thrown on top to prevent infinite backstabs latency is a huge decider of every fight you will have and a lot of the skill comes from being able to quickly identify the approximate ping difference between yourself and your opponent and adapting your tactics accordingly your skills at pve will not carry over at all in pve you can look at an enemy s attack and decide to press dodge if you think it will hit you but in pvp you have to press dodge anyways no matter where their weapon is because of the invisible hitboxes and latency on top of this fromsoft decided to make the latency issues even more prominent by introducing powerful status effects that build up on you even if you successfully dodge an enemy attack the top level of pvp is full of scarlet rot and sleep status abusers who exploit the fact that these status effects build up on you even through dodges and the counter for this is to duplicate items cheating which cure rot sleep in the middle of combat oh and if you want to turn their tactics around on them then you ll need to duplicate items too because the sleep and rot grease are both limited in the quantity that you can obtain legitimately in a single playthrough watching a high level invasion honestly makes me laugh with how many limited use items both players are popping like candies pvp is just laughably broken on top of this there are some multiplayer decisions made by the developers that cannot be described as anything other than stupid first of all co op requires an item to even be allowed to summon people in the early game you ll have to waste some time farming for flowers and probably 10 minutes trying to figure out why you can t summon until you look it up next if you kill a boss you can t summon your friend anymore or be invaded in that area if you kill all the bosses in a particular open world chunk then that whole area is off limits for multiplayer when you kill a boss anywhere in the world even if it s just a random dragon in the open world you will be sent home as a cooperator there are random fog walls preventing you from entering caves with your friend and you ll have to disconnect ride to that spot in your own world enter the cave in your own world then re connect to your friend logical right it obviously improves the gameplay finally even when everything is working properly and the networking issues aren t getting in the way elden ring co op is just horribly balanced after the first couple of early game bosses every challenge in the game starts to become easy most enemies are simply not coded well to deal with multiple players attacking them bosses will change targets anytime they take damage even if it s a tiny throwing knife meaning that aggro juggling is incredibly easy the bosses are supposed to be able to kill you by damaging you and then punishing you when you try to heal but with aggro juggling you will always be able to heal unless you mess up horribly and get killed in a single combo this does happen so co oping bosses can still take a few tries but the difference between multiplayer and singleplayer is night and day despite the fact that the game increases enemies health in co op the game is at least 3 times easier to try to compensate for that my friend and i turned on the taunter s tongue to attract invaders but the game was still too easy because it s incredibly hard for an invader to fairly beat 2 people if you try invading you will probably walk into a blender of 3 people spamming spells and ashes of wars and die in 0 5 seconds this means that the only people who are left invading at higher levels the only people who can manage to have fun within this framework are the players who are willing to use any tactic necessary to win be prepared to deal with lots of duplicated rot grease duplicated starlight shards snipes from across the map with duplicated golem arrows and nuke builds that can kill you if you make a single mistake i don t even blame the players who are using these tactics because without them there would be no invaders at higher levels the game is simply so broken that players are forced to resort to these tactics to have a 0 5 chance of winning invasions story the story is mostly incomprehensible if you rely solely on playing the game you have to watch youtube videos to have any idea of what s going on after watching some though i came to this conclusion every one of the main players is a greedy george r r martin tried to craft a complicated story but the gameplay just doesn t support it imagine game of thrones but there are no background civilians in the story it s just the lords and ladies fighting over empty castles full of monsters that s elden ring every single creature attacks you on sight and there are no visible civilians you are fighting to become the lord of ashes overall the game is alright but it s simply not a good way to spend your time it all comes back to the 7 23 ratio of fun to filler maybe others will find that to be an acceptable ratio but i don t i wish i could get back the hours that i spent on this game and i implore others not to make the same mistake that i did,361.2,79.0,10,Not Recommended,"July 6, 2023",ELDEN RING,sandsalamand

12247,2022 my main problem with elden ring is that this game is sekiro bloodborn speed without the mechanics that make sekiro bloodborn work enemies are so fast and relentless with their attacks and you have very very slim chances to actually fight back this is particularly noticeable on the later bosses where they have these insane 5 9 hit combos that they then have less than a two second punish window before they launch off into another chain they also have way more health than most bosses in ds3 on average and most of them can instantly kill you even with a pretty hefty investment into health if you had the rally mechanic from bloodborn or the deflect from sekiro this game would be completely different as it is the game punishes you severely for being aggressive with the completely over tuned damage of the later bosses this tends to really impact colossal weapons more severely than it does faster weapons due to the fact that so many openings are so short you might not even get a single swing out safely after dodging 6 10 attacks what this does to combat is essentially makes the optimal way to fight anything simply to passively dodge all the attacks and only go for the punish when you know for a fact its free damage but since the enemies are so aggressive and have such long chains you ll find yourself spending the majority of most fights just dodging over and over again players insist you can balance this with the summons since they are meant to be part of the balance for the game but what self respecting fromsoft fan is going to want to use summons to beat the game the entire point of the game and the dev s have said this is for everyone to be on the same level as far as difficulty well if that s the case why are the summon ashes so bloody strong and have zero downsides clearly a mage player with a summons is not having the same time as a melee player with an ugs they literally betrayed their own design philosophy with this system and the result is that the bosses are hilariously over tuned against a single target again if i could deflect attacks if i could regain hp lost trading hits if i could do anything besides just spending 90 of the fight rolling around waiting for my turn to hit back this would be a very different game my other major problem is the absolutely unacceptable amount of recycled bosses this game has 165 bosses and maybe 10 of them are not reused the dragons are reused 6 times the erdtree avatar is reused 13 times that s insane to have a single boss be reused that many times,73.5,286.0,75,Not Recommended,"September 10, 2022",ELDEN RING,Grumpy Old Guy

12308,2022 this review pains me to write as i really loved the game and wished to enjoy my time with it unfortunately there are many short comings to this game at its current state that i just can not give a good review for major spoiler warning aheadmy opinions without spoilers will be at the tl dr section at the bottom let s first get this out of the way the map design and visuals are gorgeous my first steps into leyndll capital and the stunning nokron and nokstella cities gave me a feeling i ve never felt in any of the hundreds of the games i ve played this is no doubt the most immersive and enjoyable world fromsoftware has ever made the amount of content in this game is also unfathomable the amount of details and secrets such as the hidden sellia tunnel or the countless talismans and quests has made me eager to explore every nook and cranny of this world the sound design is also stellar not only are the boss soundtracks absolutely enjoyable my favorite without a doubt is the tibia mariner s theme but the sound design in general is mesmerizing the latin chants of the man bats or the cries of the cowmans to name a few are hypnotic to say the least however there are many shortcomings to this state that made my experience unenjoyable let s first talk optimization as i feel this applies to the most amount of users the optimization at the game s current state is simply horrendous per my experience the game could rarely run smoothly at 60fps with the lowest settings on my gtx 1070ti with 16gb ram and i7 8700 i m also encountering frame drops or frame skipping in every boss fight granted these are not the best specs but they are at least better or at on par with average graphic cards these days a friend of mine who has a 3080 and i9 core could rarely achieve great frame rates at high settings and others who had poorer specs could barely run the game at all ofcourse turning the resolution down and altering graphics files could net an increase in frame rates but players shouldn t be forced to juggle nay choose between immersiveness and playability next is the boss designs don t get me wrong lots of the boss designs are incredibly amazing and interesting especially true of the demigods however this only lasts for the early mid portion of the game many of the minibosses are over recycled and most bosses just become a war of attrition or worse luck i understand that this is a huge open world game and there are limited resources for development but when you are fighting your 7th ulcerated tree spirit or 6th erdtree avatar the encounters themselves simply feel unrewarding and boring i am also particularly disappointed with the reuse of the naturalborn of the void the main appeal of this lovecraftian scorpion is that it s supposed to be a one time encounter with a being that should not exist in the game world it should be horrifying and provide only a hint of what could exist in order to create a lingering dread and fear in the players however when it is reused again in a simple ice cave it just destroys the whole experience at least for me the bosses are also extremely unbalanced i know i know git gud just dodge bro but it feels like this title heavily caters towards sorcerers and abusing summons for the early game the game doesn t expect you to have good spells good stats or good summons and so the bosses feel fair and close range attacks feels powerful this is flipped completely in the later portion for my playthrough i was using a hybrid int build i could simply summon a 10 oleg knight have it tank all the damage and spam full moons until whatever is infront of me is obliterated this made the game uninteresting and so i switched to a strength faith build and i can say that it was completely hell on earth it feels as through all of the boss attacks are targeted towards melee players the magma wyrm attacks astel voidborn aoes and many other attacks is nonthreatening to ranged users and lethal to melee users because of the summons the rests between each attack from bosses are cut extremely short compared to other souls games as they expect you to be playing essentially 2 on 1 or 2 on 2 this has created a dilemma in which playing without summons and melee builds is extremely challenging while playing with summons as a sorcerer is extremely unfun and repetitive also most bosses are not challenging by design but are simply scaled up to one shot you if you don t dodge random bs ability 476 like ffs why does the black knife ring leader have like 500million health while being able to track and one shot you with his jump aoes i d like to bring up sekiro in comparison sekiro did the gameplay system perfectly at least imo where the boss attacks don t feel random but is a challenge of skills if you fail to parry that s on you if you fail to recognize the chain combos that s on you if you parry everything you get an opportunity to retaliate or heal in eldenring it s not the same let s say you get hit by ability a you are now faced with two decisions heal or not heal due to the short times between attacks it is essentially a gambit a random roll of a dice of whether you get punished for healing or not this is as i mentioned because summons exist and so the game is balanced to the summons the fights themselves turn into a battle of attrition of whoever runs out of health or flasks first and whoever is the luckiest instead of a true dance and true combat of skill questslastly the quest system is also abominable it is unwelcoming to veteran souls players and completely confusing to new players considering this very well could be the first souls game or even the first ever game that someone plays though i did enjoy doing some quests and feeling like satisfied after linking the dots between questlines how on earth are you supposed to progress main quest lines such as seluvi s plot without looking up a guide to find a hidden tunnel in the billions of ruins or how do you know without exploring for hundreds of hours where brother corhyn went after he just simply left the roundtable without even a hint of where he s heading ofcourse the game s not supposed to let you know everything but at least give a slight hint or direction you explore and finish the entire game without completing a single questline even when you are ecstatic to do so tl drthe game is immersive and interesting with jaw dropping visuals and some unique mechanics however due to the atrocious optimization poor balancing and perplexing quest system i simply cannot recommend it at its current state i emphasize at its current state because i wish that most of the complaints will be addressed and i would love to absolutely adore this game however it is sadly not the case right now that said i m going to be playing more eldenring because despite my complaints it is pretty fun,203.7,104.0,15,Not Recommended,"March 23, 2022",ELDEN RING,"A44.5kgOnion

12412,2022 a brief summaryelden ring is an open world soulslike with solid mechanics great level design and fantastic customization unfortunately the game has balancing issues that turn the early game into a slog and combat while built on solid mechanics that is often needlessly difficult and unfair at times while i personally enjoyed the game i don t think i d recommend it gameplaythe basicsit s dark souls with a fresh coat of paint and a jump button this means third person combat usually melee in which the player learns and masters the patterns of enemies to best defend and retaliate against them swinging one s weapon blocking and dodging all require stamina leaving the player vulnerable if they overextend lastly the player is only ever a few hits from death rarely more than ten but can heal with potions if they find an opening in which to use them these games carry a reputation for being challenging having sufficient depth to require a certain mastery from the player elden ring changes the formula slightly with the addition of jumping as both an offensive and defensive tool additionally repeated hits on an enemy in a short time frame will knock it down for a critical attack returning souls players will also find that weapons require far less stamina to swing increasing player agency substantially explorationstormveil castle the raya lucaria academy and so many more while the side dungeons may vary in quality the main ones are exceptional there are several routes through which to reach the end often with breathtaking landmarks to keep you oriented and hint at where you ll go next the areas are massive but naturally segmented with checkpoints and shortcuts finally they re packed with items secrets and enemies picking up the pace from the slower world outside the world at large naturally isn t as dense as the main dungeons that said it still has the handcrafted feel with many points of interest and encounters strewn across it customizationplayers level up using runes slowly growing attributes of their choosing vigor mind and endurance boost health focus and stamina everything else determines what types of equipment you can use strength for big swords faith for incantations importantly the game has the runtime to allow for players to allocate enough points to explore multiple options in their character build as far as options are concerned there are several categories of weapons with a large portion of them having special attacks and traits to distinguish them there are a variety of spells with widely ranging requirements many of which are low enough to support otherwise purely physical builds last but not least are ashes of war which can be applied to weapons to alter their movesets and infuse them with different properties all in all the customization is fantastic with a great many choices of viable options multiplayeras of now the game suffers from serious connectivity issues with players disconnecting from each other at random provided they can connect at all when it finally does work you ll normally get invaded by someone with an optimized bleed or madness build no fun allowed who can full to zero you off of one or two hits that said pvp is the best it s ever been in a souls game ignoring them the fantastic diversity in weapons and skills means that cooperators will be able to compliment each other s builds almost always beating out npc summons as a note it s a waste of time outside of dungeons since you ll have to explore on foot co op though it doesn t often work makes dungeons more fun and can make even the worst fights manageable writingwhat writing the premise was never properly defined or motivated with the introductory slideshow sharing little of value the characters were promising before they disappeared for good i read my item descriptions and explored as best i could but after it all the world feels empty devoid of stories my character has no place in the world no past nor connections what s this elden ring and why does everyone want it who s this person who levels me up frankly i couldn t tell you nor will the game try to shortcomingsnumbersto upgrade a regular weapon to the maximum the player will require 96 smithing stones of varying tiers i used over 900 smithing stones on weapons costing me something in the ballpark of 1 2 million runes on upgrades overall to put that in perspective that s enough to level a player from level 1 to 83 or 83 to 105 late game ignoring the fact that smithing stones are rare to the point that you might not find enough to fully upgrade one weapon let alone ten the shortage of runes in the early game is especially bad with full dungeons failing to provide the runes for a single level why s this matter firstly enemies across the board have high stats and are scaled up considerably with each new area my character durable first fun second and threatening last was physically incapable of killing many late game bosses that said anything less than that high durability was susceptible to one hit kills in higher leveled areas as such it s often numbers that force players away from the main dungeons and with the relative scarcity of both runes and smithing stones it can be days before a player is strong enough to return that is to say that progress is frequently held back by a lack of what is effectively grinding rather than mechanical mastery ctrl c ctrl vbesting a giant the first time is exhilarating the fiftieth one won t meaningfully differ from the one before it yes there are a lot of enemy types but not enough to make side areas distinctive side dungeons feel the same due to similar architecture and enemy types not to mention the repeat boss fights all while lacking any discernible narrative significance most rewards are stone sword keys and crafting materials which aren t any good on their own lacking narrative intrigue and meaningful powerups to help the player overcome adversity in the main areas the world at large beautiful as it is feels empty boss fights are good unless the boss has overwhelming numbers requiring hundreds of hits to kill the boss has a practically undodgeable attack which governs the player s success there are multiple bosses whose attacks can and will overlap the boss is constantly running away and can t be hit in most cases the boss has inconsistent follow ups or is always attacking rendering player attacks unsafe that the player s only ever one or two mistakes from death isn t necessarily bad but there s a difference between the boss forcing a mistake with an undodgeable attack and the player actually making a mistake if it was just once or twice it wouldn t be so bad but it would seem that more often than not bosses check at least one item off the list if not two many of the boss fights can t be realistically beaten by the player alone requiring a second player or npc to share the worst of it all that said there are stellar bosses mixed in there only spaced tens of hours apart blocked mainly by poor boss fights the game was difficult all too often at the expense of being enjoyable conclusionit s not terrible but a lot of the game just wasn t much fun getting stuck on a boss for hours because i needed to go near perfect for minutes at a time only to return to a world that has long since lost its magic losing connection to my friends over and over hoping it d be better than the day prior was frustrating all the while i loved exploring the main dungeons and lambasting my friends for getting caught by the undodgeable attacks the core gameplay was good and the other sixty hours wasn t i had my fun but i can t say i d recommend it,203.1,17.0,1,Not Recommended,"April 2, 2022",ELDEN RING,"Dazzle10

12417,2022 80 hours into a single character mostly into a faith build i don t think i would tell someone on the fence to buy this game but i would recommend it if they could get it on sale for 40 off or more it s a game for diehard fans of the series of which i would count myself but it fails to perform past the initial few areas the game itself is rocky on pc at its best moments the port feels like it was an afterthought and i do wish i had picked this up on my ps5 which is not something that i would commonly say large drops in framerate when some enemies cast spells hitches when cutscenes transition from scene to scene luckily i have not encountered any serious difficulties in general gameplay but i do dip below 60fps commonly it s obviously manageable but i m somewhat disappointed overall with this aspect the gameplay is the same core loop as we have been playing for the past decade in the souls series this isn t a negative but it has me beg the question of what people are seeing when they call elden ring the 2022 goty or an industry level game changer there s barely anything new here you can jump you can be stealthy to a degree you have a somewhat temperamentally controlled horse the attacks feel the same the peaks and troughs of weapon powerlevels feel very similar man that first uchigatana i found really trivialized most of limgrave much like the uchi in every souls game ever and the core loop feels very similar incantations and sorceries are very very cool and generally quite rewarding to use in this game hence why i went with a faith build smiting nerds with lightning bolts and giant red lightning stakes or massive exploding fireballs is extremely satisfying and probably why i made it this far but nothing else is really that innovative sans the sekiro stance breaking mechanic the complete reliance on the hold sword in air for 12 seconds while the tarnished attempts to read your move style of attacking really cuts this game down for me bosses and larger enemies hold onto their swings for dear life just to bait you into a roll and catch you halfway through recovering it feels lazy like they discovered this was a viable option wherever it first made its appearance in the series and they decided that was the thing that was needed to truly make the game difficult the oppressive aggression some enemies have is exhilarating and keeps you on your toes whereas this kind of mechanic just serves to frustrate a player when they get caught and have to then watch a 13 hit combo delete their character the level design in this game takes a sharp decline in the later portions of the game limgrave liurnia mostly altus leyndell these are all fantastic zones mountaintops of the giants could be better caelid whatever that is it ain t it chief lake of rot hilarious loved it what a great throwback to places like the valley of defilement and blighttown even though this kind of thing exists in every single souls game and we should be expecting it i even enjoyed mt gelmir as it housed a very fun questline and the obligatory stormbringer fight but then we see zones like the subterranean shunning grounds ok it was fun to kill the horrible npc here farum azula got dayum dragons gibbing my 30 vigor ass because i m too stupid to learn how to dodge when i m not looking at them the consecrated snowfield hur dur blizzard haha remember frigid outskirts btw co director of dark souls 2 and the haligtree why is everything suddenly so resistant to my lightning and it truly sucks the fun out of the game these areas can be beautiful have wonderful soundtracks and interesting artistic qualities but they are such slogs to get through it no longer feels fun to progress the nosedive in quality of level design is unfortunate in such a highly anticipated game the crafting and ash of war systems are fantastic if nothing else i hope other rpg style games take note of the ability to swap infusions and skills on the fly like this crafting throwable pots or knives or arrows with materials you collect is a great way to reward exploration and being the type of person to mash triangle to pick everything up off the ground the open world formula really works for this series though elden ring itself suffers from some pacing issues if you can call it that exploration feels rewarding but once you progress further into the game it becomes less so and the world slowly becomes more sparse this made it less appealing for me to explore some of the aforementioned slogs and not just try to blitz the enemies and find ways to avoid ones that i didn t particularly want to waste 15 lightning bolts on all in all i think this game is worth trying if you re a fan of the series and there are definitely some great and rewarding moments but the fact of the matter is that it s the same game we ve been playing for a decade with not much new to offer aside from an open world that deviates slightly from the barren ubisoft style formula if you re looking for something new and exciting you might find what you re looking for here but i have my doubts tl dr git gudder than me and enjoy the game but i think it s a 6 5 to 7 10 at best and i would probably rate this just above ds2 in terms of how much i enjoy playing it and you know this is just my opinion right,133.8,88.0,11,Not Recommended,"March 22, 2022",ELDEN RING,Snow

12856,2022 it has been anticipated for quite a long time to say expectations were high would be quite understated being part of its sizable feverish following you naturally wish for it to fulfill the idea of a game that you have made up in your imagination which in hindsight often seems foolish elden ring is fromsoftware s shot at an open world i avoid most open world games because i do not care about mindless collection and completion rodent wheels that most of them are built to be i was hoping for fromsoftware to have the wisdom to steer away from the typical trappings of what they were going to attempt and to actually deliver on what open worlds have promised to be ever since they have become the industry s favorite gimmick no need to make it explicit i don t believe they did i will not go much into the performance issues that have blighted this game so far they exist and make the game worse though my gripes lie more fundamental in nature and unlike the poor technical constitution they have no hope of being mended i am also going to assume that you are familiar with dark souls iii since this game lifts quite much from it it is more timely to simply point out where it differs open worldthe world of elden ring is segmented into several distinct zones each with a main dungeon that is relevant for making actual story progress and a variety of side content which is in significant part rather generic and repetitive there are a vast number of random soldier camps and mini dungeons that primarily exist to hold certain items of loot but do not stand out as worth seeking out for their own sake once you have seen an abundance of them the enemy rosters of the various overworld zones have a disappointing amount of overlap with soldiers and knights of various factions just being reskins of the same base model and many lesser foes being ubiquitous across a large portion of the world quite a few of the minor bosses also get reused to a silly degree at some point you may consider that stopping to fight them just doesn t seem particularly worth your investment and would rather make use of that new horse to skip right past without any trouble overall different regions are primarily distinguished by the looks of their terrain which do indeed look very pretty but in the end they largely share a lot of the same stuff and blend together as you keep playing the moment the game shines however is when you leave the uniformity of the content pastures and enter the main dungeons these are actually well crafted and intricate large structures that merit your attention and time they resemble something closer to a fromsoftware level with winding paths shortcuts and atmospheric architecture the addition of jumping has opened up new ways of traversing them and generally the pathways are more complex than ever before evoking the feeling of exploring a truly massive place gameplayif you are familiar with dark souls iii and its moment to moment combat elden ring will feel strangely familiar the basic combat loop is the same in essence with many weapons attacks and spells being completely identical to their older counterparts the most notable addition is horse combat which allows to swing weapons while moving very fast with a little bit of practice most overworld encounters can be fairly trivialized with hit and run tactics because enemies rarely get a good chance at retaliation before you dash away ground combat has a new shield counter move aswell as the ability to slot looted weapon arts onto arbitrary weapons what is odd is that elemental infusions can now be arbitrarily changed at any time now no longer is it necessary to dedicate a weapon to a particular type of damage or stat scaling it can be adjusted at any time while resting it puts to question why such a system still exists if all it does is reshuffle around some damage numbers to whatever seems suitable at the time rather than being a means to permanently invest into a weapon like some kind of roleplaying game i struggle to really come up with a succinct way of describing how i feel about bosses beyond just being generally unsatisfied with them there being such a large amount of them really underlines how dependent fromsoftware has become on creating frantic confusing difficult to read movesets as a means to create challenge for many if not most bosses i was frequently compelled into long periods of passivity unsure about when i actually had a valid opening for attacks or actions other than dodging and blocking it felt less like fighting a creature and more like playing a guessing game with frustrating stakes which technically has always been the case for dark souls to some extent but never had been this obvious before many moves are designed to force you into a timed roll by cheap means and punish simply maneuvering out of the way many melee attacks either have an aoe blast on them to force you into abusing i frames regardless of whether the weapon actually touches you or worse simply drag the boss towards you so that an attack hits even if you have pre emptively backed up not only does this make fights feel very one dimensional it also looks incredibly silly very few bosses manage to break away from being a moveset that you just have to memorize the few that do are pretty much recycled concepts from past fromsoftware games including everyone s favorite machete wielding giant storytellingcontinuing the theme of eerie familiarity is the story and lore elden ring continues the trend of having characters speak in very vague and cryptic metaphors and item descriptions being the main catalyst for worldbuilding this section may spoil the overall trajectory of the story it becomes rather obvious after a while that the story is almost beat for beat the same as dark souls iii with the names of characters and places simply being swapped out the tarnished are undead in all but name and the quest they embark on has them collect great runes instead of cinders of lords to link the restore the elden ring so that life may once again flourish in the world or maybe you want to go for the age of dark ending equivalent which i am going to predict the game will offer without having actually finished it once again it s not exactly the first time that fromsoftware has repeated itself but this time feels particularly blatant especially in context with all the other recycling that has been going on in the rest of the game final judgementi derive no joy from not recommending this game i wanted to like it as badly as anyone else it s not like it is entirely awful i have enjoyed it early on in the honeymoon phase when everything was still new and i had no idea where the game was gonna go but the creeping realization eventually set in that it really was just stretching a small amount of fresh content over a vast space and that it was not going to become any better the elden ring experiment has failed it has resulted in a shallower bloated and bland game but it looks like it s made a lot of money so there is no reason to assume that this won t be what awaits us in future fromsoftware titles this is the first one that i shelved before completing it simply due to being burnt out and ceasing to care not because of any one particular road block i have lost count of how many times i ve encountered the same dragon boss fight being repurposed by merely applying a different color and elemental damage type in once instance i even correctly predicted the reveal of an ice flavored dragon simply by the presence of a suspicious large open frozen lake there is one boss gimmick that is original to this game however i don t want to spoil it though i think it sucks,208.5,19.0,0,Not
