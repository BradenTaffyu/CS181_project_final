13525,2023 creative assembly has decided that going to war with their playerbase is the best option in light of recent failings poor marketing anti consumer practices and outright hostile community management here on steam what was once a thriving studio and series has become a collection of broken promises aggressive sales tactics and outright threats on the community while currently in the process of trying to walk all this back the damage has been done dlc prices have increased while content has decreased when concerns of this were raised the community was quite literally told to buy it or support would be dropped when it was pointed out that support doesn t really exist due to the continuation of major bugs broken ai and gameplay balancing issues the response was to ban people when it was pointed out that making a hero shooter with hyenas was a terrible idea and the community wants rome 3 empire 2 or something along those lines again the community is told to shut up and get in line hyenas has been canceled to the tune of millions in losses and jobs cut somehow the problem in all this is the community when pharaohs got announced it was met with a criticism and push bask as a reskin of total war troy and pushing a sagas title smaller budget scale and price as a full scale total war release wasn t at all what the community wanted bare in mind during all this ca dropped support for three kingdoms because despite selling well and getting good response it wasn t big enough for sega ca so they killed the project apparently a team of just 20 people work on total warhammer content now and ca s studio size has been reduced by 40 with hostilities continuing towards the community though ca is trying to walk it back with a non apology once they got enough push back for banning mod creators on steam which locked them out of updating their mods or even uploading new ones guess ca realized it wasn t the best idea ot remove those actually helping their game i m 100 in support of boycotting ca products until this sort of stuff is addressed and the community given the respect it deserves i ve been playing total war games since the original shogun hit store shelves back in 2000 there was a time when i held out hope we d see shogun 3 but these days i question if studio management and sega will allow the studio to continue long enough to release another game let alone something the community is actually interested in playing been over 10 years since rome ii released and since then it s been calls for rome iii shogun 3 medieval iii and empire 2 yet beyond the total warhammer releases they ve largely missed the mark for bringing something new the community wants three kingdoms had its success but ca and sega weren t happy with fan spending so despite being from 2019 the project is dead buried and forgotten about oh and ca is quick to blame steam for their harsh treatment of the community as someone who has moderated discussion boards on here before for games that s a load of crap but ca is used to shoveling crap to fans so it is on brand rip creative assembly,163.8,816.0,3,Not Recommended,"30 October, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Keji Goto

13529,2023 i really really want to love this game i ve played over 3000 hours of its predecessor and was beyond excited for this game to come out the main problems 1 cost dlc chaos dwarfs was the most expensive dlc to date but the upcoming shadows of change is a slap in the face to everyone who supported and loved these games it asks for 25 usd for a few units and three legendary lords prior examples in the previous games offered the same exact thing for 10 including one of the legendary lords being free for everyone even then the free lord would still be high quality more often than not free ones have included imrik and rakarth for the high elves and dark elves respectively which became many people s favorite way to play the entire faction 2 updates have slowed to a crawl the game is still littered with significant bugs nearly a year and a half after its release communication has been uncharacteristically absent compared to the norms of the previous games at times gamebreaking bugs like nakai s inability to recruit kroxigors the units he specializes in have been present for three months or longer this particular bug was fixed for free by a modder in about 5 minutes of work which leads us to 3 the game s future is uncertain and troubling a previous game in the total war series three kingdoms was met with a huge positive response upon release but the dlcs and updates seemed disconnected and disappointing for many players whenever new content came out gamebreaking bugs would follow including ones that would never be fixed when the purchases began to slow down the entire project was unceremoniously cancelled many people fear that this game might inherit the fate of three kingdoms the official response to this price hike has been troubling at best many people have invested hundreds or thousands of hours of this series and wanted to see it through dlcs were bought consistently and regularly because there was trust and goodwill towards the developer and while they may not have been perfect each would often lead to countless hours of enjoyment and unique opportunities and ways to play the game i and many others just want a return to form we want to be excited for new content not anxious many of us are more than willing to pay for content that shines with love and care such as what has already been accomplished in warhammer ii we want to feel secure in the game s future without worrying if or when the skeleton crew will be recalled we want to see that the game is cared for and that bugs especially significant and simple ones are addressed we want more open and transparent communication and to see that feedback is being respected we are upset because we put so much of ourselves into this game and want it to be as great as it can be living up to the potential that has already been created and witnessed if warhammer ii was any indication when the developers are allowed the time and resources to make something great the community by and large won t think twice about getting dlc that meets a respectable quality for the price we don t want the future and functionality of the game to be tied to exponential price hikes and radio silence we want something close to what we already had and what has already been made time and time again many have been invested in this game series for over 7 years many have been waiting with excitement for the conclusion to the trilogy of phenomenal games the people who have been hurt the most by this abrupt and inexplicable shift are the ones who have been there for years and have happily and willingly supported the game and all of its content the ask is only to get something close to what we already had to what had already been developed sold and delivered to us many times before for better or worse the treatment of this game will affect the future of the developer publisher and playerbase make it count edit may 1st 2024 i am pleased to say that it feels like things are finally turning around the developers have become a bit more communicative and they have addressed many major points of concern they started by pushing out hotfixes for various bugs and followed it up with providing much more value to the shadows of change dlc to make it worthy of its price point even after its release the thrones of decay dlc has also just launched with a ton of new content along with the completely new option to buy each different part of the dlc separately so far the game seems to be in a much better shape and future is looking far better than before speaking strictly for myself i am now satisfied with their change in direction and substantive response though it would not be unwise to hold off on preorders for future updates until they actually go live to make sure the quality is consistent,212.2,368.0,4,Not Recommended,"August 19, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Dylmystro

13557,2023 warhammer 3 is like a new pair of expensive shoes with a tiny piece of glass jumbling around in it that you will never get out you will turn it upside down and shake it you will change socks you ll walk differently you ll think you ve taken care of it and you ll feel amazing in your new shoes on a beautiful day for a while and then you re stung again foremost is that it s addicting because of its excellent core gameplay and there always being something new to try or get better at wh3 is huge various and it s good it s awesome even speaking as someone who played rome shogun and medieval 2 for a decade if i want to play medieval again i ll just start a bretonnia campaign and that s just one of the many factions unless i want better music pre battle speeches and those cool event movies as you find out things that excite you engross you and build your book of strategies you will find out other things such as the loooooooaaddd times actively discouraging manual battling the performance is poor for the visual quality especially on minimum it still chugs after you make it look like dough and you need mods to demake it enough to not cook your gpu the amount of factions lords you can play with the base game is low and you re expected to have warhammer 1 and 2 to access their races and a lot of dlc after you ve already paid full price dlc content isn t intrinsically bad but it s likely that you ll be a bit disappointed if you just purchase wh3 new factions are starkly powercrept old ones are being updated but at a glacial pace there exists a downright silly anti player bias where enemies will sometimes ignore all reason and self preservation to march full stacks at you from preposterous distances sometimes they declare war the instant you discover them and perhaps they were building armies and waiting in the fog doing nothing but waiting only to launch them at you once you meet them even though they were adjacently surrounded by other hostile targets edit this may have been retuned as of 4 0 will update later the empire is supposed to suck and have an agonizing start position and it being recommended as a beginner faction is a cruel joke chaos is the main character and general favourite and you will feel it enemies take less attrition in higher difficulties to the point of rendering it irrelevant this hurts vampire skaven tomb king and nurgle players skaven plagues do unavoidable unmitigatable attrition to an army putting it out of commission for 5 turns plus 2 5 more to heal back up moreover they do not care if you are allied with them allying with skaven does not stop them from plagueing you because they plague your common enemy and they spread for a long time having war declared while being next to your new enemy s lord or city will trap you inside of their zone of control and not let you leave unless you initiate an attack and then retreat some critical strategies that make your faction not miserable or even quite powerful will take many hours and new attempts to discover unless you watch a video first in other words racial tutorials are barebones and don t describe practical play expectations as cathay chaos will ignore the great bastion outside of a rare scripted event and backdoor you with a hilarious 20 turn journey through the mountains the ability to build walls around minor settlements was removed even at the maximum growth stage and maximum wall building tier huh unit performance is not insignificantly dictated by an undocumented animation metagame which governs splash damage and entity finishers quests and grudges that require raiding a region or attacking a city lord with a hero don t complete if you do more than that claiming the region claiming the city or slaying the lord in battle nope you have to specifically raid that region and you fail the quest if you conquer it instead every time you leave a section of your border undefended you are punished severely and have to learn repeatedly to always expect the most annoying inconvenient bs to occur even if taking it slow means crippling your campaign this does make some starts where you re totally exposed on multiple fronts reliant on big gambles pathfinding around walls in siege battles may cause hemorrhoids playing chase the goose with an enemy lord in march stance that just perfectly slipped by you will cause hemorrhoids ai factions have a hidden faction potential which gives them artificial extra production regardless of difficulty and autoresolve power when fighting each other legendary lord factions have much more fp than minor factions and will erase them by virtue of fp difference rather than actual military difference this also means allying with minor factions is pointless additionally when the player hasn t discovered these factions yet they have another invisible mechanic shroud their fp based autoresolve advantage is doubled this means that you drastically change the nature of the world simply by having vision of it and if you re not careful you can significantly nerf factions you like while distant enemies keep their undiscovered bonus fp is both randomized and weighted based on your starting faction so now you change the nature of the world just by what faction you start with this is silly it s understandable to give ai production and military bonuses based on difficulty but to include these arbitrary invisible modifications just confuses the player and tempts them to metagame rather than play normally beyond your comprehension if your ambush trigger fails and the enemy declines to engage he can just walk right through your army and raze your settlement instead of being forced to retreat backward like the player is while passing your turn and sieging an enemy city if they sally out to fight you and you don t slay enough troops such that the enemy garrison survives and you don t claim the city your siege is canceled and a all of your equipment building progress is lost b attrition will not tick that turn and c another faction can initiate their own siege on the city stealing the tag from you new factions are added without care to how they affect the situation of old factions the immediate neighbours of chaos dwarfs perhaps the most juiced up faction to exist received no rebalancing when they were added despite it wholly changing the nature and demands of their faction starts the dammaz kron shuts other than that it s fun sometimes a lot of fun see the shoe metaphor if you re looking for more complex diplomacy and economy other tws like three kingdoms would be more to your taste however in my opinion tw diplomacy was never good no matter how deep it was and having to meticulously manage your trade network would be silly in the face of kragbock teh eternel killer coming out of the fog whose sole responsibility is to well it s in the name diplomacy is there and it s deep enough though missing a joint war declaration option instead of one of you having to be at war first it could be tuned better economy is the same different factions have fairly different styles of diplomacy and economy so i suppose that s how the game makes up for it breadth over depth but not too shallow that same principle applies to much of the title i reiterate buyer beware if you expect to make a single purchase or even a few and be done with it,481.8,172.0,10,Recommended,"May 31, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Christmas Treant
13558,2023 as soon as ca decided that threatening the end of support of the game if we don t adhere to new pricing was the best plan of attack after the backlash of the monsterous dlc pricing hike the company has shown its true colors and the fanbase won t have any more of it go back to the rome 2 launch you will see the same clown writing the same post back then too rob bartholomew should be fired but he won t be this is what happens when you have leverage in a company and can say and do whatever you want well the community has shown you we don t like your words of despair too bad the damage is done perhaps games workshop will go else where its a shame especially when i have thousands of hours on this trilogy do not buy this title a s i n i n e,423.3,276.0,4,Not Recommended,"August 20, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"|Pipe Dreams

13573,2022 this game was published months to early as of now the problem is this is not a finished game and it was planned exactly like that that would have been okay as you get a little content to allow you to play until the actual campaign comes what makes it problematic is that the content we actually get is utterly dull repetitive and already needed a big fix patch for many problems in fact the problems are so big ca postponed the content this game so desperately needs to create solutions on the foundation a good step of course but too late now that the game is published for full price no less people want to play and despite you get more factions than ever to start with you barely have anything to do with them ca should have postponed the game as a whole to care for all the problems this game has that way our expections would still be when will the game be published instead of when will we get the needed content it s a problem with expectations too high the grand finale and game pushed out too carelessly it s not a bad game if we get the content it is planned to be published with no it would be a damn awesome game that s what this shows but it is a demonstration version for a full price for what s yet to come this is not a full game don t treat it as such add the game got better due to some patches it s still not a great game it does what a total war game does other total war games are better this is still not the game it could be and that the developer thinks it is see the abnormal prices for dlcs add fans are angry about the pricing policy 25 for a simple lord pack with three lords and nof much else in shadows of change for example and how does creative asdembly react they announced they will delete discussions about prices and possibly ban people from their communities fine as a reviewer though i feel i gotta tell you about that talking about prices should be allowed for customers bad move wouldn t recommend to buy a game with such pricing and community policy,804.6,967.0,4,Not Recommended,"April 6, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Mallow, The Bunny 💗"
13574,2022 it s a great game but no reason to rush into buying it just yet let s start with the negatives the major problem is that performance is not good even in high end systems it s going to take a few patches for ca to optimize it the ai is also acting weird and could use a bit of tweaking the campaign is fun the first time you play but it feels too much like a time attack at times i just wish there was more time to explore and expand in between the chaos gates opening the way it s structured means that you actually have an advantage if you don t expand too much and keep your faction leader near a major settlement in order to rush into chaos gates get demon souls rest at settlement to remove negative traits and rinse repeat the final battle whilst very challenging the first time you play it get s much easier after you realize what are the optimal unit types to bring and what strategy to follow there s a few glitches but nothing too gamebreaking in my experience most annoying thing i ve encountered was camera acting weird in battle maps with steep declining cliffs on to the positives graphically and visually stunning truly a work of art both in environments and units the battle maps have been improved sieges maps especially diplomacy and alliances are greatly improved trading settlements is back you can borrow allied armies and easily see what they re up to and you can even recruit allied units i really really hope they transfer these changes to the next historical total wars outstanding the factions are all great and they have interesting and unique gameplay mechanics both in campaign and battles everything feels distinct they finally did away with the web paged encyclopedia and it s back into being locally stored i haven t tried the multiplayer campaigns just yet but they finally increased player count it was about time for this change and can t wait to start some campaigns with friends when mortal empires map launches the game will really shine bright when the mortal empires map launches that unites all three total warhammer games into one beast of a game if you re on the fence maybe just wait until then game will be a masterpiece by then,201.0,350.0,11,Recommended,"February 20, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Blitz™

13579,2022 something about this ai is just frustrating i m never excited for the next turn because i know it s going to be something absurd i have thousands of hours in this trilogy but i can t stomach more than 40 turns of a campaign in this game before thinking i don t care enough to deal with this it hardly ever feels like you re actually strategizing just playing wack a mole with factions that would gladly sacrifice their existence for the chance to march 24 turns through their enemies past my allies to blow up one settlement and then get deleted for it before you know it you own a quarter of the map by just reacting to suicidal ai you don t even need to declare war they will constantly seek you out at this point i d rather just skip the campaign map all together and just have battles strung together in a narrative campaign battles are good praise sigmar,384.4,272.0,10,Not Recommended,"December 1, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,RewgHero
13580,2023 no amount of beating around the bush is going to get around the fact that this game had a rough launch but it s been a year since then and the devs have not stopped working on improving the game since then and won t for the foreseeable future as was the case with other total war games warhammer 3 will remain in development for years to come as the devs update older content and add new content to the game in the form of free downloadable content and paid dlc both so if you re looking for a definitive experience you won t find it here with that said at this point this game has improved so much since its launch that i can confidently say i d rather load up a new wh3 campaign than go back to playing wh2 even though i m a wh2 veteran of 2500 hours the maps of wh3 are better the features are better and the gameplay is still best in class and as such i will gladly recommend total war warhammer 3 as the first game to buy from this franchise and as a psa the franchise frequently goes on sale i would highly recommend keeping an eye out for sales both on and off of steam as you can often save quite a bit of money currently most items are 50 off on steam as of this review,901.3,155.0,6,Recommended,"March 23, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Fen

13588,2022 let s be real for a second this game without any dlc or predecessors is not even half a total war game and the price you are asked to pay for the full experience is only stomachable if you bought the other stuff you want in it over the last years the balancing is all over the place since ca ramped up the magic from i to ii to iii considerably and throws in elite units like it s going out of style once you ve met a half dead chaos army that still kicks ass because every single unit is a super elite unit you ll know what i mean the difficulty setting essentially just beefs up the ai units to ridiculous levels and reduces their upkeep so a faction a tenth your size may field as many armies as you have legendary lords may have the most special of special effects or a minor economy buff so if you meet one in battle be prepared for nasty surprises even just on hard difficulty i ve seen the ai attacking me getting killed to the last zombie sylvania and both attacking armies were back to full strength with the lords i just put in the ground there may be some around endgame scenarios follow the old ca route just throw a ton of elite fullstacks at the player because that s fun idk if it were an actual horde attack but the spawning of for example 15 stacks of elite wood elves who just go on the rampage until you burn their stupid forest is plainly creativly bankrupt the design of minor villages is moronic in the extreme and mostly doesn t benefit the defender nearly as much as it should in the case of dwarfs humans and elfs who may have things like firing lanes and defensive positions in mind there are for example often courts which might concentrate the enemy by blocking off the exits but you can t put any ranged units in good firing positions around it sieges are still as stupid as they were in twwhi everybody has a ladder up his arse and walls are little more than death traps for your troops knocking down reenforced gates with clubs and fists takes about as much time as it takes a unit to leave the wall i m not saying i m not having some fun in this game but it could be much better especially since it s the third and final entry in the series so if you liked the other two twwhs and have all the dlc races you might want to play go ahead and buy it but if you are new to the whole twwh go get something else this game will annoy the hell outta you,351.8,220.0,3,Not Recommended,"December 9, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Froger

13592,2022 before immortal empires i wouldn t have recommended warhammer iii as it was the realm of chaos campaign felt only like a showcase or a distraction of the new things for warhammer iii while they were making immortal empires the settlement siege battles quickly became tiring to play the ai often bumbled around both tactically and strategically the portals to the realm of chaos itself were frustrating to deal with same for actually visiting these locations and the overall performance of the game quite often caused the game to slow down to an unacceptable pace mostly around kislev at that time i only put roughly 6 5 hours into the game after finishing the kislev campaign and decided to wait and now with immortal empires while some systems remain in place this feels like how warhammer iii should ve released granted it s still fairly buggy with a few issues popping up during my playthrough i ve come back to finally start enjoying the mosh pit of races and factions on one giant map and playing the game the way i want to as it should be like with everyone else although the settlement siege battles are still rather obnoxious to deal with the ai still fumbles about on the occasion and the performance still slightly worrying at times it s been a much better experience than it has been compared to warhammer ii s mortal empires there are some genuinely great changes that have been made here specifically the diplomacy which is far more interesting and intriguing and allowing for allies to truly shine better than being a downright disappointing doorstop for whatever comes knocking on the other side even being able to simply threaten a trespassing faction or add some intimidation to a deal you re trying to make adds more level of interest than ever before in my opinion of course furthering this comparison is the addition of the end game dilemma s or calamities that may spring up although fairly simple in concept and idea it s a better addition than warhammer ii s chaos invasion mechanic in which chaos armies on northern and southern sides of the map spawn in numerous numbers to challenge the world although the player bias would disagree with that now it s a system that involves a singular faction spawning numerous amounts of armies in a lore friendly location to perform their faction goal and with a slightly less player bias it suits the theme of total war much better than a single faction invading the way they did and it also draws end game out better and add more variety to it since dealing with only chaos felt like a chore more than anything overall i highly recommend the immortal empires side of warhammer iii as i believe it s a better representation of what the game should be a sandbox empire management game and while i still do not recommend the realm of chaos campaign it s okay to have as a side dish to the main course,98.1,125.0,1,Recommended,"August 25, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Arcyteer

13595,now that i ve 100 the game and can only derive enjoyment from legendary campaign difficulty very hard battle difficulty anymore i think i can finally leave a well rounded review this is definitely one of those games that i wish steam had a neutral review option for to give you an idea of where my thoughts are coming from i have over a thousand hours across the total war series and started over a decade ago in middle school with medieval ii this is easily the most diverse of the franchise by far with the variety of races and the rosters for each one and it has an incredibly good modding scene the battles are as cinematic as it gets and the game is beautiful on max settings this entry in the franchise also has the most robust multiplayer campaign with the player slots going up to 10 medieval iii multiplayer campaigns please the variety of lords heroes schools of magic and tech trees for all the races allows for a variety of playstyles as well however it s really more of an illusion of choice because when it comes down to it each legendary lord has their bread and butter to the point that with all the stat buffs you get between perks and research you ll steamroll armies that are composed of units that are supposed to counter you agents heroes will 99 of the time be incorporated in your armies and be objectively better as a battlefield unit than for their campaign map purposes i ve beaten multiple legendary campaigns without utilizing an agent on the campaign map even once which i feel shows their lack of impact if they re just a side option instead of being absolutely essential for well rounded play sieges and settlement battles honestly feel like a downgrade from previous titles medieval ii did it perfectly with multi layered citadels dedicated military settlements being entirely different than cities etc in this game there s multiple scenarios where you attack with a lord that just gets a free destroy castle wall button right at the beginning of the battle you should have an inherent strong advantage as a defender in a siege situation and this game just doesn t facilitate that at all the largest issue this games suffers from which plagues essentially every game of the 4x rts genre by the way i just need to point it out here is difficulty scaling the ai is dumb want to make the game harder give them every cheat known to man stats wise the only thing ai really know how to do is attack move their entire army at you even on legendary they will regularly send full stacks to their death by initiating battles against you they don t even have any chance of winning and i don t just mean in battle by the way i mean the autoresolve will be an 80 20 split in your favor and the ai still attack for some reason the game is fun i ll continue to experiment with mods and play with friends when they ask but when it comes down to it once you crack the formula there s really no situation where you haven t really won the campaign by turn 50 60 and would just continue it for the sake of reaching the tedious win conditions of a long victory which vary wildly wood elves and norsca were beyond annoying to complete whereas chaos dwarves i beat a legendary campaign as zhatan the black in 2 hours the core gameplay loop sees you essentially solve the first 10 turn puzzle for each legendary lords start and once you re able to do that consistently that illusion of depth for the game shatters and you re left with a quick 30 minutes of conquering and then an end turn simulator as you sweep through the map i do recommend this game the warhammer lore is one of my favorite universes and is done extreme justice here the game is definitely enjoyable up until the point that you ve mastered it and you ll get your money s worth for that time however after that even with such a diverse cast it s just boring due to the lack of actual challenge hitting start campaign feels meaningless in my opinion if you know there s no chance of actually losing,424.2,99.0,0,Recommended,February 4,Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Jason

13596,2022 need to rewrite this review a lot in it is factually incorrect long story short a cautious recommendation but a recommendation nonetheless for now edit creative assembly has clarified that the drm was not the origin of the performance loss and there seems to have been a performance update bundled in with the champions of chaos update it s a good start and i may be switching my thumbs down to a thumbs up after investigating the performance increase some more the game is very good and i would wholeheartedly recommend if it weren t for the controversy surrounding the game s current performance according to certain media outlets www pcinvasion com the review build ran significantly better than the current build and in the case of the specific reviewer linked above lost over 50 fps on low settings on the current build of the game and on a monstrous machine at that the community is speculating that it was a large patch uploaded moments before the game went live that tanked the performance of the game possibly through the inclusion of denuvo anti temper aka anti piracy software regardless of the origins of this huge performance loss many reviewers and insiders advertised the game as running with similar performance as the previous instalment of the series currently if your pc was somewhat struggling to run total war warhammer ii you may potentially find yourself almost incapable of running the game at even below decent framerates beefier machines do not seem to be spared the performance loss although some may be able to bruteforce their way towards a better framerate if performance is a big deal to you or you possess a somewhat weaker machine i d advise you to wait until this issue is resolved unfortunately if the performance loss is indeed a result of denuvo current players of this game may find themselves in a similar situation as purchasers of doom eternal did not so long ago in doom s case was only removed after significant backlash www eurogamer net from the community yes the tech savvy among you will no doubt mention that the denuvo software packaged with doom eternal was theoretically far more intrusive worse than the denuvo software bundled with total war warhammer iii and although you might probably be right the core argument still stands that ca or sega may not feel pressured to address this issue unless there is significant public backlash similar to doom eternal to the best of my knowledge there has not yet been any communication from ca over this issue and the substantial performance loss in comparison to the review build but perhaps it is simply too early to tell if you are mindful of performance or possess a weaker machine i d advise you not to purchase the game at the present moment if you already own the game and happen to read this review i urge you to write a similar review with a big thumbs down as long as performance isn t restored to review build levels considering the amount of people that based their performance expectations on pre release videos this is borderline false advertisement if you are lazy but still wish to signal your disagreement feel free to copy and paste this review if you so desire i eagerly await the moment i can change this review to a thumbs up and promise to do so once ca takes action and resolves this issue,231.5,806.0,6,Not Recommended,"February 18, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Diablowe

13598,so far so good but i purchased the game heavily discounted i really like the main game so far but ca charge way too much for all the dlc sadly i will never play any of it because even with 50 discount the dlc prices are way too high for what they do,132.4,103.0,1,Recommended,July 4,Total War: WARHAMMER III,Exerion
13600,to say ca has had some troubling decision making is perhaps the understatement of the year however i do genuinely believe this game business aside is well worth it especially if you have the first 2 games already the diplomacy is a significant improvement with the ability to sell and buy cities being absolutely useful early on and into the mid game the races mostly are reasonably balanced with each other sorry kislev and ogres not you there is also a feature i consider significantly underrated and something i wish was in total war rome 2 and the like at times you can play co op with multiple people and all of your turns are done together huge quality of life improvement dlc wise champions of chaos are okay chaos dwarfs are a fantastic addition ogre kingdoms are at least fun if undercooked and shadows of change well i guess they went back and added some value probably should get these dlc on sale though it s a 4 stars out of 5 type deal with the major issues being largely business related but i have hundreds of hours in at this point so it s hard to say i haven t had fun modding community is fantastic highly recommend things like legendary characters and the old world for some added fun,576.2,121.0,4,Recommended,February 21,Total War: WARHAMMER III,KrugPrime

13611,2022 longtime warhammer fan over 500 hours in warhammer 2 about 50 hours in this game also 500 likes for this review thank you homies im so glad that i can help so many people decide if they want this game or not abbreviated review don t buy this game start with warhammer 2 with moral empires you ll have a much more fun time especially if you re new to the series wh3 might have potential when mortal empires comes out for it but you ll just be re buying the other games so i find it hard to justify wh3 is buggy tedious and has a campaign design that in my opinion is designed to simply not be fun additonally wh3 is currently in it s vanilla state at this time meaning that without a doubt dlc after dlc will be introduced to make this game that is currently a bit bland and unbalanced into a playable experiance if you do plan to buy this game be prepared to sink several hundred dollars in total to grab all it s dlc s detailed review wh3 s main issue is it s campaign that makes the game extremely unpleasant to play without exaggeration the second most blaring issue is that the game feels very unfinished bare bones and unbalanced which is already paving the way for overpriced dlc s as for the storyline it s bad but in a way you might not expect most games have a main quest but provide players the freedom to pursue it whenever they are ready or feel like it this is not the case with wh3 the main quest basically soaks up the entire experience which is starkly different from the other two entrees that allowed for a more sandbox empire building campaign which i think is what most people were expecting these sandbox elements of warhammer 3 are quite fun when you have the chance to play them but again the main quest line quite obtrusively prevents you from really enjoying this core of the game you re gunna get sick of this main questline very quickly basically spoilers ahead the game is a race to acquire four demon souls before the other factions you have very little capacity to stop the other factions and if you fall behind in this race there s a chance your ten hour campaign will all be for nothing several rifts into the chaos realms open up across your empire that you have to constantly close and use as teleporters to reach these demon souls where you have to fight a total of 5 quest battles each about one hour long ontop of dozens more within the realm of chaos extremely tedious if you don t close these rifts they will spawn armies and spread corruption across your empire hence being an expansionist empire like how 90 of players want to play is highly discouraged because more lands equals more rifts perhaps you re beginning to see how many like myself accuse this main quest of being obnoxious the chaos realms themselves which is where you go when you enter the rifts are even worse especially the tzeench realm which in my opinion needs to be completely redone basically you have to spend time in these four chaos realms to capture the demon soul where you have to fight dozens of repetitive battles and finally a long and tedious quest survival battle where your whole army is likely to die the longer you spend in these chaos realms the more likely you are to acquire absolutely crippling weakness to your character that s essentially impossible to avoid based on how long you have to spend in the realms oh and by the way there s zero reward for completing a chaos realm and capturing a soul none you just get a soul which is one of four steps to get to the final battle which is it s own can of worms why do you have to do all this like i said i ve never seen a game that pressures the player to pursue the main quest more than wh3 if you don t do this the other factions will get the souls first and you lose are you like me and you just wanna build an empire at your own pace explore the map fight the factions and be a strategist sorry all that matters is the main quest line you absolutely must use your main lord army too when entering these rifts you can t send a second army to make it easier seriously idk what these developers were thinking i guess creatively assembly hates their fans perhaps the biggest slap in the face is that even after you beat the final battle more on that later the rifts keep opening lololol so if you get this game you can enjoy endless rifts that need closing tedious chaos quest battles and crippling character traits because you spent too much time in the chaos realm enjoy your anxiety driven easter egg hunt they call a campagin that s what i can tell you that you will get after playing this game for a total of about 50 hours on my two accounts dont even get me started on the final battle have fun playing an hour long battle just to lose at the very end after you ve successfully defeated the main boss and have your whole army die by the endless enemy reinforcements in my game my lord bugged out too and wouldn t move during the final battle which is pretty the game is buggy but not exceptionally buggy compared to other new releases final battle is a rage fest that s way too hard and takes too long to fight it s very easy to exploit the thing to farm supplies and win that way which is arguably cheating but if you actually try to win the battle the way it was designed you re gunna be spending hours just to watch your grand army fade away even if you do win go ahead and bring a doom stack you ll still have high casualties the final battle is one of five survival battles that are cool in theory but are like an hour long each and extremely costly i really respect the attempt making a challenging survival battle but it needs alot of work if someone makes a mod where you can just turn off the entire ursun main quest entirely that d be awesome and maybe i d give it another try for now though i wouldn t advise you to get this game and that s coming from a major total war fan the story line absolutely blows is tedious and the new factions aren t very remarkable to compensate they are quite unbalanced too lots and lots of dlc s will have to come out to make this game fun so that s why i would recommend war hammer 2 with moral empires on sale you ll have an equally fun campaign experience without the most obnoxious and intrusive story line in the history of total war games to be fair it s likely ca will address the trash storyline or someone will mod it to just disable these silly rifts perhaps then the game will feel less like a rectal thermometer to play the second of the two glaring issues i have with wh3 is the greedly dlc grab this game has potential but be prepared that to get the full experiance you will almost certianly have to drop hundreds of dollars into dlc currently they re actually charging about 2 dollars for a dlc that enables blood and gore yep you just read that right the game has the word war in the title twice and the base game doesnt have any blood and gore not only that but they re seriously charging their fans for a dlc in order to enable blood and gore they re actually charging a dlc in order to access graphics i could certianly say more but i think you can make your own judgement on the moral charachter of ca and how they see their fans like most games these days unfortunately wh3 is in it s bare bones vanilla state if you buy this game you will get access to 7 playable factions one of which is chaos undivided which is just a combinaiton of the others so really it s only 6 i personally find this pretty light but its up to you if you think that s enough to justify a 60 dollar purchase also 5 7 of these factions are evil and not everyone likes to play as the baddies thats just one guy s thoughts you i hope you decide if this game is right for you,781.5,586.0,11,Not Recommended,"March 2,

13619,2022 disclaimer this review is based around week 1 impressions and may not be accurate moving forward as of july 2022 i have updated this review to fix some grammar and awkward sentences it s really kind of disappointing to see warhammer 3 in this state i m not even going to lie i was absolutely expecting it to be like this before it was released i ve been under the opinion that despite everyone saying they ve been working in this game for 5 years that they d actually probably been working on it the past 2 years if even that where to begin graphics the graphics are a downgrade from what they were before at least in my opinion things kind of have a cartoony vibe to them instead of the gritty realism look from warhammer 2 which i m not really a fan of if you look up warhammer 3 snow too bright you ll see what it was like half of the time i fought a snow battle where the ground was basically highly reflective glass that blinded me the campaign map looks pretty good but i don t really understand why they took the approach of changing up the graphics from the second game to be clear this is a personal opinion sieges as a massive dwarf player from warhammer 1 and 2 i take it as a personal insult that with all these talks of siege reworks we still don t have the ability to effectively position gunpowder units on walls or that sallying out to defend the walls while ranged units pepper the opposition isn t a tactic instead they took a look at bloons tower defense and decided that it d be a great idea to incorporate a tower defense system instead of actually overhauling sieges at all i m happy that a lot of sieges have bigger maps but the supply system feels like a massive gimmick to me we needed sieges to be redesigned from the ground up not the exact same with one new feature added minor sieges are basically just full on sieges now sure there are no walls but the same stupid tower defense game is available to the defender the minor sieges seem to offer superior defense to the main ones go listen to legendoftotalwar and other creators even they say that city sieges are more difficult than minor sieges now dedicated daemonsreworded july 2022 i have a gripe with the fact that chaos undivided has access to all daemon units i do not like that the only thing that makes the dedicated daemon factions unique are their faction effects and legendary lords 3 unique units for each dedicated faction would have sufficed and provided more incentive to anything besides undivided for more than a single run unit pathing responsiveness unit pathing is absolutely horrible again as a dwarf player i love ranged units especially gunpowder units while this has been a problem in warhammer 2 on occasion in the past in warhammer 3 it is the worst it has ever been every single time you give ranged units an attack order they do a little dance without failure this is absolutely always the case imo one of the big reasons you ll never see anyone utilize crane gunners iron hail gunners or streltsi is because they cannot reliably be attack ordered you are 100 better off just turning them and leaving them on fire at will and even then it s a 50 50 if they will shoot potentially fixed as of july 2022 couldn t tell ya unit mass unit mass is busted top tier cathay halberd infantry braced to take a charge from slaanesh horsies nope sorry the ai has the horses charge into and then pull through the infantry every time to hit your back line send out a terracotta sentinel beast to intercept a charging unit of daemonettes nope the middle of the unit gets knocked back the rest keep running like absolutely nothing just happened again right into your backline of crossbows i have 0 idea what they did involving unit mass but it needs to be tweaked substantially large entities just pass through crowds without contest when the ai is controlling them despite certain crowds being designed to take on large foes game ui who was in charge of the ui it s objectively a downgrade from warhammer 2 where before colors used to mean things now everything is red red red red red why why did they think it was a good idea to just obliterate faction unique ui and on top of it slap red onto literally everything else it just baffles me it s like they thought if they didn t do it that everyone would call it an improved clone of warhammer 2 with new races which hilariously enough is what everyone wanted just another horrible design decision the campaign don t even get me started on the realm of chaos campaign jesus whoever thought this was a good idea is really helpless then again no big deal right just because all four chaos realms are literally no fun to interact with and they couldn t even bother making each boss of the realm look like a representative of their respective god doesn t mean you have to interact with that system right if you don t like it just have a great time exploring the new map declaring war on your neighbors subjugate your enemies just like the older titles too bad 10 poopy portals just opened up across your entire empire that corrupt your land and make everyone extremely unhappy unless you manually send armies or heroes to go close them armies fight a battle heroes use gold and better yet despite the campaign implying that your advisor is the only one capable of helping you enter these realms every other major faction can do it too what a coincidence now you have a time race so even if you don t want to explore this mechanic you have to because if you don t you will literally not be allowed to play the game if an ai reaches the end and you don t take the opportunity to fight them your campaign will literally be a loss and you will be unable to play any further to top it all off ai factions will almost never close these portals meaning that if you don t own entire provinces or you have an ally they might have daemon armies wandering around as they spawn from the portals yay i believe this has been addressed as of july epilogue honestly i could go on turn times not being improved nearly at all balancing being all over the place tiny rosters compared to previous releases the game is fun you probably won t regret your purchase if you re new to the franchise but honestly even with that i really can t justify telling anyone to buy this game when warhammer 2 exists like i just can t feasibly understand why anyone would want to play whatever this is when warhammer 2 is out and is just flat out better more interesting races a bigger and more diverse map a gigantic modding community so yeah is it the worst game ever no but if i could summarize it in a single word it s disappointing i m sad that i was right about this title being trash compared to the last i m sad that they took all the advice and barely implemented any of the complaints that weren t superficial and easy to do ie diplomacy did actually improve summarygo buy warhammer 1 2 preferably on one of the many sales they have throughout the year if you are new to the franchise explore the races in the mortal empires gamemode in warhammer 2 and then pick up the dlc you find interesting when it goes on sale if you re bored to tears of warhammer 2 and want something new then buy warhammer 3 and enter it with low expectations get a lot of heroes so you can close the rifts when they open other than that the only reason i could possibly recommend for someone to get warhammer 3 is if they really love the daemons in the warhammer universe in that case you might enjoy this game a lot since daemons aren t really utilized in the previous titles see you guys when immortal empires comes out,330.0,697.0,7,Not Recommended,"March 7, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,NukaColaBomb

13635,2023 tl dr solid title still has a couple of issues but overall a huge improvement from tw warhammer 2 one of the suits said a really foolish thing and the company vastly misallocated resources changing lanes trying to tap into a market they had no business being in which probably caused the issues on launch day i d get this one on sale the i ve got time review are the c suites running the company into the ground it would appear so but aside from valve itself there are few aaa gaming industry companies who are not doing the same in 2023 they sega and or c a were dazzled by how much cod and battlefield rake in and wanted a piece of that pie what they should have done with that 50 million is convince games workshop to let them make a non lore related total war warhammer unchained or whatever title but some sort of nod to the fan favorite and very entertaining un sets from mtg with 1 randomized maps with many different world gen protocols 2 no faction has any inherit disdain for any other faction 3 random start spots with a function to let players teams start close to one another if desired only just recently gotten tw w3 and having been playing tw w2 up until that day there are a lot of improvements still no move all units separate from end turn button like shogun 2 had pros i can think of off the top of my head simultaneous turns in multiplayer 10 10 quick deals 10 10 separate button appears when ally player sends you a deal 10 10 being able to recruit allied faction s units 10 10 being able to just disable any notification you find annoying 10 10 being able to move while in ambush stance 10 10 ai doesn t spam under passage 10 10 different factions rise to great power 10 10gripes the little check box in the upper right of an army lords panel should be ignore this lord s notifications as opposed to always show this lord s notifications it s really annoying having to garrison an army somewhere then every turn click through that notification because i want to know when my other lord stopped moving it s just a bit backwards is all instead of making me click the disable notifications then any army i want to keep tabs on just let me click the army i want to ignore as i said before there is still no move all heroes lords button i would like them to move before i end my turn not both at the same time overall performance needs to be more polished lots of stutters mid battle and freezing issues from some we aren t using some obscure hardware off of wish either we all have among the 10 most common gpu s according to steam s surveys also the host of games seems to load in last by about 30 to 60 seconds every time we load up the world map not sure what that s about does my experience discount from the experiences many went through from launch day up until to a few months ago no games should be released in a far better state than this was should a c suite say the quiet part out loud also no we all know that if a company does not take in enough revenue the company dies it is up to that company to provide a product worth buying in the first place that s econ 100 stuff we are not just cash cows you milk when you want to buy another beach house or another fleet of super cars gaming for me seems to be turning from oh boy the new title came out it s gonna be great to a somber i better wait a year or 2 for the game to be actually enjoyable,496.2,121.0,6,Recommended,"October 24, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Ole Hockey Thighs

13639,it s a good game if you have a pc that can run it stably if not try warhammer 2 but you need to bare in mind the state it released in after the poor release i stopped following it but after about 9 months to a year after release was when it finally became a product that can be considered finished enough to sell aside from that they milk you dry with the dlcs and a lot of factions that aren t dlc are diminished without them so it feels like they are taking advantage of you i buckled in the end and bought them all on sales and with keys to make it bearable which encourages them even more and it frustrates me but it s hard not to that s why despite having 77 hours and likely hundreds more hours to come it really frustrates me to the point i must give it a negative review in hopes that it impacts them and they reduce dlc prices and release their products in a closer to finished state with more reasonable pricing you might say that when comparing price to hours played it is worth it but total war games are just extremely long and shouldn t be rated like that if you weigh the effort they put into the dlc it will become clearer oh and the dlcs they release can be quite poor too in quality and quantity the most recent one has just got a new patch a few days ago which makes it barely worth it if you are comparing it to previous dlcs despite still being expensive,356.7,223.0,2,Not Recommended,March 1,Total War: WARHAMMER III,Jordo

13645,2022 one step forward two steps back the predecessor to this game total war warhammer ii is a masterpiece of a game that brought thousands of new players into the series it was very flawed in the early days but had the foundations you look for in a good strategy game engaging ai distinct identities between factions and interesting and engaging mechanics at the end of its lifespan the game had ironed out all of its issues except for three main issues the simplified and repetitive major settlement battles compared to historical titles in addition to a lack of minor settlement battles clunky simplified and unclear diplomatic mechanics and the base game campaign the vortex race was unfun and a complete mess total war warhammer iii was developed with the hope that all of these issues would be resolved it was clear on launch that this would not be the case the developers learned nothing from their development of the race for the vortex and made a campaign that was somehow worse the realms of chaos removes agency from the player and gives them severe penalties for both engaging with and failing to engage with the mechanics the campaign was so bad that the top mod on the steam workshop for six months was a mod that removed the core mechanic entirely sieges did not fare much better the developers wanted survival battles with mobile tower defense game mechanics to be the central focus battles of the realms of chaos campaign and decided to port many of the same mechanics to sieges and minor settlement battles to make defending them more interesting the end result was that every settlement battle became a de facto siege battle and with the developers only creating one or two maps per race and the ai avoiding field battles players end up having most of their battles be these repetitive slow and punishing settlement battles diplomacy definitely was improved coming into the third game in the trilogy but came with notable downsides confederation already difficult in total war warhammer ii became almost impossible due to the developers reworking the mechanic and disallowing the player from using gold to influence the other faction s opinion this has actually influenced the way the ai operates in the campaign with many more factions but each faction remaining relatively small and insignificant relative to the player immortal empires the combined map including territory and factions from all three games was supposed to fix most of the issues with the game what it did was highlight many of the issues that went unnoticed for the six months prior to it coming out the developers had made many changes to the game that powered down most factions in the game justifying it by powering down the ai factions as well how many game developers draw players in to their new games by removing features and powering down the player almost all game developers try adding more features in or changing the focus of the features to differentiate them from the old mechanics total war warhammer iii is a game that is not quite ready yet and might not be as good as its predecessor for a long time i cannot recommend it now to a new player but i might change my opinion in the future if the developers make changes to improve the game experience,683.3,408.0,14,Not Recommended,"October 9, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Pharaon

13657,2023 first of all if you enjoy strategy games fantasy games or warhammer or total war titles in general you are almost sure to enjoy this game too you can easily sink hundreds of hours into total war warhammer 3 especially if you buy the right additional content i have in all three games combined around 2000 hours myself however i cannot with good conscience recommend this dumpster fire of a game unless you can find absolutely no other games to enjoy it is unfortunately rotten to its core and i don t see any way for the developers to fix it i sincerely hope future games will do a better job but this one does not deserve your time why you ask well both sides of the gameplay are just so glaringly inadequate first this game is all about capturing settlements with your armies that constitutes 90 of your campaign goals that is how you grow your empire and make more money etc so battles using said armies and for said settlements should probably be the best feature of the game right wrong some of the battles are so bad that even trying to write about them right now makes me furious the variety in battles is amazing but that causes the poorly programmed ai armies to flounder more often than not in field battles the enemy units will try to repeatedly get into new formations neither defending against your incursions nor advancing on you it is somehow less competent in higher battle difficulties once you get the hang of it more often than not you can destroy whole armies of elite troops with only a couple of units of your own as for the battles taking place in settlements i don t think i could do justice to how awful the ai becomes if you don t take my word for it i suggest you watch some gameplay online that demonstrates this debaucle there are plenty of such videos and streams the layout of the settlements also boggles the mind every infantry unit features magically appearing ladders aptly dubbed by the community butt ladders making the walls trivial the design of which are already pretty senseless by themselves inside the settlements you have fixed spots where you can build barricades and towers using some vague resource that you accumulate over time the location of those defenses can be absolutely insane like towers blocked by buildings on all sides rendering them useless the pathfinding would have been considered terrible even in a game 10 years old and the so called victory points oh my god it is just so bad so bad even the simplest tower defense flash game has better design than these battles which are not even supposed to be like tower defense battles they are supposed to reflect real siege battles in a reasonable fashion they just don t these battles were actually so badly received by the community that one update removed most settlement battles and replaced them with field battles the campaign management is also laughably stupid campaign in total war games has never been on par with other major turn based strategy titles like civilization of course because this series also supposed to feature amazing real time battles but in the warhammer series it is dumbed down lower than imaginable though some mechanics introduced in the overpriced paid dlcs are very interesting all the basic features are largely unimaginative and lazy call me crazy but i think such an essential part of a 60 dollar strategy game should be at least halfway decent without having to pay for any additional content diplomacy is mostly a joke only one deal in a hundred that you make requires any strategical thinking it is admittedly better in tww3 than in tww1 and 2 but not because it is now of a higher quality but because you are now forced to waste less time on it thanks to quick diplomacy and auto balance options most of the races from the first and second games either have not had updates to adjust them to the third game or said updates do not function properly it is clear from the lackluster skill lines of older characters missing features in the mechanics incompatible and insufficient adjustments to the new diplomacy options and other interactions between factions etc that no real thought has been put into how these factions should play together in the new game it is like comparing a well made article of clothing to one with weird patches all over it you can clearly see that the patches don t belong which makes the cloting seem very cheap and unattractive not to mention that many of the updates the game receives just do not work there have been dozens of critical issues that the developers claimed to have fixed in a patch which turned out to be blatant lies like five times in a row i refuse to believe that they do any testing before releasing these updates and there remains a buttload of important problems that they are yet to even acknowledge again you will probably have fun in this game despite all these issues and more of course you will likely get bored and fatigued by your campaign by the mid game and either start a new campaign before you get to the good stuff or stop playing for a while that is what happens to most players,611.1,399.0,26,Not Recommended,"June 12,

13665,2022 to preface i put 2 000 hours into warhammer 2 it really is my favorite game on pc and feels like a complete package even before you factor in the frankly ludicrous amount of dlc that creative assembly hurls at the consumer in the early days of tww2 s life cycle it was a little shaky and buggy but those problems got ironed out within the first year of the game s release we are almost one full year into tww3 s launch and it has been turbulent at best and a nightmare at worst i m not going to discuss realms of chaos because everyone else here already has but in short its very bad instead i m going to talk about immortal empires and for how the player is essentially punished for playing the game the way it is intended to be played one of the things about total war is that usually throughout a campaign you create an empire you build wide not tall save for a few specific factions like wood elves or now warriors of chaos in order to build wide you need to capture settlements in order to capture settlements you need to engage in settlement battles which are by in large the worst addition to the franchise the cobbled together mess that is siege mechanics in this game make for an unenjoyable experience for both attacking and defending attacking because you are forced to take attritional damage from the computer level micro management throughout the entire fight no matter how superior a force you have due to ever present siege towers that you as a player couldn t possibly afford to have at that point in a battle as defender you have to wait until you have enough supplies before you yourself can build those same siege towers to defend while the ai barrels towards you at a speed that you can t possibly hold out until they arrive both sides attacking and defending are forced to deal with the abysmal pathing of your units that will charge 120 entity units into a single file line right into units that are braced and pick them off one by one despite you giving an order to not go anywhere but a straight line in tww2 the settlement battles that defaulted to open field battles were prime and if they really wanted to incorporate some form of buildings into their siege battles they could literally take inspiration from older total war games such as attila or rome where defending and attacking settlements was both fun and felt rewarding actual proper city sieges are slightly less annoying because they re walled cities it makes sense for the city to be fortified and have defenses put in place but the battles suffer many of the same problems that settlement sieges do in that pathing is horrible attacking is an attrition contest and defending is just giving away parts of your city in order to bank enough supply points to build a hot zone inside the city it makes zero logical sense that the optimal defense strategy is to completely abandon your walls as you will never win on them diplomacy has been improved greatly in this game giving you the ability to threaten factions despite this rarely working to gain treaties or payments and more notably the abilities to not only trade territory finally and the ability to have meaningful alliances with the use of the military coordination mechanic that being said confederation is now almost obsolete as an option factions even if you control several provinces have the largest standing military and have thrown gold at joined wars with or even been allied to or traded with your suitable confederation targets will refuse to join your faction this is especially annoying for when you are trying to confederate factions that contain legendary lords you may want during your campaign i admit it was too easy in tww2 with you just being able to shower your kin in gold in order to submit their autonomy but in 3 they will only join you if they are on their last settlement that is currently under siege with no standing military force to resist their enemies the endgame scenarios for tww3 are an interesting concept on paper but in practice are just what flavor of armies do you want to fight for the remainder of your campaign most of the endgame scenarios just spawn limitless amounts of armies of whatever faction gets picked until you destroy all the related factions major factions i e destroy all major vampire counts factions for their scenario all major dwarf factions for their s etc i also wish there was still a mass chaos invasion option as the chaos invasion in tww1 and tww2 was really fun especially with tww2 s method of being able to crank the difficulty of the invasion itself it really could become a massive doomsday event where chaos engulfs the world but the scenarios in tww3 just do not fill the same niche even though i rated the game as a negative review i do like the game quite a bit but in its current state it is just not where it needs to be in order for the game to be considered complete we are almost a full year into the game

13678,2022 i m a big fan of the total war series and the warhammer games but i can t recommend the game in its current state the prologue s storytelling is incredible but if you already know how to play the game you miss out on one of the best total war cinematic stories i ve seen and get thrust into the main campaign which does an ok job but definitely doesn t compare to the prologue the gameplay loop has been changed around siege battles and in my opinion for the worse the addition of attila style defenses to minor settlements was a cool idea in theory but being able to actively place them in the middle of combat breaks the ai pathfinding and largely makes these battles unenjoyable i haven t even gotten to defend with these new features yet because the ai never attacks me anyways unless it s a doomstack vs the basic garrison so only the ai benefits from the new gameplay change when attacking it s even worse i will get my army to destroy a barricade or tower just for it to immediately queue up another one in 2 minutes the only solution is to quickly break a barricade then blob your forces through the chokepoint before it gets built again all while taking constant turret attrition from the ai which also doesn t seem cheese able with heroes juking the projectiles like in previous titles either the other solution is to cheese cavalry around the flank and capture the points behind the ai blob to destroy the turrets and win the battle that way so most of the minor settlement battles turn into auto resolves because i don t enjoy watching my tier 2 units get fatigued and ripped apart by the defenses and basic marauder spearmen one personal gripe but as the starter faction khislev is really underwhelming for me their tech tree is a jumbled mess of random technologies that all add random buffs to random units but not in any order that makes sense in the early game i want to buff my kossars but there s only 2 techs that do that melee defense and ammo reload meanwhile immediately you have access to a tech that improves snow leapord units which you can t even recruit for about 20 turns or so and only start with one when playing a specific starter lord trying to navigate the trees and find a good path that fits my playstyle is near impossible for me plus their unit roster feels off their tier 2 units feel weaker than the regular kossars you get and the fact that everyone is a hybrid of everything isn t satisfying to me the campaign pacing seems unnecessarily rushed in wh2 you could ignore the main quest and go at your own pace due to being able to send incursions to stop your rivals both leading up to and at the final battle to win thus you could expand and sandbox the way you want to and do the story once you ve built yourself up in this game the campaign seems built around discouraging the total war expansion style of gameplay expanding too fast weakens your empire to chaos gate incursions but turtling and not expanding and fighting enough lets the ai get ahead of you in the quest to get souls of all the warhammer games to cut blood and gore out for a dlc this one is the most egregious you can play as a servant of khorne on maps that have 50ft blood fountains rivers of blood skull mountains nurgle soldiers literally pooping units to death and the debauchery of slaanesh all in the base game already but heaven forbid my units draw a little blood when attacking other units it makes the combat look floaty when you zoom in and instead of getting gristly fantasy action that feels impactful units will fly back and die with 0 feedback seemingly at random it s blatant cut content for the sake of selling it in a dlc some of the ui changes make no sense but luckily most of them are changeable in the settings if you don t like them the only major complaint is the obsession with making everything red i m unable to really at a glance tell the difference between a building i m building and a building i m demolishing because they re both the same hourglass color with one minor ui tweak next to it in terms of graphics the game looks like a weird mesh between the realism of warhammer 2 and the fantasy style of three kingdoms and it doesn t mesh well with the serious tone of the story and campaign doesn t matter to me a lot though since i normally run it on medium graphics anyways but the performance is significantly worse this time around on the same settings as previous titles all in all it s an ok game buggy yes but nothing gamebreaking in my playthroughs but of the three warhammer games it s definitely my least favorite obviously when they add this roster and map to mortal empires most of those grievances will go away because i won t have to play around the chaos gameplay loop or soul fetching quests but other than trying things out and learning how the factions play i don t see myself devoting half the total hours to this game as i did wh2 or wh1,278.7,994.0,26,Not Recommended,"February 19, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Thanatos

13682,2022 i love total war games and i m an even bigger fan of the warhammer series this game functionally isn t very different from warhammer 2 but with tons of news races and some new mechanics it gives a new feel and a new way to play the best part is the more than 2 player multiplayer campaign which allows you to play with all your other friends in a big map but this is where i hate the money hungry decisions being made because you need warhammer 1 2 and 3 in order to play mortal empires which is the premier gamemode and the one where you can have the most fun with your friends i already paid 60 for a game and i even own the others but the fact that you need to dish out another 50 80 depending on when you buy them in order to use a part of the game that should just come with it ruins it,93.8,212.0,9,Not Recommended,"December 23, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"MilkMeHarder

13686,been playing tww for a while now got like 3000 hrs on tw2 and i ve got to say since the release of tw3 its been a bumpy road with pretty much every decision ca made being focused on anti fun and playing the game the way they want you to however the thrones of decay brought a breath of fresh air to the game with actually interesting new ll s and mechanics but unfortunately as we are learning more and more recently it seems these good changes were actually unintended as ca has come rushing in to save the day with patch 5 1 removing a huge amount of fun from the game such as trait nerfs or straight up removals and worst of all some of these nerfs aren t even to the new introduced content such as the huge nerfs to vlad and malus who have been around for years vlad all the way back in tw1 and malus was released in tw2 back in 2019 these 2 characters have served as regional powerhouses in their respective areas and have provided some much need challenge to the early game especially since in tw3 campaign is pretty much over after the first 30 turns these massive changes to the single player experience in a mainly single player focused game truly show that ca actually has no clue how any of their fans actually feel about the franchise and they are actively trying to remove difficulty even to the hardest difficulties to make the game more beginner friendly as they seem to only care about new players ca is truly showing us now where their priorities are and that is getting as many people as possible to buy the game dlc and they have absolutely zero interest in long time retention of players tw3 was originally going to be a like 10 year life cycle with how well tw2 did and after soc and the most recent patch i would be very surprised if they are still supporting this game in 2 years time tl dr game has been progressively getting worse over the last few years everytime something good is added ca turns around and patches it out saying stop that no fun allowed here these days people enjoy these games not because of ca s updates but in spite of them,981.3,271.0,4,Not Recommended,June 25,Total War: WARHAMMER III,Vesuvante

13695,2023 product received for free i ve been playing total war games since over two decades starting with medieval 1 which my cousin hugo gave me when i was a student a poisoned gift which did a lot of harm to my studies but i loved it the series has evolved a great deal over the years the 2d sprites of shogun and medieval 1 were replaced by animated 3d units from rome 1 on medieval 2 increased the tactical depth through an amazing diversity of units empire brought in naval battles napoleon multiplayer campaigns shogun 2 character skill trees rome 2 added the province system and combined land naval battles it also introduced us to the current business model liveops games marked by buggy launches but polished over time and enriched by tons of free and paid content this is true for tww3 attila opened the door to nomadic hordes three kingdoms improved diplomacy troy innovated with a resource bartering economy and the amazon unit upgrade system the warhammer trilogy dramatically increased the playstyle variety with unique mechanics per faction its final chapter adds a fair share of features units from allied factions can be recruited through outposts entire armies from allied factions can be borrowed through diplomacy immortal empires is a sandbox megamap with an immense replay value as nearly 300 factions fight over 550 regions region trading is back a neat tool to manage your allies the recently added chaos dwarfs dlc represent a challenge to the usual way to play and a step further in asymmetry since they ignore standard mechanics such as growth but come with their own economic and tactical complexities plenty of quality of life from tooltips and ui colour schemes to endgame scenario settingsbuilding these features on top of the solid foundations of the tw series has resulted in a deep and gripping game many strategic and tactical layers dozens of highly diverse factions an impossibly large amount of quality content with more planned on the roadmap the issues which plagued the launch such as the so called antiplayer bias have been fixed as a strategy gamer and fan of warhammer fantasy all i need is more spare time to indulge in it as the admin of turn based tactics i m lucky to have received a free copy from creative assembly however warhammer has always been a pricey hobby and clearly this digital adaptation is no exception it begs to be installed on an ssd to cut on the loading time the base game is more expensive than most strategy titles and by most i mean gary grigsby s war in the east and then you may want to pick some of the many dlcs of the trilogy to complete the rosters of your favourite factions gamers on a budget should wait for a sale on the bright side there are tons of free units and features to get from the steam workshop thanks to a thriving mod community,121.2,91.0,5,Recommended,"May 27, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Saint Scylla

13696,2023 i want to recommend this game i do i enjoyed wh2 a lot and have some fun moments in wh3 but there are just stupid problems in this game considering it is a direct successor to wh2 and design choices that are just not good there are still bugs in the game well over a year after release ranged units have a hard time firing at targets correctly armies can get stuck on agents and be frozen indefinitely random crashes can happen in battle maps several unit descriptions just don t even match what they actually do are functionally the ai are brain dead during sieges and i think the main settlement sieges are the worst in any total war game since empire the defender is actually worse off than the attacker with the new capture point system defenses don t work all that well walls are still worthless the ai can t defend their settlements for it is such an epic fail and makes sieges just a pain on both ends i hate them several of the older races empire dwarves dark elves especially just feel bland now in immortal empires the empires mechanics are terrible cathay isn t a finished race bretonnia needs attention realms of chaos is a bad campaign pure and simple it just isn t all that good id welcome arguments to the contrary but it wasn t well executed for the original characters on release and was insulting that they released wh3 with the game being unfinished immortal empires wasn t out yet and cathay wasn t finished and still doesn t feel finished the new chaos dwarves feel much more fleshed out than they do ca is half assing a lot of their content it is infuriating to see they are capable of doing a much better job and i cannot recommend any product from them in good faith while they keep putting out games dlcs and other updates that just aren t up to snuff unfinished unpolished untested and they expect us to accept it for what it is test it for them and wait for months to have proper changes by which point we ve moved on to the next paid title they ve released where they can take in more money,180.7,141.0,1,Not Recommended,"July 7, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Lone Wanderer

13715,2022 this is a good game not a great game not a bad game but certainly a good game 7 factions and a handful of decent legendary lords to give you a sense of how to play the same sure the realms of chaos main story line could be annoying to deal with after a while but you re also getting to visit the realms of chaos what s not to like about that and if the main story line is still scaring you away don t worry each new dlc released up to this point has it s own narrative that takes advantage of the realms of chaos map but doesn t immediately force you to jump through another giant portal every 10 turns some of the stand alone stories and their content are actually really great look at champions of chaos 4 legendary lords each competing for the ultimate prize in a thunder dome battle to risk it all or take it all with their own unique blend of one of the 4 chaos god factions mixed in with the more standard chaos warrior faction and that dlc is at the asking price of about 15 20 unlike the 25 that we re seeing these days and if you re wanting to get deep into the lore then try out the immortal empires campaign which is completely free if you buy this game imagine having a game that spans the entire earth and every other county or country is run by a lord or a character with compelling story amazing abilities powerful faction mechanics and they re all competing or assisting each in creating the biggest fantasy empires you ve never heard about join the empire and lead the sons of sigmar against the horrors that threaten humanity or join one of those horrors and destroy the empire now granted you will have to get the other two games and dlc to experience all of that content but i genuinely think that it s worth your time and money heck there s even a lot of people out there on the internet who ve come up with all kinds of guides dlc buying guides tier lists recommendations for new players and everything you could ask for as a new player trying to jump into the game honestly even with the recent controversy going on i will confess that the greed of the company does hurt me to see and it certainly shouldn t be allowed to keep on going like it has but that shouldn t stop you from buying this game or anything related to this trilogy if you want to a lot of the dlc is more reasonably priced and if the public has their way we ll either see those newer dlc prices drop or double in quality to match that price so join us if you like it s always better to have more players and even with the concerning events going on surrounding the game right now this is still a great trilogy and worth your time and money if you are willing to pour the time into it,253.7,229.0,10,Recommended,"July 16, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Mr. Bad Wolf
13716,2022 as of now total war warhammer iii does not exactly stand on it s own compared to total war warhammer ii due to a lack of content owing to its current infancy and lack of expansive addons and updates seen in warhammer ii this likely would not be the case if it shipped with mortal empires on day one and did not elect to release without add the very least a skin and bones placeholder version of the chaos dwarves instead using orks as a placeholder the game itself runs somewhat poorly it is not well optimized however this can be mitigated by running at a decreased resolution and lowered textures this however is entirely temporary and shouldn t factor into your interest but only your interest immediately unless you re a huge fan of kislev cathay chaos or the ogre kingdoms i would highly suggest delaying your purchase until the future when there is more content to be had as your time will likely be better spent in warhammer ii where you will still have access to the content from warhammer i and ii that being said chaos is an extremely well designed faction from a gameplay standpoint and has some unique mechanics that stand out from anything else creative assembly has ever made having tried out the first several turns of most factions by now i can safely but unfortunately say that the legion of chaos is by far my favorite which is unfortunate to me because i was mostly looking forward to the ogre kingdoms as for the campaign it is about as sandboxy as vortex was but with a new mechanic involving the invasion of each realm of chaos to slay a daemon prince as opposed to completing rituals as in warhammer ii i personally enjoy it lastly the minor settlements and siege battles i am not as adverse to the change as other people are while the supply system is bizarre at best i m not convinced that it is entirely detrimental to gameplay after playing a few rounds however i would appreciate a setting to be able to disable this mechanic and return to the old design i do enjoy the designs of the maps though and i really like the new survival mode for custom battles at it s current state i would suggest waiting for further updates unless you re a die hard fan of total war fantasy or any of the races in warhammer iii barring of course chaos dwarves i run an old am3 cpu 8gb of ddr3 ram and a gtx 1050ti which is an extremely obsolete setup for this game however after twiddling with the settings im able to run the game at about 57fps which is tolerable to me it is possible for me to gain almost 100fps at very low settings but the blurriness strains my eyes i d give it about a 7 10 right now you might enjoy it conditionally but i wouldn t recommend it to everyone,191.9,149.0,5,Recommended,"February 18, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Conan

13725,2022 as you ve probably noticed some people have really enjoyed this game and others have not i fall into the category of one who doesn t mind the realm of chaos campaign that many others despise yes at times it can be annoying but as someone who has plays the vortex campaign in total war warhammer 2 i m quite used to this type of campaign and don t need to wait for immortal empires to come out some pros to the game decent faction selection base game has 9 legendary lords from 7 different factions map is very large and allows for diversity in what enemies and friends you come across individual faction mechanics for every faction that adds some flavor to each one skarbrand the exiled punting most characters across the map graphics are pretty good especially on higher settings modding community is wonderful cons immortal empires isn t out yet less sandbox ish for now as you are kind of forced into playing the souls race unless you have a mod that turns it off limited units as of now for each faction especially the daemonic factions cannot play as the warhammer one and two races this doesn t faze me but i know it affects a lot of people that fancy playing the empire for the 50th time anti player bias still is strong but much better than what it was at release back in february of 2022 conclusion personally i think the game is worth it and it is only going to get better as we progress further into the year if you are waiting for immortal empires then i would hold off until later this year when the beta gets set up for that if you really want to try out new factions like cathay which is new ish to lore and the daemons then i would recommend getting this game i hope this helps you all make a good decision,593.4,209.0,12,Recommended,"May 30, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,jchambers16
13726,2022 any fun i m having with this game tends to be despite the game rather than because of the game needs tune up for unit responsiveness in battles and pathing sick of units deciding that the contested ladder looks so much faster than the wide open unblocked gate and i absolutely 100 orders a unit to run around in a circle for the purposes of them just skipping the entire shift clicked route and decided that actually they were just going to count it all as completed and get completely deleted by artillery they also still haven t really fixed siege battles walls tend to be kinda barren and it just feels wrong still for a setting that is known for some extremely well defended cities it would be good if there were fallback positions or something that were consistently viable across the various walled maps ai also cheats or is given mechanical cheats like how you often aren t allowed a retreat zone from ambushes the retreat zone exists outside the map and is inaccessible so fun and engaging when skaven get to paint themselves purple as you watch and then cut your limbs off with no reinforcements so engaging great design offensive ambushes in general are bad mechanics that have zero counterplay aside from having a good enough individual army to just win every battle after you watch the completely meaningless unskippable 15 second cutscene of your leader walking which is so interesting when you have to deal with another stupid rat ambush performance is honestly terrible maxing out a 3070ti on high at 1440p not quite 60fps on the campaign map the same campaign map where zone edge borders are aliased when there s corruption like it s 2005 i don t have ridiculous standards but i do expect some quality of life from the third game i should not be ragequitting from bs every session after getting sick of clawing for every shred of satisfaction not to mention the questionable notion of campaign difficulty impacting auto resolve instead of the battle difficulty setting surely if auto resolve is meant to represent your battles the difficulty thereof should be what controls it rather than wanting diplomacy map blobbing and economy to be more challenging bug are a thing i have a campaign where the quest battle didn t spawn and can t be teleported to ai also appears to play by different movement rules so they kinda just teleport behind you for a fun and engaging game of whack a mole with march stance they also like to do nonsense double jeopardy battles where they ll assault and lose then immediately re attack and this is mechanically bs because defender units get completely wiped out when they break but attacker units do not it makes some sense because half the time defender units run out into enemy territory but that s also nonsense because there s a keep to retreat to and because the chain of nonsense isn t quite over yet this game causes frequent bluescreens about 1 every ten hours of playtime it s only this game and it happens exactly when i click an in game button and there s this weird thing where ca required the first two games for a good chunk of the immortal empires content but also still absolutely 100 insists they re worth the full aaa 60 pricetag for reasons re review all of the same hold but mods do improve it but mods can only do so much and cant do anything at all about how your units have a mind of their own and or ears full of cotton might as well build a monstrous infantry doomstack because every unit behaves like them it also disables all your mods every time the game updates so you better write down which ones you had on and for some reason fullscreen is just two or three pixels short i was hoping it d go away but no amount of debugging and troubleshooting actually made the game not have strange bugged pixels in the lower left and a few columns along the right no other game including the previous two games does this so it s just completely baffling,190.6,195.0,8,Not Recommended,"September 28, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Professional Pat

13729,2023 the replayability on this game is astounding and its really fun to play with friends now buying all the requisite base games is costly and all the skaven related dlc unless you are getting it on a steam sale but that s nothing new earlier this year ca released a dlc called forge of the chaos dwarves an all new race with neat new mechanics and units consisting of 3 legendary lords it was well received by basically all and launched with minimal or next to 0 issues it is by far one of my fav factions to play personally it cost 25 now ca s executives and board are releasing a lord pack shadows of change and it simply doesn t stack up based on the value proposition that they themselves have established with the chaos dwarves dlc shadows is the same price but includes no new races and no revolution in mechanics and very few new units apparently the kislev lord is also bugged to the point of unplayability i m not getting shadows of change because it doesn t live up to the value proposition that ca itself established earlier this year total war is ca s biggest property but instead of training their strengths by giving tw warhammer the time and attention the game needs the executives and board are clearly plowing total war profits into their derivative fort valerant clone and inevitable failure of a game called hyenas pathetic ca executives and board members are clearly a bunch of out of touch hacks who know nothing of business do they not know that chasing after other audiences to the detriment of your core products has not worked for any entertainment company from modern cinema writ large to netflix to disney are they paying attention do they think they are better positioned then multi billion dollar entertainment companies who have failed at the same gamble games workshop needs to revisit this partnership and read the ca board the riot act or else risk the poisoning of a massive on ramp to gw s own ip so i come back to what i said in the first line of this review the replayability of this game is amazing therefore i don t need this new crap dlc to make and to keep this game fun for me and my friends so i won t be buying anything from ca at least until their garbage secondary product hyenas launches and subsequently fails,384.5,148.0,19,Recommended,"August 31, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Firestryke2

13736,2022 only tech issue i had was some blurriness which was resolved by changing anti alias method the new factions are good fun been getting lots of fun out of it and there are many many improvements over wh2 overall to the point that i wouldn t be able to go back if i wanted to alliances quick diplomacy reinforcement timers actual settlements settlement trading ect but the realm of chaos campaign itself is very annoying you ll get rifts spawning every 30 turns that spew out armies agents and corruption and you get no rewards when doing the main story which leaves you little incentive to do so a second or third time the optimal way to win is just capture a province or two and just end turn until you get the rifts because you are penalised if you try to expand the only way to deal with rifts en masse is to spam heros and sit them at the rift spawns which is incredibly tedious and closing each rift costs 1500 gold if you do it this way so it gets quite expensive to add to this the ai is terrible at dealing with rifts to the point that the entire map except your territory becomes the chaos wastes making it even more tedious due to attrition really keen on mortal empires but overall it s still a massive improvement just not sure why they went for such a tedious and unrewarding main campaign at least i could ignore the vortex,840.1,32.0,1,Recommended,"February 28, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Verdiumm

13745,2022 this is a bit of a sad review because it s nearly an incredibly good game nearly every aspect of the game is far improved on warhammer 1 and 2 but with a few very noteable downgrades that ruin the experience entirely because of this i ll only list my complaints uithe ui was intentionally downgraded for some reason in tw1 and tw2 it was much clearer what was build built and destroyed recruited and disbanded because it was highlighted in green or red for some reason everything in this game is red possibly to try and distinguish itself from the other games but as a result its a lot less readable performancefor me performance is okayish looks great but the benchmarks for the prerelease had much much higher frames they were slashed significantly for release some even by half and many are speculating denuvo is the causecrashesi have completed one campaign and i have crashed easily 40 times in 20 hours of play most of this is only when you tab out but with a multi monitor set up its extremely unstable and more than half of those crashes resulted in me having to restart my pc completely campaignthis part is the most fixable but also the most egregious issue with the game while nearly every part of the campaign mechanics and battles is extremely high quality and fun the main campaign the realms of chaos is not fun it seems specifically designed to not be fun why the game will spawn portals all over the map which cause massive corruption spread and eventually spawn doomstacks that come out and roam around they can either be killed with an army theyre defended by 20 units or deleted for a fee of 1500 with an agent this means around turn 150 i had 15 of these portals in my lands playing whack a mole for them all is extremely time consuming boring and punishing it dictates how you play entirely the realms themselves are even worse you have to enter 4 to win the game they re extremely time consuming and offer no rewards one rewards you essentially for failing it others give you some minor stuff rarely but its not really a reward in fact completing them punishes you by spawning more and more enemies in the world you need to complete this for the victory but its so agonising heres what you have to do for all 4 slaaneshtake 10 or so turns just walking through portals at the end kill a big boss at any time if you leave you get given massive rewards the most thematic and cool of all of them but still a pain similar fight to khorne mentioned later khornekinda agony kill things capture a thing then defend it repeat three times takes a very long time 1 2 hours and really burns you out its really not clear where enemies will come from and you can get wiped easily by not deploying properlynurgleyou re in a plane that you constantly take damage in have to walk around and pick up gifts to survive longer then big fight at the end takes a long time but the fastest and most punishing of the 4tzeenchi don t know who made this place but thematically its on point a literal confusing hellscape you get lost and tormented in its completely rng boring and frustrating all 4 realms everything you interact with essentially takes your turn away its made even worse where in this realm you have to interact with teleporters that may or may not take you where you want to go basically its a good game but has a handful of smaller issues but all of that is overshadowed by the mammoth that is the campaign its so poorly designed anti fun and frustrating i would never recommend it to anyone pick it up when they rework remove it or when they add immortal empires realms of chaos is not worth your time,191.1,60.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 18, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,瓜老外 Steve

13751,i can t recommend this tldr if you haven t bought this game already don t just stick with tww2 it works better and the new factions aren t worth it with over 2 thousand hours in the second game and a little over two hundred in the first as well as every dlc ca has put out for them this game makes me done with the total war warhammer games i ve played the ice queen the chaos dwarves the northern provinces and the shockingly obese and before i got the game on steam i played on game pass where i finished off a prince of chaos and skarbrand campaign so i ve touched on all the new factions the new order factions are meh and the new chaos factions are really fun but the main issue is the ai the ai was almost a deal breaker in tww2 they make really terrible decisions don t know how to correctly build settlements or defend their territory and still prioritize the player which would be fine if they could take other threats into account i had grimgor declare war on me while having his capitol threatened by kholek suneater i was able to ambush one army take out the other by leaving someone to defend my settlement and after i took five of his settlements kohlek came in and wiped him out why is the ai bad enough to let this happen the battle ai hasn t been fixed either units sometimes refuse to stay in formation they sometimes will not go where you tell them to if any units are in contact they tend to ignore most of your orders to fight the unit they re in contact with which is terrible news for cavalry the ranged ai got much worse as they sometimes just won t fire even with clear line of sight and within range at one point i had an artillery unit stop firing at a target that hadn t moved when i tried to make it fire at that target again they decided they needed to rush it and other times they will just be standing idle after you gave them and order to attack a unit that is not fleeing or broken just moving away the enemy ai for sieges was never fixed and is still extremely easy and i ve broken the enemy ai a few times like when i was fighting zombies and they didn t know how to line up so they just kept moving back and forth on their line while i peppered them with artillery shots it went on like that till i was out of aty ammo then rushed in and they barely fought back it s still not worth it to make any allies until you ve cleaned out most of the potential enemies around you the benefit of being able to build their units is kinda cool but the downside of being at war with everyone they are at war with outweighs it by a good bit they did add the ability to trade land so that s an awesome change you no longer have to sit with one useless settlement in a region and can now gift that settlement to a faction for a relations boost nice they won t use it to improve themselves in any way because again the ai can t build settlements but it was still a great addition so yeah it doesn t improve anything and the new factions aren t worth it i would say wait for a fix but i ve been waiting two years and i m done waiting,314.7,272.0,6,Not Recommended,January 27,Total War: WARHAMMER III,Felix Nix

13758,2022 i love total war warhammer 2 and have played it for many hours nevertheless it has some well known weaknesses that bothered me a lot especially in the long run e g limited diplomacy little varied battles boring sieges with disadvantages for the defenders gate bug etc i ve put about 18h into the game so far starting a multiplayer and single player campaign with kislev completing the prologue and briefly starting a multiplayer campaign with cathay based on these experiences i ll evaluate the things i ve experienced so far i think it s worth noting that ca has taken player feedback to heart to address many of the issues from the previous two games and to make the game even bigger and more varied i really feel bad for the developers because i recognize a lot of very good intentions and efforts but in its current state the game is unplayable for me and unfortunately this includes many issues that probably can t be easily fixed but are very fundamentally rooted in the game s architecture i hope they didn t mess up with this as the game had a great potential so first the positive things that really improve the game experience for me diplomacy is not a complete revolution but it is much more transparent than before the menu navigation is not optimal especially regarding outposts etc but i think that s a matter of getting used to it i would also like additional transparency concerning the costs of diplomatic actions depending on the general relationship with the faction i like the artwork of the world map and of the new factions small highlights are the descriptions of certain points on the map which fills the whole thing with even more warhammer feeling and story the ui for the heroes and commanders is clearer and somewhat more user friendly especially for followers i also love that this has been expanded further and there are now item sets and you can recycle items for gold or to create new items i had always missed that before the simultaneous turns in multiplayer allow for a completely new gameplay experience this is really great the fact that you can let others control parts of your army is really cool as is the ability to hire allied factions in armies and outposts neutral i didn t experience any major issues with performance on my rather old pc i can only play it on medium settings high to ultra settings in its predecessor but it runs smoothly here for the most part i can t currently evaluate the campaign mechanics as i haven t progressed far enough for that the chaos portals however are currently a bit annoying it also feels like there is always a lot of time pressure right from the start and now for the weaknesses by far the biggest problem for me are the minor settlement battles i was really looking forward to this since there was a lack of variety in the predecessor but ca missed the target the maps are huge and look great but currently they are unplayable there are so many bottlenecks and narrow alleys that units can t be positioned there are always blobs that completely block each other any kind of formation is impossible ranged units can barely be positioned and it s completely unclear when they will or will not have a clear field of fire at all 90 of the time their line of fire is blocked this is also related to the next point which is currently gamebreaking for me the pathfinding attack commands and also auto attacks of units are often broken especially in minor settlement battles units regularly lose their paths and targets yes i disbaled the guard mode sometimes they suddenly don t attack enemies anymore even if they are right in front of them for ranged units this is so severe that it becomes unplayable when barricades are suddenly set up and towers which are currently a bit too strong in my opinion keep shooting at the blobs the frustration is unbelievable in addition units block each other excessively often which makes the whole thing even crazier also other players experienced these problems the issue is discussed in the total war forum at the total war website further what i don t like so far about kislev and what makes the point above even worse are the many hybrid units with these you can actually only go to close combat because the change between ranged and close combat in the cities does not work at all also the units lose their appeal when they are all hybrid the basic hybrid units don t feel any different than basic archers or ranged units from other factions in tw w2 high elves archers also engaged in melee with their swords and they were not labeled as hybrid before overall the minor and major settlement battles feel very tedious and slow on the really huge maps of course this is amplified by the points mentioned above the limitation of the camera s zoom is also terrible here as you can only see rather small parts of the map and worst of all it feels like 70 80 of my battles so far are minor settlement battles maybe 10 sieges of major settlements at the same time i don t think that the supply system has improved player experience in the classic siege battles at the walls the defenders are still relatively helpless especially when it comes to enemy fire and destroying the walls also i think i ve already experienced the old familiar gate bug once here a few bug fixes and some changes to the gate and wall mechanics would probably have been much better my conclusion the developers have listened to the fans and implemented some things that improve the game enormously compared to its predecessor i was fortunately not affected by the performance problems either nevertheless the problems regarding the game mechanics in the battles are game breaking for me not only do they completely kill the fun of the game they also lead to extremely poor battle outcomes even with the greatest superiority which increases the frustration even more the developers really need to fix the pathfinding and attacks otherwise it remains unplayable for me unfortunately even the mortal empires map won t change that poor developers nice ideas some good intentions but still a long long way to go however if these points are eventually fixed in one way or another and the sandbox campaign on the large combined map comes along then this game in combination with part one and two could make video game

13776,2022 let me start by saying the game is good if you buy this game you most likely will enjoy your first campaign if you enjoyed your first vortex campaign from game 2 they have added a bunch of qol improvements and changes that i find pleasing the negative reviews are due to a few things which are legitimate like the bugs the lack of replayability and comparisons of this brand new game to the masterpiece that was the second game of the trilogy i felt the need to leave this review to give greater context to the negative reviews people are comparing this brand new game to game 2 which has had years of tweaks and dlc to flesh it out to it s greatest potential game 3 is brand new no dlc other than the day 1 pre order bonus no mortal empires fresh bugs etc it is a bit unfair to compared game 3 at launch to game 2 at it s peak game 2 at launch did not have mortal empires and only had a fraction of the playable races lords available as they do now in time game 3 will likely surpass the popularity of 2 but it will take time for the devs to add in immortal empires sandbox mode new lords factions and patch bugs i do think this game was the best of the 3 on release day but wh2 with all the dlc and updates is currently the superior product unless you ve played it to death and are bored of playing the warhammer games rarely ever go on sale so i would suggest picking it up and enjoying a campaign or two now and when you get bored put it down until they come out with new updates especially the immortal empires update which is coming later this year that should add a bunch of replayability that currently isn t here for a lot of people who dislike the souls race and don t feel like installing any mods to remove that objective from the game the current factions already offer up a bunch of differing campaign mechanics to keep things fresh for me personally but your mileage may vary this game gets two thumbs up from me because i know it will get better over time like the first and second games did and i had fun with what they released on day 1,156.3,43.0,4,Recommended,"June 5, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Apollo

13778,2023 i bought the game on sale definitely not worth the full price the dlc price is outrageous i like the game despite it s flaws it has the worst ai in almost any game i have ever played armies running back and forth between their own settlements for 50 turns enemies ignoring 10 other factions they are at war with to attack you allies that do nothing except try and drag you into every war possible now neck and neck with paradox with the most disgusting dlc policy in gaming need to take a good hard look at baldurs gate 3 on delivering excellent complete games instead of focusing on greed,202.8,128.0,3,Recommended,"October 3, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Chicane
13779,this is the single most exploitative anti consumer game i have ever played you can see that there is 300 dollars or something like that of dlc but they don t tell you about the various random hoops free dlc will have you jump through to get them and ones that are marked as free in the battlemode roster page are often not the most egregious example i just discovered being krell requires the purchase of warhammer 1 meaning a single subfaction of the vampire counts effectively costs 60 dollars because it needs warhammer 1 to summon the main unique aspect of the faction you get access to other things with the purchase of warhammer 1 but krell is all you get for vampire counts the game itself is incredibly fun its just genuinely if you are poor you cannot play a number of the factions tl dr the real cost off all the dlc is closer to 400 cause you also need to buy warhammer 1 and 2 to get all of the content and said content is sectioned in as anti consumer way a possible,639.9,157.0,12,Not Recommended,September 1,Total War: WARHAMMER III,Pinochet gaming

13794,2023 what is the current status of tww iii 3 0 quite simple to describe shiny on the outside and rotten to the core but you have to take a closer look to see it which apparently not many are capable of to be honest i have no problem with the price for me it s about something completely different for more than 5 months the numerous bugs haven t really changed to the better at all in just under 5 hours with the new patch i ve seen the same problems even worsened in some cases especially in sieges still invisible enemies the ai with completely stupid deployment in cities ungrim ironfists journeys end still doesn t work waaagh of orc ai factions in battles still not working pathfinding in sieges still incredibly bad still also it seems the performance on the campaign map has worsened again movement of the vampirates seems buggy also the rites of the vampirates frigg i don t want to list everything the dlc looks really good and great but if you put more resources into new stuff like the intel thing instead of fixing the old and known problems bugs then i don t see the point in buying the dlc in fact i won t be buying any more dlc until something improves in terms of the endless bugs in my case the new stuff is not relevant right now i encourage everyone here to reconsider their buying habits for god s sake stop pre ordering everything that s one of the reasons why the quality is getting worse every year ca get your act together or this will be an even bigger than it already is as long as nothing changes i will not recommend the game edit as of today 08 17 2023 nothing has fundamentally changed and today s official statement from ca i guess i ll wait for the new patch 4 0 before updating the review,365.6,142.0,2,Not Recommended,"April 27, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Patersuende

13815,2023 setting aside the politics of whats going on at ca and dlc cost etc etc ill get to that at the end i simply don t like warhammer 3 as much as warhammer 2 now perhaps its nostalgia and i didn t like warhammer 2 as much as the first game until the larger map with warhammer 1 factions came out i think i m generally just less interested in all the demons and the factions which aren t demons don t excite me as much and adding the full map didn t ignite the passion to play the game more for me this time around it s a solid game and will provide entertainment my game play hasn t really been effected by bugs etc i was just really hyped and i don t like it as much as i thought i would end of as for the politics like almost everything in life the capacity for profit and the satisfaction of shareholders is more important than the end user or customer i have accepted it as the norm with almost every other aspect of life so why not gaming too there is no solution other than bloody revolution off with their heads and the end of capitalism since a civil uprising of the gamer seems unlikely a high percentage are too high to be bothered i guess ill just have to deal with being ripped off and such is life in 2023 it seems if you want this to change vote for someone who wants more even wealth distribution in society which i didn t as i was too busy playing warhammer 2 if you don t do that its hard to have the moral high ground to complain,220.7,99.0,2,Not Recommended,"October 19, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Suddy0169

13818,2022 for reference i have 1500ish hours in tw w2campaign maybe i m in the minority but i actually really like the campaign and changes to siege battles i like how the focus isn t on expanding but on diplomacy and making the right strategic choices at the right time do you go for the soul yourself or thwart the faction in the lead thematically and mechanically i find it superior to the vortex rifts offer up an interesting shake up that makes protecting your inner sanctum of settlements actually worthwhile i loved defending against demonic armies with a t3 defensive garrison and leveraging the reworked siege mechanics to win battles i would have been crushed in however i did find the survival battles to be extremely mentally fatiguing by wave 3 i lost all motivation to continue and just minimized the game overnight luckily you can auto resolve them without much consequence if they were 2 waves i think it would be just right changes changes to diplomacy are extremely welcome the new system is a complete improvement in my opinion alliances are actually worth having and the complex network of alliances between other factions means you need to tread carefully when expanding this is a notably different experience than warhammer 2 where i just kept expanding thoughtlessly the supply lines rework is great and alleviates the reliance on doomstacks in warhammer 2 i had 1 army for as long as i could possibly manage now the threshold is much lower to make a smaller secondary force a host of user interface improvements are present as well the unit and spell encyclopedia is convenient to use and helps make informed decisions spells actually have stats showing damage and armor piercing values no more guessing how good magic is the quick deal feature on diplomacy is a god send and eliminates tedium if you fight battles in a row with the same army the game remembers your deployment from the previous battle and saves you alot of time hero and lord traits for the most part are heavily nerfed from warhammer 2 which is something i prefer since it doesn t promote save scumming or a sense of loss when you don t get a good trait issues there are numerous experience ruining bugs though like disbanding lords doesn t reduce upkeep docked ranged units don t fire etc luckily i have a high end pc but i have to turn resolution down and externally limit the fps to keep my gpu from melting unit pathing is pretty bad it s especially awful with larger units especially ogres the chaos faction rosters are underwhelming extremely fun to use and a nice change of pace but very lacking in variety especially compared to warhammer 2 races who have had multiple dlc s of unit addons and regiments of renown all that said with the sure to be upcoming patches dlc and immortal empires i am positive that there will be nothing to complain about,423.2,23.0,0,Recommended,"February 22, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Stuck Step Brother

13822,2022 total war warhammer iii was one of the most anticipated games for me in the last years with over 1500 h spent in its predecessor i knew already that this game would be a must have for me now i want to give my detailed review about the recently released last part of the trilogy build 1 0 0 i want to add that i solely focus on the campaign side of the game and not on custom battles also many points are meant as a comparision to total war warhammer ii positive prologue campaign the prologue campaign is very well made it introduces the player to the story while explaining all the necessary basics and enables complete newcomers a good start into the series unique races all of the new races not only look extremely unique but also feature their own playstyle each with its own advantages and disadvantages diplomacy inspired by total war three kingdoms the new diplomacy system is now way more comprehensible for the player and offers new possibilities like the trading of settlements finally it is possible to declare raiding and trespassing factions on your territory war while breaking existing non aggression pacts and trade agreements without receiving a diplomatic penalty military alliances you can now see on the campaign map where your military allies plan to go and thanks to the new outpost mechanic you can help your allies to defend their major settlements as well as recruit some of their units to enhance your own roster the ai is also able to use this system which causes very interesting army compositions battle maps the new battle maps are gigantic and extremely versatile land battles minor settlement battles and siege battles feel now way more epic the ai is also able to handle itself on the huge battlefields though this layout also puts a heavy focus on fast units and artillery furthermore reinforcements won t join the battle immediately instead it can be determined where they should spawn enabling more tactical planning defensive supplies and capture points the idea for the defender to construct barricades and towers with defensive supplies adds lots of variety to the battles on the other hand the attacker gets additional buffs for capturing certain points on the map to gain momentum as a compensation items and ancillaries low quality equipment can be fused or transformed into gold if not needed this helps to get rid of unwanted items and to keep the character window a bit cleaner graphics the graphics are simply stunning lots of love and effort was put into the units and the environment from the blossoming lands of grand cathay up to the surreal realms of chaos the visual aspect of the game is outstanding compared to total war warhammer 2 the overall setting is a bit more grim which fits the narrative difficulty playing on very hard very hard the campaign is challenging but not to the extent where it starts to get frustrating ogres one of the most anticipated and epic races finally made it into the game neutral the realms of chaos campaign the campaign map is nicely made it really feels like you have to race against the other factions though when entering the chaos realms you have to spend lots of ressources time and troops while gaining nothing in return in the end there should definitely be some additional benefits for defeating the 4 demon princes because you have to invest a lot to do so so currently the game punishes you for progressing the story all in all it is still a big step forward compared to the eye of the vortex campaign of total war warhammer ii optimization the optimization of the game is currently in an acceptable state the battles themselves are very smooth and load quickly but on the campaign map you will sometimes encounter fps drops when finishing starting a turn in 15 hours of gameplay i had only 1 ctd negative auto resolve auto resolve is completely unbalanced on higher difficulties especially on higher difficulties you have to fight ridiculous battles manually because otherwise it will wipe half your army it doesn t make any sense that an attack of a full stack of ogres against 10 units of kislev would result in a valiant defeat as soon as you enter the battle map itself the balance of power bar looks way like it should i can t see a reason why the ai should get buffs for auto resolve additional to the already given difficulty buffs items can be equipped immediately while most of the possibilities to cheese were removed this allows you to transfer your best items from army to army and just use them in every single battle no respec button wanted by the community for a long time the possibility to respec your lords and heroes whenever you want f e after a confederation was not introduced into the game i think ca has a reason not to do so but i am still a bit unsatisfied about this missing feature in conclusion total war warhammer iii is a great game and the first hours were a blast for me but i have to state again that i was also a big fan of the other two parts of the trilogy currently i would rate the game with a 85 90 100 with a reasonable auto resolve an enhanced optimization and the introduction of the mortal empires campaign it will easily be a perfect game in my eyes edit after playing the game a bit longer seeing some of the patches as well as the road map i have to admit that my original rating of 85 90 100 was way too enthusiastic the developers had lots of time and ressources as well as experience thanks to tw w1 and tw w2 yet they delivered the game in a questionable state and the replayability of the current campaign is not so high so until immortal empires launches i would rather give this game a 65 70 100 rating edit 2 with the current version 2 1 2 of immortal empires i can revert to my original rating of 85 100 while still being a bit unbalanced and the ai lacking bite compared to tw w2 the game is really enjoyable and better optimized compared to a few

13825,2022 the best iteration of total war warhammer is it well optimised hell no is it expensive yup are there bugs yes plenty although i personally haven t yet encountered any however it is still a gigantic step up from what tw wh2 was a lot of qol improvements and straight up upgrades makes this version really good the music is amazing the graphics and artistic direction is stunning at times the soundscape is to die for and there are hundreds of hours of enjoyment to be had here already prior to any dlc or addons of any kind the only criticism i can level at the game is next to the points starting out this review of course the awful ui although there are some improvements and qol overall the ui just doesn t mesh with the game aestehtic at all and is quite hard to read everything just looks the same also a chore for returning players because they just had to rearrange all the buttons for whatever reason the biggest letdown in this regard is the diplomacy menu which is just tiny square buttons with even tinier symbols and a bunch of numbers crammed into a small chunk of screen red on red whoever designed this should really check their eyes this is awful i hope the optimisation issues get addressed down the line,344.9,104.0,6,Recommended,"February 18, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Maxknight

13837,2023 this is tale of modern gaming developers and publishers taking a beautifully well done game clearly the product of equal parts passion and skill and slowly choking the promise and life out of it through corporate greed i m not surprised it is everywhere today not just in gaming but what is so fascinating to me is that this same greed that is killing companies the world over could be sated by a few good consumer focused decisions they could with a little hard work have their cake and eat it too i know what is happening the business side of the company made the determination that raising prices and reducing content ignoring bugs and focusing on new content is the most profitable and efficient method of doing business less work more money after all the company needs profit to survive but this model of thinking is grossly short sighted i would ask the stakeholders of the company the following question which is preferred a 100 increase in profits in the next fiscal year from wh3 but due to horrific understanding of the consumer base the game dies on the vine and the player count and population of consumers of future content decreases to the point where it is no longer viable to continue supporting the game within two years or a slow increase of 10 profit per quarter over the next 5 fiscal years shoring up a rock solid foundation of consumers who will loyally purchase every release of content for the entire life cycle of the game additionally the community relations ensure that the next game in the franchise is eagerly anticipated and pre ordered continuing to grow the company exponentially everyone is picking the first option and not even considering the second even though long term that would be the most profitable decision and the most welcomed by the consumer the problem is that the business side of the company does not understand how the money is made you do not succeed in business by spitting in the face of the customers who have spend hundreds of dollars on your products in the name of quarterly earnings if you do that you may not survive financially to see another quarter you succeed by doubling down on the things which made you successful in the first place attention to detail understanding your community and communicating openly with them and working tirelessly within your own company to produce a culture of full spectrum consumer focused effort rather than deadline driven content generation read bug fixes community engagement media and then quality dlc in equal measure rather than the current high price low content dlc rush it is a circle of growth the consumer sees what they want to see the consumer spends their money on the products the company produces the money is used to payroll the employees increase the wealth of the stake holders and grow the company to produce more content in the same vein of what the consumer wants to see and so on and so forth but enough of my own analysis if anyone from the company is reading this i ll provide you some data points and you can do your own analysis i won t draw you any conclusions i won t tell you why i stopped playing but i ll tell you a little about what matters most to you what i bought from the company and when exactly i stopped playing i have purchased every single item in the total war warhammer franchise except the shadows of change dlc most i purchased at full price many i pre ordered as the time of this review i had 86 9 hours on record in whiii i had 542 6 hours in wh2 i own every single total war title in the franchise except thrones of britannia troy and pharaoh i stopped playing whiii when i noticed that the animations for the witch hunter and free company militia they share the same animation set was completely broken this was a year ago now simply put their mouths do not open or move their pistols were floating magically from their belts to their hands when swapping from idles to attacks and eventually their swords were invisible despite being reported by multiple users on both steam and the forums it was never even added to the known issues list eventually a low effort fix was pushed to bring the swords back and to shove the pistols into the off hand of the model but to this very day the grip of the pistol is horribly clipped into the thumb of the hand and nothing was done to address their broken mouth rig i purchased the forge of the chaos dwarfs but never played because the aforementioned bug wasn t addressed and once i had noticed my favorite hero unit from my favorite faction was broken it became too frustrating to ignore i did not purchase shadows of change so there you go analyze away why might i have stopped playing could there by a linkage between terrible community relations and profit could seemingly minor cosmetic bugs really cause someone to stop playing could ignoring issues like that despite multiple reports and video evidence create a perception of not caring about the player base so powerful it drives decisions to purchase future content could it be after all this time the little things which create success could this really be what kills a multi million dollar franchise there are thousands of other players just like me if you can get my money i think everyone wins you included i wish you nothing but the best i m rooting for you guys,88.6,25.0,0,Not

13838,2022 pc intel i9 10850k 3 60ghz rtx 3080 32gb ram win10 2560x1440 144hz long review tl dr at the end visuals and performancethe game offers great visuals it runs smooth at max settings on my pc so far i got one random crash but some people with older hardware report more using alt tab does crash the game often annoying but no big deal i notice no major framerate drops only a tiny drop if there s four full armies in battle normalizes after some units die the prologue presentation is well done except you are forced to press buttons or watch ingame cutscenes where the camera moves all over the place before you can progress it distracts from an otherwise speckless prologue in terms of ui the demonic khorne red menu layout reminds me of a mobile game menu ultimately it works looks ok and you ll find total war elements where you d expect them to be the model quality is great but what did catch my eye is that some units have odd animations for example kislev streltsi units will shoot an enemy and then crouch or stand still instead of reloading their gun you will hardly notice this though most animations are great the game offers great graphics style and performance for my hardware but it lacks some polish for perfection gameplay factionsi will not go in depth on each faction but we have kislev chaos demons the four main chaos factions ogre kindoms and cathay considering that we are used to in mortal empires this feels like a meagre quantity but mortal empires was also added to tw wh2 at a later time to see chaos collide with we will have to wait for immortal empires for now we can finish the campaign quest line for these factions for kislev it means taking relics of the primary four chaos factions to free ursun while politically stabilising your faction really kislev is an alternative russian themed empire campaign summaryyou can use chaos rifts that appear from events every x turns to move of course other factions can travel to you if you want to be safe you must close them they can also spawn chaos rebels it s always a surprise if something heads your way rifts appear all across the map so you need to be ready to use both defensive and offensive armies you will find yourself at war on multiple fronts while you struggle between building faction mechanic or economic buildings this time you can t make random demands in diplomacy this was prone to cheese in older tw games you make deals based on faction approval without the approval you need to balance the approval gap for example with gold before you can make a deal there are some deals where you can try to threaten the target faction risking approval drops if you cannot make a balanced offer factions generally accept a deal as long as you have the required approval and or a balanced offer also you can trade settlements if you take settlements you don t need or don t want to defend you can give them to your proxy buffer allies perhaps even get one of theirs there are many fires to put out at once at the start of a campaign so having a defensive ally act as a proxy buffer will help other than that it has the usual campaign elements of a tw wh game that don t warrant further review combatcombat mechanics are largely unchanged ranged magic and lord hero units still dictate the course of battle the offensive power of frost and tzeentch magic impressed me but the way in which it s used isn t new winds of magic regeneration is improved though cavalry is still only useful for cycle charging or running down enemies they can still get stuck in multiple units in melee their speed is meaningless if they can t pull their own weight in damage and utility i only use cavalry as bait or to run down routing enemies melee units are good to hold the line but you ll never encounter any enemy for which the answer is not ranged magic or both instead you can still use fast units heroes as bait the ai is not improved the ai fails to deal with cheese like corner camping ammo wasting and luring enemy units sieges changed a bit defenders can build ramps a la atilla and towers however on most maps attackers can still exploit blindspots the ai is never in control of a defensive siege tw wh3 hasn t taken steps up or down from tw wh2 however the formula can get old 1 there are mechanics that give penalties to your faction 2 you build to counter penalties while fighting off enemy attackers 3 your army bonuses become so good that the the ai s only strategy of attacking you cannot work anymore that s the part where you start mopping up and stop caring i still enjoy it but there s room for improvement humanity developed chess tournament winning ai yet we can t develop strategy game ai that can do more than spam armies and send them at the player but lose every battle to cheese game opinionthere is a lack of polish and waiting for immortal empires makes the game currently feel like a teaser for itself mechanically it brings little new things to the table as a warhammer or tw game however i just want to see all fantasy warhammer factions in their full glory that this game does well i expect the same for immortal empires this game is not the second coming of something holy but it s one of the best pc games i played in recent years i didn t recommend tw wh1 for a full price pre order because i did not approve of pre order schemes and an incomplete chaos faction i did not like all the tw wh2 dlc however tw wh3 is definitely worth my 60 because they get it thematically right and it s a functional ejoyable total war game opinion on chinese review bombingfrom what i understand this is about keys being handed out some time before the official release to chinese streamers who are not warhammer tw fans they spoiled the game for the chinese audience while long term chinese fans had no opportunity to play it i can see it wasn t a great move by ca so i can sympathize but this means a lot of negative reviews are not submitted for an opinion on the game itself i don t think review bombing helps the community the opinion on a game or developer publisher can vary by localization and this isn t the first time maybe the positivity rating should be something you can filter by region so users can get more context on public reception that said i do not think someone else receiving a key to play a game before you do makes for much of a negative review or should really affect your experience criticism of a game tl drthe game is not the second coming of anything it does not revolutionize anything but it s a great pc strategy game and a great addition to the tw wh series chaos is thematically done really well and that alone is a reason for me to play this if you have doubts wait until the release of immortal empires if you are chinese and are outraged by the streamer key situation write creative assembly an email but ffs review the game for the game,562.9,149.0,12,Recommended,"February 19, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER

comparison of performance i have added my pc specs at the end of the review so let s get on with the review i have split the review into several categories i have played the prologue and started a multiplayer cathay campaign with a friend of mine performance is solely based on the fps and loading time gameplay glitches and bugscontent the new stuff1 performancei took notice that there has been a huge complaint about performance optimization issues however i can not relate to these problems even though my rig is not superior specs at the end of the review i can still easily play the game at medium graphics with 60 fps in battles but due to my game being installed on the hard drive loading times have gone up quite some bit i would approximate about 2 to 4 min loading time for transitioning from a battle to the campaign map and vise versa i have not had the game crash on me yet 2 gameplayat first glance there seem to be no issues whatsoever however over 6 hours of playing i did encounter a couple of odd things happen these are all in the category of annoying in my humble opinion grand cathay have the ability to use the ivory road to trade around the world during the travels of such a caravan many events can happen in my case i got ambushed by a small ogre army which would have been easily beat however due to bad luck when i clicked on fight a sudden second army joined due to this i lost my caravan the speculations are that at the location of the attack a second army was located that got dragged in to the fight during this ogre fight i encounter another weird possible bug when a wall of halberdiers were defending the frontline they seemed to be useless allow me to explain when a unit clashed with my static halberdiers half of that clashing unit was allowed to move through my entire unit without any trouble this caused my unit to be surrounded and my archers behind to be in trouble i can not say for certain if this is a bug or a new feature flying units can not be ordered a flying unit to move above a unit it will always relocate your move order beyond the ground units this does not seem to bad until you are using units that have the ability to drop a bomb right beneath them this caused for a minor inconvenience where i had to fly the unit over the clashing armies and press backspace to hold the unit in the right place 3 content the game has added a lot of new content to the total war warhammer franchise kislev grand cathay the chaos factions of tzeentch khorne slaanesh and nurgle and the ogre kingdoms i have yet to play the chaos or ogre kingdom factions however i have played grand cathay thus this review will be more focussed on the grand cathay features 3 1 mapthe game has also added more features to the game such as region trading quick deal in the diplomacy tab this greatly increases the efficiency of making diplomacy and prevents you from asking every faction for a trade agreement to which afterwards you are trying every possible money gift for the deal to work only to find out that they were note interested in a deal after all instead you can see which factions might be interested in a particular deal and you can use the balance button to get or give the right amount of money to let the deal work they also implemented a better public order system this system stimulates growth on higher public order and reduces growth on negative public order the multiplayer campaign mode is really neat to work with all the players work in the same turn to which it is possible to play with more than just 2 people if you have some moral in your group of friends than this system should work just fine basic rules such as first do all the management of your kingdom diplomacy building and recruiting and at the end make people move their units and attack this greatly reduces the time for each player to wait 3 2 fightsthe new map looks stunning and the new siege map mechanics are great instead of having a single wall that you have to climb which gets repetitive quite quick the siege maps are more stunning and usually have multiple sides to enter the city the defender has the ability to create barricades and towers before and during to fight this makes siege fights a lot more difficult and interesting to fight and the last very notable thing is that the ai has improved a lot an ai army with war hounds actually uses these hounds to properly flank you and take out your archers the ai is clever in scenarios where it might get a backup army after a couple of minutes instead of rushing in they move back to wait for the other backup army to meet them 4 to concludethe game certainly has a few bugs here and there but i would not say that these inconveniences outweigh the new content the games looks great even on medium has amazing new features and has made battles a lot more interesting due to the better ai and the reworked siege fights since they will still be updating the game a lot optimizing and bug glitch fixing i feel like they do not get enough credit for what an amazing game they have managed to make reviews saying that it has become normal to release games that are bugged beyond playing are lying through their teeth the game is not beyond playing some bugs just cause minor inconveniences i am not implying that every bad comment on the game is unjustified i certainly believe that people have had major issues such as not getting the game to work beyond 20 fps and possible other issues however this is my perspective on the game after playing it for 6 hours just after release 5 my pcit is an 8 year old pc that back in the day was quite high end however in these days not so much anymore currently i run all my games on a 8 year old rig with the following specs processor intel i5 4690k

13868,2022 in its current state i can t in good faith recommend the game before the game launched they patched in denuvo which has severely decreased the games performance for customers but it s not reflected in the reviews that came out before the game was launched making it as anti consumer as it gets but that s unfortunately not all the game has some core issues that make it less fun than previous entries primarily the campaign mechanics some of the chaos realms are amazing to look at but the surrounding gameplay isn t fun the race against the ai is frustrating and they clear the chaos realms with ease but for you it ll mostly be a boring slog of identical battles with infuriating corruption traits on your legendary lord and armies that constantly need replenishing the main battles in the chaos realms are nice to look at and provide some variation with attacking and defending points but the way to these battles makes you groan when it s time to do them again the biggest issue by far however is that they ve made a total war game that discourages territorial expansion the more you expand the more rifts to the chaos realm you ll have within your territory and the more rifts you have the more chaos corruption will spread with invading armies since you ll have your legendary lord and army locked away battling in the chaos realm you ll be left with whatever resources you have to combat these invasions you ll be lucky if you can field another good army to fight the invaders but with the replenishment nerf you ll be stuck trying to get your numbers up before you can engage again and while all this happens the ai will either decide to stand idly by or attack you ignoring most other of their enemies it s a shame because there are a lot of needed changes to the warhammer tw series like the changed sieges and minor settlement battles diplomacy overhaul and the new races are all interesting and unique i would honestly wait until the ca patches out denuvo and patches in the mortal empires campaign,97.6,26.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 19, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Peppe

13887,2022 so after almost 60 hours i ve completed 3 campaigns and poked around at a handful of others the game has some shining spots in it while also having a lot of major issues with the gameplay and performance at the moment pros wh3 is absolutely beautiful when graphics are turned to high the detail of the map battle maps and units are very detailed the factions are very fun to play depending on how you like to play your campaigns i find that most units are balanced well throughout each faction s roster the narrative is absolutely amazing overall during my first playthrough i was captivated by the prologue and the story told throughout the soundtrack is amazing to listen to while playing as certain factions cons the game does not perform well at all even if you have a strong computer it is impossible to have more than 25 frames if you are running any other program in the background i could only achieve 60 fps by turning all of my graphics settings down the mechanics of the base campaign are atrocious without going into too much detail the main campaign requires you to complete 4 different chaos areas which significantly punish you for completing them unlike the previous campaign ion wh2 you are forced to play the narrative even if you don t want to if you would like to read more on why the chaos mechanic is atrocious go read legendoftotalwar s post on it because of the previously stated problem there is no incentive to continue to play the game with the forced narrative because you have already seen it after the first few campaigns it becomes somewhat repetitive to deal with making the game not fun overall i would recommend this game yes but after they have fixed some of the mechanics and the campaign or release mortal empires version,126.5,86.0,2,Recommended,"March 10, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,NicFlix
13888,2023 i ve invested approximately 2000 hours across the trilogy enthusiastically purchased all the accompanying dlcs however the recent unveiling of dlc both in terms of the quantity quality of content has left me deeply disappointed although this game was released 18 months ago subsequent game updates dlc releases have been sporadic and uninspiring the neglect of numerous established factions such as norsca lizards the empire is glaringly evident as they languish and stagnate without comprehensive campaign revamps similarly game 3 factions like nurgle cathay ogres desperately require a reimagining of their hero traits technology trees skill lines the ai both in battle on the campaign map displays a baffling lack of strategic prowess and fails to present any meaningful challenge myriad bugs are introduced with each patch especially painful given the now lengthy patch cycles what s most disappointing is the unfavorable comparison of immortal empires to mortal empires ie s lack of polish heightened bug count inferior performance worse ai late game states are all noticeable obtaining substantive information from creative assembly has proven as challenging as extracting blood from a stone the lack of meaningful communication regarding the issues fans are experiencing is frustrating and disheartening recent comments posted by rob bartholomew show how out of touch ca is to our concerns a thinly veiled threat and a corporate smokescreen of deal with it it s painful to witness the unrealized potential of the game and see the community s valid concerns seemingly brushed aside my patience has worn thin my goodwill eroded the culmination of underwhelming content neglect of core aspects and the persistent influx of bugs and unresolved issues is unacceptable perhaps in the years ahead ca and sega will manage to rectify these deep seated issues it s unfortunate to part ways with a franchise i ve held in high regard for so long but until significant improvements are made i cannot in good conscience continue to support this franchise,571.9,42.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 18, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Ampersand

13917,the idea of playing warhammer 3 total war is more appealing than actually playing it due to how much of it is still broken for example reinforcements units under ai control can get stuck in ditches at the edge of the map and fail to do anything unless enemy units are drawn over to them units frequently fail to follow orders properly indirect fire units such as mortar teams will decide to walk into melee rather than shoot if the battle map has interesting battlefield features on it such as cliffs the mortar teams for example will also sometimes simply decide not to fire when fire at will is on with enemies in range due to becoming confused by terrain features the same is true for indirect and direct ranged units which get confused by unwalkable terrain you want them to shoot over which causes them to start shuffling around when you desperately need them to shoot something ordering faster melee units to disengage has always been something of a pita which has not changed as you constantly need to babysit them spam clicking to get them to move properly direct firing units like handgunners are particularly painful to try to command as obstructions will easily result in them not firing such as very slight elevations in terrain you cannot see unless you zoom in closely or terrain features messing them up whilst this could also be an issue on 1 2 i ve found it is particularly bad in 3 during sieges attacking the enemy gates can result in your units getting trapped or cut in half due to the gates opening and closing this a problem for obvious reasons i never recall having this issue with 1 2 even if the gate is opened i remember my units not crossing the threshold unless i tell them to or have them attack a unit on the other side of it the balancing in general is all over the place and new dlc factions are blatantly more powerful than others also enjoy seeing units on the campaign map and being given quests to recruit units you can t due to not owning said dlc it is almost like ca are trying to compete with paradox interactive in terms of how much hate they can get for their dlc practices the load times in ie are not great though that is somewhat forgivable due to the size of the map the same is true of the ai taking their turn in the campaign map until factions start dying off what is also understandable i ve repeatedly tried to give wh3 a try after enjoying 1 and 2 but for some reason the game fundamentally just does not play well i did not play multiplayer but its possible you might have more fun with that on flat grassy plains maps with much less chance of your units getting confused and knowing your opponent has to deal with the same issues with their units that you do i want to enjoy the game but the gameplay never meets expectations due to all of the issues above,119.6,89.0,4,Not Recommended,August 11,Total War: WARHAMMER III,Aether

13927,2022 i ve logged more than 2 300 hours with warhammer ii and as it stands i m struggling to understand how i m going to get anything near that in what is almost certainly the ultimate release of the warhammer franchise in the total war mould ca are effectively asking you to hand over a tidy little sum for what is a triple a title and don t appear to have bothered to create a game at all rather a promise to make a game anyone who is remotely familiar with this franchise knows that it s the game s sandbox campaign mode where the fun actually begins this is made worse when you realise that in order to get the full complete total war warhammer experience at the hypothetical end newcomers to the franchise will be presented with this thing and asked to pay for two more complete games with two very average campaigns and effectively the same smaller sandbox in order to have it it s no lie now that modders have effectively prolonged the wh2 experience well beyond its intended shelf life this popularity combined with ca s buy all three for the best experience attitude to marketing once looked like a commitment to the creation of a fantastic world and a beautiful product and now looks a lot like hucksterism ca a substantial developer should not be relying on the creative talent and passion of people to improve their game for free in order to squeeze out as much length out of the wh franchise as possible i know many of us are waiting for immortal empires in the hope that wh3 will become an experience worth having and there s no doubt it will improve things substantially but let s face it it has no where else to go the campaign in this instalment is the laziest ever ca clearly knows why people bought this title because most of us who play wh are completionists and will patiently wait for what is effectively the wh sandbox to arrive and then spend hundreds and thousands of hours enjoying it but i think we all know now that it s not because ca have created amazing story driven campaign experiences the vortex campaign was about as forgettable but because the modding community is so passionate so committed and so much more detail oriented than the studio itself that ca knows it will get a lot more commerciality out of a franchise that frankly doesn t deserve it if we re being honest i sunk 50 or so hours this week into wh3 because i had covid and had nothing else to do i will play it again when ie finally launches still cannot understand why that doesn t ship at launch as well but the reason i will stay with wh like i did with wh2 is because of our modding community so make sure you give them some love subscribe to their patreons where they have them but most of all treat this franchise with the cynicism it actually deserves especially if you re new to it,475.1,257.0,9,Not Recommended,"June 27, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Mythox

13949,2022 most disappointing game since cyberpunk being a big fan of total war games in general and total war warhammer ii in particular i really expected to love this game however this broken betrayal of a product is not worth your time or money in its present state indiana jones and the race for the soul fragmentsthe rifts to chaos realms opening up could have been a very interesting addition to the game however the way the game works is that you win the game by entering these rifts and collecting soul fragments this could be an interesting sort of dynamic story challenge if not for the fact that every other faction can do the same thing meaning that even when you are playing in single player the whole game just turns into race for the soul fragments very early in the campaign i m not the only one who noticed this angry joe noted that this killed the campaign in his review skip to 27 25 youtube video total war warhammer iii angry review views 655 778 patreon yt join our new merch angryjoe gets in touch with his inner demon to rule the and mandalore gaming noted that this basically makes winning any other way almost impossible youtube video total war warhammer 3 review views 3 466 500 total war warhammer 3 has arrived in a month absolutely stacked for games this review covers anything and everything that came to mind so prepare for trees and menus what s worse the rifts can only be entered by your faction leader which means that winning the game is all about creating min maxed doomstacks and using them to play what is basically a bad moba rather than coordinating armies and managing kingdoms as you would in say an actual total war game broken storythis game has one of those awful stories that was clearly put together by people who worked separately and hated each other for instance the story clearly states that only a certain person can enter the realms of chaos to do the thing needed to win the game but literally every ai faction actually does that the first chance they get characterization is also off for instance kostaltyn is a well played sympathetic character in cutscenes but he s an ugly deranged blowhard on the campaign map terrible performance and denuvokeep tolerating bugs and so will the devs this is the most unreliable total war game i have played so far with all of the issues you might expect including broken ai that can t move properly constant de synchs in multiplayer and of course crashes that frequently cause you to lose your progress after a tough battle it s impossible to tell how many of these problems are linked to the use of denuvo but it certainly isn t helping conclusionthis is the first total war game for which i have posted a negative review and i have been playing the series since the early 2000s this game made me sad,80.4,33.0,6,Not Recommended,"March 18, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Fomin

13977,2023 after the success of wh2 this game was destined for greatness yet even now one and a half year after its release it is still broken and it s getting worse immortal empires still lack narrative content compared to mortal empires from wh2 intros quests and its beta tag was shamelessly removed while major issues still stand ai sieges garrisons etc update cycle is awfully slow and the patches often bring new bugs that are left unfixed for months including simple 5 minute fixes when patch notes boast a new fix or feature and it doesn t work at all damsel troths then something is really wrong they either didn t test it released wrong data or knew it was broken but released it anyway all options suggest incompetent management moreover it took them an absurd amount of time to release a mere roadmap their communication with the community is woefully insufficient simple tweaks wished by the players take years to implement and now they announced a new dlc with an inflated price to put it mildly and how did they address the inevitable player backlash they added insult to injury by an implied threat to abandon the game if we don t buy their well done ca that s going in the book of grudges i m getting the impression that there is just a skeleton crew of like 10 20 devs working on the game who i believe would like to put things right but their greedy management doesn t give them enough space i spent thousands of hours in total war games and i spent hundreds in this game looking forward for it to get polished and expanded to reach its full potential but with this kind of shoddy work and attitude towards fans they made me write this review and i ll think twice before buying anything else from this company edit after seeing the content reveal of the upcoming dlc i don t know if i should laugh or cry the huge price controversy aside the design itself is just dumb the jade dragon ruler of the central provinces the guy who pretty much runs the cathay starts away in lustria the pseudo baba yaga protector of kislev land forests etc starts in bloody nagaroth on the other side of the world who designs this nonsense this urge to mix everything up just for the sake of gameplay diversity regardless of lore and common sense is absurd ca get your together,729.1,27.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 18, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Chlupatyr
13979,2022 alright so first of all this despite all the backlash isn t an awful game i d much rather play release tww 3 than the original that being said it s not a good game either ca has pulled the classic 2020s razzle dazzle of releasing a game unfinished and patching it until the backlash stops with every update until now the game has improved overall even if the bugs kept multiplying without a doubt the biggest improvement at least for me so far has been the implementation of the mod support which allowed the community to fill negative space in the design and improve the balancing overall this may change soon though as the immortals empire patch looms over the horizon now would i recommend people to buy this game before ie drops no that doesn t mean it s not worth playing cause i do like playing it and the implementation of ie will bring such a breadth of content to the game that i have no doubts that it will shake up the reviews however i am both excited and scared of how this will turn out because while i have no doubts ie will have me playing hundreds more hours regardless of quality i can t as of yet make comment on how well implemented it will be and how much love will be shown to it and future releases i strongly believe that once this game has gotten the dlc support of tww2 it will be a good game perhaps even a great one however i shall leave this review on negative because let s be honest here this game needed another year of dev time and should have released with more content tho not necessarily ie and way more polish,268.0,208.0,12,Not Recommended,"August 17, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Smeick

13989,steam should create an award for the game devs that hate their customers the most then ca would have a title that wins at least one award every year but just so this is somewhat of an actual review the game is fun it s three games that have been built up on each other with apparently little long term planning so its mechanics can be convoluted and poorly adapted to later additions look up wulfhart in ie but despite that the years have allowed for many interesting changes and improvements to various faction mechanics i have a ton of fun with this game most of the time because its scale variety and fantastic mod community make up for a lot of its shortcomings with that being said ca hates its fans or rather they seem utterly indifferent to the needs of its customers once they ve been parted from their money they ll acknowledge a persistent and somewhat significant glitch say they re working on it then not mention it for 3 months while spitting out another dlc instead of fixing it luckily someone discovered that you fan fix it by buying the blood god dlc because why not spend money on something you don t want to have a product work as advertised there s the fact that new dlc factions have smaller and smaller rosters while the dlc prices keep going up there s the whole the right to discuss is a privilege thing and today they removed version 4 1 4 the most recent version compatible with most mods from the steam rollback options so you have to play vanilla with their most recent patch which was so well made at launch that it needed two hotfixes in 3 weeks and probably needs more so while the game is a lot of fun i don t recommend it unless you1 want to be furious every 2 6 weeks because ca is doing their thing again and2 want to play a game with an entertainment value that is dependent on how many hundreds of dollars you d like to spend getting past the dlc paywallsbut if those things don t bother you you ll probably really enjoy it,754.5,48.0,3,Not Recommended,March 20,Total War: WARHAMMER III,Jeezuz

13993,2023 warhammer 2 was far better i don t think there is a comparison it seems like everything about the game was designed by some executive or director that had no idea what actually made warhammer 2 fun just look at some of the terrible ui decisions at launch like making the build and deconstruct icon both red like what not only did they seem to want to make change just for the sake of change the changes they made made the game more of a drag seiges while a promising premise are now a naggy annoying arcade style mini game that is even less fun to play than warhammer 2 a lot of the other changes too were seem be made to spite players rather than keeping elements that made the game fun as a single player game its like they viewed it as a challenge to themselves to make everything less fun and more annoying i could ramble on and on about every little detail but straight up its just not as fun as 2 2 built on the 1st game and became one of my favorite games ever 3 has taken two steps backwards and four steps sideways but hey there s 4 half baked chaos factions where half the units are reskins which totally warranted a new game tag,117.7,114.0,7,Not Recommended,"January 9, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,WoozyTulip9943

14014,2022 as probably many have said before me this game was not and is still not in a fit state to launch whilst some head scratching design choices for the campaign will hopefully be eliminated with the introduction of the immortal empires the problem with the game runs far deeper units are unresponsive even after the massive update released a few weeks back and will often run in a completely different direction to the one ordered this is extremely visible on the new and imo not very enjoyable settlement battles where the map designers don t seem to have ever played a game of total war before but can also happen on an open map where a unit will walk in the wrong direction and then refuse to move or take any orders for the rest of the battle also missile units will often not fire when enemy units are in range would randomly swap target from the order given the fact the game was released in this state shows an utter contempt for the consumer i have a general rule of never pre ordering which i ve broken twice recently and both times this game and cyberpunk i ve been reminded that you can t trust that a developer s previous work will be any indication of a future product executive greed and disrespect for their paying customers is sadly just too prevalent in the gaming industry,854.1,20.0,0,Not Recommended,"May 10, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Davey Diablo

14018,2022 just finished a cathay campaign two strong impressions 1 siege battles feel much more fun because of the new multi layer settlements maps and supply mechanic to build defense structures 2 quest battles are also very enjoyable having to capture multiple victory points and hold them against enemies waves meanwhile you have supply points to build defense structure call in reinforcements and buff heal units mid battle downside is that these battles are quite long now the new siege battles are definitely more fun than before if you are defending you can build defense structures like towers traps and barricades and the new settlements map are huge and complex with multi layer pathways and many interesting choke points this opens up many interesting strategies to turn defeats into heroic victories i was able to win many outnumbered defense battles by holding crucial choke points and maneuver my army through multiple lines of defenses to wear enemies down cathay crossbows felt so strong when you have them positioned on higher grounds and having your melee units hold the enemies down the downsides are these battles are sometimes very long because of how big the new maps are and attackers do feel harder to play if you don t take supply point the defenders can constantly build towers traps and etc the quest battles are also more interesting now you have to capture several locations sequentially and after each capture you have 45 sec to build defenses and layout your army against a coming enemy wave these battles are super fun because you need to play as both attacker and defender you capture points from enemies and then defend them against them who are trying to take them back you can also call in reinforcements heal restock or buff your units mid battle using supply points which are passively generated the maps are also huge with interesting terrains and choke points where you can leverage to either hold points or push through enemy defenses the final battle also have interesting mechanics xd annoying or fun very subjective 1 constant spawning of enemy troops behind you after taking first points forcing you to take next victory point quickly while hold up against enemies chasing behind you 2 random enemy teleport onto final victory point soulgrinders into the middle of your army this scared me so hard since these giant nonstoppable monstrous machines just started spawning and running through my crossbows at the end downside is still the same the battles can feel long easily 30 min as for optimization i honestly feel it is similar to total war warhammer ii occasional fps drops especially on the campaign i did not experience anything major that stopped me from playing it the only bug i encounter was that a few of the rifts i closed somehow reopened after i reloaded the save file the next day i was able to enjoying the game and i don t really expect any more optimization improvement as long as it runs fine as warhammer ii and whenever mortal empire whatever you call it the aggregation of warhammer i ii iii come out the game still runs the same i am totally fine with the current state of optimization,198.2,20.0,0,Recommended,"February 22, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"kw142 (Lie in Mid-July)

14047,2023 i love this game i have spent hundreds of hours with it and thousands with its predecessors and i will keep playing and having fun with this one even after this negative review still i am writing this negative review in the hopes to warn everyone of the negative turn this game is taking and to make my voice heard so that it might improve in the future and i can hopefully update this to positive so the game is a mess it s been 18 months since release and what a cluster it has been the amount of bugs is through the roof and ca puts more emphasis on putting out dlc than to adress these sometimes gamebreaking bugs the big joke beeing whenever a dlc and patch drops that is suppost to improve upon things the newly added content adds even more bugs the list of known issues ca puts out has barley changed since the game launched add on this their delusiounal dlc pricing and there is little good faith left that they will make this a good game at some point in the past couple of years they have increased their prices for dlcs multible times that is or rather was fine with me inflation is a thing and we got more and better quality dlc content so these increases where justified for me i own every dlc for all 3 warhammer total war games except forges of the chaos dwarfs and of course my motivation to write this review the shadows of change dlc the content price ratio is abysmal it even gets worse when you compare it to older dlc no amound of new faction mechanics justifies a 150 price increase they don t fix game breaking bugs or take 3 to 12 months time to do it and then try to sell less content for 150 the price they will keep doing so unless the community takes a stand against it vote with your wallet people or it will only get worse from here on ps if you allready own the game use the community bug fix mod it s a game changer and a shame that we need it because ca dropped the ball,654.7,18.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 9, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"P4P

14048,2023 so i am just here to point out that ca has yet to successfully launch a dlc without introducing a host of new bugs the launch and almost every patch since have been slow and bug riddled the last dlc added an entirely new race chaos dwarfs was mostly just reskins of existing units from other rosters same animations same hitboxes etc that dlc was not worth 25 this dlc adds 3 new legendary lords and a few new units for 25 at a certain point we as consumers have got to start saying no to this type of behavior i know i will not be paying 25 units for what will almost certainly be another buggy mess,380.1,33.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 8, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Sweet T

14060,2022 great improvement to twh2 the new content races are all insanely unique and fun to play performance issues are unfortunate but i personally have not experienced any improvements to diplomacy are much needed and will be even more apparent with more mortal order races settlement battles are very improved and actually allow for some tactics but are a bit too frequent new campaign is amazing depending on what you are looking for if you are looking for the same power fantasy of completely painting the map with little resistance in twh2 then wait for immortal empires in a few months if you are looking for a campaign that actually has some inherent challenge unlike the vortex which you could completely ignore then ca has finally done it the campaign gives you a little room to breath and expand your borders between the events but will continue to put pressure on you throughout the campaign also nerfs overly aggressive expansion which is much needed as there was no reason not to wildly expand in previous games making the mid late game extremely easy and boring this also adds more reason to try diplomacy with neighbors instead of just rolling them over overall a great improvement for the series and an even bigger jump in quality than from twh1 2 very excited to see this game improve with further updates and content,641.3,21.0,0,Recommended,"February 24, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Charlie Kelly

14066,for me warhammer 3 is probably one of the best 3 strategy games out there and the best when it comes to warhammer warhammer 3 is the perfect application of the total war series game principle in terms of administration diplomacy combat with the addition of warhammer lore anyone who likes to get information about their units i e apart from numbers the characters in the game the races etc will find many texts describing their backgrounds in the warhammer fantasy world on the world map which has been designed with great attention to warhammer detail there are also plenty of points of interest to see and read and i think i ve even seen felix and gotrek as an army on the map the base game has included the almost complete warhammer fantasy map and races for some time now however you can only play a few of them after buying the basic game you then have to buy expansions or the two older games to be able to play more races but all the races are in the game and they are then controlled by the ai the technical side also fits the graphic art style the music and the voice acting create a dense warhammer atmosphere and the game also runs stable for me the low rating of the game seems to me to come mainly from players for whom the prices of the dlcs are too high and i have to say it s true they are expensive but i d rather get new dlcs for a few more years than have the game cancelled just to make it cheap anyone who plays warhammer as a table top knows the price issue in terms of content however i also found the last dlc too shallow for the price i paid regardless of such fan discussions it s a great strategy game that can really be fun for a very long time,381.0,41.0,3,Recommended,January 12,Total War: WARHAMMER III,JazzManMR

14081,2022 edit there s been several patches since this review so while some things are still relevant others aren t i ll update it as i get the feel for the new stuff when i get around to playing it more total warhammer 3 is the third installment in the total warhammer franchise and it is a good game it is unfortunately also plagued with a ton of design issues and oversights and bugs that makes it hard to recommend as it currently stands the short and sweet of it is that if you absolutely can t wait for more total warhammer this is a nice enough tideover until there s more dlc and the new combined campaign map comes out in a few months but if you re not in a rush or still haven t experienced everything tw2 has to offer definitely stick with that one for a while yet and wait with picking up total warhammer 3 until at the very least the game has had a handful of patches to fix some of the glaring issues with the campaign and some factions or modding support has been added so you can mod those issues away the singleplayer campaign map in the game right now has some agonising mechanics which are a combination of mostly incredibly unrewarding dungeons that penalise you for doing them but are mandatory take 5 7 turns and are only doable with your faction leader s army a race against a handful of other ai factions with an almost immediate loss condition if you don t participate and rifts that pop up across every territory across the gameworld that heavily penalise the area they re in the dungeons the realms of chaos are generally fairly uninteresting slogs with the exception of slaanesh realm it is the only one that has a potential reward as you can get some huge bonuses or great gear if you decide to lose that realm it s very thematic and cool and gives an extra bit of strategy the others are pure penalties and tzeentch in particular is an rng fest which the ai of course doesn t have to deal with they re hard scripted to arrive at the end of the realm after 5 turns you can get around it with a cheat sheet and you might need to if you get behind the ai you lost the realm there s nothing to do unless you happen to catch them to kill them so they get thrown out all of the realms end with a survival battle a long long battle in which you need to survive waves of daemons while getting reinforcement points to summon reinforcements build defensive towers and barricades to help you survive etc the idea is nice and it s fun the first few times but since each of them is so long they get tedious fairly quickly fortunately all but the final one can be auto resolved with a strong enough army as for the rifts you can interact directly with them to close them but it requires either fighting them or having several heroes run around in your territory to close them using money they do have some utility as they allow your faction leader s army to jump between them and only your faction leader for some reason but it s not quite enough to offset the massive penalty they give the area they re in nor the fact they ll spawn hostile heroes and daemon armies wherever the rifts are too the later in the game it gets the harsher those penalties are and stronger the armies are too all this heavily disincentivises aggressive expansionist playstyles as the more territory you have the more rifts there ll be in it and the more heroes or armies you ll have to have patrolling your territory the prologue campaign however is amazing it serves as a narrative introduction to the plot of the main campaign and a tutorial for new players there s not much new for veterans in this campaign in terms of gameplay but its story is the best there s ever been in a total warhammer game moving away from the campaign there was a siege rework that uses many of the same mechanics of the survival battles all minor settlement battles now take place on specific beautiful city maps with several lanes of approach capture points and the possibility of making towers and barricades if you are the defender while they re fun to defend they re not nearly as fun on the attack depending on your faction and the map it can be really frustrating to fight them and especially on higher difficulties you will need to as the auto resolve heavily disfavors the player at those difficulties the towers will continually respawn and they can be very devastating on the flipside it means that if you are the defender you can defend against armies you might not otherwise have been able to as the balance of power is so heavily skewed in your favor the ai is not smart enough to really abuse it the way a player can nor counter that abuse thankfully i do wish there were less of them though the ai rarely attacks my settlements in my experience so i m usually left on the much less fun attacking side walled sieges have had a similar overhaul with their walls now facing in multiple directions and with sprawling lanes defensible chokepoints and of course the same tower and barricade mechanics and capture points i am in the minority who never minded the old style of sieges but there s no denying the new maps are very pretty and that they offer more tactical options than they did before the new factions all have some fascinating new campaign mechanics and i think it s fair to say this is the most complex and interesting a launch roster has been not even taking into account the sheer quantity each race has a very distinct playstyle and identity on the campaign map and to a lesser extent also the battle map which means that the replayability between races is pretty high unfortunately some of them while certainly interesting have a lot of design or implementation issues that means the enjoyment is somewhat diminished as the cracks begin to show the daemon prince for example while based on the super interesting idea of customisation of both himself and his faction falls short by being a very weak legendary lord by himself and running out of things to get fairly early on compared to for instance the tech trees of other races which usually last considerably longer diplomacy had a very cool overhaul where you now get to see just how interested in a deal another faction is what factors are impacting it what you can do to change it and so on it also allows you to trade settlements and create outposts in your allies territory to get access to their units which is an absolutely amazing new feature it lets you supplement your army with up to 4 allied units per army allowing you to shore up weaknesses or just have fun adding some more monsters from other factions some old issues still exist but overall a great overhaul and of course as with many new total war releases there s a slew of variously severe bugs that will absolutely affect the enjoyment of your game as it is now it s very hard for me to recommend picking up the game if you have only a passing interest in the franchise or are new to it and i would strongly suggest anyone interested in the game to wait a bit unless you re absolutely sure you ll be able to overlook the early issues the game has i feel absolutely confident that it ll be a great long term purchase like total warhammer 1 and 2 were but it just doesn t feel completely finished yet so if you aren t absolutely in love with the franchise stay away for at least a few months or until modding tools are out,258.8,19.0,0,Not Recommended,"March 2, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Kitschy

armies or effectively develop its empires diplomacy mechanics and diplomacy ai in all ways forms is beyond awful especially around vassals and alliances ai is bugged limited in its perception of nearby faction ai is literally not aware what factions are nearby no diplomatic contact unit pathing in manual battles especially cities with construct able barricades is awful units refusing to path through broken city gates destroyed city walls instead insisting on using ladders to slowly climb up exhaust themselves cavalry monsters getting models stuck which pulls back the whole unit into death units dropping forgetting orders even in the middle of pitched melee combat units not shooting because they are moving fast while being stationary units unable to shoot despite having clear line of sight battle maps being broken for pathing and losight especially on top of wall crenellations auto resolve insists on damaging killing single entity monsters and especially artillery pieces even when the player army outnumbers the enemy 5 to 1 auto resolve still gives cities a ridicilous advantage even when the player army outnumbers the enemy minor settlement garrison 5 to 1 certain units lords heroes fail to properly do their charging attack units especially large ones will randomly die when attacking certain walls gates or being remotely in proximity of a collapsing wall but nowhere near close enough for it to be a valid danger units even lords on foot will randomly die when climbing ladders some lords cathay dragons especially just flat out fail to perform melee attacks for well over 10 seconds at a time ai does not understand nor properly react during the defense of siege battles it will spread out its army across the map and be unable to fight a concentrated force ai charging his fastest units at the start of battle into certain death especially lords heroes like belakor ai clueless about properly using aoe magic magic in general which also makes anything anti magic rather useless hundreds of bugs related to skills techs items unit abilities stats building mechanics etc etc sometimes two characters lords heroes will be placed on the exact same coordinates on the campaign map permanenetly preventing them from movement and interaction item qualities being nonsense with common ones often being better than rare special ones lord hero traits either not working or straight up inferior compared to other available ones wochaos revive norsca faction mechanic intentionally broken by ca because they could not be bothered to properly fix it manual battle ai will sometimes simply not activate instead its units refuse to attack defend move seen most often in ambush battles and wood elf forest defense battles countless quests for lord items or unlocking special lords heroes do not work properly ai occasionally able to see your ambush hidden armies from across immense distances react to their positioning skirmish mode on ranged units often failing to trigger react causing the ranged unit to just stand still ai will often prioritize targeting sabotaging or annoying the player even if it means certain doom for its faction player units are utterly unable to finish off a broken leadership fleeing unit especially if it is a single entity like a foot lord squads of large sized ranged units like salamander razordon hunting packs after finishing a move order will take forever to wiggle around before actually firing confederated lords for factions that have loyalty mechanics skaven etc will often start at zero loyalty confederated lords will sometimes not be able to change their mounts confederated legendary lords will sometimes lack their immortality trait meaning their next death is permanent completely non functional mechanic for automatic development of cities everyone forgot this even exists in game because it never worked ai lacking any proper skill builds for most lords and heroes which both makes them weaker and makes those lords useless for confederation bugs related to construct able objects on defensive maps where units get stuck in barricades or can not attack them fresh bugs like bretonia damsels wood elf ariel nakai unit recruitment etc etc black ark unique map army spawn positions again bugged after it was fixed in late tww 2 black ark capability to offer recruitment to nearby delf armies bugs out when the black ark is garrisoned in a city ai will readily kill its own armies by trying to occupy ruins that have just been destroyed by extremely unfriendly but not yet at war factions which are still surrounding that location from the previous turns razing ai will readily abandon its capital city and flee to some meaningless tier 1 settlement when facing an equal force instead of fighting where its chance is best inside the capitol some sea objects like islands treasure skull carcass will cause a guaranteed crash to desktop ai will insist on besieging a weak settlement for 10 turns despite outnumbering overpowering the garrison 5 to 1 and auto resolve showing certain defeat for the players city various lord hero equippable ancillaries that fail to work properly vampire count coast ui for showing raise dead pool possibilities near city bar ui does not show units recruit able from battle casualties certain unique cathay caravan rewards are again inaccessible despite being fixed in some previous

14157,so i finally bit the bullet and got this despite the repeated frustrations of random ganking by allies in most total war games first off i have to say that the review bombing for the game not having immortal empires on release is pretty stupid nothing releases perfectly these days and a degree of patience is expected also let s face it ie is only a pat on the head for everyone that just got stuck to playing certain of the old factions so it s just more of the same secondly it s easy to ignore the fact that there have been massive quality of life improvements with wh3 going back and playing 2 again is an absolute snore fest by comparison not to mention that it is vastly inferior graphically the prologue tutorial is fun and vastly superior to having to mess around with individual tutorials with an advisor blathering on about the most remedial rubbish from previous tw games if you ve ever played a single tw game of any kind you can either set advice to low or turn it off altogether for those worried about the crazy amount of dlc when you include those from 2 you needn t because they are all optional and not needed in any way shape or form outside of multiplayer if you are on a budget then do yourself a favour and just get the base game and install radious mods which add more to the game for free than any dlc outside of the cool prologue what you have here is a more interesting new main campaign more and far more delineated and interesting factions cathay is clearly the jewel in this new crown and they are great fun to play khorne are massively changed from the old beastmen demon prince is powerful and fun and continues directly from the prologue and chaos dwarves which have a completely different campaign to the others works like a total conversion mod if you decide to get that particular dlc throw in the fact that for those who actually want more of the same being able to use everything they bought previously through mortal empires and you have a vast overall improvement from 2,124.8,30.0,2,Recommended,March 20,Total War: WARHAMMER III,"MrMuse

14161,2023 if you are exploring this game as a new player to total war warhammer i would recommend you steer clear of this franchise for now after playing this game for years it is clear the developers have moved on to a new focus and are simply dragging out this game as a means to invest into other projects this can be seen with the other negative reviews and the 200 of dlc for this game inherently this isn t a bad thing however due to the drive to continue to bring revenue from the franchise at the cheapest cost their new dlc updates have fundamentally broken the game examples of this can be seen in various game crashes poor ai decision making faction abilities not working correctly and multiple quality of life game functionality that has not been implemented correctly fundamentally its the elements above that make the game no longer a pleasure to play and why i would not recommend anyone to buy into this franchise as it stands today it is a huge shame to see such an amazing idea grow into a great product only to be dismantled by poor business practice,918.9,25.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 23, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"FinalOdyssey

14196,2022 edited 09 08 2023im adding on to my previous review in light of the dlc price reveal for shadows of change 25 euroes is a joke thats almost half of baldurs gate 3 for less content than some older dlc i dont know if its sega forcing the price or ca being arrogant but this kind of customer milking while not even fixing existing bugs regularly makes me sad more than anything else whats supposed to be a capstone of the trilogy is just being constantly mistreated as a money cow with the attitude of they re going to lap it up anyway needless to say i wont be buying the dlc review edit end complacency if there was one word to describe this game its complacency warhammer 3 isnt a bad game not enough to usually warrant a negative review but in the context of its messy launch lackluster or poorly thought out content the entire selling model of the franchise and knowledge that the main team has been pulled off the project entirely definitely makes it clear the higher ups just expected it to sell with no respect for the consumer,168.3,24.0,0,Not Recommended,"May 14, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,deVoid

14236,2022 tldr the key element of real time strategy clear unit cohesion is missing from the game as it is to illustrate the problem let us compare the game to total war rome 2 and how units worked in the game compared to tw iii for example sparta in r2 as a faction was revolved around sturdy and immovable heavy spear infantry backed up with ranged units like slingers and archers your key gameplan was to play like a turtle seek chokepoints and position your troops to maximize their effectiveness your direct counter was anything more mobile than you your infantry would devastate any cavalry dumb enough to charge at them however due to their slowness if you were careless your ranged units would be caught out on the open and destroyed then your spear infantry would be at a disadvantage since they lacked damage output however if you accounted for this well you d still manage to win battles while dishing out tons of ranged damage tying up enemy troops with your own durable heavy infantry in tw iii as a comparison cathay is a faction that is supposed to have strong spear infantry like jade warriors that have charge defense against all cathay has tons of powerful ranged infantry ranging from archers to muskets to cannons now you d expect to hold your line with well positioned rows of spear infantry while trying to watch out for more mobile enemies what you ll find out is that many enemy units just ignore your infantry that is supposed to tie them down for large units like trolls that is to be expected but even medium units like ork boyz run through your spear walls like thin air not around or anything straight through the unit medium charge units like panthers etc do as well when you try to reposition you ll find your units respond to commands late and sluggishly you might find out that your archers have actually stopped firing at targets within their los for over half the battle in the majority of occasions you ll have your entire ranged arsenal wiped out as the first thing in battle either by frontline jank or spells the best alternative is to get the most expensive heroes or generals possible leader units have tons of hp and armor and they deal more damage than most ranged units ever could both in melee and with their abilities they can continue dishing out ranged damage even while being engaged by enemy infantry and can hold their own at least for a while against multiple units even the most expensive artillery pales in comparison to nukes all of the playable factions can call down from the sky if the hero is in range babysitting cannons with a squad of infantry that cant even occupy marauders or any other unit is a waste in comparison since even a second in contact with melee combat breaks your artillery pieces i might be the only one to feel it like so but the best units are large units with firepower unlike their smaller fragile counterparts since antilarge units aren t in many cases durable enough or numerous enough in most armies to take them on even in previous games looking at you tw2 necrofex colossus doomstack if i m wrong please enlighten me so until immortal empires drops i d like more factions in the game that it lacks thus the negative review edit in the recent patch even bullets go through infantry you can fire friendly musket units through your on infantry to hit enemies with no penalty every infantry unit in the game is practically immaterial,83.0,19.0,1,Not Recommended,"June 21, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Noobinati

14238,2023 wow looked up the post myself because i didn t want to believe it the right to discuss is a privilege cathe amount of effort ca has put into butchering their public relations recently is honestly inspiring i remember when ca s dreams were more important to them than their wallets those days are gone another reviewer said it s time to accept that the ca we knew and loved is dead and that s very likely true some advice revive three kingdoms with one or two fairly priced dlcs invest in fixing and polishing the base game for tww3 then layout a public road map on how you re going to give your once loyal and adoring fans back the ca they remember edit to the people defending the pricing of titles such as this with lines such as it s just the price of a pizza and a soda that is comparing apples to nuclear submarines if ca was making a pizza and providing a soda to each and every single player individually the effort expense to profit ratio makes sense they are not making pizzas and providing sodas however they are in fact developing something called video games granted it can take considerable effort to develop said video games each game only has to be developed once just once now if you divide up that one time effort equally between millions of purchases while i still grant it s a lot of effort in total i promise that the divided effort per purchase does not equate to a pizza and a soda that is why game companies that are even somewhat successful become cash cows beyond any accountant s wildest wet dream and will often recycle content and engines as long as they can to milk their fans over and over for less and less work that s also why small companies with a lot of talent and love can become millionaire game dev superstars with just one or two successful titles and then they get bought out by take two the bottom line is please don t compare games to pizzas,92.9,23.0,1,Not Recommended,"November 21, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Korvyr

14311,2023 while total war warhammer 3 had a rocky launch once the immortal empires update launched it initially seemed as though lessons had been learned and improvements were going to steadily come tragically things have not panned out well updates are extremely slow and leave gamebreaking bugs in the game for months at a time said updates come almost solely alongside new dlc but said dlc also have a habit of introducing new bugs to the game creating a problematic circle i will not go into too much about the latest dlc here as this review is about the main game but this game s trend is highly concerning and the latest dlc which is very expensive for the amount of content on offer and leaves many core design issues unresolved is part of any consideration of the game s future prospects as things stand at this time i cannot recommend this game so long as it stands on its current course prospective fans should instead consider total war warhammer 2 as while it has less content it is more polished by far and will regardless satiate a new player for dozens to hundreds of hours until hopefully warhammer 3 has received the treatment it needs,514.4,16.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 20, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Ashi

14381,2022 many people describe the state of this game as abysmal or terrible or unplayable which i feel is pretty hyperbolic i bought this and played it at launch and had a good time from the get go as per other total war titles the voice acing music and overall sound design is amazing perhaps the best in the series the new lords are pretty memorable and all have unique personalities and memorable quotes the visuals are also pretty tight the map feels more alive and the effects of chaos effected areas are fun to look at the design of cities across all the new factions are also really amazing and unique the field battles are very fun and hold up compared to other titles in the series really no complaints with the field battles the siege battles can get a bit tedious in my opinion but the new improvements to the settlement battles have been a welcome improvement it seems one of the biggest complaints is with the chaos invasions and the mechanics in the chaos realms themselves i do agree these mechanics can be frustrating but in all my multiple playthroughs i never found these mechanics to so frustrating they led me to quit the game or restart the campaign i played on medium difficulty overall i think this is another fun instalment in the total war series and i give it a strong recommendation i think it is difficult to compare this to total war warhammer ii which has had years of time to develop into the game it is now people also note this game feels unfinished i do think covid definitely played a part in the development cycle which placed the developers in a precarious position i do think this game feels unpolished in many ways but i would not go so far as to say it feels unfinished i ve been a total war fan since shogun 1 and the original medieval total war and i believe this is a fun and welcome entry to the series with an optimistic future,734.5,21.0,0,Recommended,"July 15, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"PunchRockGroin

14456,2022 the hate this game has received is both fair and unjustified the game did have some fundamental development problems that meant that aspects of the overall game that where altered to praise by the community lord hero skill trees and tech trees as one example were reverted back to how they were halfway through wh2 s life cycle in other aspects however the game was an improvement over wh2 even after multiple years of updates diplomacy graphics to name a few understand before buying this game that this game is already fun i will say however that the campaign objectives do not encourage traditional tw gameplay i e sandbox experience and empire building updates have meant that you can kind of ignore the objective until you are ready but its still not perfect if you are looking for a cool story driven rts tbs game this will do i would also suggest this game to anyone wanting to get into twwh as this game is only going to get better and better and there are many aspects of wh2 that makes it jarring to play now that i have the updated model sieges diplomacy and the overall map if you own wh1 2 and are wandering about getting 3 wait i would strongly suggest waiting until ie comes out if you know you know because i guarantee that there is a faction you love playing now and will miss like crazy in the current game for me its vampire counts and gs in conclusion i do not agree with the review hate this game has received even though i understand this game is not perfect particularly as a concluding chapter in a trilogy but this game is still fun i would rate it 7 10 in its current state with the possibility if ca meet their current roadmap deadlines to become possibly a 9 or 10 10,384.9,32.0,3,Recommended,"May 18, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,luv child of hansolo and chewy
14468,2023 did paradox make this game psa this is my general review of the entire warhammer total war trilogy because immortal empires is the only thing i give a about 304 77 300 whole pound sterling is how much it would cost to unlock every single faction and character across the map i get that its a big game and i can understand it being expensive but hello the micro transactions being more expensive than the base games is already taking the piss even if you ignore the limited map size and faction choice in an attempt to sink all your money into buying all three games immortal empires what i ve been waiting for since the first warhammer total war was announced when my balls hadn t even dropped yet is unfortunately still lacking the ai is more autistic than all the discord moderators of the world combined and by turn 100 it feels like a repeat of a random 20 stack alone appearing out of nowhere after the ai walks to timbuktu and back crossing through territory owned by neighbours they are also at war with just to sack one of my settlements on the opposite side of the country diplomacy for me is completely useless unless i want to assimilate a legendary lord of a same race faction or try to be at peace with a completely random chaos nation across half the world that declared war on me to then invade me from 100000 miles away the end game crisis events while imo is a pretty brainless and easy way out method of making the game have some sort of actual goal are quite fun but once again ruined by the player targeting agenda that all the ai have ingrained into them and makes it a constant loop of turn by turn fighting settlement by settlement reconquering so it takes about 3 hours just to push back a handful of settlements thankfully i only bought this game while it was on sale opting for a game key website to get the second one because it still was a better price than the christmas sale if i did however buy it when it first came out i imagine i could write even more about how much worse everything was when it first released which was months later than they said they would release it regardless of all this i am going to continue playing this in an endless loop of playing different factions to turn 130 where i will then get bored and switch to another because i hate myself more than i hate this game thanks for readingno tl dr because if you re debating whether or not you should get something this expensive you should put some thought into it,246.9,17.0,2,Not Recommended,"January 11, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Ianitori

14626,2022 total war warhammer 3 is the latest game in the grand strategy franchise where the player will command armies containing thousands of soldiers in real time battles while also managing their empire on the turn based world map this is the 7th total war game i ve played following both previous warhammers shogun 2 rome 2 three kingdoms and troy while i enjoy the real world historical games the warhammer games are my favourites because of the variety provided by the different races which helps to keep lengthy campaigns interesting immortal empiresi m basing this review on the immortal empires campaign where the maps from all three warhammer games have been combined into one giant world map featuring every faction who has appeared in the franchise most of my time has been spent playing as the grand cathay faction led by zhao ming the scale of this campaign is incredible i ve eliminated a faction of cathay rebels skaven dark elves ogres nurgle chaos and two factions of vampires who all thought it was a good idea to declare war on me plus a couple of beastmen armies who were raiding in my territory i ve got alliances with three neighbouring cathay factions one is defending the great bastion which reminds me of the wall in game of thrones from chaos armies to the north while the other two have expanded south through lands previously held by lizardmen they ve helped to keep my borders mostly secure allowing me to focus on fighting all these wars between us we now own 65 settlements i ve earned the short victory and if i confederated my allies i d be close to the long victory its taken 45 hours and 138 turns to reach this point often fighting multiple battles per turn and there are still 91 other factions on the map on my western border high elves are fighting more skaven while some greenskins have attempted to invade my empire twice i ve also had to defend my north western border against multiple attacks by another chaos faction led by archaon the everchosen the final boss of the first game meanwhile in lands so far to the west that i can t even imagine how long it would take me to get there are large empires belonging to the tomb kings dwarves wood elves slaanesh and the empire all hail mighty grand cathay a screenshot of total war warhammer iii by g00n3r varied factionscathay s playing style feels like a typical total war campaign where i m capturing settlements constructing buildings to upgrade my economy and fund more armies to further extend my empire their armies have a good all round mixture of melee ranged and cavalry units but they also have some unique features they can send trade caravans to the capital cities of friendly western empires to earn big profits but enemy armies especially ogres in the mountains can attack the caravans during their journey they have to pay attention to harmony where most buildings generals research and events favour either yin or yang when they re balanced you get bonuses to income growth and control public order but when yin yang are unbalanced you start to get penalties and every few turns you can choose which direction to set the wu xing compass which controls the winds of magic this is almost entirely a positive thing which lets you get bonuses depending on what you re planning to do over the next few turns reduce recruitment cost if you want to raise a new army increase replenishment when you re fighting lots of battles increase income if your economy is struggling increase control to avoid rebellions or reduce corruption when you re capturing territory that has been held by vampires or chaos factions such as nurgle i ve also spent around 10 hours playing as skarbrand s exiles of khorne whose tactics feel very different to be honest i m not sure i fully understand how to play them but i m starting to have some success their armies lack ranged units and are focused on strong melee and cavalry but the biggest difference is how their economy works they don t earn much money from buildings and their units are very expensive to recruit so it feels like capturing territory is a waste of time because i d never be able to support enough armies to defend a large empire instead i think the correct tactic is to have a couple of armies quickly rampaging around the map from one settlement to the next sacking to earn enough money to pay upkeep and razing to either earn skulls needed to research new tech or spawn medium size temporary armies for free who automatically disband after a few turns but give you a short term boost to military strength so while cathay is about building and expanding khorne is focused on destruction which feels appropriate for a faction belonging to the blood god and this illustrates how the different factions don t just have units that look unique they offer very varied playing experiences which provides a lot of replay potential technicalso far the game has crashed 3 times but i suppose that s actually pretty good for 60 hours of playing time in a campaign that is still labelled as a beta i haven t noticed any other bugs and i ve had no problems with framerate even though there are hundreds of factions armies and settlements on the map the end turn process moves quite fast the visual design and animations for all the different units is really good and i like how the appearance of the world map changes based on its level of corruption from green grass and trees to a scorched wasteland recommendationwarhammer 3 is an excellent game that veteran total war players will most likely enjoy the scale of the immortal empires campaign is easily worth a full price purchase assuming you already own the previous warhammer games as reaction to this game s story campaign which i haven t tried yet was quite negative new players would probably have more fun by starting with warhammer 1 and 2 which both have strong story campaigns,174.2,23.0,3,Recommended,"October 1, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"G00N3R

14668,2023 this is actually the first time i have had a hard time writing a review on a game weirder still i haven t ever really ever been inclined to leave a negative review on a tw game even the saga games for what they were i found enjoyable to a degree normally speaking it has been pretty black and white i either enjoyed the game and its mechanics or i didn t however with the release of the new dlc the sheer lacklustre attempt made by ca to generate new content for their players and keep prices reasonable is nothing short of a joke the game in and of itself isn t necessarily even bad i still find myself plugging away hours of tzeentch however the response by the creators to their literal target audience you know the people that feed their continued ability to create any games let alone make those that they do actually succeed in the marketplace was shocking buy our or we stop supporting the product was the theme of the day on this one we appear to live in a day and age where justified criticism over a product from its consumer for it not feeling like it justified the cost applied or like a complete product is met with threats and not understanding or a genuine attempt to engage those involved should honestly be ashamed of themselves and not be then overly surprised if their next product doesn t do as well as it may have done this is literally how you diminish your target audience not how you grow it unless of course they took a look at bud light and thought to themselves hold my beer would strongly advise they fire their pr team and perhaps hire someone competent after that stunt,432.5,20.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 31, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Chris

14844,2022 this was written before champions of chaos was announced i will not be changing the rating delivering unfinished products and updating them later is not a practice that should be rewarded i m new to total war i began with warhammer ii back in 2019 inspired to purchase by mandalore s video i enjoy 2 far more than 3 tl dr don t buy this even on a sale wait for it to be complete because it isn t done yet let s start with the game itself the campaign is ass granted it s much better than it was on launch but you d think ca would have taken criticism of the vortex campaign in 2 and made something more bearable but it isn t as a matter of fact it s worse than the vortex you are hard pushed to play the campaign whereas vortex allowed more freedom one of the reasons that roc sucks so much is these rifts that start spawning after 30 turns and spew chaos corruption which tanks the control of your settlements and one of four effects depending on the flavor of monster energy you have to deal with these rifts will also pop out enemy agents and sometimes armies that will always prioritize you as the game goes on and more souls are collected these armies will become stronger and stronger until you have to start babysitting your settlements lest they are torn from your control and you start hemorrhaging even more money and you have to do this for every province group of settlements thus the game almost forces you into two or three if you re lucky provinces so you can manage whatever the rifts decide to puke at you all while handling anywhere between 2 to 5 different enemies and their 3 deathstack armies on your own that s yet another issue potential a new background mechanic that was introduced in warhammer 3was faction potential which from what i m aware of dictates how much a given ai faction will cheat and they will cheat the thing is minor factions have significantly less potential than factions directly competing against you in roc this indirectly affects diplomacy specifically military alliances when you ally either defensive or military that faction s ai is heavily gimped their potential hits rock bottom and they will be hard pressed to protect their province capitals with 20 stacks and if that faction just so happens to be of your race say cathay or kislev good luck confederating because for some godforsaken reason the ai considers your military power in addition to theirs when you offer confederation now some of these issues may have been already addressed but i don t care as of original writing i have not touched this game since april two months after its release which fun fact is about how long it took for a patch to come out that even slightly addressed these issues ca s radio silence for the first three months of warhammer 3 s release is despicable warhammer 2 received many more substantial updates including the highly anticipated map painting mode in one month we are expected to receive a beta for immortal empires in september what s even more frustrating is a relatively small issue that being slow replenishment for tzeentch and slaanesh being on a roadmap that should have been fixed a week after release,629.9,133.0,10,Not Recommended,"June 29, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,purp

14912,2022 unfortunately this game has some controversy around its launch that i feel is overblown and judging the game as it is today march 22 2022 i still consider this game to be worth a purchase and your time the negativity surrounding this game is partly related to bugs which have been present in just about every total war game at their launch and the narrative campaign that the game launched with i am not concerned with the bugs in the game right now none of them are game breaking and ca has a history of stamping out the more serious bugs in their previous games the newest patch notes show that they are aware of and are working on these bugs the narrative campaign is admittedly not my preferred way to play a total war game as i would rather play a sandbox mode but the campaign as it is today is still fun to play and i think more fun than the vortex campaign in warhammer 2 which i played maybe 2 or 3 times in the warhammer 3 narrative campaign rifts will open up at a regular basis out of which will spawn enemy heroes and armies you can close these rifts with your own armies or heroes but if you want to win the campaign as intended you need to take your main legendary lord into these gates where they have to go through a gauntlet battles attrition mazes effectively taking them off the main map for about 10 turns the rifts and the gauntlets themselves were never a big deal for me annoying but not a game breaker for me i was still able to expand a wide empire without my legendary lord on the field the latest patch notes offer solutions to increase the rewards in the gauntlets and even prevent the rifts from opening in the first place which would allow the player to not even interact with the narrative campaign at all what makes me like this game so much are the races just about every race in the game looks fun to play i managed to beat the campaign 3 times in the month since launch and am eager to go back and try another race it is rare that i feel this way as i easily spent a couple hundred hours just playing beastmen in warhammer 2 before their rework the combined map and campaign have not been released yet it has been known that the new combined map will take longer to come out than it did in warhammer 2 so i feel it is silly to expect it at launch or even a month after and until it comes out we only have the narrative campaign to play which is not a problem for me i am having a good time playing it when the combined map comes out i could see warhammer 3 becoming my forever game like warhammer 2 was which is a game that i always have installed and will come back to regularly in the years to come,893.9,23.0,4,Recommended,"March 22, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Chummy 8

15198,2023 the ai is not fun all it does is attack you with overwhelming odds you ll never fight a winnable defensive battle without absolutely cheesing the ai and it constantly runs from every fight it s not favored in the reason ai gets insane bonuses to combat and economy is so we can have a challenging and fun experience with ai running multiple stacks and stronger units if it uses that to abuse information the player doesn t see fov to attack undefended settlements and then further starve them out until there s no chance of victory if it runs from every fight not in their favor what s the point it s ok if the ai occasionally does this that would make it look smarter but it s so bad ca had to remove small settlement siege battles because the game was boring and the ai refused to fight running around in ai s territory unless the ai had a overwhelming advantage i ve never seen it come and try and stop my army on the field,570.6,23.0,2,Not Recommended,"April 9, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Caeruleus Mors

15201,2022 regretting the purchase should have bought it in some months today 2 months after release they released 1 1 patch fixing many many issues many including technical ones still left to be fixed and its the 3rd entry of the saga so they should have learned now basic content expected to release not later than 1 month after games launch like the blood and gore pack something basic for many that is not shipped with core game due to ratings is postponed until who knows when the excuse the bad state of the game which justifies months and months of fixing until the game has a decent low amount of bugs and some decent optimization regarding performance for many of us who like to enjoy zoomed in battles the lack of blood gore and killing animations etc breaks the deal i played it for 50h expected the content to release like in total warhammer 1 and 2 1 month after release and nothing happened now its a broken toy the player count is below minimum the forums is full of people like me saying regretting the day 1 purchase now back to the waiting game its an aaa studio that has profits spilling from their ears but join the bandwagon of releasing ultra broken games and patching them in the coming months this is not even an mmo not even a live service game but looks like 2 months after release we are very dependant on the developers as many many more bugfixing and performance patches are needed,76.2,16.0,0,Not Recommended,"April 5, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"MeGa

15209,2022 this used to be a review about how much of a mess this launch was let me clarify it is still a mess half the factions you paid for have bugs so severe they can ruin playthroughs when chaos dwarves came out i stopped playing as there was a fatal crash that came with the tooltip update this took i believe over a month to fix the game gets no updates some say only one dude is in charge of updates all together and honestly i m at a point where i m willing to believe it they are pooling their money into other projects all the while draining their succesful franchises for corporate profits they use their employees as meat shields saying costs are up they ve made record profits i d be surprised if 1 of the money made from price gouging will go to employees and not the ceo who seems to be an ardent defender of this change i wonder if this could have to do with the fact ceo s make around 400 more money on average than normal workers most of which comes from boni gained by price gouging such as this none of this will go to the working people all of it will end in the pockets of people who openly despise you let me also here just address the elephant in the room 150 price increase yes you did not misread this is real this is reality as absurd as the idea of a 150 price increase sounds nothing more really needs to be said they killed three kingdoms for cash now they re killing this is this ca s fault is it sega s fault does it matter do not support it this game the people behind it do not respect you and don t be a fool you can buy a good game like baldur s gate instead and that s my recommendation leave this accursed land of warhammer 3 and never return,531.6,170.0,18,Not Recommended,"February 17, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Kaleidio

15285,warhammer 3 a fun game that introduced kislev grand cathay chaos dwarfs the prince of chaos and the realm of chaos factions like khorne nurgle tzeench and slanneesh which if you like chaos or like human factions is a win as those factions mostly don t have any dlc unlocking important units i think that will make a large difference in how you play the game and how enjoyable it is but outside these new factions other factions suffer from dlc before you start reading the rest of this please know that i only made this negative cause i myself do not enjoy the factions of chaos and one of the two human factions above and again these reviews are all opinion based it is okay to disagree with my opinion but for the love of god don t be immature and start name calling my problem with the game is the dlc and how much content is locked behind them and some containing entire species locked behind them for those who don t know and are looking at this game series without having played warhammer 1 2 and 3 most factions on the game map require dlc which if you are a elf lover is fine cause most of their content is free but for any other faction including the realm of man has most of it s content locked behind dlc and both warhammer 1 and 2 have some content in it s base game that s locked in 3 so if you want to play those factions you have to buy those games as well i haven t even mentioned how much it all costs it costs a new player around 150 to get all the dlc edit if you don t care about the dlc and the factions in it then i recommend getting the game but if you don t like generic humans elves or dwarfs then this game is either going empty your wallet or you shouldn t get the game species locked behind dlcnote they all are in their own separate dlcs not in one or two dlcs beastmen pirate coast not really a species but is a faction different from the main faction with it s own entirely different units and mechanics similar to above chaos dwarves ogre kingdoms warriors of chaos the chaos factions from the second game wood elves norse men tomb kings bretonnia i don t suggest getting this faction at all they are bad unless cav spam i will be mocked by a couple of people in warhammer 3s community for hating the large amount of dlc and the requirement to buy each and every game but i d rather inform people than not,109.9,38.0,3,Not Recommended,April 30,Total War: WARHAMMER III,"The Intercom

15488,2022 as someone who has been a huge fan of the total war series since empire total war back in 2009 i have over 5000 hours of game play through the different games i feel like i have a good understanding of these games i have to say warhammer 3 has been a huge disappointment from the start very limited amount of factions to play if you re only playing the wh3 campaign very limited set of units for each factions with most factions only have 2 units of renown main story isn t too bad but after doing it 3 4 times it gets very repetitive as theres isn t many ways to complete the campaign and some factions are absolutely terrible compared to the others legion of chaos is one all units you get are weak versions of the actual factions worshipping a single chaos god the main campaign also have some game breaking bugs that just make the game not fun to play as example my buddy got one of his settlements attacked drops in to the battle and the ogres that are attacking him bug at the entrance of the settlement and sit there till they re dead giving him free wins when it clearly shouldn t some battles the players has clearly the stronger army lord and heroes but when you attack it says something along the lines of valiant defeat when you know for a fact that the iron dragon of cathay is supposed to eat up nurglings like his morning cereal but you re then forced to waste 5 10 minutes of your time to do a drop in battle that was completely unnecessary to begin with you can select units and send them somewhere but for some reason they stand still even after selecting and trying to move them 5 times for the immortal empire i am aware that they re still working on it and it will get better but with the last patch its only made things worst they removed minor settlement siege battles cause apparently people live in the trees now instead of buildings and for some reason they re constantly making the terrain a hill for my opponents as for large settlements the tower placements are terrible often being behind tall buildings or walls so the tower shots never connect they constantly hit everything but the intended targets wall get taken down by peasants with swords or spears towers get murdered by tier 1 harpies that literally lose to everything else your units will also break moral in the stupidest way running while being 80 90 hp and into the enemy units instead of running away and for no reason even if you re sitting with 14 healthy units with a lord and heroes still being present i could keep ranting amount all the other issues i ve found but it would taken way too much time anyway all this to say total war warhammer 3 is an incomplete game with an industrial amount of balancing and bug fixing until it becomes fun and worth while to play and currently the only fun part of the game is the immortal empire that doesn t even allow players to select other races apart from the wh3 if they don t own all 3 warhammer games example buddy of mine has wh3 and wh2 with all dlcs but the game won t let him choose a wh2 faction even though he already owns the content of it he was forced to buy wh1 to be able to access the other factions that he s already paid for i will not be returning to wh3 until the game has been worked on some more and even then i ll probably have to pay more to get the additional content that we were supposed to have to begin with so i may refund the game and stick to wh2 i don t know anymore thank you for taking the time to read my rant and feel free to let me know what you guys think,267.2,26.0,2,Not Recommended,"October 20, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Clarence Creek

16563,2022 tldr i pre ordered three copies of this game for myself and two friends both myself and my friend have systems that exceed the recommended requirements both of us have had a 50 fps drop using the same settings in tww3 vs 2 and it is not apparent why this is after installing the nvidia game ready drivers and following forum suggestions i question why this game is 79 99 and whether it was adequately optimized tested further there are many bugs ranging from hilarious to game mechanic breaking i cannot therefore recommend it in its current state ca broke my trust once with abruptly ending three kingdoms and leaving it unfinished now they have the audacity to charge full price for a half finished game i am tired of pre ordering from game companies and getting unfinished product the warhammer team is supposed to be better than that i guess not full review it is finally here after the long wait the end of a trilogy sadly the game runs exceptionally poorly what were the devs thinking i was getting 70 fps on ultra 1080p on tww2 with tww3 i get barely above 30 fps with frame skipping below that from time to time this is even with the game ready drivers going through forums even individuals with the latest and greatest hardware also have problems based on reviews i expected a 20 decrease in performance but instead now have a 50 decrease this makes the game unplayable i question how much effort ca put into optimization in essence the devs in my opinion need to step up and fix the performance issues looking at forums i am not the only one having issues and i have no problems with any other total war or other games bug wise the game gave me two achievements when i only watched the intro videos that was strange there are issues with pathfinding during city battles where the ai will go in circles during city fights this is comical in some cases but it means you have no meaningful opposition the last bug i picked up is that one of the research items for slaanesh causes you not to be able to vassalize factions this breaks an integral mechanic in the game if you change any graphics settings your cursor wont work if you click on the ui you have to quit the game to do so the only way to do that is to slightly click outside of the ui button to quit in conclusion even if you are a fan of the warhammer universe save some money and buy it later the game feels half finished and is significantly overpriced i am willing to change my review if things get fixed but currently i can t play the game i bought and neither can my friend,117.4,246.0,40,Not Recommended,"February 17, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"l33tn3ss_17

16847,2022 i have tried to like this i really have as someone who sank 2000 hours into warhammer 2 i couldn t wait to see what came next what came next was a truly awful gameplay experience there are problems everywhere from performance to ai to presentation and it s hard to know where to start when listing the failings the campaign mechanics are almost without fail terrible from the cathayan caravans causing you to endure the exact same battle turn after turn after turn to the godawful rift system forcing you to run around the map closing rifts over and over the campaign map is visually jarring the ai is predictable and dull furnished with unimaginative cheats at higher difficulty levels too easy how about we give them three stacks instead of one in my most recent abandoned due to utter boredom campaign 4 stacks from distant factions trekked across the map to arrive at my capital on the same turn for no apparent reason crossing hostile lands unmolested bypassing undefended settlements as they did so at the same time a swarm of 8 agents from 4 factions surrounded my leader s army as she wandered around apparently doing nothing other than standing looking at her merely finding my army to select it was a headache if this was near endgame and i was on the verge of victory i could understand but this was before the first round of rifts even spawned what else the revamped settlement battles are tedious beyond belief the defender is furnished with a steady supply of free towers to mow down intruders while the troops play ring a ring of roses in endless circles through the streets the autoresolve is so nonsensical that you are forced to play almost every battle even when the result is totally beyond doubt lest you lose hundreds of troops unnecessarily manually play the battle and lose 2 soldiers autoresolve 50 losses 4 turns wasted replenishment 4 turns that you don t have thanks to the fun destroying race for the rifts things may improve if the mortal empires version is released i ll take another look at it then maybe but in it s current state it is unplayable avoid tl dr appallingly bad play wh2 instead it is far far superior,966.6,21.0,0,Not Recommended,"April 12, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Lost soul

and bugs that they haven t even acknowledged despite being in game since launch the list becomes unmanageable when trying to compile all of them there are 276 bugs that the community bug fix mod alone covers there are hundreds more that aren t covered calling it unacceptable seems like an understatement i waited 18 months to post a review to give them time to rechart the course of the game while i will still hold out some hope for the series primarily because i have enjoyed them so much in the past and that it fills a niche with no real competitors it is clear that creative assembly has underfunded and underdeveloped the game exploited the good will they garnered after total war warhammer ii and will continue to do so if you want to continue supporting them that is your prerogative but i can no longer gloss over the myriad failures with the game and company,241.5,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 8, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"that guy who was unnamed

17738,2023 product received for free i give large props for the free play across the 4 days i racked up a fair amount of hours and just about all i needed to know that i will maybe buy this game in the future for a really heavy discount this is a true sequel in that it is much the same game which is great but also it has the same huge issue that total war 2 has the ai is pyschic they know when they ll win they know when you ll lose they know when you move this is particularly problematic losing the ability to have walls in your non capitals the only saving grace in tw2 was being able to turtle and rush walls so you ll at least get one turn generally to stop a army that wiggled it s way through your vision at march speed knowing you couldn t catch it this is also particularly sad because capital battles basically don t happen they only did happen before because if everything is wall d they re going to attack somewhere now they just will avoid your walled cities like the plague until they can out number you in a hilarious degree as a point to this i beat the entire campaign without one capital battle not one coming from shogun total war 2 that is so sad base defenses were a huge part of what made total war amazing some good notes they made several good changes to things like diplomacy giving things point values so you don t have to guess see where your ai friends were routing defending etc made enemy heroes not gods yea i m talking about you grimgor and several others from tw2 several other improvements were definitely noticable being able to trade settles to from your empire is massive most of the lords were boring and pretty weak slaneesh faction was silly op everyone was my friend or my vassel letting me pick and choose who i want to murder the issue comes down to the fact that it s just boring auto resolve will be right 95 of the time and mean there is no real reason for you to fight a battle nearly all the campaign people don t even have another legendary lord to confederate with and just one unique gear quest to do idk it s not a horrible game and they did make some positive changes but i find very little reason to buy play this over tw2,82.8,39.0,4,Not Recommended,"March 14, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Xaduk
17761,2023 edit what i wrote below about the dlc pricing is still true but right now there is a bigger issue with the game performance everyone complains about the poor optimisation and since the latest update it s hit a point where i don t even want to play wh3 anymore i no longer consider this game an upgrade and now just really recommend just sticking with wh2 i wish i had if you liked the other warhammer games then you ll like this one too there are enough improvements to justify the upgrade from wh2 and the new races are fun however the dlc pricing for this third game is becoming ridiculous 20 for the new chaos dwarfs dlc if you re going to invest your money in this franchise seriously consider what you are willing to spend at this point to buy the complete set of games and dlcs is pushing 200,242.1,18.0,1,Not Recommended,"March 14, 2023",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Dukee8

17927,2022 english first off all in really wanted to give this game an positiv review but there are to many issues right now with the game to do so honestly i was really worried that if i bought the game i might be really desperate to be in a situation where i would be really frustrated with the game s development so far that s exactly why i really struggled with whether i wanted to risk it in the end my fears were justified namely the corresponding error and imperfection in really many small details which in sum left me with a really bland feeling on the tongue which is why i can only advise anyone who expects and desires an error free and perfect game against the game i will of course follow the further development of the game with great confidence because it is still warhammer but at this point there are just too many bugs that make it impossible for me to give it a positive rating still unchanged 10 11 2022deutsch zun chst einmal wollte ich diesem spiel wirklich eine positive bewertung geben aber es gibt im moment zu viele probleme mit dem spiel um dies zu tun ehrlich gesagt war ich wirklich besorgt dass wenn ich mir das spiel kaufe ich wohl m glich echt verzweifelt sein k nnte in einer situation zu sein in der ich wirklich frustriert ber die bisherige spiel entwicklung sein werde genau deshalb habe ich wirklich mit mir gehadert ob ich es wohl riskieren will am ende waren meine bef rchtungen doch berechtigt n mlich dem entsprechenden fehler und unvollkommenheit in wirklich vielen kleinen einzelheiten die in summe mir ein echt fades gef hl auf der zunge hinterlassen hat weshalb ich nur jedem der ein fehler freies und vollkommenes spiel erwartet und sich w nscht von dem spiel abraten kann ich werde nat rlich die weiter entwicklung des spiels mit gro er zuversicht verfolgen denn es ist immer noch warhammer aber zu dem jetzigen zeitpunkt gibt es einfach zu viele fehler die mir es unm glich machen eine positive bewertung zu geben immer noch unver ndert 10 11 2022,699.3,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"October 7, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,"Faith

18077,2022 so denovu is still causing performance issues as it was never removed since release also they are still fixing basic bugs that have been in the game since launch i m certain this game was not play tested at all 2 2 was supposedly the biggest patch yet most of the list of changes are fixes that again have been in the game since release like how have ca handled this game and its development probably worse than rome 2 at least they mostly fixed that fairly quickly,142.3,21.0,0,Not Recommended,"February 19, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Chillnic_

18117,2022 tldr don t buy lots of bugs that ca seem reluctant to fix plus pricing is a problem original review posted july 2022 see bottom of review so its been almost a year since i wrote my short review to answer any questions about performance it has improved greatly it s still not the best but it is miles better than it was for me at least as for pricing i stand with the larger community ca have tried to push a price hike to make up for their predicted losses whilst their other projects are in the works that s not the communities issue and should not be expected to cover that predicted loss is the game worth buying in short i feel it is not tww2 is a better game with far more polish at this time buy that and any dlc at a key site on sale and you ll have a blast furthermore there has been very little in terms of bug fixing including a long list of issues that really break any positives i could raise in this review the following is a comment from the tw subreddit listing a few of the major issues that dev leads seem to not be willing to fix a year after they were reported for me it feels pointless to even consider purchasing dlc when the base game is in a state like this most of these have been reported countless times and are often marked as a known issue for many months to spread awareness in the playerbase customerbase of the critical core long standing bugs issues in tww3 here are the ones i know of campaign map ai utterly sucks unable to put up a proper fight build upgrade up its armies or effectively develop its empires diplomacy mechanics and diplomacy ai in all ways forms is beyond awful especially around vassals and alliances ai is bugged limited in its perception of nearby faction ai is literally not aware what factions are nearby no diplomatic contact unit pathing in manual battles especially cities with construct able barricades is awful units refusing to path through broken city gates destroyed city walls instead insisting on using ladders to slowly climb up exhaust themselves cavalry monsters getting models stuck which pulls back the whole unit into death units dropping forgetting orders even in the middle of pitched melee combat units not shooting because they are moving fast while being stationary units unable to shoot despite having clear line of sight battle maps being broken for pathing and losight especially on top of wall crenelations auto resolve insists on damaging killing single entity monsters and especially artillery pieces even when the player army outnumbers the enemy 5 to 1 auto resolve still gives cities a ridiculous advantage even when the player army outnumbers the enemy minor settlement garrison 5 to 1 certain units lords heroes fail to properly do their charging attack units especially large ones will randomly die when attacking certain walls gates or being remotely in proximity of a collapsing wall but nowhere near close enough for it to be a valid danger units even lords on foot will randomly die when climbing ladders some lords cathay dragons especially just flat out fail to perform melee attacks for well over 10 seconds at a time ai does not understand nor properly react during the defence of siege battles it will spread out its army across the map and be unable to fight a concentrated force ai charging his fastest units at the start of battle into certain death especially lords heroes like belakor ai clueless about properly using aoe magic magic in general which also makes anything anti magic rather useless hundreds of bugs related to skills techs items unit abilities stats building mechanics etc etc sometimes two characters lords heroes will be placed on the exact same coordinates on the campaign map permanently preventing them from movement and interaction item qualities being nonsense with common ones often being better than rare special ones lord hero traits either not working or straight up inferior compared to other available ones wochaos revive norsca faction mechanic intentionally broken by ca because they could not be bothered to properly fix it manual battle ai will sometimes simply not activate instead its units refuse to attack defend move seen most often in ambush battles and wood elf forest defensive battles countless quests for lord items or unlocking special lords heroes do not work properly ai occasionally able to see your ambush hidden armies from across immense distances react to their positioning skirmish mode on ranged units often failing to trigger react causing the ranged unit to just stand still ai will often prioritize targeting sabotaging or annoying the player even if it means certain doom for its faction player units are utterly unable to finish off a broken leadership fleeing unit especially if it is a single entity like a foot lord squads of large sized ranged units like salamander razordon hunting packs after finishing a move order will take forever to wiggle around before actually firing confederated lords for factions that have loyalty mechanics skaven etc will often start at zero loyalty confederated lords will sometimes not be able to change their mounts confederated legendary lords will sometimes lack their immortality trait meaning their next death is permanent completely non functional mechanic for automatic development of cities everyone forgot this even exists in game because it never worked ai lacking any proper skill builds for most lords and heroes which both makes them weaker and makes those lords useless for confederation bugs related to construct able objects on defensive maps where units get stuck in barricades or cannot attack them fresh bugs like bretonia damsels wood elf ariel nakai unit recruitment etc etc black ark unique map army spawn positions again bugged after it was fixed in late twwh 2 black ark capability to offer recruitment to nearby dark elf armies bugs out when the black ark is garrisoned in a city ai will readily kill its own armies by trying to occupy ruins that have just been destroyed by extremely unfriendly but not yet at war factions which are still surrounding that location from the previous turns razing ai will readily abandon its capital city and flee to some meaningless tier 1 settlement when facing an equal force instead of fighting where its chance is best inside the capitol some sea objects like islands treasure skull carcass will cause a guaranteed crash to desktop ai will insist on besieging a weak settlement for 10 turns despite outnumbering overpowering the garrison 5 to 1 and auto resolve showing certain defeat for the players city various lord hero equip able ancillaries that fail to work properly vampire count coast ui for showing raise dead pool possibilities near city bar ui does not show units recruit able from battle casualties certain unique cathay caravan rewards are again inaccessible despite being fixed in some previous patch such as the vampire weapon there is a limited number of names for generic lords heroes and once they have all been used up the game notifications will start showing nonsense mixing up factions names icons etc 20 mins played with very poor performance it s difficult to understand why they made changes to the engine when wh2 looked great 3080ti and 7900k for reference it s a shame because the game is unplayable on the campaign map with less than 10fps unless i am zoomed right in fyi i did not pay full price for the game edit will likely follow if i get this working well enough cannot recommend at this time,140.3,19.0,0,Not

18314,2022 ca learned nothing from wh2 firstly the ui it s ugly it s pretty much all one color which makes distinguishing literally anything aheadache second and by far the worst the campaign it plays like they did no testing on it instead of making the game legitimately fun in a challenging way they just make the pc cheat going into tzeanches realm the pc knows the path straight through going to papa nurgle pc takes no attrition and now before they ve even finished balancing the game they are trying to sell dlcs no hate to the developers here but ca gave us a flop even after the community gave them all the feedback they needed from wh2 to make a great capstone in the end all ca care about is your sweet cash no matter how good they get this game it released in the state it did and will always be just another mediocre cash grab,529.0,56.0,12,Not Recommended,"August 11, 2022",Total War: WARHAMMER III,Elderberrypigdog
