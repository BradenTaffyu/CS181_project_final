69855,2021 if you re not going to lower the base price then how about making a call of duty black ops iii just zombies and nothing else because nothing else matters edition i mean you are scamming people by making them think that the multiplayer is enjoyable after all you re also fully admitting that you re aware of the fact that a large majority of your players the ones that aren t cheaters only play for the zombies and custom maps solely by calling the base game zombies chronicles edition you obviously just want people to buy the full package for a higher price and that would be fine if it wasn t for the fact that it feels like it never really goes on sale and the game is what 6 years old now can t forget that the sale prices for these games are always the same every single time as well can only recommend buying it when it s on sale can only recommend buying call of duty black ops iii zombies when it s on sale edit just finished the campaign and i already forgot what happened,121.4,433.0,19,Not Recommended,"September 30, 2021",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,FrootSauce

69888,2022 i simply cannot understand why a 7 year old game still costs 60 but if you love cod zombies this is the best game for it the new maps are fantastic way more detailed and in depth than say vanguard or cold war get chronicles if you want to experience classic maps such as kino or nacht steam workshop is also available if you feel like downloading custom maps weapons perks textures skins,116.5,226.0,1,Recommended,"March 9, 2022",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Ley

69889,quite possibly the best way to play zombies in the cod series not only do you have some excellent maps zombies chronicles along with progression for guns and prestige levels to grind for but also custom zombies content via the steam workshop if you re looking to play this game safely be sure to search up t7 patch by shiversoftdev and look up any videos at how to setup the patch and you re done the game also suffers from performance issues after an update to the steam api and t7 patch fixes that issue no problem in addition to you can uninstall the campaign via the manage dlc section of the game to save up on file size game is huge fair warning black ops 1 and black ops 2 are still good games for zombies but this game has so much content that it is in my opinion the definitive cod zombies experience buy this on sale though it still baffles me and many others that they sell this game still for 60 or even 100 dollars definitely wait for a sale and get the zombies deluxe edition if you want all maps and do the super easter egg the game has to offer or if you want just base game and zombies chronicles you can pick up just the zombies chronicles edition and play the many custom maps to your hearts content,446.1,127.0,3,Recommended,April 22,Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Carcino

69908,2020 lower the price old games with community support maps mods and add ons will continue to do well for example left for dead or fallout 4 but when you are still charging 60 dollars basically for zombies as the multiplayer never that good to begin with anyway is hacked and finding a good game is rare so 60 dollars for the same zombies maps you used to play and 1 new map which will leave you confused if you stopped playing zombies awhile ago it is not worth 60 dollars that being said its a very good zombies game the community saved this game from being forgotten as new maps drop every week maps drop daily as well but normally need a while so its not glitchy this game is very good looking and you will be shocked when you enter most of the custom zombies maps how well done they are some look better than any map in the base game as well as some looking like it came with the base game if they drop the price of chronicles to 30 buy it with no regrets but please do not buy at 60 buying at 60 will only keep the game at that price for longer you could be the biggest cod zombies fan ever and i still don t think you should pay 60 buck for it as customs alone can be fun its way more fun with freinds and im not sure how many friends will wanna drop 60 on a game they ve played and that s almost 6 years old get this game to 30,107.1,146.0,8,Recommended,"December 24, 2020",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Birdman

69950,2019 i recommend solely for zombies not much else needs to be said this is the best iteration of cod zombies edit since this review got some attention i ll elaborate further this version of zombies is the definitive version in my opinion and there are several key reasons for it blops 3 zombies is the last version that sticks to the core formula it takes the established formula from waw black ops 1 and black ops 2 refining it as much as it can this version really feels like the most refined classic zombies experience so far it may not be as purist as some of the other version thanks to the new perks and gobblegum but it is still very much the classic formula just with some newer elements the default map is a tad gimmicky for my taste and i much prefer the classic experiences like verruckt and bo1 s maps that being said bo3 on pc has steam workshop support so you can have any map that a modder can dream up you have old maps ported to bo3 in the zombies chronicles dlc any map you can dream up through steam workshop and an overall modern refinement of the classic zombies formula its an equation for addiction now there are some legitimate complaints i don t like that people have to buy the full game just to play zombies especially since the campaign and mp are less than stellar i ended up buying a key off of a trader on reddit for 7 it was a good deal another legitimate complaint is the huge imbalances created by the gobblegum system gobblegums range from so useless they re almost a hindrance to so overpowered that all challenge is gone they can completely ruin the intended difficulty curve that being said i just don t use them they re not required by any stretch and i ve even seen some workshop maps that don t even have the gum machines some maps require you to get to a certain wave before using gums unless you are hell bent on using gums this isn t an issue the optimization on this game isn t great either overall it isn t the best cod port but since it has aged a while the optimization may not be an issue for you its old enough at this point that it probably will run just fine on most machines the graphics hold up pretty well for its age but there are occasional sometimes more noticeable in modded maps issues with pop in and texture loading the campaign is frustrating to me it has several individual moments with awesome ideas or cool concepts but none of it ends up amounting to anything the whole campaign essentially ends up meaning nothing won t spoil anything there are quite a few neat ideas like walking through virtual recreations of memories but those same ideas have so many oversights that ruin it for example one section has you reliving one of the battles in ww2 it would have been a great opportunity for era appropriate weapons as a sort of level wide easter egg but no these ww2 soldiers were using future sh t weapons quite a few ideas fall flat and don t work despite the presence of some ideas with great potential speaking of guns the default gun selection in bo3 is uninspired these weapons feel like a designer took modern guns slapped the bare minimum amount of fuuuuuuuuture on them and sent them to production the upside here is that mods allow for custom weapons from other games and previous installments this allows for a great and renewed variety in gameplay modders have even started to make entirely new weapons to implement in the game new and ported npcs from other games are also making an appearance i played a map with the panzerhund from wolfenstein in it that was awesome and unexpected i ve also used an infinite warfare weapon pack where all the weapons had their proper alternative fire modes mp is also uninspired it feels like the devs took a look at titanfall and did the bare minimum to capture some of the magic of that game s movement system the only problem is that it barely works and feels out of place the weird hero abilities also don t feel like they fit its almost like they made the mp into call of overwatch instead of a unique title with its own identity the mp tries to smash the identity of half a dozen other better mp games into one it fails at carving out its own path tl drzombies mode is great its refined has mod support and lots of longevity thanks to it the mp and campaign lack any real identity and they suffer for it this game is only worth it for zombies so pick it up on deep sale,175.0,102.0,3,Recommended,"April 6, 2019",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"7-Avocado-40

69977,2023 disclaimer the game is currently filled with hackers so if you re interested in the pvp multiplayer don t bother there are mods to fix it with custom secure servers but it s in beta as of now and you gotta pay for that so yeah it also has stuttering issues that can be fixed with a patch or the boiii client that i talked about if you plan on playing coop campaign or zombies go ahead it s amazing this review will focus entirely on zombies which is pretty much the only thing i m interested in imo best cod zombies everthe slide movement thingy makes traversing maps fun without adding overwhelming invasive stuff like advanced warfare campaign the gobblegums are fun and add a new twist again without being overwhelming even old maps that didn t have much to offer aka no main easter egg are interesting thanks to this mechanic and i really appreciate that the progression system with levels and gun xp incentivates me to use every gun and that s great i also love that you can basically get calling cards for pretty much just playing the game it s really nice despite being incredibly simple the new zombie maps are great the easter eggs are really fun and you can really feel the tension while doing them so it feels rewarding as plus most of them can be done in solo i really am not a fan of first person shooters i suck at them but zombies is a coop experience that i love and i m thankful i was able to experience it idk i love this gameedit as of may 22nd 2023 the boiii client received a cease and desist letter playing multiplayer cod is harder than ever if you use the t7 patch you can t do the coop campaign nor public pvp or zombies your only way to play this game as of now without hackers and stuttering issues is by using the t7 patch in a private match with your friends that also need to use the patch it s still my favorite cod zombies but it s a shame that activision sucks ass,150.1,100.0,5,Recommended,"April 12, 2023",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Renka

69979,2022 it s 2022 and the price of this game is insane but that s corporate greed for you anyway call of duty black ops 3 has the best zombie mode compared to all the other cods the workshop mods are a lot of fun and i find myself constantly downloading new zombie maps everyday the best part of zombies is that you can look up servers in game that are using custom zombie mods which makes the game even more fun i do not recommend buying this game for multiplayer because well its dead 100 the zombie community however is very much alive and lots of players still playing that whether its in on the server list or the actual zombie mode itself i do not recommend buying this game at 60 but if you ever see it on sale for 30 or less then sure it s a lot of fun and worth it as long as you re a zombie fan,106.2,73.0,0,Recommended,"February 18, 2022",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,tblack

69990,2022 a recent steam update in may of 2022 affected some dlc heavy games in how often they ping the steam servers to check for dlc this game is affected to the point where people are getting huge frame drops every few seconds there is a topic on the front page of this game s discussion board outlining specifics of the issue with hundreds of responses complaining that the issue hasn t been fixed yet there are currently only three solutions 1 launch the game offline and don t connect to the internet this completely fixes the stuttering 2 revert steam to a prior build and play it on that however you still won t be able to play the game online 3 oddly enough apparently installing a mod menu spoofs all the dlc into your game and makes it so that the game won t repeatedly ping to check for dlc this completely fixes the stuttering unfortunately it can cause issues when trying to play with mods and of course it risks a vac ban and really we shouldn t be expected to use some shady dll cheating file from a discord link just to play online normally i think it s unacceptable on valve s and or activision s part that players did all the legwork in documenting the issue and what causes it and have submitted many support tickets yet this remains a widespread issue two months later i just want to play zombies with my friends without lagging every few seconds tl dr this is a great game which i ve had so much fun with over the years but don t buy it right now i ll change my review to a thumbs up if when the issue ever gets fixed,294.4,154.0,6,Not Recommended,"July 13, 2022",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,The Swag Patrol

70039,2016 updated 4 08 2016multiplayer review only note the hours in total are not 100 from multiplayer as campaign and zombies count towards the total hours played and i have friends and family who use my steam account too activision presents call for unbalanced ops 3 minimum edition oh man when activision announced black ops 3 after the last 2 entries to the franchise ghosts advanced warfare i had hoped that we would finally get a cod worth the money and time sadly i believe this is not the case if you are considering buying this game than i cannot recommend this game to you or anyone else i will explain why in detail and remember this review expresses my experiences and my opinions so here we go pros no exo suit and the limited thrusters make you more grounded than advanced warfare the specialists w weapons abilities is an interesting move but more on this in cons interesting melee weapons added more on this in cons customisation of your character specialist is a nice feature hero armor is a cool idea but more on this in cons some cool designed black market call signs and emblems ability to perform gestures at the winners circle decent selection of options in the graphics settings split screen play controller support works well con to this as well the change from 75 points in tdm to 100 points is a very good move imo cons oh boy here we go micro transactions weapon unlocks via blackmarket and just 1 map for zombies is for some reason a full priced game the weapon balancing has been improved upon by altering the kuda and vmp and a handful of the others however people still resort to roughly the same selection of weapons in the game leaving the others to collect in game dust team balancing is still an irritating experience while lately i have encountered this issue a bit less but you can still easily come across a team with really skilled players versus a team with bad or unskilled players boring recycled map designs only 4 13 maps i enjoy playing on 12 without nuk3town and personally i loathe metro with a passion but everyone feels differently on designs the 4 maps are combine evac fringe havoc overpowered specialists the purifier and ripper are still pretty much the dominant choices among the specialists hit markers or hit detection is awful countless times i have shot at a player and either it takes too long to register that i am shooting them or doesn t register the amount of shots i have put into them short amount of players every lobby i run into at least 2 people i have seen before you would think you were playing a beta or something only a single map included in zombies and the rest are only available through the dlc packs i think you get what s wrong here optimisation hasn t changed much the game still has the odd frame drop and stutters randomly i have a gtx 970 installed so that could be why it stutters but still that means this game has a vram leak and i confirmed this in msi afterburner mechanics how many times have you attempted to slide but end up crouching too many now you may think well you need to build up momentum before you can slide normally that would be correct however why do you need sprint momentum to slide with thrusters answer you don t also auto mantle is a terrible idea because it s a slow enough animation to put 10 bullets in your ass they simply could have made it that you double tap the space bar to mantle so that you don t get forced into the animation the blackmarket it takes you a bit to earn 30 crypto keys just to unlock a rare supply drop and that doesn t guarantee you anything good just that you will get a quote rare or better item which can easily be a rare callsign or gesture you don t give two sh ts about controllers with aim assist while i applaud the idea allowing the use of controllers in game i do not appreciate you giving the controller users aim assist in multiplayer i am not sure if this is true but i have heard of a trick where people can remap the controller buttons to their keyboard and mouse through an outside 3rd party program if this is true than shame on you hero armor dark matter is a nice little acknowledgement of achievement but let s be honest they look kind of boring if you want me to do some ridiculous get 2 rapid kills 4 times or get gold on every single unlocked weapon in the game then put some more effort into the looks longevity now with the introduction of contracts you can do challenges that you complete to gain access to a time restricted specialist that basically permits the use of all other specialist abilities or weapons on top of blackmarket unlocks crypto keys cod points the extra 1 000 levels after the prestige master rank it seems whoever decided to allow all this seems to know that cod games are getting worse and want people to stay on their older titles as long as possible to keep people playing them and to keep a flow of income the verdict i m not saying this to bad mouth the game or the franchise but it seems they are building quite an ego and thinking they can make whatever they want and we will buy it because it s labelled call of duty however if you want to play the game regardless of all of the cons then try it out and judge for yourself to all fanboys of the game this is not cod hate it s just objective criticism and some irritating experiences i have had with the game they may develop but we make the game,405.7,494.0,56,Not Recommended,"August 4, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"BarrelRider

70045,2018 part 3 3 of my black ops series reviewintroductionif you are the type of call of duty fan that i am you most likely enjoyed the black ops except the third installment maybe and modern warfare games the most and that s good because for most of us this is where the franchise peaked both in quality and story wise if you play games like call of duty for the story so now with possible rumours of black ops 4 on the way in 2018 i embarked on the quest of reviewing the series and hopefully help some of you who still haven t made up your mind about your opinion on call of duty i will say it straight from the beginning the black ops series is worth it at the very least let s see why campaignso you liked the story of alex and david mason you liked the way those characters were built and the intense narrative you want more of the soldiers you know and love lol no you treyarch decides to throw all of that in the trash and start anew with a story that has absolutely no link to the previous black ops games i m gonna be 100 honest with you here i didn t understand a single bit of black ops 3 s tale that it s so desperately trying to deliver in an interesting way spoiler alert it s not interesting at all while the other games were engaging and had deep beautifully constructed plots bo3 is a story about if i know you basically play as a custom character don t expect any depth to the level of customization it s about 3 faces and 2 caps and that s it which loses his her limbs in an operation that goes terribly wrong then you get on a mission to destroy the illuminati or something honestly it s quite twisted what i m trying to say is that the campaign isn t in the last bit memorable not the characters not your motives not anything it s just a big mess that s probably why you see so many train go boom memes and black ops 3 ending explained videos on youtube but the gameplay of the campaign in itself is alright the new thing is that you have some new enhanced abilities which are actually pretty fun to use multiplayerwhile many people don t take this game seriously because of the new movement mechanics i can tell you the multiplayer here is quite solid unlike other cod games here you have specialists you can use in multiplayer instead of random perk specific character models these specialist have some abilities which give you an edge against other players for example a bow with explosive arrows invisibility traps with nano bees that kill any enemy that steps in them it sounds ridiculous i know or some portable seismic charges that insta kill nearby enemies it may sound overpowered but you mostly get 1 or max 2 kills with it because of the short range and the fact that sometimes you don t even get to use them since you have to jump to trigger them and the enemy can kill you in mid air the new movement system with sliding and thrusters which allow you to glide or jump higher is actually well implemented and smooth it can make for some interesting plays or can be very frustrating at times depending on the situation but overall it s a nice experience zombiesthis is the part where black ops 3 shines the most this is without any doubt the best cod game for zombies mode yes you have the classic 4 dlc formula for unlocking the current zombies maps but there s also a dlc called zombie chronicles which allows you to play better remastered versions of almost all of the zombies maps in previous cod games that is just awesome besides the fact that in the age of steam workshop you have hundreds of user submitted maps at your disposal maps which are pretty damn good most of the time even if you don t buy any dlc the user maps and shadows of evil the zombies map you get by default are still gonna ensure you have a blast if you buy this game only for this mode my respect to treyarch for this amazing top notch zombies experience conclusionblack ops 3 is overall a pretty good game being the best call of duty for zombies mode and having a fun multiplayer mode i say it s still worth the 60 price tag just don t expect wonders from the campaign or even better don t even play it pros steam workshop allows for countless hours of fun with zombies maps modifications to the multiplayer are a nice change of pace zombie chronicles dlc is worth every single pennycons horrible story my black ops 1 review black ops 2 review,229.2,66.0,1,Recommended,"February 8, 2018",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"TrapGod

70060,2020 hola to the few random people scrolling down into the comments and reviews im home from school today so ive decided to write a review on one of my favorite games im gonna be breaking this review up into different categories on the three main gameplays and the bonus ones zombies multiplayer campaign and the bonus mode also i just hit my 300th hour on the game so i think im somewhat qualified to talk about this game also this is my first review so i would appreciate some criticismzombies 1 gameplaycall of duty black ops is notorious for zombies they revolutionized with every new installment and took a different turn with the release of black ops 3 black ops 3 included two new main additions that carried over with every map gobblegum and double pack a punch and each map had their own unique features gobblegum was a contreversial addition for the reason most people thought it made the game too easy and wasnt necessary but i beg to differ gobblegum adds another path to take with the game another way to approach your run you could either play without the gums that carry you throughout the experience or you could do my personal favorite and complete the easter eggs in 1hr moving on to the next addition double pack a punch pack a punch was a staple of all zombies and treyarch took a turn and said lets make it even better dpp allowed for infinite damage making high rounds attempts effortless and much faster inscentivizing the player to continue playing and trying out different abilities that best suite their gameplay style 2 map designthe map design of every map is similar in the fact that you can go either left or right to reach your objective like i mentioned before each map has its own unique features for example gorod krovi my personal favorite this map has dragons manglers drones more dragons robots drunk russian and a flying eyeball and thats barely scratching the surface you dont need to be a veteran to understand or interact with the features of the map 3 easter eggsevery game has their own little easter eggs that you can do to maybe get a secret weapon or some bonus currency but black ops 3 says you look at what i can do every dlc map offers some sort of easter egg that you want to do shadows of evil or commonly seen as soe is the base map the one that everyone starts off with this is a four player easter egg and the objective here is to defeat the shadow man repent for your sins and obtain the summoning key you have to perform for rituals collect souls get a sword kill margwas which are based off of hp lovecrafts cthulu mythos then after that you have to defend a flag while meatballs go at it at full speed then the final step is a bossfight with the shadowman himself you pour 100 s of bullets into him hoping to defeat him only to fail and have to try again the easter eggs are so interesting and each deliver some sort of small message to the player 4 the storythe story is by far one of the most interesting stories ive seen in a videogame which is saying a lot this story isnt some carbon copy thats used in every game its its own new idea that jason blundell made and a story that i think everyone can appreciate the four main characters are takeo a japenese warrior that cares only about honer dempsey who loves to tell you to drop the chips richtofen basically hitler if he was a scientist and nikolai who is on his ninth wife these heros go around from dimension to dimension attempting to restore reality 5 replayabilityyes this game keeps you coming back for more you always want to improve your time in easter eggs always want to find out how to optimize certain routes and wanting to go for higher rounds if you get really good at the game you also can join multiple discord to help people that just started 6 conszombies is an overall great experience but not everything is perfect one major downside of zombies are the graphics in some areas of maps sometimes a map will look phenomenal but then you move 5 feet to the right and it looks like a potato another bs thing in some maps are the dumbass mini bosses that come every few rounds tedious easter egg steps and zetsubou 7 final verdictcall of duty zombies is amazing i didnt mention custom zombies because thats not part of the main game like what treyarch made thats more community fueled i would recommend this game to everyone for its great story good graphics and overall fun gameplay its fun on your own but even better with friends granted it has its flaws but what game doesnt multiplayer1 gameplayme personally im not a fan of bo3 multiplayer its super pay to win so in any encounter whoever has the better gun will win this is a lot less skill based and the meta rarely changes you could call me bad at the game and i would accept that but there are a lot of over powered weapons that really ruin the experience but one new addition to the black ops series was rocket jump boost if you double tap space bar you can fly up for a short time the downside of this is it makes noise and alerts others to your position 2 map layoutthere isnt much really to say about this since every map is mostly formatted the same way there are two lanes one on the left and right and there s a middle part with some obstacles on all three paths your spawn changes throughout the game to prevent spawn camping and most maps have a window in the middle to camp in 3 specialistsone new addition that was in bo3 s multiplayer was the ability to have specialists specialists each grant you and ability that fills up throughout the game with each specialist you can choose between one of two abilities usually one passive and one that more for attack you can also customize the appearance of your specialists with crates that come from the black market which i ll talk more about later 4 black marketthe black market is how you get cosmetics and dlc weapons you can either spend money to earn crates faster or you can just do missions and play a lot you can win either common rare epic and legendary you can get emotes skins camos paintjobs and emblems 5 final verdictmultiplayer is personally not my favorite but ive heard mixed review on it you can load into a game and have the best time of your life destroying everyone else in the lobby or you can get unlucky and walk into a prestige master level 1000 and start throwing things if you get bo3 i would still recommend giving multiplayer a try maybe thats your style or what youre good at campaign1 gameplaythe campaign is the worst out of all of the black ops granted thats purely subjective but its just bad the only positive thing i can mention about it is that its fun to screw around with it but only with friends the bots are super easy to kill unless youre playing realistic theirs no incentive to go for collectibles class selection and loadout is pointless because it takes so long to level up your guns 2 storyhorrible just bad i couldnt follow it at all and honestly i just couldnt give a crap about any of the characters involved the person you play as isnt likeable and isnt relatable and i gave the story a try but i couldnt follow it there are just too many things going on 3 map designthe map design is different every time but the layout is the same theres an open area outside the you go inside the after that you have to go outside again maybe take control of some robot then go back inside just to go outside again 4 final verdicti dont mean to cut this short but i reached the world limit lmao overall bo3 is an amazing experience and i would recommend this to literally everyone to give it a shot if you made it this far thank you and i would appreciate some criticism on my review also i didint have room for the bonus review but just know that its fun

70118,2016 product received for free okay i ve put this review off for a while now i think now that i have the time it s probably worth me writing one i ll try make it short sweet and straight to the point tl dr 7 10 if you re looking for a serious war game this isnt it p call of duty black ops 3 is a 50 50 game in my opinion the mixed reviews show that too it has its pros and it has its cons however something is always drawing me back to this game whether it s the frantic multiplayer or the captivating campaign but then again it s made by activision most of their games follow that path i ll start with the cons get the negativity out the way the community yeah you probably already knew about that the cod community is freaking awful that ruins it in my opinion it might not be everyone who is like that but i can assure you that at least 2 people in any match will be salty or toxic about something at some point it s hard to avoid and if you find a nice lobby stay in it of course this is only on the multiplayer part of it not so much in zombies just the game modes the system requirements this game is reliant on fps you ll probably see a tonne of reviews with these mentioned or people complaining that it doesn t run or load or work or their fps is 10 it does require a hell of a lot for it to be smooth with high fps or you can sacrifice all of the beauty in the game a very smooth look and some fps it s a shame that this game requires so much for it to be look good and be 60fps because i enjoy the surroundings in game as well as the graphics but that s a personal preference in a shooter game you need the speed you need good fps so you have an advantage over your enemies and bo3 really does rely on that in certain situations like when you re shooting down a giant spider like mech and you have to skid out the way of a missile heading straight towards you or when you re head to head against others in a death match however for some people fps will be minimum and therefore your gameplay will be very different to someone with a strong pc keep reading for a major fps fix the seriousness of it or lack of it personally i don t mind the lack of seriousness in the multiplayer and what i mean by seriousness is if you were to play some of activision s older games you d see a verrrry clear difference between this of bo3 or cod ghosts for example black ops 3 is a rather futuristic take on the bo3 franchise more so than the other 2 seriousness ceases to exist in multiplayer now that character customisation and highlight taunts have gone out the window you d know what i mean if you saw it basically if you re looking for a ominous and stealthy multiplayer where you re crawling through mud and ash to get to the objective it definitely is not this try battlefield 1 instead because i know for a fact that if you score the most by the end of the game on bf1 your character doesn t dab or do the whip naynay or does some other form of viral something bo3 is full of memes the dlcs this is straight forward just don t buy them if you want to play the new and different multiplayer maps online they are dead like in most games where they release dlc only maps no one is on them much however if you want to play this game for the zombies i d say it s worth it the dlc maps for zombies are rather enthralling and different also there s is a large amount of people playing on them the multiplayer scaling yeaap it s pretty crap i don t need to explain how bad it can be there s days where it will be perfect there is a good mix of ranks and prestiges on both sides and you have a fair fun game or there s other days where you get put on the weak team and you get absolutely slaughtered and you come out with a low 3kills 27deaths that s never fun plus you can t always avoid it by leaving the lobby and joining a new one cause there s a high chance you ll get put into a team with 3 vs 6 and the 6 are all max prestige zooming around the map and obliterating everything alright i think i covered most of what i think let s the game down a lot now onto the pros the campaign i won t spoil anything don t worry personally i really enjoyed the campaign it takes you on exciting and tiring missions you re always in your feet or in the sky doing something the seriousness that lacks in multiplayer has to be somewhere it s very immersive and emotional at times and during my play through i found myself getting attached to the different characters as well as my own you re not a backseat brain a your character that you don t see never hear but somehow they manage to save everyone and they rule the day you re play as a very proactive strong independent individual black op i found that i was drawn to them and you really take a front seat also the ability to customise yourself and your weapons is still there not to mention finding collectibles hidden within each level will be scattered and placed in your room and over time your room will become a mini museum okay okay i like the campaign and i could keep rambling on but that s not fun zombiesss i haven t actually played zombies all that much nor do i have any of the dlcs i know others who have them and really enjoy them though but from what i ve seen and experienced i can tell you it was pretty damn fun it s creepy ominous endless and noisy i ll be honest i haven t a clue how to solo it so if you re interested in zombies more than anything else i d suggest watching some gameplay or look for a review about it zombies is a mode that is fun to play with friends or alone one slip up or being in be wrong place at the wrong time could get you killed and eventually will 3 hits and you re dead meat it s very different from other cod zombie modes that and it makes it unique in many ways i also love the style of the default zombie map it s like bioshock mixed with zombies the atmosphere music and graphics i can keep this one short and sweet kinda all game modes have a nice atmosphere to them by that i mean there is a lot of detail that s been put into the maps story lines and characters it has a nice feel to it the music well i love music in games that s something i look for in games actually but that s another personal preference however all modes have their own music and it has been made to fit in to work simply it sounds great and it sets a scene indeed now onto the graphics if you read what i put above in cons you know what i m going to say the graphics are amazing then resolution is high and crisp but yeah it s a big but you can run the game in 4k and it feels like you re actually in that shoot out oooor you can run it in 1080p with acceptable fps and dream that your pc could handle 4k so i m going to tell all of you dreamers a little trick that a friend of mine told me when i was close to giving up on hope with my bad fps nightmare all you have to do to achieve rather smooth gameplay and that advantage over others in multiplayer is turn down the render resolution under video in graphics to anything under than what it s set at 60 50 etc there s a cache this makes your game look freaking awful buuuut you can play like a pro soooo i guess it s 50 50 doing this and turning down the textures will improve your fps by around 20 30 okay you know what i m going to bring this to a close i typed all this on a phone and so far it s been like 2 hours or something i can t remember anymore i stopped noticing 50 words into typing this novel yes this was short and sweet to me overall i ll recommend this game but it s more about what you re looking for in games thankyou for reading my long freaking review that i ve put off for a year i hope this helped you a bit i apologise if it didn t goodluck

70135,2017 note i played the maps on the playstation 4 console peasent ewww jk before i got black ops iii on the pc this review is mainly centered around the zombies mode of black ops iii let me start off with shadows of evil shadows is a great map however it is challenging and can be tedious at times by making you spend a small bit of time in the beginning of your playthrough to do the rituals and get to pack a punch its stressfull at times but is a really good and fun map shadows boss the margwa is also really challenging at times due to him needing to reveal his weak spot before you have the ability to kill him however the civil protector strategy makes the margwa a walk in the park the wonder weapons on this map are really damn good the apothicon servant and the swords which are an absolute blast to play around with and are both very useful to get to high rounds shadows has a great cast too with jeff goldbloom as nero or neal mcdonough as jackie f ing vincent the easter egg requires 4 unlike the other maps in black ops 3 which can be done solo so if you want to get the primiz rules calling card youre going to need some friends i do not reccomend this map to a beginner zombie playersecondly is the giant the giant is a great throw back to der reise and is really good for grinding experience or levelling up your weapons recomennded to a beginner zombie player to get his bearings and learn how to play theres not much to say about the giantthirdly is der eisendrache der eisendrache is a fun and relativley easy map once youve obtained the bows the easter egg was fun with a challenging boss at the end which was frustrating in the beginning but eventually i beat him and completed the easter egg the ending with blowing up the moon was fantastic and then killing dempsy 2 0 the boss the panzer wasn t as hard of a boss as its origins counter part but it still puts up a fight especially with his shock charges danger closest reccomended in the boss fight because of the shock charges the pack a punch is easy to get to and the camo for the pack a punch looks really damn good however the map is a piece of cake due to the lightning bow which when combined with alchemical anthesis you d be set for life the wonder weapon ragnorak dg 4s are fun to use but they too make the map really easy as it traps the panzer so you can easily shoot its core and the slam attack kills a hellavalot of zombies would reccomend to a beginner or intermediate zombie player fourthly is zetsubo no shima now this map got alot of hate when it first came out but i enjoyed the map especially playing it with friends because of the amount of crap you had to do to get to the power the map did introduce 2 new weapons the hg 40 and the marshal 16s both of which are good weapons the trashers were a real pain in the ass especially with the amount of them that could spawn within a round the wonder weapon the kt 4 wasnt really fun to play around with it was a decent wonder weapon though the skull of nansapwe however is really fun to play around with and is the best specialist weapon in zombies the map however is hard and the easter egg wasnt that great in terms of steps and the ending was fine the best part was them going to get the blood vials after the cutscene ended would not recommend to beginner zombie playersfiftly is gorod krovi i really enjoy gorod krovi it has to be my favorite map on black ops iii it had a variety of weapons the ppsh gkz mk3s l4 seige hg40 the wonder weapon gkz mk3 was a great addition to the mystery box as you dont have to go through chores in order to get the wonder weapon and the wonder weapon was great and it wasnt even too over powered it would start to become slightly useless around round 50 60 the ppsh was also a great throwback to world at war and it handled well the easter egg was fun to do even with gersh appearing as a step within the easter egg however some trials were very difficult to do in solo or to do without gobblegums such as in plain sight the boss fight was fun and the ending was great in my opinion the intro cutscene for gorod krovi has to be the best intro cutscene for any zombies map origins included especially with that refrence to peter mccaine as he falls through the aurora borealis the dragon was also a great addition to the map and made it much more challenging to play as if you stayed in an area for too long it would come and breathe fire in order to get you to move the gauntlet of seigfreid is a great specilist weapon packaged with your own mini dragon buddy and the dragon sheild is the best sheild in all of black ops iii the mangler the boss on the map isnt that hard to defeat however as the rounds progress they do get more health and get harder wouldnt really recommend to a beginner but its still a good map finally we have revelations well revelations is a very easy map eventhough it has hard bosses like the margwa elemental margwas and the panzer the weapons in the map such as the apothicon servant and the thunder gun thats right the thunder gun made the map way too easy you could get set up very easily with liquidation immolation firesale gobblegum and proceed your way to rounds in the triple digits the ending itself in my opinion was disappointing with it just telling us the cycle restarted and our characters were set back to origins where they start off as primis the boss fight was way too damn easy and could easily be accomplished the throwback to old maps is really good and the map layout and just the overall look to the map made it very appealing theres not much else to say about revelations it isnt a bad map but it isnt very good either now its time to wait for zombies chronicles edit zombies chronicles review will be

70167,2023 this game is great for zombies i kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points the following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam people do that to trick you into giving you steam points the steam currency by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all lies and deceit i am a 52 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now 16 my son recently started total war warhammer iii and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories,112.7,55.0,7,Recommended,"April 7, 2023",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"harrison

70169,2015 no spoiler in this review the latest episode in call of duty franchise continuing the story from waw bo1 and bo2 the time is setting in the future 2065 all the sci fi stuff is awesome and fantastic in both appearance and functionality generally the main menu is fabulous you may admire your own character in the menu backgrounds and you can locally play with friends in split screen support both vertical or horizontal split this is very cool if you want to play together locally the game breaks into 3 big modes campaign multiplayer and zombies in bo3 all these modes are quite decent individually moreover all 3 modes are well connected such as in multiplayer mode you may use the camo which was previously unlocked in campaign mode most of the unlocks and customizations are shared in all 3 modes and in each mode you have your own progress they all have levels achievements and statistics separately besides all 3 modes have multiplayer which means you can play these modes with friends campaign and zombies mode both support coop up to 4 players another awesome part is the customizations and the media community most of the fps game such as battlefield series allow players to decorate their guns with camo and also have custom emblems for creative players to show themselves in bo3 each custom emblem support up to 64 layers which means you could create almost anything you want furthermore you may also fully customize your weapons with camo and paint job even clan tag or kill counter if you got prestige these customizations are not only for you to please yourself you can upload your sick guns the to in game media community all the bo3 players could see your works and rate them even download them if they like it so the customization and social functionality is quite robust in bo3 screenshots sharing coming soon in order to clearly express my opinion i will review bo3 mode by mode campaignvery nice and deep story continue the story from bo2 the story is so deep imo that you may have to play over and over again to truly understand the true story behind the scenes and there is a secret mode the secret almost everyone knew lol called nightmare after you beat the campaign mode basically the nightmare mode is not only the zombie version of the campaign but also re tell the story form a different aspect you should also try it if you want to understand the true story very nice and deep story support coop in all stages in campaign up to 4 players multiple routes on the map you may choose which route i g up from roof or side flank etc you are going to assault 4 diffculties provide different challenge for both newbie and skilled players lots of checkpoints no need to restart from the beginning when you die the cutscenes are nice and immersive playing campaign just like watching a movie awesome and beautiful scenes not only the sci fi stuffs you may also see some fantastic imaginary scenes in campaign secret mode nightmare totally different feelings and different order to tell the story from different aspect with different challenge story is so deep maybe not easy for everyone to see the true story in first run so many people think the story sucks pok if you still cannot understand the story here s a discussion by from chinese forum baidu tieba explains the whole story very well sorry it s written in chinese decent features success from the predecessor and add more new stuffs in bo3 the class weapon attachement perks wildcards and scorestreaks system are quite similar with bo2 the specialists and the new movement are the new stuffs in bo3 the specialists are all have their own special weapons and abilities which makes the battle more interesting and the jetpack allow you to double jump wallrun and slide on the battlefield moreover you can swim underwater in bo3 these new movements are very nice extending the battle into three dimensional several new perks were added to match the new movement system such as silence jet pack fast thruster recharge and digital footsteps new jet pack movement fast pace 3d battle is very cool sci fi scenes and sci fi stuffs the future battlefields and equipments looks awesome highly customizable weapon you may show off your favorite gun with tons of camo self created paint job and attachemnets specialists are very interesting 9 unique specialists each of them have 1 special weapon and 1 special ability for player to choose and specialists all have lots of outfits and taunts to unlock further showing off yourself tons of challenges achievements specialists weapons attachements perks camo calling cards for you to unlock statistics are informative lobby leaderboard is nice if you want to see how s the players in your lobby and yes you can chat in lobby right now can t chat in lobby in bo2 nuketown is back better connection in my opinion i ve played over hundred hours never get disconnected from server bo2 in bo3 players in asia is fewer than north america some modes are few players playing i m in se asia you can only see other player s level and shared showcase paint jobs variants and emblems no statistics even no history match replay friend list are still bugged in bo3 just like bo2 if you have over 100 steam friends it will only display random 100 friends in bo3 s friend listzombiesi played zombies mode less because it s not easy to find public game or other teammates to play together in asia sometimes the game connect me to europe server and my ping will over 300ms hard to play lol thus the following review might not very accurate and not very completed the map is quite big many place to explore very challenging it s not really easy to beat the game transform into the beast get special abilities and access certain places new stuff gobblegum you can get these gum for different boostsi can t tell much since i play few zombies mode but it s really fun to play zombies mode with friends in conclusion black ops 3 is quite a masterpiece in my opinion although there s some performance issue at launch treyarch quickly patch it in several hours the performance is quite nice and smooth now if you like cod series if you like sci fi and if you like fast pace fps you should try call of duty black ops 3 it s awesome,346.4,712.0,68,Recommended,"November 20, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Howar31

70179,2020 genrefirst person shootercampaignyesgame length9 11hoursdifficulty modes4wikipedia page link en wikipedia org overviewthis game is a first person shooter mode that is great like the previous call of duty series it can be said that after 5 years from the release of the game it still has its own online players but less time it takes to find a game server that is not annoying the offline part of the game also has a relatively interesting short story which we will discuss its strengths and weaknesses campaignso you liked the story of alex and david mason you liked the way those characters were built and the intense narrative you want more of the soldiers you know and love lol no you treyarch decides to throw all of that in the trash and start anew with a story that has absolutely no link to the previous black ops games i m gonna be 100 honest with you here i didn t understand a single bit of black ops 3 s tale that it s so desperately trying to deliver in an interesting way spoiler alert it s not interesting at all while the other games were engaging and had deep beautifully constructed plots bo3 is a story about if i know you basically play as a custom character don t expect any depth to the level of customization it s about 3 faces and 2 caps and that s it which loses his her limbs in an operation that goes terribly wrong then you get on a mission to destroy the illuminati or something honestly it s quite twisted what i m trying to say is that the campaign isn t in the last bit memorable not the characters not your motives not anything it s just a big mess that s probably why you see so many train go boom memes and black ops 3 ending explained videos on youtube but the gameplay of the campaign in itself is alright the new thing is that you have some new enhanced abilities which are actually pretty fun to use zombies this is the part where black ops 3 shines the most this is without any doubt the best cod game for zombies mode yes you have the classic 4 dlc formula for unlocking the current zombies maps but there s also a dlc called zombie chronicles which allows you to play better remastered versions of almost all of the zombies maps in previous cod games that is just awesome besides the fact that in the age of steam workshop you have hundreds of user submitted maps at your disposal maps which are pretty damn good most of the time even if you don t buy any dlc the user maps and shadows of evil the zombies map you get by default are still gonna ensure you have a blast if you buy this game only for this mode my respect to treyarch for this amazing top notch zombies experience multiplayer while many people don t take this game seriously because of the new movement mechanics i can tell you the multiplayer here is quite solid unlike other cod games here you have specialists you can use in multiplayer instead of random perk specific character models these specialist have some abilities which give you an edge against other players for example a bow with explosive arrows invisibility traps with nano bees that kill any enemy that steps in them it sounds ridiculous i know or some portable seismic charges that insta kill nearby enemies it may sound overpowered but you mostly get 1 or max 2 kills with it because of the short range and the fact that sometimes you don t even get to use them since you have to jump to trigger them and the enemy can kill you in mid air the new movement system with sliding and thrusters which allow you to glide or jump higher is actually well implemented and smooth it can make for some interesting plays or can be very frustrating at times depending on the situation but overall it s a nice experience the bad side horrible story i did not see anything else personally the good side zombie chronicles dlc is worth every single penny steam workshop allows for countless hours of fun with zombies maps modifications to the multiplayer are a nice change of pace,364.7,77.0,8,Recommended,"August 13, 2020",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"༺Remiel༻

70219,2020 tl dr get while on sale okay but seriously the zombies in call of duty black ops is good at least in a conceptual manner for example in pack a punching a weapon more than once you receive what s called an alternative ammo type aat for short and this makes killing zombies a lot easier to make this more balanced it only activates every so often perhaps every 30 seconds or so the maps in this game have a lot of detail and content in them they re vast and expansive while actually still having stuff to do in all the various nooks and crannies at time of writing i ve only done one easter egg so far that ee being the flytrap from the giant which per step literally the same as on der riese in previous games the maps are designed well in terms of general layout a fair amount of challenge but not too terribly difficult it s not quite casual friendly but neither is the price even with sale but i feel as though the learning curve isn t absolutely terrible for anyone who s serious about having fun with zombies on that note about maps this is the first treyarch made game since world at war to natively support mods still currently the only one actually slowly but surely the classic world at war maps are even being ported to black ops it takes time due to the newer engine not having much backwards compatibility but it s happening community made custom content especially maps is great modders are being hunted to extinction by devs and their proprietary software and end user license agreements each new map also feels truly unique in an aesthetic sense with regards to zetsubou no shima isle of despair for example you would think by the japanese sounding title that it s some kind of shi no numa swamp of death clone however you d be sorely mistaken with such an assumption it does indeed have imperial japanese zombies and lots of kanji on various signs throughout the map as well as a tropical climate and even a quasi symmetrical layout but treyarch really tried to make it unique in most every other way you ll just have to see it to believe it now with as much praise as i give this game on a conceptual level things are different when put into practice black ops has absolutely terrible graphical optimization my fps goes from 150 down to 120 all the way down to the 70s literally several times every minute without any apparent rhyme or reason as to why this even happens and the graphics don t even look that good at max settings the textures and models are pretty good looking but the shadows and ambient occlusion are frankly lacking in that manner black ops do it way better note black ops has actually amazing performance as well as spectacular model details but a lot of textures are extremely so low res that it s visible at 480p even at max settings particularly dlc black market camos but i digress still way better optimization however even if low res textures are the least of that game s issues ing terrible sound design i will hear the zombies at all times in black ops black ops black ops and even world at war they ll either be walking or at least groaning whereas in you have zombies literally sneaking up on you in full and absolute silence half the time on that note about audio there are a lot of recycled sfx jingles from previous games but in a pretty tasteless manner like you hear the lock jiggling round end cue from mob of the dead on guess which map the giant of course and you don t even hear the motd new round cue while numerous plot holes were introduced in black ops with origins these plot holes were opened up even wider just so blundaddy jason blundell could milk the story with a bunch of multiverse nonsense and actually turn it into something even if poorly written campaign is forgettable multiplayer is trash and honestly has been since black ops no i didn t suck at it it s just really boring in comparison to the og black ops a game also developed by treyarch mind you that or hell even to the new modern warfare which wasn t developed by treyarch but was published by activision who publishes all call of duty titles and infinityward cooperates with treyarch on a regular basis namely for teasers full trailers etc so with that i give call of duty black ops about a 7 2 10 in terms of rating it if you re serious about call of duty zombies you should get this game but wait for a sale thank you for coming to my ted talk,242.8,33.0,2,Recommended,"September 3, 2020",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,The Dirty Console Peasant

70230,2019 now is the perfect time to get black ops 3 mostly for zombies here s whybo4 zombies sucks okay it doesnt suck but it s missing the charm the all previous black ops games weapons variety is lackluster in bo4 but there s a good amount of weapons in bo3 don t like em mod the game so you can have bo1 weapons or bo2 weapons or mw weapons even halo weapons the revival of modded maps when mod tools were introduced we had alot of lazy challenge box maps that zombie youtubers just eat up cheese cube and octagonal ascension are a few culprits they arent the lazy ones but you get my point zombie chronicles existsother mods like a wario ware esque game8 player grief modand a plethora of other reasons as for multiplayer its sorta alive it s not as alive as other games like mw2 or bo2 but it still has enough players to get a match going even though it has exo movement it s executed perfectly as for singleplayer it s okay i only found real enjoyment in coop and nightmare mode the price is pretty expensive what i recommend is getting it off a keysite but buy all the dlc on here or humble or if it s on sale for 30 45 dollars it s still a good buy because now it comes with zombie chronicles black ops 3 is honestly a master piece of a game for zombies even though it has a soulless gobblegum system it s made with love and the same amount if not more is being put into the game by the players and modders pick it up asap,101.4,35.0,3,Recommended,"January 18, 2019",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Diacute

70247,2015 bo3 is a game that needs your attention they are trying to show you how pc ports of cod aren t all bad and that they re trying to work on it treyarch really does try and make good ports of cod all leading up to bo3 in my book have been well made ports with bo3 treyarch is really stretching it they re trying to make a new staple in pc cods with additions such as 2 player split screen in every major gamemode and confirmation of mod tools coming out next year this alone shows how serious they are with pc ports along side this we have full dedicated servers an fov slider that goes up to 120 a reasonable options menu changable frame rates and much more they are even cracking down on hackers very well and swiftly i haven t met a single hacker in any gamemode as of writing this review bo3 didn t have a perfect launch with many frame drops even on high end hardware i didn t have any major problems during the launch but after a decent amount of patches many players and me incuded can confirm that this game is polished up compaired to the launch as of writing this i have no farther complaints to say about bo3 performance wise now lets stop talking about the pc port and start talking about bo3 as a whole bo3 adds many new features to the cod formula such as specalists and a more fluid movement system a specalist is someone you pick as your character for multiplayer that have abilities these abilities must charge up in game and can only be used for a small amount of time this changes up each match ever so slightly that it makes the game more refreshing to play the new movement system isn t something to go to much in detail in they mainly added wall running and sliding this makes the game more fast paced and fun to play tl drpros split screen specalists alot of features for a pc port new movement systemcons some proformance problems still occur on lower end hardware this isn t as bad as before though overall8 5 10remember this review is based on the enjoyment i have had with the game this is all just my opinion,308.6,150.0,14,Recommended,"December 29, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,godspeed

70262,2018 the call of duty that made me happy the call of duty that got me through depression the call of duty that did everything the zombies and multiplayer were so unbelievably fantastic that the campaign being complete ass didn t even matter or effect peoples opinion on this game because everyone was so hypnotized by the perfection of black ops 3 s zombies and multiplayer please i beg of you if you haven t played black ops 3 zombies do yourself a big favor and play it experience it and you will discover why i say the zombies is pure perfection i hate to say it i really do but i think its almost if not impossible to ever ever recreate what they did with black ops 3 zombies and even multiplayer it would take alot of heart and soul to re create what black ops 3 did to the world but never say never right gamers black ops 3 forever gamers black ops 3 forever,247.2,32.0,3,Recommended,"November 29, 2018",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,FluffyGunz

70272,2016 this game would have potential if the company behind it actually gave a about the game and not just about money the community is dead already on many gamemodes and i can t blame them you d think this game is still in beta if you played it full of game breaking bugs and the hitboxes are worse than ever before whenever there is an update all they seem to do is add extra content to the game where you can spend your money on this company never gave a about the community and i guess they never will to sum it all up for you guys bad hitboxes at times more than previous cod games laggy at times framedrops buggy random disconnects and graphical issues for many players updates are more about extra money generating content than actually fixing the game small community every game i play i see at least 4 people i know majority of the community are just a bunch of raging kids same as at least the last 5 games needs a high end system and still runs like if you have one results vary though they didn t balance the weapons properly shotguns and thermal dingo kids all over the place activision sometimes permabans people that never cheated in this game and never say why the dlc maps are only playable in limited gamemodes without the ability to play original maps they actually seem to ban cheaters if you send evidence to the right place the gameplay is fun if you actually find a lobby or get to play without issues or dingo kids cool weapon emblem and character customization optionsblack ops ii was the last proper game they made and times like modern warfare 1 and 2 are long gone the game reminds me more of cybermonkeys in space than the oldschool call of duty games the only reason i still play this is because of my clan and the fact that boii has almost no players at all i m praying to god that the upcoming remake of mw1 will be decent or else this game will be the last of my 6000 hour cod journey,659.9,337.0,39,Not Recommended,"June 13, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Rehhminator ツ

70279,2016 i wanted to take the time and explain all of the content on the game so buyers can make an informed purchase as many know since there are 3 different makers of the game the gameplay and content can change drastically between them this game is made by treyarc if you do not follow them they are the original creators of zombies and often regarded as the best of the three now for the review campaign the campaign allows for 4 different difficulties ranging from beginner to holy sh the game allows for multiplayer campaign which is a huge plus and a lacking feature from the years previous which i really enjoy the graphics are what you would expect from such a large franchise so i won t go into detail there in the game you are outfitted with a chip in your brain which allows you to interpret various things very quickly and also give you advantages such as hacking robots and or causing them to self destruct the overall gameplay is not the best seen in the years of call of duty but it is well made smooth frame rates provide a really good experience overall the game doesn t allow you to skip cut scenes and many are pretty long i particularly like following the story however this could get old for some one the campaign is complete it opens a new mode which is a zombie story mode i personally am really excited about this however due to the long story mode and attempting it on realistic i have not made it that far yet i will update my review when i reach that area of the game edit the cut scenes are in fact skip able and when playing a mission on realistic it is best to play with friends even when with friends a single mission will take on the order of 1 2 hours depending on the mission the zombie story mode is a lot of fun and depending on the difficulty you select can be very very challenging at the beginning of a level there will be a mystery box it s actually very well done in how they incorporate random things that have become a staple in the zombie mode i was anxious to reach the zombie story mode but was a bit reserved in thinking it might not be laid out very well it is in fact is even more fun than the main story line in my opinion i wont include any spoilers for those who haven t played either story line but the game play is amazing multiplayer the multiplayer is standard call of duty but has the addition of a super power and wall running i particularly don t care for the wall running or double jump and all that fancy stuff but if it must be added to the game then it is much better than the exo suit from last years call of duty the map designs are really nice for multiplayer and the overall game play feels very balanced depending on play style edit i have actually come to enjoy the wall running mechanics unlike previously stated it takes some getting use to but once you jump on a wall to begin wall running go ahead and aim down the sights and its a good method the sneak over to a player and get the kill before he realizes where you are the super powers that you can select from are a very nice touch while some are way more useful than others i personally prefer the annihilator its a one shot one kill pistol and if you are an accurate shot then this is a must try it is very effective and impossible to defend if you are accurate miss a shot however and the very slow reload will most likely render you dead zombies disclaimer i love zombies the first and only map of black ops 3 is amazing it s a huge map with many things to explore in place of dogs however there are these bat like creatures that come every 5 rounds or so also as you increase in rounds a octopus like boss arrives and will chase you he really isn t a big deal easy to kill but more and more of these boss like creatures will begin to spawn each round there are a few new additions such as gum balls and a new perk i won t explain every detail but if you are a fan of zombies then you will enjoy the new map make sure to google how to find the perks as there are busted bottles that will explain the best direction to travel towards to get the desired perk in order to turn on power etc you will need to become the beast which is ok i guess it s new and different but not sure how i feel about it yet i will say this though it s much better than the bus map that black ops 2 came with good luck easter egg hunting i will add that if you are playing with a group of 4 i have found a very good strategy that will allow you to reach the higher rounds and each have their own circle once you open pack a punch room one player stays in there while another is just outside pack a punch while remaining in the rift as long as you have opened all the rifts the other 2 players can simultaneously run the boxing ring circle this will allow one to face forward and clear the path while the other is opening fire to clear the zombies chasing you ok so that s a quick rundown of the changes and what to expect please do not downvote cause you are a fanboy or hate the game and do not agree with what i said i am attempting to inform buyers of the changes and what to expect although some is my opinion of course i tried to give an honest review with no bias update 03 10 16 so i have had a lot of time playing the game now and have unlocked everything that you can basically for the price of the game you are getting 2 full length story modes normal and zombie the standard call of duty multiplayer with the addition of powers and wall running and a massive zombie map that offers a ton of replayablility honestly treyarc killed it with this game although its not perfect since there are still glitches such as the game randomly freezing causing you to start a 2 hour mission over as well as a few other annoyances i highly highly recommend this game to those that are on the fence imo this is the best multiplayer experience to come from the call of duty franchise in a long time,802.7,65.0,4,Recommended,"October 3, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,@exceptiiion.

70359,2018 at the time i m writing this review i have played over 400 hours in this game that s campaign multiplayer and zombies combined but i would estimate that three quarters of that time i ve spent in zombies i ll give my thoughts on all three sections the best i can i have a lot to say on this game so i apologize in advance for rambling campaign do not buy this game if you re looking for a good campaign this is certainly the worst aspect of this game the campaign just lacks in a lot of aspects especially the story the story is confusing as heck and honestly quite difficult to even follow at all much too futuristic possibly worst of all is that it has basically no connection to either bo1 or bo2 campaigns which were both amazing there are plenty of steam achievements to complete in campaign which is the only reason i chose to periodically come back to it multiplayer i feel like i need to give a quick disclaimer for this one i know a lot of cod players mostly play the game for the multiplayer but personally i prefer the zombies because i don t play mp too much i m never too critical of multiplayer in cod games i just sorta find them all to be pretty similar i know they ve all got many differences i just enjoy them all more or less the same with that in mind there s really not a whole lot to say if you like the advanced movement system and all that you may very well enjoy this game i never really played aw or iw so i hadn t ever really gotten tired of the advanced movement however a lot of people think this isn t a very good multiplayer so i would certainly get some other opinions than just mine if you are considering this game for the multiplayer but i know i certainly had fun with this zombies the zombies mode in this game is what makes black ops 3 one of my favorite games ever i m not exagerating the only downside would of course be having to buy all the dlcs if you re skeptical on buying those i would highly suggest it especially since you can now buy the season pass maps without actually having to buy the pass i have all maps on the season pass as well as the zombies chronicles both packs are incredible if you ve played either bo1 or bo2 then you ll certainly enjoy the chronicles especially but what really makes this game great is just how stinking fun it is on the surface the game is really just shooting up zombies trying to survive as long as possible it s quite simple however as you get better and better and start to learn the maps more aspects of the game are opened up to you i love to play der eisendrache one of the season pass maps because it s perfect for doing anything it s great for casual or if i just wanna focus on getting the upgraded bows or if i m really feeling it i can try and do the main easter egg there s just always something to do there are times when i get on this game and i can t decide what to play because there are too many maps i just simply can t decide it s too fun whether it be by yourself or with some friends unfortunately it s pretty hard to find public matches now one more bonus is that if you get this game on pc there are loads and loads of custom zombies maps and some of those are real good overall many people would say not to get this game for the multiplayer and everyone would say not to get this game for the campaign if you re thinking about getting this for the zombies though definitely get it i can t begin to tell you how amazing this mode is you just have to experience it yourself and get the dlcs although this game wasn t recieved by the public too positively i d say the zombies mode carries this game to a perfect 10 10,576.8,25.0,0,Recommended,"October 7, 2018",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Luke

70369,2017 we re talking zombies okay kayzombies has never had this much content and been this cohesive the maps are all fairly strong entries my personal favorite being gorod krovi i will admit i still have not completed the easters eggs on all the maps but i good taste for the gameplay experiences i would be having on all the maps shadow of evil is a great eldritch snack of a map just about everything helps this sucker function as a pretty seamless sandbox for the new mechanics of the game it s a bit on the easy side as are all the maps in black ops 3 but they all are consistently interesting the questline to get to the packapunch is probably my favorite of any map on offer the wonder weapon is pretty godlike the dog rounds are fine the new creatures flies and meatballs are okay the meatballs being especially hard sometimes but really if you re decent at zombies they pose little to no threat der eisendrache is map i ve just about fully experienced and most of what i have to say is meh the bows are all sort of annoyingly underdesigned aestetically in terms of mechanics they re just sorta powerful not too interesting and not so powerful i love them the easter egg this one i ve actually completed was really a chore more than something fun though completing it did feel pretty dang good the map looks okay but the snow kissed castle is just a little bit normal to me it d be cooler if it was just a little bit more freaky a bit more closed in too castle wolfestein and it s easy as pie and only half as sweet zetsubou no shima a black sheep in the lineup and not without reason but like all these maps there are unique gameplay concepts that they approach pretty confidently even it still comes out a little funny the generator and underwater stuff is pretty dang cool it weaves well in the core of the game underwater rather than being a burdeon feels kind freeing though you must surface for water the boss monsters were kind of annoying but they got easier i don t hate the wonder weapon either the easter egg design is really lazy and is based on chance how hard it is going to be to complete which i ve never beaten but tried for days it s an okay map gorod krovi difficult goodness a bit more oldschool which is a good thing the intro cutscene is kind terrible which goes for all of them but shadows of evil they re just a little bit rushed like it feels like one two layers of audio are missing ppsh is back again goodness the wunder weapon is strong and versataile i ve honestly not experienced all of this map but so far it s pretty good revelations is an interesting patchwork of many previous maps in the treyarch branch of zombies it s pretty good but it really is just an idea rather than a truly great map the areas don t flow well enough into each other to really warrant them to be smashed up as one making the gameplay feel rather segmented the wunder weapons though are in full force sporting multiple from previous maps which make the map super easy but also pretty fun i love you thunder gun good map great concept awesome gunsthe workshop tons of free fanmade maps what s not to love part of the reason i bought the game after vowing not to purchase cod ever again workshops are the way to my heart now for my obligatory number score i almost never give them to videogames in earnest but here it is8 10 if you ve liked previous zombies buy the game check out the maps there s some fun to be had story to be enjoyed just don t expect something as good as bo1 zomboners,200.1,28.0,0,Recommended,"December 4, 2017",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Half Life 3: Gman's Revenge

70383,2020 while i do recommend the game it s most fun with friends campaign is a joke but its co op multiplayer is ehh but its more fun with friends zombies is where this game truly shines its fun solo but its more fun with friends the campaign is pretty crap doesn t connect at all to the previous campaigns apart from a few small mentions and doesn t feel as fun no wonder it s the least completed campaign in cod history the multiplayer is hit or miss either you love the advanced movement or you hate it you aren t really likely to find many games nowadays however the zombies is where this game truly shines each of the maps is crafted with so much love and care treyarch even decided to bring back a bunch of bo1 maps in zombie chronicles as well as origins for those who played bo2 black ops 3 maps are a lot more complex and difficult to set up on than any previous game but once you ve actually set up it is fairly easy to survive each map is unique has a unique setting and provides a unique gameplay experience easter eggs are prevelant like always but they re a lot harder this time around you ll have to practice the zombie chronicles remasters were incredibly effective at bringing a last gen level into next gen shangri la is my personal favourite design wise and they all still feel just as fun and distinct as they did in black ops 1 or 2 overall if you have friends who are rich get this game,485.7,22.0,4,Recommended,"February 23, 2020",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Neo Noire

70389,2016 this game is really fun to play upon first release the game was poorly optimized even for people who had some very nice hardware for their gaming pc however developers saw this and eventually made the game nice and smooth i originally played the call of duty series on a playstation 3 but eventually moved on pc when playing black ops 3 on here the nostalgia hit me from all the fun times i ve had with my friends from black ops 1 and black ops 2 the majority of my playtime from all of the black ops series including this one is playing zombies mode but i also really enjoyed the last two game s campain and multiplayer mode i was highly disappointed with the campain seeing how it had nothing to do with the previous two games but at the same time there wasn t really a way to continue the story and i m actually a bit glad of that the multiplayer was a blast it felt just like the other games as for zombies it is one of the best experiences i ve had in a video game especially from the workshop content there are so many remakes and remasters of older maps that the steam community has commited themselves to making and even new original creative maps if you liked the last two games you would probably enjoy this one as well,119.7,33.0,6,Recommended,"December 26, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Williamage

70418,2021 do not buy this game expecting to play multiplayer back when it came out it was good and enjoyable my friend and i recently reinstalled to test out the zombies again neither of us own the zombie expansion and will not be buying it for the ridiculous price in 2021 but i m not done talking about the multiplayer the lobbies are all hacked you enter a game only to have someone invisible shooting you or an aimbot that is even if you enter a game the games we tried playing last evening it would start and then the match would end in a draw at the beginning i thought it was the servers until some a hole said get crashed erik and my whole game crashed nice job nerd i imagine holding lobbies hostage is hilarious for all of 5 minutes but beyond that really you re quite a loser lol treyarch activision are sh t companies who aren t going to fix problems like these and you can do better with your money that being said zombies with friends is fine but 60 hell no lol get out of here treyarch this game is 5 6 years old and you want full price hilarious do not buy this game,186.4,28.0,4,Not Recommended,"March 21, 2021",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,ER1K TH3 R3D

70428,2016 campaigncons linear story no alternative endings like how black ops ii was a bit dissappointing but hey does anyone really play cod games for the campaign anymore pros kit customization use different perks like nano swarms or invisiblity camo to help you manuever levels have 6 attachments on your guns and create crazy setups good story nothing great but isn t a bore to play the game alludes to previous games and makes references easy to follow and understand but you know some people still don t understand how to point and shoot in the comments theres even a zombie version of the campaign if you finish it the first time through multiplayercons autobalance is crap you re either playing on the team destroying or the team getting destroyed i ve only had a few close enjoyable games where both teams had a chance matchmaking is crap half the time you get placed in lobbies about to begin a match and the other half you re just joining a game thats about to end weapon balance is just stupid smgs seemingly kill in less bullets than rifles and shotguns have the range of a rifle a 6 burst lmg requires 2 bursts to sometimes kill your enemy the addition of those supply drop weapons makes balancing even worse one shot kill pistol knife shooting side arm one shot that also can meelee one shot pros gamepad support is great my 360 and one controllers both work fine with this game solid fps and graphics this game definitely runs great in multiplayer if you have the minimum specs required splitscreen support want to play with a buddy you can surely play with keyboard controller or 2 controllers seen countless lobbies with people using splitscreen specialists abilities are fun to use seeing activision use destiny s ability system is a great tool in the game although the purifier ability is a bit overpowered each ability adds into the game to help each team and can give an edge in objective based gameplay wall running is useful exo boosting is limited zombiescons matchmaking for a multiplayer zombies lobby can take forever and when you do get into a lobby everyone one needs to ready up which some players take forever to do unless you have dlc you re limited to playing one map kind of a bummer but if you do decide to buy the dlc for the zombies maps it is well worth it the dlc levels are well designed for the gameplay and puzzles that they offer pros solo runs fine i ve had no issues if you have minimum specs then the game looks and runs great splitscreen support is great don t like playing zombies by yourself grab a controller and buddy same as multiplayer i ve been in zombie lobbies with splitscreeners overall reviewif you can get over some of the cons the game has to offer then there is fun to be found in this game i would not recommend this game to someone who has never touched a fps pc game before and i recommend waiting until there is a sale for this game i m gonna give this game a solid 6 10buy it for the zombies and or,192.1,147.0,14,Not Recommended,"June 13, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Seoul

70448,2020 the campaign sucks and the multiplayer sucks but the zombies alone makes this one of the best cods out there with all of the dlc the game has 14 zombies maps so you won t get bored any time soon but on the steam version we have workshop support so custom maps are back and people are still making maps now you ll never get bored i used to play on xbox one so coming to steam and seeing all these custom maps was an exhilarating experience i still think 100 dollars for the game plus all the dlc is way too much for a five year old game even 60 for the game plus zc is too much so i d wait for a sale but if i m being honest because of how mediocre the dlc maps are and with all the custom maps out there i d just get the base game it s worth it solely for the custom maps tl dr it s worth it for the zombies alone,128.0,43.0,0,Recommended,"September 7, 2020",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"ClovisMissing

70456,2021 the future is black treyarch delivers once again with one of the top rated call of duty game s in the franchise already with a lot to live up to being the sequel to the fan favorite black ops ii the third installment in the sub series grants a stellar multiplayer and cooperative experience although with a lackluster campaign despite it s poorly done story egregious micro transactions and debatable price tag for 2021 black ops iii shines brightly in areas that overshadow it s shortcomings zombies youtube video official call of duty black ops iii zombies chronicles gameplay trailer views 5 079 540 nacht der untoten verr ckt shi no numa kino der toten ascension shangri la moon origins revisit the definitive chapters of the call of duty zombies storyline that led up to call of duty as custom with treyarch call of duty s black ops iii returns with it s next installment of the famed horde mode 4 player co op solo survival experience likely the reason most of you will purchase on steam black ops iii is the definitive zombies experience to this day though it asks that you invest more money into it for it s full offerings as it s now standard for the zombies chronicles 5th zombies focused dlc pack to be included with standard editions purchasing grants you access to the launch shadows of evil map as well as 8 gorgeous remasters from previous installments giving players a healthy mix of complex and casual maps if you manage to purchase the vanilla standard version you will only have shadows of evil with additional maps available via season pass or la carte exclusive to the pc version black ops iii fully supports the steam workshop allowing users to create share and download additional content with multiplayer server browser support mostly utilized by players to create fully customized zombies maps breathing a lot of variety and longevity to the steam version specifically as with the multiplayer bo3 zombies unfortunately falls victim to activision s unsatiated past greeds in it s micro transactions though not to the same extent through a system of mega gobblegums grants players some debatably broken and pay to win consumable gameplay advantages players can earn by playing or accelerate the process via in game purchases chances to roll a literal virtual slot machine and stack up their bonuses for use in game some are so strong that it honestly ruins the experience but you can control this to an extent by choosing to not use them or agreeing with your team to stave off of them though in public matches you have next to no control over someone breaking out some overpowered buffs if you re looking for call of duty s best zombies experience you get black ops iii on steam multiplayer youtube video call of duty black ops iii e3 2015 multiplayer reveal trailer ps4 ps3 views 2 588 063 call of duty black ops 3 expands the possibilities of call of duty multiplayer the new movement system allows players to fluidly chain movements together while playing in maps that have been while this is one of call of duty s best multiplayer experiences with incredible depth movement based gameplay and progression it s unfortunately heavily hampered by it s age as custom with cod each year that passes the lack of support increases as the player population dwindles particularly on pc platforms as there is no crossplay this problem becomes even worse when you own dlc maps as it tries to match you with other bonus map owners constricting the matchmaking pool further actively punishing you for paying more money with no option to disable the maps for matchmaking besides uninstalling them which is far from ideal unless you re interested in only playing team deathmatch with high ping exploiters and cheaters i d highly recommend against purchasing black ops iii expecting the fantastic multiplayer experience of it s prime if you re looking to play a remnant of it s offerings i d recommend playing the ps4 version though it doesn t have steam s vac support it s evened out by the restricted accessibility of cheats on console however exclusive to pc there is some fun to be had through steam s workshop with custom maps and weapons created by the community with a server browser to utilize it though if you re not at all tempered by this and are strictly interested in black ops iii s multiplayer you can get it for a fair price via the multiplayer only starter pack version campaign i m not even going to bother linking the trailer for this as it does not give an accurate representation of the experience you ll receive through black ops iii s campaign mode though the gameplay is good features 4 player co op for the first time in the series since world at war and shares multiplayer s movement based gameplay in addition to it s own unique and really cool exo abilities and can be fun in it s own right it s all hampered by it s short and bad storyline that feels like a chore to get through defying expectations in all the wrong ways black ops iii has very little connection to it s predecessor s narratives with only a handful of small references attempting to pull off deep psychological storytelling it falls completely flat as it s just not that interesting and poorly executed some fans have convinced themselves that once you fully understand it s tucked away storyline that it s actually a good one i fully understand it and i also understand that it s still sh t regardless a huge shame as black ops ii set a new bar for call of duty s narrative and is unfortunate that black ops iii s good gameplay and longevity is wasted on this uninteresting mess i do not recommend purchasing black ops iii for it s campaign for any reason as it s by far call of duty s worst campaign experience black ops iii also sports a few bonus modes though only one really being noteworthy dead ops arcade 2 a worthy sequel to black ops 1 s top down twin stick shooter zombies experience only improving the fun variation of survival freerun a very light parkour mode allowing you to hone your movement speed and combat skills in 4 different courses with leaderboard support nightmares take black ops iii s campaign replace almost all the enemies with zombies make it cheaply switch around the mission order and somehow make the narrative worse than the base campaign this mode will give you nightmares over how stupid it is but it is good for some dumb fun in conclusion black ops iii is a great game and is widely considered one of the top 5 in the series despite it s flaws and age for good reason call of duty s notoriously don t decrease in price besides the occasional sale a few times a year excluding dlcs however due to it s zombies offerings black ops iii is the most reasonable to purchase out of the franchise if you want it and want it now always consider steam keys for a better price though keep in mind not all keys include the zombies chronicles dlc to provide additional credence to my review i ve played black ops iii for 2 000 hours on the ps4 version,153.3,29.0,6,Recommended,"August 22, 2021",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Archon

70458,2016 i had such high hopes for this game but with the obvious neglect of pc players who wants to pay 60 to a money hungry company like activision just opening the game you can see issues like frame stutters almost no online players and the fact it takes 10 minutes some times to join a server they also make sure to make it very difficult to get anything good basically shoving it in your face to buy more crypto keys and i will be honest i have put almost 40 into crypto keys but i cant get over the fact that the servers are so bad less then 1 percent of players are on the dlc that i payed for really and me and my friends have had such crazy issues with the nat type and having a party for multiplayer if you are absoulutely set on buying this game do not buy the dlc honestly the worst money i have ever spent oh and one last thing prepare for the hardcore urge to rage you will get from all the broken guns and specialists and this whole thing was all in my opinion and if you guys dissagree you either havent bought this for pc yet or you are just another blind call of duty fan boy yours sadly josh,92.5,121.0,7,Not Recommended,"April 16, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,MoonRockGems

70470,2016 after some gameplay i decided to write a review for this game product welcome to future 2070 year when robots mechanics and etc is alive and you got some jetpack exo suits welcome to black ops 3 let s get started with pros and then cons campaigncampaign is pretty solid to be honest it tells you a story about nano chips upgrades and pointing to you that friends can betray you at any time anywhere its not that long but if you want to complete it on veteran difficulty it will be longer of course overall not that bad like people is saying about that they probably don t complete it on veteran difficulty yes it s a bit linear because it s call of duty but every single cod campaign is like that run and gun also in campaign map is kinda restricted which sucks but in nightmare mode it s not overall 7 10 multiplayerhm what to say about this game mode its kinda classic same as previous games it feels like a game mode or dlc rather than full game but in other way it feels different because of jetpack much more easier to use than exo suit and also you can run on walls prince of persia style its rapid its ultra fast mode and its fast paced so if you want to buy this game play with bots on hard difficulty before you get into the multiplayer or you will be slaped in face by prestige masters or other people who plays this game a lot and you will not understand how are they so overpowered also in mp you get cryptokeys for finished match to open common and rare drops similar copy paste from counter strike global offensive but it completely free except if you are idiot to buy cod points for 50 freakin dollars and open those crates for untradable skins also much better is that you actually get cryptos for free when you playing a lot overall 7 10 zombieswhat can i say about mode that keep this game alive and other call of duty games its fantastic have a great maps but you can get a only one shadow of evil with based game other are dlc but important and better news is that game got mod tools and map editor for zombies after 7 8 years it s here on black ops 3 this game mode dont have and futuristic stuff any jetpacks its normal and just run and gun with milion fantastic easter eggs over map overall 9 10 nightmare mode story mode with zombies its story mode but with zombies all over the map its great option for people who like to play zombie mode like me it feels like dlc but its completely free and great option to see how will other single player maps will work with zombies 8 10 freerunpretty solid training mode for jetpack and running its pretty solid option to have if you dont know how to use jetpack system properly overall 7 10lets get with cons now because this game got a lot of cons d campaign game ai is so horrible its so stupid that enemies will kill you through wall in veteran difficulty its like wallhacking also i got r9 290x gpu but also on nvidia you can see some graphical glitches and pixelated textures even if your game is setted to a maximal graphics and effects some enemies got randomly more health than others but when you restart the checkpoint it will be reduced to normal as it should be before lol some checkpoints can be glitched and automatically get you killed aka spawn to die checkpoint multiplayer microtransactions cod points are cancer before in older games you can get everything for free now you can get almost everything for free but you need to play too much game for some unlock cod points costs from 2 50 dollars or euros depends on your country some weapons are so overpowered also perks but thats optional thing and it will probably be fixed in more updates community its so toxic cancerogenic that i can t describe too much kids raging too much kiddy boosted prestige masters peeps that can actually mod their game for some pre fire assets and wallhacking but don t get me wrong this game got some excellent and brutally good players but most of players are not cooperative and don t want to play together like team cancerogenic camping with shotgun or rapid snipers oh yes people and kids in this game can camp for whole game with rapid shotgun so noobish and so cancerogenic it s not tactic its noobish thing you know don t get me wrong i destroyed them anyway random fps drops in this game is soooo bad i got r9 290x intel xeon cpu from 2007 with 3 0 ghz and 8 gb of ram and game is runing most of time 80 fps avg but in some random places it can be 10 fps but in next spawn it will be normal so stuttering and drops are here which is bad also in zombie mode too did i mentioned spawn to die system yes its here like in previous games nat type uggggghhhh its so annoying that you play with friends and just after 2 hours session lobby will crash and you must restart your game and router to make it work again because game changes your nat type to strict randomly even with port forwarding even with 30mb s you get about 30 60 ping i live in serbia and on other games i got 10 ping easily zombies game stuttering on shadow of evil map on footlight district is so bad it will random drop your fps from 100 to 20 and will lagg a little bit sometimes game can randomly stutter anywhere because its not patched properly since february month servers are slowly dying in this mode but they will be back because mod tools will be soon released in this game mode also sessions longer than 2 hours with friends will crash and disconnect you from servers annoying stuff drop system is extra rare even if you open doors buying weapons and etc you can barely get 3 4 liquid diviniums keys for gobblegums nightmare some zombies have a glitched health one of them needs to be shooted 3 times in head some casual zombies with casual health must be shooted 10 times in head with powerfull weapon strange glitch in veteran difficulty zombies can glitch in your back which gives you instadeath even if they needed to spawn in front of you graphics not so good in this game because its 9 years old engine with newer stuff in him but you can easily see a pixels blurry textures and bugs over maps and textures so 6 10 for graphics on maxed detail i think some older cods looks more polished gameplay its classic and you will enjoy it but minor glitches and bugs can frustrate you as 7 10overall i can give this game a honest 7 10 its super game but got some really really bad glitches also

70493,2018 call of duty black ops series are my most favourite cod games as well as modern warfare series i bought this game is purely for single player campaign and zombie mode personally i had spent more more than 12 hours to finish campaign hardened mode the storyline of this game still not bad and it features high wall run high tech nano machine etc for zombie mode it is definitely worth it to play although i am not a great player with this challenging mode but still very enjoy to play it for multiplayer mode i heard there are a lot of cheaters or hackers used 3rd party cheating tools also one of my friends has been issued a permanent game ban due to his game stats has been altered and damaged by hackers my friend is a victim in this situation since he never involved in cheating so if you want to play multiplayer it is better for you to find your friends to play with you in private lobby do not play with any stranger that you dont know or you will bear the risk to get game ban furthermore if you are interested in hunting achievement then you will have to own full base game zombie chronicle dlc season pass i give overall rate for this game 8 10 if you are seeking achievement guide can go refer guideline in youtube it help you a lot some of achievements are required 3 persons and even 4 persons play together in order to accomplish it good luck in hunting achievement about the pricing of this aaa games it seems like bo3 is overpriced especially deluxe edition one you know what i mean but if you think you cant afford that price then wait until the sales another thing treyach will be releasing cod black ops 4 battlenet on oct 12 after watching reveal trailer of bo4 im very dissapointed because the traditional single player campaign is being cutted and replaced by battle royale mode however zombie games in bo4 sound like promising to me so i will buy it in future also i believe some people have very douby question why activision only sell pc version on blizzard s battle net instead of steam sell bo4 via battle net is much better and 100 secure because nobody can involve in cheating in battle net platform steam anti cheat system is very suck absolutely if you are interested you can go pre purchase it then just hope you won t lost your hype sorry for my bad english anyway hope you can enjoy my review and have an amazing day review updated since june 15 2018,135.1,41.0,3,Recommended,"May 20, 2018",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"ジュンさん

70497,2022 i ve been playing this game since release for basically only the zombies gamemode i really love this game and i appreciate all custom map devs that have been single handedly keeping this game alive for the last 5 years unfortunately hackers now have a mod menu that provides a list of every player that s online and can grief every single person by bricking your dlc s kicking you offline grabbing your ip and more this basically made black ops 3 100 unsafe to play unless you re in offline mode and that means you cant play with friends so it s solo or a no go tons of support tickets have been made and sent to treyarch and they ve been radio silent on the issue for years play this game at your own discretion i have no doubt that cod will not come back to this game to fix it simply because it isn t profitable hopefully the community can work out a patch for these exploits but for now i can t recommend this game until this get s fixed if it ever gets fixed,582.3,17.0,0,Not Recommended,"September 19, 2022",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Ghost

70520,2020 zombies this is the best game in the series for zombies and is pretty much the sole reason i bought it i still find myself now 5 years later coming back to this game for some classic cod zombies the game brings several great new maps and some cool new elements like weapon attachments loadouts levelling in zombies and an interesting deep story made up of many interweaving secrets and easter eggs the chronicles dlc is amazing and is probably my favourite part of the game it brings remasters of pretty much all of the great classic maps from world at war and black ops 1 as well as origins from black ops 2 this dlc is also now apparently part of the base game when purchasing the game steam workshop support also adds a great deal to the game as many people have made some incredible maps mods many of which are just as good fun as official maps weapons the campaign is also pretty good i enjoyed it the multiplayer is okay not really my cup of tea but i know it is somewhat populated still,343.4,19.0,1,Recommended,"December 28, 2020",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Henray

70521,zombies genuinely carries this game completely every other aspect is terrible the campaign is awful and it solidified that call of duty no longer cared to tell interesting stories like in that great stretch of 2007 2012 releases the multiplayer is broken and unsafe but the zombies is one of the best co operative experiences ever it s great by yourself as well if this game ever goes for a really low price a long with the zombie dlc s it is worth it to buy there s also free community maps that are a gold mine of entertainment if zombies doesn t interest you don t touch this game but this isn t a review of black ops 3 it s a review of the best zombies experience ever,72.2,47.0,5,Recommended,February 17,Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,HNgaming

70524,2015 i absolutely love black ops 3 s multiplayer unlike the past few cods that have come out which felt gimmicky and crammed with unnecessary features black ops 3 s multiplayer feels more simplistic and reminiscent of the older cods yet still manages to keep newer features like the jetpack from aw to my surprise it took less than a second to find a game in australia at 5 am with a ping of 40ms it seems as if there s already a large amount of players which is great considering it took forever to find a game in ghosts understandably i can easily see myself playing this like i did black ops 1 zombies zombies i m not too sure about i didn t play much of it and i did play it solo but it was really complicated i didn t understand what was going on or where i was probably due to it being the first time i ever played it i dislike the way zombies has become more fantasy than reality they ve allowed you to go into beast mode which allows you to turn into a giant slug they ve also added new perks and consumables which come in the form or gum balls or new perk a cola machines such as widowers wine i haven t made my mind up on it but based on the map alone it s definitely not as bad as black ops 2 s zombie mode and i honestly think it will be fun once i learn the map and how things work especially if it s with a couple of mates as for the campaign much like black ops 2 and aw its set in the future and though it is fun to play the storyline was dull i was hoping for it to pick up where black ops 2 left off as 2 did with black ops 1 there was a reference to raul menendez and the nova 6 gas which was interesting and unexpected i found that completing the campaign on the veteran difficulty seemed easier that previous call of duty games probably because they ve added another difficulty realistic which i ve yet to try out they ve also introduced zombies into the campaign in the form of a new game mode called nightmares which was unlocked after completing the campaign and is probably my favourite part of black ops 3 it s basically the campaign retold to include zombies with a new and separate storyline after the release of black ops 2 ghosts and advanced warfare i was really hesitant to buy black ops 3 but i m glad i did overall i ve really enjoyed black ops 3 it s good to finally play a decent cod game again would definitely recommend,104.3,208.0,10,Recommended,"November 11, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Crid

70549,2015 i do not write many reviews for games probably because i do not figure that anyone would read them but i feel i have to say something about the newest offering in the call of duty franchise it is not what the hype made it out to be maybe if you are a console player it may have redeeming qualities but as far as a solid pc fps i say no you may ask why keyser would you say such nonsense you love cod well to be honest it is like this 1 if cod ghosts and tianfall had a child it would be named black ops 3 2 you have to make your gameing rig jump through hoops and perform magical tricks to get it to run then if it makes it through the connecting phase you have to become the great sherlock holmes to find the graphical settings to make it not look like absolute and hold frames so it is not an animated flipbook 3 your mouse will do crazy things 4 hate to say but advanced warfare is much better than bo3 there is a clunkiness to all movements and hit detection is a joke aw has much more customization and a better prestige ladder 5 oh you like hard core modes gtfo and wank in a corner yes tdmhc has the wait to respawn mechanic and hcdom has been totally omitted thank you for removing my favorite game mode treyarch i would refund for the deluxe package but i made the mistake of giving this game a chance maybe they can patch the crap out of it as is the norm with all modern pc games they like to sell unfinished products and string along the consumer taunting fixes for something that should have been right to start if we are going to pay 100 for something make sure it is good and deserving of our hard earned dosh and by the way before you go off on a this is a console port rant aren t the games made on a pc to start with so shouldnt it function properly on a pc and what kind of 1 off pc do they test these things on they use the latest tech and nvidia amd offerings which most of the gaming base does not have access to purchase if you think you have the best pc evar and like call of duty games otherwise go get fallout 4 i m finished with this review for now if you would like to leave me a message or your thoughts on anything i mentioned here feel free have a great day after two months of playing around with settings and patches updates being released i wanted to update this review and say thatblack ops 3 is redeeming its self but i have to say the game is now what it should have been on realease i should not have to buy a un finished game and then hope it gets patched down the line as i said before if you like the cod series purchase and carry on update finally i am happy to say that everything i have mentioned previously has been pretty much taken care of i do reccomend this game especially if you are a fan of the cod series,588.4,33.0,3,Not Recommended,"November 9, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Keyser Soze

70560,2016 there are good and very very bad things in this game remember this is my personal opinion but i am reviewing for others i have 297 hours on record at this current moment so i feel that i can review this game to it s full extent just as i will with infinite warfare campaign cool weapon selection super powers pretty much such as control martial and chaos control let s you control robots and such martial is mostly close quarters such as a charge ability a slam ability and a invisiblity chaos is chaos you unleash swarms of mechanical bugs to eat people you shoot robots with fire bolts pretty much and much more confusing story at first very bad story once you understand it characters pointlessly dying if you re looking at cod for it s campaign i do not recommend this game at all multiplayer pick ten system large variety of guns though a lot of them are bad so there are few guns that are the guns that everyone uses one being the kn 44 which is the starting assault rifle the maps are actually pretty good though need to be larger spawns aren t as bad as cod ghosts or advanced warfare but they are still bad due to the insanely small map size the wall running is fun but shouldn t really be in a treyarch game treyarch should go back to boots on the ground sledgehammer can keep doing what it does most of the guns either have unique designs or are based off of modern weapons but look futuristic which is alright but if you re going to have modern guns just make it a modern game some people really like the multiplayer i do not but that is my personal opinion if you want this purely for multiplayer wait for it to drop in price if you kind of want it for multiplayer and zombies get it zombies much much easier then waw bo1 and bo2 perkaholics ruin public matches or any matches at all really headshot sounds are amazing they just feel so rewarding to get or to get the wunderwaffe or thundergun and just blast an entire horde of zombies the story is very good right up until the end which was more of a cliffhanger then anything soe is a very well made map der eisendrache is a very easy but very fun map with lots of replayability zetsubou no shima is a map that some like and some don t i do not like it gorod krovi is an overrated map ever since i completed the easter egg i have not played the map revelations is a dissapointment all in all the game is worth the 60 if you are into multiplayer and zombies but not for campaign also wait for season pass price to drop,503.9,18.0,3,Recommended,"November 6, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"McWolfe

70598,2016 update just moved nightmares to the pros nightmares is not having many issues anymore for some reason so i played it a bit more update 2 i finished the campaign last night i updated it s review below so i bought this game back in december i mainly wanted to play zombies and i liked it however let me break down the game a little caution a real review incoming pros good zombies mode shadows of evil is actually a very detailed map i like big city maps such as that unfortunately though unless you have the season pass or whatever that is the only map you can play on decent graphics it s not better looking than battlefront ea or rainbow six siege but it s actually alright for a cod game advanced warfare honestly looks better than this but then again this game uses the same engine like all the other cod s out there besides aw multiplayer is alright as well i haven t really had any connection issues or hit registration issues either everything seems quite stable for me in that regard i also haven t met a hacker once hell i ve been lucky not to meet any campers for once in a cod game not to mention exo abilities such as the jetpack are non existant except for sliding and boost jumping wall running is also a thing nightmares this idea i actually like i ve been waiting for a zombies campaign and now we got one somehow this mode is working better than before for some reason so i ll tell you what it basically is in a nutshell nightmares is pretty much the campaign levels but done with a different protagonist and done in a slightly different order with zombies splitscreen yes you heard me there s splitscreen co op campaign multiplayer zombies and nightmares not many devs nowadays actually give us local splitscreen in their games and of all the devs out there to do so it was a cod dev wut decent amount of graphical options you can change texture quality texture filtering mesh quality shadow quality dynamic shadows subsurface scattering volumetric lighting ambient occlusion anti aliasing and motion blur hell they even gave us a field of view slider as well as vsync fps limiter slider and pretty much almost every other video option that s in today s games cons my biggest gripe with this game right now is the performance the game doesn t perform as well as it should i sometimes have a hard time pulling a consistent fps at or above 60fps in campaign and nightmares even at high settings it still runs about the same the only sure fire way i could maintain a stable framerate sometimes at max settings in 1080p was by disabling volumetric lighting and order independant transparency completely however i actually like those effects since this game manages to make some decent use of godrays and lighting in certain areas of the maps but what can i do not to mention this game eats up way too much vram and ram for what this game presents us in the graphics department i can max out battlefront rainbow six siege and just about every other game in my library perfectly but not this game unless i turn off said effects i hope treyarch optimizes this game a little more however here s where this game gets weird in terms of optimization it s a hit or miss situation some people say that this game runs great for them some say it doesn t unfortuantely i am one of the people whom the game runs a bit poorly for me now unlike most people here who will simply say this game performs like a child trying to shove a square into a round hole and never post their specs i will if treyarch optimizes the game a bit more i will change this review to a positive case cooler master elite 430 gpu zotac geforce gtx 970 4gb no oc cpu amd fx 8350 8 core black edition no oc ram corsair vengeance 8gb disk drive samsung sh 224db bebe dvd cd

great ever since the start of the story i have no idea what the hell is even going on i only made it to the hypocenter level before i stopped i just couldn t understand what it was going for honestly one moment i m fighting a bunch of baddies in a run down terrorist controlled part of the city and the next minute i m suddenly in singapore fighting more baddies along with robots and mechs it doesn t help that the campaign runs terribly for me either but to add insult to injury i don t even know how this is a continuation of black ops 2 s story update now that i finished the campaign i have to say it s still not that great some sequences were pretty neat however it didn t even feel like a call of duty game towards the end it felt like it was trying to be something it was not at that point honestly i just couldn t feel it to be honest the whole dni mind control thing was dragging on way too long slight spoiler the only thing ever mentioned about black ops 2 so far was raul menendez but that conversation was very short lived also they mentioned and showed nova 6 from the first entry in the series during the last mission now granted i never finished the story yet but i just cannot bring myself to do so maybe when they fix some of the game s issues and whatnot i ll come back to it once more for now i d just skip it specialists i only really like 3 of em honestly ruin spectre and outrider the others aren t really as interesting but the whole specialist thing isn t really that great to me regardless to me i think it d be cooler if we could make our own mp character ya know or not make but perhaps build our own my final verdict thus far is still a 6 10 i will change this to a positive should treyarch fix up the game a bit i will still go on here from time to time to play a few matches of multiplayer and zombies i will update review as necessary i do wish there were a neutral or average option instead of a straight like or dislike i am excited for the modding tools as well but i hope that they deliver with that if not then i don t know honestly,67.0,115.0,13,Not Recommended,"January 11, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,KobraKira

70622,2015 well this my is first proper review so bear with me note i said that there are no original perks in the zombies mode that is an error on my part as i didn t play the map enough at the time to find them they are part of the game when i was reading up the reviews for this game i was very concerned about buying it myself due to the excessive amount of negative reviews left by people however i do believe in trying out for myself instead of going off other people s words i m not an extreme fan of cod but i have so far enjoyed all of the games released by treyach excuse the spelling so i thought why not give it a go initially the game seemed normal no issues on the menu or setup all runs as it should after starting up a private match in multiplayer to test it out i did run into a few minor issues now i m not someone who complains about a game if i can t run it on ultra high realistic settings so the fact that the game for me lagged when i had it on normal did not bother me my computer is a fairly decent one amd eight core processor gtx770 and 8gb of ram but i still had to turn down everything to low settings but like i said this is a minor point for me in regards to bugs and issues my game does every now and then drop to 30fps for a couple of seconds but this isn t very often pretty much all of the time it runs nicely at 65 frame give or take a couple i only encountered two bugs so far that caused me to get a little annoyed however they only happened once and since then they never repeated the first was getting a completely white screen when trying out the zombies mode for the first time i was still able to access the menu so i quit the match and after trying again it worked as it intended the second one was recieving an in game error code whilst trying to access one ability on the campaign mode can t remember the code and it caused my game to run at 1 2fps and be unplayable i promptly quit and restarted it and it never appeared again so far overall the bugs are not bothering me that much gameplay wise i find it quite enjoyable from the things i heard about advanced and ghosts this is much better and more balanced i don t feel like there is an extremely overpowered weapon or class just yet i haven t encountered anything rage worthy and the gameplay feels even the added extra of jump boosting and wall running i feel has been done just right and the maps are done decently certainly a fast paced game for sure zombie though did annoy me a bit there s only one map on the normal edition i can t say much about the actual map that is there as i only played it once successfully it is a nice challenge though and is quite big it does take elements of that one alkatraz map i can t remember it exactly one thing i done like personally is that fact that there are no normal perk machines as they are replaced by a gum all machine that contains all of the chosen perks being able to choose your perks is also quite nice and i guess it makes up a little bit for removing the single separate machines overall unless you are dead set for ultra graphics and 120 fps and you have a mid range computer i would say wait until they optimize it a bit more if you don t really care about those things and want to enjoy it in a casual experience then i don t see why you wouldn t like it bear in mind this is my own opinion of a more casual player than competitive,103.8,70.0,4,Recommended,"November 10, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Nyphoøn

70672,2016 black ops 3 isn t a masterpiece but i believe there is fun to be had the campaign is pretty solid with missions that don t follow the cod formula and a moderately interesting story the zombies is a fun addition that gives you a wide variety of tasks to fulfil while adding some new things to the cod zombies lore the multiplayer is pretty fun also some of the maps are well designed and colourful but some of the other maps are really horrible the guns are decent and well balanced the subs and ar s feel very reminiscent of one another though similar damage fire rate and range etc much like last years advanced warfare the exo suit is an unwelcome addition that gets pretty irritating due to players constantly using it to get out of your line of fire none the less the multiplayer is the best and most entertaining it has been since black ops 2 campaign 8 5 10 zombies 8 10 multiplayer 8 10,420.3,18.0,2,Recommended,"November 2, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Ⲣ ᥙ ᥒ ɩ ⳽ ᖾ ᥱ ɾ

70699,2016 i have played black ops 2 for a long time and i have never been this disappointed with a transition from old game to new game in my life it s hard to see why anyone would play this as wall running and sliding has ruined the entire game call of duty has never been a game where you are safe anywhere but it has progressively gotten worse with the new acrobatic features the map is more flexible than ever before this can be good and bad in my opinion wall running sliding and double jumping isn t that great when you jump around yourself it s alright but not great however when an enemy jumps around like a damn monkey it s impossible to shoot them like i said you aren t safe anywhere it s not just camping that you aren t able to be doing anymore not that being able to camp was good it s also being anywhere at all in the nuketown the houses aren t even remotely safe as an enemy can easily jump into the house from any direction these acrobatic abilities also makes it impsssible to kill someone with a grenade they can simply slide away and avoid the grenade easily the game has the same problem a lot of the call of duty games have in common using the larger gund like light machine guns are a disadvantage in combat the submachine guns are so much more useful i can t really say a lot about this feature since i m not in a very high level apparently being good at bo2 does not make you any good at bo3 but i also dislike the specialists in the game it s great that you are able to customize your looks but the abilities the specialists possess are not very great they seem just like perks only for a limited time or normal guns for that matter ruin i m officially done with call of duty screw this i m going back to battlefield,134.1,62.0,7,Not Recommended,"August 13, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Idar
70701,2015 ok let s start off here i have no issues with performance and the game is perfectly smooth other then the occasional stutter or whatever it may be the dedis are fine i havent experienced any lag whatsoever as far as that it s a new release there s gonna be bugs there s gonna be issues and it makes me sort of sad to see all these bad reviews about game performance when the game itself is perfectly fine no one understands developers have to be able to optimize the game for the millions of different hardware configurations out and it does take time most of the time but i ve noticed most people are complaining the game isnt optimized and they re trying to run it on high settings with a 650 and other lower end cards and 70 of those bad reviews are generally due to people not understand how textures work i have a 4770k and a 980 strix the game uses a little over 3gb for me with high textures therefore anyone trying to do that on low end cards with less then 3gb of vram just arent going to get good performance it simply wont work with any game it s not the devs fault for that the game is amazing one of my fav cods so far and i tend to only like treyarch games recently anyway as they re always the best optimized and fit my playstyle but patches will come the game will get better,187.7,19.0,1,Recommended,"November 12, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"CasPeRR

70716,2015 while many people are getting performance issues that s something that can be fixed and is therefore not a basis to immediately reject this game i like this game it s clear time and time again that treyarch actually gives a when making call of duty games there is so much content in the base game and it s not even locked behind dlc this time there s so much you can customize that i m still in doubtthe new gameplay mechanics work perfectly and add a new twist to the old gameplay mechanics in cod that were starting to get stale the specialists are a great addition to the game that adds a layer of uniqueness to each player as well as new fun abilities to implement into your playstyle i love the new paintshop that s dope i wrote the word farts on my gun in big black letters over flames on a background of yellow and purple stripes 10 10zombies feels fresh again the new gobblegum system is great the new weapons while difficult to get used to at first due to them being completely unfamiliar are a lot of fun to use there s actually good snipers and shotguns in zombies for once i feel like they could ve included at least one extra zombies map in the base game though in the same vain as the five map in the original black ops pros distinguishes itself from previous installments in a meaningful way lots of content lots of new content genuinely fun looks greatcons only one zombies map includedupdate after upgrading my ram to 16 gigs the game runs perfectly at max and no longer eats up my pc s speed 6 gigs of ram is not enough git moar,550.0,41.0,3,Recommended,"December 7, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"PYROTEKNIK

70886,2018 the above 15 hours is inaccurate to the actual amount of playtime i have in this game i am currently at prestige master level 106 in multiplayer and prestige 5 in zombies i d say ive had enough time invested to give a decent review campaign by now everyone knows that this game is infamous for having a bad campaign which is true in a way personally my enjoyment was haltered due to the lack of a connection to the previos two installations with only a slight nod that sets up the timeline there are no beloved characters and as far as i know no descendants the story features a fresh batch of bland characters alongside a story that may be enjoyable to new players but is a diservice to fans the gameplay is decent but not great but does feel like a typical call of duty game multiplayer as i previously stated i have a very long time invested into the multiplayer of this game this is not because i found the game great but rather centered around me grinding for the famed dark matter camo along with hero armor for my specialist characters and showing off my accomplishments in lobbies of children that posed no real combatative challenge in short i played because i wanted the cool stuff and the lobbies tend to be easy to dominate in this games multiplayer like its campaign really revolve around personal preferance gameplay is clunkier than other cleaner infinity ward games there is a decent majority of gamemodes almost all unplayable at this point in time beacause the community only plays team death match you will be lucky to find a game of domination any other gamemode you will be starting a lobby alone the guns in this game are a major turn off the game features generic futurastic weapons of which the only varierty you seem to encounter is smgs and shotguns both of these groups contain very powerful weapons that are used by the majoirty of the community this is also the game that really enforced the supply drop system set in to place by advanced warfare there are countless weapon camos uniforms reticles calling cards emblems and otther items that amke it impossible to access the desired pay to win dlc weapons did i forget to mention that you also recieve duplicates of these thousands of useless and sometimes ugly items killstreaks and perks are nothing impressive although raps are a fun addition most perks that are not typically in other call of duty titles are unforgetable and almost useless the movement system in this game is also a large complaint heard about the title although not personally a fan of the wallrunning and exo movements black ops 3 perfected this movement system and made it as enjoyable as possible in the multiplayer zombies this is the true draw of this game treyarch is known for having the best zombies experience of any call of duty team and it truly shows here the base map along with most of the dlc maps season pass and chronicles are spectacular maps and are truly worth the purchase zombies has truly never been better in this title and it only gets better with the support of mods in this game from 100s of new custom maps to access to mod menus the zombies mode offers an unbelievable amount of content that will more than satisfy any fan of call of duty zombies conclusion black ops 3 contains a lackluster campaign and a multiplayer that s well ok at best for longtime call of duty fans looking for a classic style multiplayer cinematic campaign smooth gameplay or even a serious war game this is most definitely not for you if you are a new player are attracted to the futuristic theme or are a fan of zombies then totally check the game out if you are still mixed wait for a sale this game is still overpriced and if you cannot find enough content to satisfy you then i would avoid this game until it is on sale campaign badmultiplayer okzombies awesome,83.6,25.0,0,Not Recommended,"August 30, 2018",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Ruffled Wombat

70922,2018 2020 update the game has a really persistent bug where lobbies get stuck into an infinite loading loop that never puts the players into the game activision and 3arch know about this bug since there are mentions of it going back to the launch of the game it seems to have gotten worse and worse as time has passed probably less lobbies so more broken lobbies encountered i tried to get into a game for 30 minutes this fine morning only to encounter loading screens and lobbies going nowhere i have no words left this game much like the publisher and developer is like the springfield tyre fire might entertain you for a while but ultimately is a pile of burning garbage another day another review and again one for a game that is hard to recommend but really kinda hard to bash the movement system is fun not titanfall level fun but fun nonetheless i like the specialists some of the maps are really cool finally a shooter with some color it doesn t have to be so damn serious and gritty all the time i got the base game for like 13e so there is a good amount of content for that price split screen on pc yeah boi however the unlocks are dumb grinding the game with subpar weapons for hours is not the way to design progress i can sort of get behind the attachment grind but do i hate the uneven playing field what anticheat the lag and lag comp are ridiculous the game sometimes just doesn t seem to keep up with its own movement system people are teleporting from lag comp when they are combining slide and jump hits aren t registering at point blank dying behind cover no the enemy did not have fmj etc etc apparently the aim assist exploit still persists season pass more like season ass the community is really horrid but then again what game doesn t have a bad community the biggest gripe is that reporting does absolutely nothing small ish playerbase i mean i do find games easily but it s against the same dudes when you run into a hacker it s better to just quit the game and leave it be it will keep pushing the same lobby to you even if you don t want to be in it runs piss poorly tested on a gtx970 i5 something something 8gb ram and installed on ssd framerates varied between 25 and 110 and this was on low settings on a gtx1080 you get 144fps on high but that is to be expected update edit unless you increase your fov in that case 122 is the best this can do and an unstable one at that random unlocks for weapons in lootboxes that you can buy for real money in a full priced game with a 50euro season pass that doesn t unlock all the content talk about a cash grab im not sure what the hell is going on but apparently the for me the quality of the connectin gets poorer and poorer the longer i play after todays grinding session i was experiencing some serious desync lag like missing point blank shotgun shots i have no idea what is going on but for now i can only play for about an hour or two before the lag gets worse or perhaps i was connecting to some more distant datacenters who knows so yeah the gameplay can be hectic and fun the first zombies map is kinda cool i like that it s not super serious but embraced the dumb multiplayer fun that it s supposed to be but kinda like street fighter 5 everything beside the core gameplay loop is horrible even if i keep on playing the game i can t in any honesty say that anyone should consider spending money on this,92.3,20.0,1,Not Recommended,"April 20, 2018",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"MRPP

71198,2015 personally i love the game but i have always loved cod since modern warfare people need to realize that it is launch weekend and not everything is going to be perfect about the game they also need to realize that the more feedback they get about the problems results in faster patching for them the zombies is great the multiplayer is great and i have yet to play the campaign from where it stands right now i would definitely recommend this game to people but seriously people let them try and fix things before you give a bad review about it it s only been 2 days,88.4,25.0,3,Recommended,"November 9, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Visena
71199,2015 the game is not unplayable but it is unenjoyable because of how poorly optimized it is my pc does not have top tier specs but it is a decent pc and plays most other current games at hight to ultra settings amd a10 6700 gtx 760 12 gb ram but in black ops 3 campaign all low settings and setting to 720p resolution the game runs at around 30 40 fps with fps spikes down as low as into the single digits which technically does make it unplayable so for the time being i put campaign on hold until if it gets patched on the multiplayer side of things the same issues are present but not quite as bad again forced to run at 720p resolution but able to run at medium settings and run around 50 60 fps but still suffering from random momentary fps drops down to around 30fps and some times random extended periods of 15 fps there is no reason this game couldnt have been optimized better and that my pc couldnt have ran it at 1080p on medium high settings at the least its just flat out a crap pc port beacause the game is cranked out year after year and they know people will buy it because cod otherwise although the game is your typical call of duty plays the same mechanics feel good a few bugs but otherwise fun game play i wish it just ran right so i could actually enjoy playing it i havent bought the last 3 call of duties because of the path activision has taken the franchise down and i was hoping this time would be the right time to get back in obviously things have not changed and i will likely opt out of buying the next itteration of cod now if you want to know a game worth your money that actually plays butter smooth and flawless pick up fallout 4 game is amazing and i am running 60 fps on all ultra settings with the same pc specs that black ops has given me so much trouble on,60.4,33.0,2,Not Recommended,"November 10, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,jxrrxd

71219,2015 call of duty been a fan of the games title for years since mw till mw3 and after that it got worse and worse because the series became a yearly which feels like the same idea over and over again sadly now let s talk about call of duty black ops 3 s cons and pros pros parkour system the graphics are awesome the soundtracks are pretty good zombies customize characters and different abilities for each character you choose cons bad port to pc race which brings some memory issues and massive fps drops especially to i5 processors the zombies have only one map and if you join sessions you ll have crazy lags the story is again in the future about robots and special robotic suits personaly i dont like it so i think this game does not worth the 60 price at least not in this shape if treyach manages to fix the issues of the game and make it more stable it would probably worth the 30 s bucks,60.9,21.0,3,Recommended,"November 11, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,.....

71448,2016 over my time of playing black ops lll i am glad to say i recommend it the multiplayer is a blast the specialists are very cool a couple of my favorite are the reaper and purifier with bo3 doing 2xp about every other week it can be very easy to level up and catch up in rank with the other black ops 3 veterans with the first dlc coming out in just a few short weeks i can t express how much fun i will have on the new maps they re bringing in this dlc and the other dlc yet to come however with multiplayer being great i have few complaints about the campaign i feel like it has a few bugs that can be annoying things like you can t run alongside a wall or mission progress not saving all of the black ops stories never made as much sense as the modern warfare series did at least for me i still like the black ops stories but i feel like they don t fully explain things 100 overall the campaign had many cool things about it for anyone who has had worries about their system not working it ran fine on my lenovo y40 70 laptop specs are on my profile but the graphics in this game didn t look that great on low medium compared to previous cod games that is the only other complaint i have despite the few campaign issues i had i still highly recommend this it s a cod game if you re a true fan you ll love it,658.8,16.0,1,Recommended,"February 13, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Mr. G

71555,2019 the campaign s story is basically nonexistent the coop mode is busted and the second you re farther away than half a country from eachother the game starts lagging in both zombies and campaign mode if the servers don t crash then the game itself does which should be not acceptable from a game made in 2015 running on a gtx 1070 and 16 gigs of ram not to mention an ssd a second of network outage can cause the game to completely freak the f out and kick you out to the menu screen saying you lost connection even though you regained in a second after you lost it note also that this can happen at any point i learned that halfway into the origins easter egg and while we re at zombies mode who the f thought it was a good idea to not even slightly gimp the difficulty when a person is attempting to do one of their tens of thousands of 900 step easter eggs that require you to look at a guide every few seconds to even get anywhere case in point 30 rounds into eisendrache solo doing the last step of filling the keeper s stone tablets about a 100 zombie kills required in a specified area by shooting zombies with incredibly broken arrows that kill them or stun them basically instantly and forever and the game decides alright this is a great time to spawn something with an auditory warning that s un hearable with that many zombies around you that can tank 15 hits from the most broken bow in the level and kill you in about 3 seconds if he gets too close with his flamethrower in addition to the 900 zombies currently surrounding him and the explosive dogs that we force to constantly spawn every few seconds at that easter egg step to give multiplayer any credit would be bold of me seeing as half if not all the weapons are sold by random chance in microtransaction crates for abusively high prices in addition to the game costing 100 bucks and thats if the servers don t kick you out cause the host is in some random hole at the opposite end of the milky way tl dr the campaign has no thought put into it the game crashes randomly if not the whole game then the server connection they made the zombie easter eggs soloable but way too fu hard when you do so the multiplayer sells microtransactions left and right for most of the weapons included and to add salt to the wound the game is 4 years old but costs 100 bucks for the complete edition in addition to said mt s edit whoops and now it s a massive data risk to play this 100 euro product that is still on the official steam stores any game that allows people you join a lobby with to literally install malware on your computer should be immediately booted off the store until the issue is fixed or permanently with how much activision loves fixing old products right,274.2,36.0,22,Not Recommended,"September 10, 2019",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Jack Wiltshire

71589,2016 i think i ve played this game enough to make a list of pros and cons that it has based on my point of view so here they come pros gameplay feels very fluid and adrenaline has new gameplay mechanics but not too far away from call of duty s style graphics zombie mode it s cool how much stuff they added in this mode over the years even though i m a big fan of more simple maps like nacht der untoten shi no numa a lot of customization options dedicated servers black market a lot of unlockable stuff this is the first call of duty on steam where you don t have a different game for each mode campaign zombies multiplayer cons it is set in the future i m not a big fan of futuristic stuff they ve ridiculed the game some customization options stupid things the characters say the actions you can do at the end of a match to taunt your opponents since the cod community on pc is much smaller than it is on console sometimes it struggles to find a match and some game modes are totally unplayable due to low amount of players some guns feel unbalanced campaign i m not saying it s bad but it doesn t come up to my standards of single player experience it is too far away to be competing with waw mw microtransactions the time between the end of a match and going back to the lobby is too muchto sum up i recommend this cod it s always big fun playing it especially with friends and the cons definitely do not make it unplayable,96.0,28.0,3,Recommended,"June 7, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Masterix

71887,2017 i flat out did not like this game when it came out bad zombies map bad campaign bad multiplayer however after i gave up on it zombies got good personally i believe that the 4 bo3 dlc maps for zombies were mediocre der eisendrake and gorod are the best of the four but shadows of evil is by far the worst zombies chronicles finally gives a reason to play this game gobblegum while being broken makes maps like shangri la actually decent but makes maps like shi no numa crazy broken not to mention that the black ops 1 dlc for pc players is ridiculously overpriced 8 zombies maps for 29 is unheard of by activision standards lately the reviews have been negative due to season pass holders expecting zombies chronicles to come with the season pass to those people i really have to wonder how you could be so stupid first off do you not know how a season pass works and did you really expect to get that much from a call of duty season pass i m sure these same people will buy destiny 2 s season pass and get mad when it doesn t come with the expansions anyway the campaign is at it s worst world at war s campaign was spectacular black ops was intriguing nothing too special but vietnam and conspiricies were definitely out of left field for cod and it was a great gamble on 3arc s part black ops 2 s story was amazing and under rated for sure it had a ton of replayability and a crazy amound of unlocks multiple endings branching paths just great to me black ops 2 was the full package good zombies good multiplayer great campaign black ops 3 s campaign tries so hard that it s garbage the we have to go further into the future meme is getting old and it worked against this game black ops 2 is barely mentioned and it has almost zero connectionsback to 2017 or rather 2015 yeah this game is almost two years old already it s hard to forget that the cod after this game fell on it s face and now it s basically removed from existence infinite warfare is for all intents and purposes a joke my verdict is this if you are a zombies fan this is the game for you period point blank every good zombies map in one package remastered with it s own workshop and ww2 zombies reveal around the corner no better time to be a zombies fan quit the bawwwwwing about a 50 season pass not giving you 80 of content and suck it up you bought the season pass to a cod game oh it s worth noting that this game is only good for zombies quite obviously do not buy it for anything else,543.0,18.0,2,Recommended,"July 16, 2017",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"destro

71901,2016 i have changed my review from a negative review to a positive i played for 6 months with friends and had a blast got more than my moneys worth the visuals are fantastic the game play is super smooth clean and fun so i will give bo3 a thumbs up that being said i am a fan of sniping in cod games i always have been and i honestly feel that the more sci fi and futuristic cod goes the more they jazz up the movement mechanics the more they ruin sniping sure sniping still works but the dash jet pack boost mechanics make it so easy to evade snipers i m praying that infinite warfare gets this right don t get me wrong the jet pack boost mechanics are awesome and they work for this game just not for sniping i want to see more cod games with a historical theme just look at how the new infinite warfare trailer went down vox populi,420.1,26.0,1,Recommended,"June 24, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,Back To Basics Gaming
71918,2016 call of duty is one of the many games fps related that i play you cant exactly contrast the game with other fps games are they have different play styles most of the time call of duty is a fast paced shooter with quite a lot going on well thats what it seems like to me the game is good dont get me wrong it is enjoyable to play but there are some issues that should be addressed and taken into consideration when you click that add to cart button 1 what the game has become the days of being able to use other weapons in game is over being able to reliable cover a section of the map with an lmg or sniper is no longer a play style that can be used there was nothing that i loved more than being able to mow down 3 guys trying to flank your spawn on dom instead the game has become saturated by 1 specific play style 2 rush i can understand that call of duty is a fast fps game one of the easiest to play in that matter you dont have to worry about bulletdrop like battlefield you dont have to worry about listening for footsteps or other sniper shots sniper ghost warrior but there is a limit in which how easy you can make it both black ops 2 ghost and aw i dont own aw but from friends that have the game are saturated with the use of smgs and or shotguns having small maps really makes the efficieny of using a sniper almost obselete lmg users are constantly being dominated by the fast firing high dmg smgs you find in bo3 yet when it comes to balancing things 3 how to guide balancing weapons after using the haymaker 12 for quite sometime now there are a few things that i do not understand somehow it is the shotgun with the least amount of damage yet fires a buckshot like most of the shotguns in bo3 i am consistanly getting hate for using the weapon note most of the people that are hating on me get to close you see treyarch fail to see that there is a difference between balance and butthurt balance is not nerfing the crap out of a weapons to turn it into a waterpistol that is what you get when a whole bunch of people dont like being killed by the haymaker the simple counter measure to a shotgun is to not get so close to someone simple as that but when balancing weapons also take into consideration where the complaints are coming from this could be from places like reddit youtube etc once you read these comments actually take some time to look at statistics i am sure you have some spare time while monkeys are fixing the issues with the game to make things right there is nothing more than seeing a game saturated and dominated by fast firing smgs with have the range of a sniper im not just saying this because i get killed byt smgs quite a lot but more so that it is true for example if you look at say the vesper chuck rapid fire laser sight and fast mag you pretty much has a lightweight minigun there are positives to the game the zombies is spot on i love it have enjoyed every single moment of it especially when you disconnect from singleplayer multiplayer although has a fair amount of issues is fun but my main complaint for the game is the constant fps spikes stutters any kind of help i look for either says update the drivers or get a better computer i have updated the drivers which had pretty much no effect what so ever getting a better computer well i think i have good enough specks to be honest i7 2600 hd7950 and 8gb ram dont you find it sad how supposedly creating a sequal to what was quite a good game black ops 2 take such a downfall games are meant for enjoyment being able to communicate with friends and all the people that have apparently slept with your mother dont you feel dissapointed in your inability to fix the mistakes and become a better overall game developer isnt it demoralising when you see that just under 50 of the comments reviews on the game are negative i know this will most likely not been seen by the eyes of any treyarch developer but all these questions run through my mind the thing is what goes through yours,522.6,25.0,0,Not Recommended,"January 4, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"AxisMilkman.FGR

72207,2016 probably only gonna focus on the multiplayer for this review campaign is good but not the typical cod campaign but despite this being the best current generation call of duty compared to ghosts and advanced warfare the flaws of the multiplayer detract from a game with lots of potential just like ghosts and advanced warfare while the 3d movement makes this game feel refreshing compared to the old movement the map design doesn t really take advantage of this and are some of the worst maps in a treyarch game despite the game s amazing gameplay while the pc port is really good the balance is really off since treyarch only cares about balancing for the console versions and as a result there is one semi auto sniper that has no recoil fires really fast and kills in less than 3 shots while this may be balanced in the console version on the pc version this gun is really overpowered as you can imagine and treyarch refuses to create a pc specific patch to nerf it as a result this leads to the balance problem every cod has that everyone only uses like the same 3 guns since the other guns are underpowered compared to it while i still love call of duty s multiplayer it is starting to become really hard to recapture the second prime of call of duty modern warfare to modern warfare 2,85.7,21.0,2,Not Recommended,"July 21, 2016",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Razorkiller1337

73458,2015 its 2015 and it s another call of duty not recommended to mid to low end pc users as it does have major performance issues regardless if the beta ran fine on your computer however it s still basically better then advance warfare in terms of gameplay long story short the multiplayer is broken so this is the following game set after black ops 2 the campaign is solid and predictable towards the main plot and overall deserves an average rating of a 6 10 now comes the multiplayer which we all are waiting for so first off these are things i see people arguing about during a match the main hype for the game is the zombie mode guys i bet you some people got this game for the zombie mode and i tell you it ain t like bo2 transit and the overall season pass for the giant map i give you all a basic overall on the game and let you all decide on it the good they gave us dedicated severs as promised and this sure limited the amount of game lag experienced online promising 3 game modes to play along with split screen for sharing experiences with friends for co op easter eggs for shadows of evil and in depth detail towards plot and story line flexible movement system which flows to movement compared to the exo movement game customisation such as camo uses attachment overview and in game sharing for features in other modes zombie mode unlock mode after completing the campaign theatre mode returns after 3 years workshop support with moding tools the bad the graphical lag when setting to quality over performance needs to be patched sluttering lag and low fram drops 1 game launch mode for steam personal season pass again for later dlc spams important no one likes supply drops and stop selling them bland campaign story mode predictable whats f ucking broken as usual the balancing of smgs in cod is broken for eg i notice that majority of the smg users tend to stick towards the vmp and vesper these gun needs balancing as towards bo3 gameplay focus on a ads play style and people would normally hip fire due to the high fire rate of these smgs when compared to the huge spread when hip fire with other weapons people will realise what s the actual play style of bo3 well at the moment a few maps have an overall flow and balance to spawns and movement maps like infection redwood have no reason to exist in this game does anybody think they are so similar to maps in ghost it s a bad idea for too much vegetation it s like snow related maps like the past mw2 derail and mw3 outpost there is just something missing about the game when compared to black ops 2 guys if you can give me more broken elements i can update the review and tag ur name in the review so personally its just what you feel about call of duty lets face it and be honest that they should give it a rest after this game,263.6,20.0,2,Recommended,"November 6, 2015",Call of Duty®: Black Ops III,"Thatweirdguy's Hero
