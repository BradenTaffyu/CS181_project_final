had to wait to log on today as bethesda was doing maintenance and an update after finally logging on my map was no longer working correctly no quests active or inactive appeared on the map even though they were on screen and in the pip boy tried all of the remedies log on log off log on log off etc unchecked all in the pip and turned off in the hud saved and re opened still nothing uninstalled and re installed zero tried using a different character and managed to lose all of my level 48 game while i know that s not that high but i had well over a hundred hours to get there i ve been on steam for over 20 years and have never had a problem with a game like this after they do an update can t tell you how frustrating this is all done with bethesda
