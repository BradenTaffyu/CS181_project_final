2016 this game started off as quite fun i like the idea behind it but it definitely suffers from paradox syndrome paradox syndrome is a disease in which games are born unfinished with numerous gaps in content whilst pleasing to the eye and imagination they are ultimately empty or unreplayable unless the player is willing to wait at least a year for patches or worse to send more money for incremental improvements in the form of dlcs which i see is the developing pattern here i like the game and my initial thoughts were that it was fun after a second play through however you realise that tech trees are actually rather limited and there are only a few combinations of weapon worth equipping your ships with in terms of story line we were promised more mid game developments which have been introduced their effects however were limited i had a race war on one of my planets but in all honesty i didn t need to pay any attention to the results so although i like this game and like the style of paradox games in general i really dispute their methods for brining games to market
