2023 let s ignore the performance and optimization problems and turn to the other issues zoning is a mess the system gives priority to older roads for zoning but if you only build a 2 square size house at a square you can t zone the remaining inside cells from the other road the game punishes you if you try to be realistic in smaller details there is no simple undo key no bicycles however there are parking spaces they probably will use your parking lot but they ll disgrace you if you destroy it furthermore the parking lot creates red max noise even without a car in it citizens keep complaining about healthcare even if the healthcare has capacity available you can t mute the bluebird announcements the news is repetitive on the radio you can control taxes in detail this was nice but you can t control the budget in such detail if you reduce the welfare budget you also reduce the police station s budget if i understand correctly this can result in a sin city scenario less welfare more crime fewer police more crime so once you build a welfare center you can t deny accessibility when you control the budget they don t tell you how much budget is just enough for your city let s say you don t want to invest too much in sewage and water you just want it to run efficiently without overconsumption you can play trial and error to find the sweet spot no placeable props the road is more detailed but you still don t have enough freedom to control it just a basic option to turn off auto painting crosswalks there is no hard or traditional playstyle option i don t want to get a ton of money every time i want to develop a remote village and fight for taxes let me do it sadly i m about to reinstall skylines 1 this is currently a demo version
