2018 the whole game is designed to annoy the ai is constantly sending you random messages it denounces and declares war right after they signed a trade agreement because the trade made them rich enough to look down on you resulting in the trade agreeement being cancelled the ai not being rich enough anymore and then easily accepting a peace offer as soon as you touch a single thing in their posession a child could trick the ai also the game starts off with unskippable eardrums busting trademark lineups that you have to break in the game files so they don t play anymore the game plays like a chess game not like an empire builder while that might be totally fine for other players i was looking for immersion not for tic tac toe previously the game took pride in using quite interesting quotes from intersting people of the past but now the brightest of quotes comes from monty python the game s speed can only be manipulated as a whole and is not designed to work but to be modded away on day1 on marathon the game balance just breaks completely it takes between 30 and 90 turns to make a military unit if your city isn t super focused on production making it impossible to create backup during a war thorugh production shifting the game balance towards gold is the way to go and to expect there is no backup making entire strategy branches unplayable medieval ages and rennaissance yet again pass too quickly and are not fleshed out eventhough they re the most interesting the aqueduct district cannot be placed at a river if that river is in the desert which means you can t win the game if you start off in a desert biome auto exploration is dumb as a brick it prefers to reveal distant parts of the map instead of the proximity when exploring an ocean it leaves out entire portions of the ocean wasting many many turns just to come back way later the ai is also stupid in the matter of being unable to settle accross the ocean i was already approaching industrial ages when i discovered an island that an ai player must have seen the whole time they were having a hard time developing because all space on the mainland was already occupied or useless that island on the other hand was rich and valuable but they never bothered to colonize it because there were 2 tiles of coastal water inbetween so much about colonial age i like that they finally made the jump to 3d but everything else about the game is just godawfully annoying
