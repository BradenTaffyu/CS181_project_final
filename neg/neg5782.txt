2018 for perspective i ve bought most every total war game up to this point over 10 titals and i m a huge fan of the realistic historical combat and tactics type game however this game is a lack luster addition to the total war line at the time of it s release it was horribly bugged and unbalanaced in a state that i would call beta and i paid for a complete game the ai is stupid even on higher difficulty levels with few if any rivals rising to challange yours once you have more than 6 7 provences you ve already won the game with no meaningful threat for the rest of the campaign additionaly many of the unit special formations proved not to effect to gameplay in the same way they did historically or seemed to debuff the units they were ment to enhance with all these failures this game made me wonder if i d ever buy anouther product from total war however with reguard to the political surrounding and sgw history revisionist idiotcy i m now 100 sure i wont buy any more total war games i played these games in an attempt to escape reality for a time to venture into a historical authentic fantasy and play what if games in that setting i don t buy games that dare to lecture me on modern politics or force their ahistoric unauthentic feminist revisions into the game i can t tell you how stupid this move was sega i was about to buy your whole warhammer game line in bulk well over 100 and then this you ve ruined the trust of a loyal fan once and cost yourself hundreds in future profits all to make petty political points with people that never bought or played your game and wont even after this sega has earned a black mark from me and won t get one more dime of my money until they tell the pc police to go themselves with a powerdrill
