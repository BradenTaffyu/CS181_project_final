2016 total war and warhammer two properties i have been a fan of and participant of for many many years finally coming together in what should have been a glorious spectacle of fantasy battle the likes of which has never been seen before i say any more i like this game i have played it through with each race and enjoyed it very much i have also spent many hours modding it it s a decent game very playable however despite putting out a decent game it has a lot of issues in terms of lore missing content and scope the warhammer side of things is largely very good apart from characters not starting where they should and iconic units missing from the game oh and a smaller campaign map than there should have been although it is very playable quests are great the sytle and feel of the game is awesome and the graphics are excellent on a total war side the game is basically an arcade version of total war it lacks many features from previous titles and fails to improve on functionailty that after this long really should not still be so lacking diplomacy being the biggest bugbear in this case campaign map ai is also terrible with it s agent spam and mm perfect movement prediction meaning it literally avoids your armies the entire game ca in their wisdom have stripped down total war into a graphical masterpiece and are now relying on two things the modding community and dlc releasing day 1 mods to placate a community not happy with design choices is bad practice by anyones standards relying on the mod community to fix ai provide lore based extra units fix battle speed and generally make the game replayable is just poor developing despite running a good dozen mods of my own and other peoples i still have not played the game in a few weeks as i feel there is nothing new to do the campiagn barrely lasts 8 hours once you know how to play and harder difficulties add little to the fun other than huge bonuses for the ai not more competant gameplay and then to the dlc ca sega and gw seem to think that we are made of money despite the outcry over the day 1 chaos dlc they have further insulted their fanbase with a near 20 dlc pack for a single not overly popular racepack they say it s related to the content however there is in no way anything like 33 of the content of the main game included in this race pack that s also missing units so i can t see how that s a valid argument at full price the current game costs 90 already and that s only including 6 of the 16 warhammer races i simply cannot recommend a game that is in my mind so incomplete and under developed at this stage wait unti a sale but even 45 is a lot for a game that has another two volumes multiple race packs and still isn t a full total war game quick comparison main game 150 region campaign map8 legendary lords4 playable raceschaos eventhuge number of campaign battle mapsall mechanics for gamebeastmen dlc52 region campaign map2 legendary lords1 playable raceno additional grand campiagn eventsmini campiagn with just 1 playable ll and race and only 2 races total a few new ambush mapsno new mechanicsi simply cannot see any way in which ca can claim this dlc took 33 of the same cost to produce as the main game it s just nonsense
