2017 early access review i ve owned this game virtually since it was avaliable on steam and honestly even with the cars they added recently the game still feels pretty much just like it did when i first started it has alot of potential but at this point its not worth the investment maybe in a couple if years the animations are weak and super generic there is the steepest learning curve of almost any game ive played and the progress of the dev s is so slow that i ve given up at this point i mean if u want an extreamly complex survival game with 90 s era graphics that you likely won t survive in long enough to actually experience any of that complexity maybe this is something you d like i remember years ago i d sing the praises of this game but now i won t be recommending it to anyone till its finally finished if ever and i can actually see what they want to call a complete game update still more complex systems and things to do but the ui is too cumbersome for the overwhelming variety of things that you can technically do in this game only problem is that you won t live long enough to experience the vast majority of this content but its in there to confuse and complicate the game and still no npc s
