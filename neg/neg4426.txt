2018 it s a decent civiliztion game it has a few interesting additions i like the increased focus on tile management but all in all it seems skimmed down from civ5 less units smaller maps religion seems poorly implemented especially on large or huge maps either focus all your attention on it to the exclusion of everything else or gain no benefit the ai is paticularly psychotic in this game the smallest things will cause them to go from being your best friend to mortal enemies oh you built a wonder denounced nothing has been done to improve turn wait times even on good hardware they re worse than previous civilization games the only way i still play it is to turn off city states i ll probably get some flack for not reading the fine print and not being psychic at launch but i feel cheated by the season pass that gave me 6 civilizations that wouldn t spark my interest enough to start up the game and not what was in my opinion the first dlc pack advertised i guess i need to stop trusting game publishers and wait for everything to be released before buying
