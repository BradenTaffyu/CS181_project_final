2022 devs willingly chose to ruin a lot of playstyles in 3 3 just to suit their egos at least that s what i assume as they ve never said why they suddenly decided that unity had to supplant half the already sparse uses for influence and multiple other nonsensical things don t pay scientists with money pay them with hugs megastructures to live in cost influence but everything else costs unity 100 cap on empire sprawl is a literal insult i frankly don t care if there are ways to mitigate the penalties this whole update should ve been canned before they put it through a beta release much less actually put out stop treating this game like it s early access it s been released for nearly six years stop gearing the game toward your stupid dev clashes and listen to your community
