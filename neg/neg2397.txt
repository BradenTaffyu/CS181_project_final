as someone who enjoyed two point hospital felt i would find some level of affinity to this game however while there are some nice fixes ability to edit buildings as an example most of it is downhill the game is stupidly repetitive beyond the initial comedic appeal of the courses the radio station seems to have at most 2 hours of chatter two point hospital had about 15 hours of stuff so it s always the same content when you sit down and play it and some of the levels are buggy as hell someone want to tell me how i treat 7 out of 10 patients if only 6 turn up furthermore the summers feel like a cope out giving you infinite amount of time to rest staff and sort out the campus for the next year really should just continue overall this makes the game too easy and too short i ll be at 100 in a couple of days of which most of the time playing is just on background while i wait to hire over summer i m also a bit unsure how to not get straight a students all i m doing is setting up basic colleges and after a year or two everyone is at least b honestly while i would call this a wasted effort it appears that they ve genuinely put significantly less effort into this than they did two point hospital with all of the quirky little detail taken out to rush something onto the shelf wish the developers focused on a theme park remake instead at least they have experience there
