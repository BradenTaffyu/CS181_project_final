2017 early access review i wouldn t recommend this game in its current state the newest update alpha 16 has caused some major regressions and bugs the new spawning system added sleeper zombies that appear in buildings or points of interest to be awoken by player activity this system has introduced bugs that cause zombies to spawn in rooms that the player had just recently cleared or are in the process of clearing to the player it feels like zombies are appearing in front of or behind them this has obviously become very frustrating for the community the newest update also added a poorly implemented game mechanic for attracting zombies to player created light sources instead of using occulsion the degree of light exposure to attract zombies to a light source the light sources crudely attract zombies using a heat map this causes torches and candles to attract zombies even if the light source isn t actually visible to them i e through walls this detracts from the immersiveness of the game because it doesn t reward players for making hidden well designed bases it simply punishes them for lighting their bases the premise of 7 days to die is great and the idea has so much potential it promises a minecraft like voxel base building and crafting experience that is rewarding to creative players but it also offers a pve experience that is brutal enough for your average player to voluntarily want teamwork with others rather than pvp honestly it s unfortunate that shortcomings in its implementation are holding it back
