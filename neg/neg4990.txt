2022 this is probably one of the worst total war games to date which is sad because i love this era and theme the unit balance is severely off the game isn t optimized the army construction is terrible the siege are super linear and silly the battles in general are unbalanced and frankly annoying the only pros i can think of are the hero generals and the art work other than that the game mechanics balance and optimization are upsetting to say the least i d only recommend this at maybe 5 10
