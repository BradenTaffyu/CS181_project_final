2023 game at launch is a let down why 1 the social system isn t integrated with steam and is very buggy expect to be constantly restarting your game if you want to invite and stay in the same party as your friends 2 there are only 2 4v4 maps 3 there s nothing that feels particularly new if you ve played coh you ve played this 4 it has a huge low effort vibe e g the menu is clunky more akin to something from the 90s than 2020s point 3 can also be seen as a pro given that relic messed up dow3 so bad trying to do something new anyway bottom line it s a low effort job by relic if you re a die hard coh fan get the standard cheaper version this isn t worth the early supporter edition or whatever the hell they re calling it for everyone else just get coh or coh2
