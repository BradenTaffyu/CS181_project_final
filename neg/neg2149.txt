war thunder is an immense tale of wasted potential a game whose real capability likely will not be realized until the day it runs out of steam its official servers close and it gets rebooted on private servers like has happened with several other once popular mmos enmasse s tera and capcom s monster hunter frontier as examples first of all the game is increasingly trapped by its initially advantageous business model the f2p or freemium model it s an easy way to get lots of players on board initially but the longer said model exists the worse it gets for example the combined ground mode is loaded with wheeled light tanks running around like they own the place so adding a few more doesn t really change much even if one gets a fancy missile here and there furthermore as a direct result of trying to get the most mileage out of the f2p model the devs try to play halfsies with every sub faction of the community and end up leaving everyone feeling unsatisfied ultimately they are ordered to do awful things by the board of directors for the company so its not even the dev team s fault necessarily when you re under pressure the first thing you look for is the simplest solution out often without thinking whether or not it is the right one long standing issues with the game as a result fester and go necrotic the general worthlessness of bombers and attackers in every single classic air battle map why even allow people to use planes that aren t fighters if the win conditions of the game mode are such that non fighters only get to matter under extreme circumstances of someone becoming a satellite or humping base aaa map design in combined arms modes is atrocious and getting worse by the update the sit in circle simulator beta feel of the combined modes has not been really updated in any sort of good way and instead of adding diverse new objectives to encourage the average player to use the entire map they cut off large swathes of maps thereby wasting the dev team s time spent modeling them in the first place all modes trending towards sub 5min moba shooters with planes tanks and boats ships where near zero brain power is needed match timers were shortened from 1hr to 25min a couple years ago many ammunition types for tanks and ships being finicky with their damage output some like heat are a total dice roll whether they will work as intended or go poof and do nothing upon impact extreme battle rating compression that is visible even at the entry levels of the game you cannot tell me with a straight face that a gladiator biplane stands any reasonable chance against an i 15 nor does a chi ha stand any reasonable chance against an m2a4 stuart with one brain cell nor does a coastal boat with only 7mm machine guns going against something with 15 20mm cannon s and the high echelons of the game are even more compressed still but the biggest letdown has been its supposed key selling point combined arms gameplay the topic of cas has been contentious for years you have one portion of the community wanting to go all in with it one portion wanting tank only mode at all costs and the rest trying to be quiet while the extremists on either end scream at each other the dev team utterly refused to firmly pick one direction here leaving everyone unsatisfied cas is implemented currently as a half baked killstreak revenge powerup its counters in many cases either don t work or have exceptional learning curves that few will undertake cas lacks all its real objectives forcing it solely into direct antitank or anti ship duty dumb game mechanics like the kill camera encourage its use in revenge bombing someone instead of addressing any of those usually what happens when screaming gets out of control is a heavy handed nerf to ordinance which comes with the bonus of being applied to all the air modes too thereby making already irrelevent attackers and bombers worth even less than before war thunder will always have the potential to improve but in order to do so it must admit that it cannot make everyone happy and instead must firmly decide what it really wants to be it can be a moba shooter or a simulator not both it can have cod killstreak cas or feature novel objectives for cas other than popping tanks not both ammunition can either do reliably large amounts of damage or act like near total dice rolls if anything happens at all i foresee the game eventually stabbing itself to death then being resurrected on private servers after which it will begin to realize its unseen potential it is trapped in the f2p economic system and the constant ever increasing flood of new vehicles that model demands leaving ever more limited time to work on the necrotic core before it all collapses how many years will it take for it to all implode no idea it s already going for 12 years this november i would be surprised if it lasted 20 but because the bones of the game are still pretty robust with enough churn in the development department it could still always turn a new leaf at any time and truly begin to grow by leaps and bounds
