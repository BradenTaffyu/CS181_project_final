2021 i don t love this game i loved 5 i loved 4 i ve loved most civ s that i have played but this one just not feeling it and i ve played it a fair bit i think my biggest issue is that if you aren t uber aggressive and warlike in the early game you get left behind previous civ s you could play tall or wide and still compete you could play defensive or aggressive and still compete wonders are more annoying to get and they don t feel as important anymore districts just kind of me also i couldn t select an existing symbol for my religion i had to use a generic one i like using the yin yang symbol but couldn t overall i am just sad that i didn t like it
