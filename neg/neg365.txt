2021 right now the game is 14 bucks i wish i had waited instead of blowing 40 on it i can t give the game a full throated recommendation in fact you d be better off playing something else like fallout 4 if you want to scratch this particular itch every ounce of progress you can make is bottlenecked by ludicrously small stash size which cannot be expanded except by allowing you to store scrap in a special stash you can get if you subscribe to their paid service and by daily refreshes on vendor caps scrip this means at higher levels you ll be stuck with a full stash and basically permanently encumbered by an obnoxious amount of legendary weapons which you can neither sell nor trade in for scrip which allows you to buy legendary lootboxes after pretty much an hour of doing events every day combine this with janky combat they desperately need to fire their hitbox guy garbage animations broken quests dialogue a menu and ui that is absolute cancer and overall 3 out of 10 gameplay and you might as well spend your money elsewhere redeeming qualities it can be fun to play with friends the gaming community is pretty starved for co op so this can scratch that itch for a few hours also the community is mostly really cool lots of generous and helpful people though i imagine they re generous because they re looking for a way to clear a little space in their stash which again can t be f cking enlarged just don t accidentally steal something or shoot someone or you might get a 5 cap bounty that some guy with liberty prime armor and a gatling laser will show up to collect
