2022 early access review mount and blade has come a long way from its original inception and there s a whole lot for armagan and the taleworlds team to be proud of that said with the announcement of bannerlord s full release coming in just 1 month i find myself completely shocked and disappointed as a mount and blade fan since 2006 starting my journey with the original m b alpha i have been along for the whole ride and have never had a problem supporting this company over long development cycles and active beta testing periods because their games always continued to improve and deliver a richer gameplay experience when bannerlord launched the graphics and scale were impressive but it was a far cry from warband in terms of gameplay features and interesting mechanics now 2 5 years of early access later i really can t say it s that much better than launch in terms of gameplay features and interesting mechanics they ve polished the balance fixed a lot of bugs and crashes but they haven t really added anything significant to the core game sure they ve worked on multiplayer they ve worked on a console port but all of these additions to the game are just to reach a larger audience not actually improving the core game itself i think it s fair to say that long time fans were expecting a lot more from taleworlds and wouldn t have minded an even longer wait to get this game feature complete but as it is it s about to release in what most would consider a woefully unfinished state it s a well polished early access game right now just a month before full release but so much is still missing the gameplay loop itself is pretty much non existent in bannerlord because supporting mechanics aren t fleshed out kingdom building and clan building mechanics are extremely shallow like just a shell of what they could should be and quests are all the same repeatable go here kill that go here talk to x minutia no matter where you re at on the map there s no unique flavor to different factions just different skins for their units and slightly different focus for how they fight all of this is fine for an early access game and i ve never once complained but to see now that they re calling it finished and releasing it in a month with a significantly higher price tag in several countries is incredibly disconcerting and disappointing to a long time fan like me and i m sure many others i m not saying you can t have fun with this game i m not saying it isn t worth a buy on sale i m just saying that the devs dropped the ball on their most ambitious title yet and it will be up to modders now to carry the torch and make this game great my only hope now is that the full release will mean greater support and accessibility for modders that they ll be able to get in there and do the job they ve been trying to do for years without constant patches screwing up their builds i sadly can t recommend this game for the price it s at currently if this is indicative of the full 1 0 release earlier we were buying a promise from a trusted developer now what you see is what you get and it s largely a disappointment i especially can t recommend the game at its future raised price after full release wait for this game to be on massive sale and better yet wait a year or two for mods to be in a really good state then it might be worth it just my perspective and i wish anyone happy gaming and hope that new players will be pleasantly surprised with the game as opposed to disappointed but from my perspective it s been a big let down to this point
