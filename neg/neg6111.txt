2023 i love age of empires and i ve played all the games in the series unfortunately this is one that i just can t recommend right now visually the game is a great leap forward over earlier releases and feels much more real in particular it removes some of the campiness in design that was present in aoe3 by returning to smoother models and dialing back the characters the game also brings more unique flavors back to the aoe series than were present in 3 to where factions really start to feel distinct again even while sharing significant portions of their tech trees an excellent balance the cut scene work particularly the embedded real world videos about the technology locations and time period are excellent inclusions as a history buff these were an awesome inclusion for the series the integration of these into the campaigns and the start of missions was also well done transitioning from real world videos to hybrid to game play fairly smoothly and probably the best than can be done with modern tech where this game struggled and ultimately gets me away from recommending is the campaigns there are a few exploring different periods and countries unfortunately each feels slightly half baked in terms of construction the missions are often very a b linear reducing the free form tactical options that make rts such a creative genre for players time crunch missions and overly hand holdy mission guidance attempt to railroad players into single solution thinking you must build and use archers only for this mission additionally the campaigns feel short like 1 3rd or so of the missions meant for them ended up on the cutting room floor while another 1 3rd were simply filler dash around quickly material that was allowed to stay i have no doubt that we will see follow up dlc which will add more campaigns and maybe even build some of the existing ones out more but i m concerned that a half baked original game is once again being used as a vehicle to move overpriced dlc fixes to an inferior product
