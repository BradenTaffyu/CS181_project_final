2023 early access review you re not trying to survive against zombies you re trying to survive against the endless labyrinth of ui windows clunky mobility and jank hitboxes your character will not have a dramatic hoard fighting go out guns a blazing story to remember your character will die to a single zombie because you didn t shove the zombie you shoved the air behind the zombie and now you re bitten your character will die because you clicked the wrong menu option out of a hoard of menu options your character will die because you didn t have the micro positioning needed to open a car door in a hurry no amount of monotonous grinding of any of the dozen or so skills your character gains will save you from any of those outcomes you go into the game knowing your character is going to die i was hoping to get that fun dramatic guns a blazing death where yea you died but you went out with a blast it was fun after 65 hours the only thing i ve gotten out of this game is disappointment
