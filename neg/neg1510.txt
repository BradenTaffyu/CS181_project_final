2021 early access review well it s complex to review bannerlord it s heavily based on the classic m b warband and it is in that light where it is judged and honestly although i enjoyed playing bannerlord at release i quickly tired of it i see from my playtime i got around 80 hours out of it which is good i guess but that was with mods and probably a bit of buyers remorse telling me to get my money s worth put simply bannerlord is just totally unfinished and 15 months after i quit playing it actually doesn t look much better the main quest is still totally unfinished has not even progressed afaik and taleworlds also seems to have crapped on modders which is unfortunate as they were the most attractive thing about the game all in all i can t recommend buying it warband is a better game right now and likely will be for a long time
