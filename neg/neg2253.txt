2016 tl dr very poor vehicle balance heavy bias towards soviet vehicles in ground forces double standards in selective realism features that tend to favour or disfavour certain nations not reccomended i have been playing this game on and off since closed beta if i remember correctly and had high hopes for it not only it held a lot of promise gameplay wise but it also looked gorgeous with great visual details to vehicles while not a very big fun of ww2 airplanes i awaited ground forces with anticipation to become a more history focused and sim oriented version of world of tanks i have been playing gf since closed beta and originally it was a real blast especially simulation mode and while game had a lot of problems back then including balance damage model corridor maps and the like the potential for a greatest tank game for ppl that want something more deep and historically accurate was there unfortunately it was not meant to last as a lot ppl noticed back then and still do up to this day game is heavily biased towards soviet vehicles while german vehicles recieve disproportionate amount of hate from developers and it only gets worse over the years what was attempted to be excused as bugs or overpenetration mechanics couple of years ago nowadays became a norm and it seems it was intended even back then in gaijeen attempt to appease their main player base which are russians to slow a player decline from game just a few examples of disbalance and nonsense that happens virtually every battle balance issues german tanks battlerating which puts ww2 german tanks against post war tanks and generally pits german tanks against opponents that were introduces much later in the war thus virtually making all german tanks inferior to their opponents what the point in tiger 1 100mm armor when it has to fight late war tanks from 1944 which can pen it from any range at any angle while tiger keep getting no damage even from t34 85s relatively thin hull gaijin supposedly strives for realism by adding armor coefficents for later german tanks to simulate lover quality late war german armor yet they ignore things like tank optics quality difference for example which all ultimately plays in favour of soviet tanks another example of this is british solid ap shells whith which you virtually has to individually kill every crew member of enemy tank to destroy it which translates into 5 6 shots to be able to destroy enemy tank and i f its a soviet tank then you can count on the fact that after your first shot you will be one shotted by glorious soviet gun unless ivan is too drunk and miss you in realistic battles where teams are being balanced by nations germans loose 9 out of 10 battles which speaks for itself most maps are made that way that there are almost no long range engagements like it used to be on old prokhorovka and mozdok maps which again greatly plays in favour of soviet vehicles which are more close combat orientated soviet glorious ap shells that 8 out of 10 times oneshot your tank by killing all the crew and detonating ammo racks while it takes several similar shells to take out soviet tank which is illogical considering how cramped soviet tanks were on inside if soviet glorious ap shell did not one shot you then it will somehow crit gunner driver and your gun at the same time this happens 99 hits out of 100 where german tank manages to survive the first shot nonsense that you will encounter almost every battles outsmarting and flanking enemy t34 on your pz4 f2 making a sideshot in a hull only to see no damage while guy notice you only after that casually turns his gun and oneshots you without much offeort for aiming outsmarting and outflanking enemy t34 with your tiger 1 shooting twice from short range at engine compartment to make sure there is no overpenetration as fanboys and gaijin like to claim after second shot with no damage enemy finally spots that simething wrong and drives away catching him 20 seconds later direct hull shot along the tank hull axis no damage while he shoots back on the move and oneshots your tiger just great so much about skill but seems not a requirment for soviet tankers this list can go on and on to eternity because as i said nonsense like this happens almost every battle it is really sad to see a game with such great potential turning into by its own devs trying to appease a part of community so school boys and always drunk ivans and nikolays can have their fun at expense of other players especially german tankers if we take realistic battles national balance into account while i understand their desire to keep players in game i think favouring one part of the playerbase over the rest is a bad call in a long run and only need leads to game stagnation at best so all in all i cant reccomend this game in its current state which seems to be only deteriorating over time and unlikely to get any better i will be cheking this game every half year or so to see if there are any positive changes in game mechanics and balance and might change this review in the future but for now not recommended
