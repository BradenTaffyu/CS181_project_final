2019 imagine just imagine you have a game made in 2016 it receives some really bad feedback due to mechanics and features that are lacking from civv however you also get feedback of bugs and game breaking issues you then spend 3 whole years adding in features that are from previous civ games and then you finally add one new cool mechanic players then come back to just play this new mechanic and after a month they all leave still the same complaints from when you first release your game arise when they leave so now you gotta figure out what to do to bring back players to buy more dlc since more and more civilization type games are popping up you look at the most popular game and go battle royal this is the content that will bring them all back you also drop 1 good change to coastal cities and naval units yet you still neglect the most glaring issue the same game breaking bugs from 3 years ago still plague this game except this time you add a new one now you can t even experience the game breaking bugs honestly a simple fix force the game to never let you to connect to other people finally no one can complain that these bugs are still here if you can t even play the game you have elected to remove everything from your previous games and half ass the things you brought into the game you not only ignore the game breaking issues but you also neglect the game itself i have never seen such a storm that makes me want to actually go to work and deal with the storm over there tl dr this game and the devs who still cannot fix a single damn thing after three whole years and then you add another game breaking bug you then add in a game mode that has no business being in this god forsaken game
