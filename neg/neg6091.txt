2016 love this game but paradox and their dlc practices at times they ve been willing to break this great game just to push out another overpriced dlc enough already hearts of iron 4 sounds like it could use all the help it can get and recent few eu4 dlcs don t give me much hope about the prospects of hoi4 dlc fixing what looks like a broken game
