2022 early access review bought it years ago and yet when i returned nothing was added or changed nothing that seemed interesting atleast and after all those years and months of pathetically small updates that barely added any content at all they decide to call it finished and announce their full release a full release are you out of your mind it feels as barren as the day they first launched it and is nowhere as interesting as their old games i was looking forward to seeing how far they could bring this game but it seems like theyre throwing down the towel and calling it complete and dont even get me started on how theyve dumbed down the game for a console release as well just sad to see honestly
