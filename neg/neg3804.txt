2018 early access review i used to love this game don t take me wrong a17 is decent however they overhauled the game in a way that is no longer rewarding back on a16 it felt like the progress you made was because you worked your ass off to get those high quality items and you would use them carefully because even though you where able to fix them this would cause them to degrade on the other hand in a17 you can fix your items without any concern whatsoever they even messed up something as simple as cooking just how the hell does making eggs and bacon should require you to use 10 meat in the process it feels that they thought that the best way to make the game challenging was to rank up requirements for crafting and to make tediously slow the capabilities of the player to acquire resources the only thing they did better on the current build was the resolution and textures of some things and the quality of the menu so until they decide to take the challenge back to the game i wouldn t recommend this game but if you love bullet sponges as enemies by all means buy the game just another thing they messed up in order to make the game more of a challenge edit after almost 2 years apart from my first review i still wouldn t recommend this game that is unless you are in dire need of a heater for your room because believe me after running this game for a couple minutes your going to be able to use the damn thing as a stove for those sweet christmas left overs all aside i have enjoyed this game quite a lot however i don t want anybody blaming me for giving it a good review when it s clear that it needs to be polished quite a lot still if you want to support the dev go ahead and buy it at least the team has been working on the game since release and that on itself says a lot about them unlike many other early access titles that had been abandoned
