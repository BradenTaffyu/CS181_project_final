2021 this game is really cool i enjoy playing it however i feel it has several issues and its quality is that its civilizations not that its number six this game just seems like an exact rip off of 4 i m actually seeing more features missing they are qol features such as in 4 if you told a dude to go across the map they would just keep moving then inform you when they get there i assumed the same applied to six doesn t seem to be the case ill send armies across the map then an hour later real time check back and see they haven t moved despite the move lines they have been sitting there waiting for me to tell them again this is a constant all day ordeal constantly having to re order my units to do the same things repeatably unlike 4 there s no auto produce like 4 you have to continously tell your cities to produce units no auto building you have to order your builders every single round constant nagging over stuff that s not important such as you are still a barbarian tribe you got a tank invading your country and the games trying to force you to send envoys and establish trade routes this wouldn t be much of an issue in other games because it would only happen sometimes in this game its an extreme issue because its every day all day every single turn the constant nagging over stupid stuff that s not even a priority wears you down and breaks the game over time i dont really care about being invaded the constant nagging is usually what compells me to shut the game off feel like i cannot do anything without nagging i have to take anxiety meds i have to take even more when i play this game i smoke alot more too there s tomany rules to construction i don t feel like i m making my cities and raising wonders i feel like i m doing what the game is telling me to do there s no achievement or sense of victory because i m doing what the game forces me you don t build anything for yourself you are building cities for the devs the wonders alone are an enormous issue unfortunatly so are the forts you try to put a defensive structure at a choke point in an empty space and your engineer won t do it no explanation as to why you end up putting it where you are told which defeats the purpose the movement speed is an enormous issue it s common in the earlier age first unit ill send him to support an allie or invade someone by the time they get there i and the enemy are in the atomic era you and your target are rolling around in modern tanks jet bombers submarines and your dudes from the earlier era are only half way there do to this error i build the bare minimum units to guard my city then wait until i m fully upgraded and have researched everything to build an army because it s pointless there s no explanation as to what resources you need for what how does the food and amenities effect your people why is my cities just as successful with or without farms i don t understand you are forced to produce and build things even if there s currently nothing to do this is very frustrating it means it interfers with your personal agendas take for example you are in the process of finishing a wonder you re just trying to get thru the turns so you can then continue on to your next objective the game will keep cutting you off and forcing you to do stuff that you don t care about nor will benefit you take for example after you finish your research tree you are forced to research feature tech continously instead of just auto researching it stops you every turn to click and select very frustrating the only unit that can attack ships from land are artillery units it s a common fact that since the beginning air planes are the most common defense against ships you can t bomb them use helicopters tanks can t hit them totally ridiculous map generation is crap the sizes vary meaning huge setting on islands is different then huge setting on continent its common to spawn multiple factions in the same few tiles despite all the available room i find myself going straight to war because i have no where to build following that you are penalized for war everyone turns on you if you go to war the politics in this game are non existent all i do for the most part is stay in my base research and establish defenses and i got all these other factions talking crap making threats for no reason every single game ends in a domination victory ironically while being penalized for defending myself the issues are infinite i would need a bible to continue pointing them out what fixes this game are mods i have tons of mods to fix most of the issues edited a file for movement speed so that factions can reach one another before maxing out there tech this made the game balanced instead of me using cheats for infinite movement or researching everything straight from the gate while the computer was limited the amount of gold provided by the game isn t enough to do anything i edited the amount of gold everyone recieves so that everyone gets more resources instead of me just being super charged now all factions have tons of units and theres actual strategy involved instead of me just steam rolling everything i downloaded a mod for auto building this actually eliminated the cheating originally i was just using infinite moves so that i could build everything and shut the builders up now we all build at the same rate downloaded a mod so that it would stop telling me to research future tech over and over originally i was using cheat engine to make it so that it would never complete i have downloaded tons of mods and edited tons of files to fix this game my complaint is that i have did all this to fix the game and eliminate cheating i m not getting paid to fix this game edit files make these mods or look for qol mods the devs pushed this game out enabled steam workshop and immediaetly moved on to their next project without doing any polishing or fixing any issues expecting the gamers to fix their product that being the case when civilization 7 comes out i m aware they are going to skip straight to civilization 8 without fixing 7 if there is no mod community 7 will be broken and there s no point in playing 7 until civs 8 comes out because it will be broken just like 6 before purchasing 7 or 8 ill have to consider do i feel like purchasing something i have to fix
