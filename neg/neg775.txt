2022 i have really tried to like this game it s to the degree where i would almost consider it masochism that i keep trying every few months i go yaknow maybe i can play it this time i end up playing for a couple hours then uninstalling i don t think the game is bad in the traditional sense the combat works fine you get craftable and upgradable armor and weapons the base building which i personally just don t enjoy doing is pretty robust and has a lot of options the map has a lot of locations dotted around it i think my issue with the game is more personal preference i don t think the game is bad i just think it s boring i feel like the quest system is actively trying to prevent from getting invested in anything specifically the side quests i think i can illustrate what i mean by this with a quick comparison 1 fallout new vegas i don t think it s a stretch to say this is one of my favorite games of all time let s say you wander up to some random location in the desert you see a guy or maybe pick up an item and a totally unique quest starts if it isn t a quest the location has some other purpose maybe there is a specific unique item here maybe you can find some star bottle caps or so information on a terminal to help you on a later quest everything feels like it s there for a reason and it actively encourages you to check out random places you spot there are very few quests that feel samey at all in new vegas 2 fallout 4 you walk up to a farm some guy there was getting shot at by raiders so you help him he explains that the raiders are hanging out in a blown out factory down the road and then with no subtly he says if you kill the raiders he ll assist the minutemen so you go kill a bunch of generic raiders come back he gives you some caps and now you have another settlement to built on and protect this wouldn t be a problem but more then half the quests in this game are just this exact formula billy farmlord has some problem that requires you shooting 10 20 raiders and then he gives you another area to build in
