2016 while the early game is very enjoyable as soon as you have colonized a couple of planets the game gets tedious fast single player games suffer from a terribly inactive ai and closed borders which means there is very often not much to do to make things worse lots of the fun associated with micromanaging planet development is gone as you are forced to hand over control to a sloppy ai in the form of sector governors either way it is very clear that the game in the current state is unfinished and will require many more patches and tweaks to become enjoyable having played multiple paradox titles for many hours i m afraid that most of the fixes will come as costly dlc s i am aware that paradox tends to add a free patch to each dlc release however the new gameplay features are almost always exclusive for the dlc which will definitely be needed here not worth the hefty price tag
