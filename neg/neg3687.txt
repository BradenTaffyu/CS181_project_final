2019 early access review i remember this being much more enjoyable but alpha 17 has ruined it i liked how the old exp system worked where skills improved when you did things such as better shooting skills when using guns building is also much more frustrating even with a nail gun this game used to be very good but alpha 17 has screwed this game i also got a tip for yah if you liked alpha 16 where the skills were fun and the building wasn t a pain right click on the game go to properties go to the betas tab and select 16 4 stable
