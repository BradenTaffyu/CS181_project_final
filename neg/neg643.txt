2022 when this game first came out i would have wholeheartedly recommended it it s one of the best rpgs out there even if it does a lot wrong it stands out as a unique and enjoyable experience in a sea of mediocre and samey games that is until the console exclusive content came out honestly i have no idea why there isn t more negative reviews after it came out from what i ve heard the content is in the game files i ve heard some conflicting reports so not 100 even if it wasn t though it d be very easy to add but just wasn t added the developer omocat has had no comment on this fact in the around half a year this content has been out and chooses to instead drop merch and ignore peoples questions i avoided the content and tried not to say anything as you never know whats going on behind the scenes but at this point it s fair to say that it s likely never coming and omocat cucked those who supported her and her game if you want to play this game either play it on a console or get it on xbox gamepass you dont just miss out on a little content playing on steam you miss out on a lot specifically in one of the games main alternate routes if steam is your only option i would still recommend just biting the bullet and playing it on steam as the game is amazing with or without the new content and worth experiencing but if you have the other options take them 100 the fact that this game hasn t had a price gouge on steam since this whole new content controversy happened is also disgusting i could go on a whole rant about how omocat doesn t give a about those who originally supported her and just wants to milk those who enjoy the game for every penny but i wont if you re curious i recommend looking into her long list of controversies yourself basically everything with the original kickstarter for the game others have explained it far better than i can i love this game and it truly pisses me off how horribly it has been handled for all these years by omocat if by some miracle the new content does come out i ll change my review by as of now naw
