2016 i wanted to love this game i needed to love this game however what i got wasn t worth the pedigree of fallout in my honest opinion this game was worse than fallout 3 let us not even consider how it stacked up compared to new vegas this isn t a compelling narrative experience that grips you not one moment did i feel involved in the story or did i feel like my actions had the slightest of impact on the world this was a hallow experience one that was cheapened even more by poor design decisions and a lack of understanding about what made the series great i won t fall into arguments as it isn t worth the effort fallout is many things to many people but this one well it wasn t really fallout to me couple this with the dlc debacles and you have a game that ea would be proud of spoiler below they attempted to add some mystery and doubt as to your origins by making you think it was possible you could be or were a synth a nice touch i liked the idea and as empty as it all was it seemed to fit
