i was addicted i loved that i could customise my decks to my play style i was loving it i even started paying real money for wildcards to make my decks i almost got to platinum rank one then one day most of the cards i d bought were no longer available because of the set rotations or something wasted a lot of my time and money i just refuse to play it again now and do not recommend spending real money on it
