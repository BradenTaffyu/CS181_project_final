2018 early access review review is current as of 23 12 2018 will revise if i ever bother to re install and look at it again well 17 broke me i ve just deleted the game from my library and want nothing to do with it anymore there were parts of this game there were broken that were not fixed and parts that worked great that were broken lets discuss stamina what the f k seriously your entire game is now almost focused around this it s no longer something you do need to worry about but isn t a primary focus your food and water meters are no longer easily visible you have to go hunting for the panel that shows them and you neeeeed to keep them at 100 for the first few days while killing zombies if you don t your max stam is decreased skills wow great job the dev s f ked this good and proper don t even bother trying to build up a base each tree is one wood per hit at base level which you can t upgrade by using the axe you need to level to get skill points which you can only do effeciently by killing zombies leveling see above f ked the 10min crashes i ve got a pretty decent rig and can t seem to play for more than 10mins before i crash during a reload animation there is a old saying where i m from if it isn t broke don t fix it the entire game now falls into that category for me looks prettier but it s somehow worse
