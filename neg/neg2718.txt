2016 i wish there was a middle ground option i enjoy the game and if you look at my history with paradox games i generally love them 800hours on vic2 600 odd hours on ck2 and about 400 on euiv however this game is severley lacking depth the diplomacy which is primarily the reason i play paradox games as opposed to total war is almost non existant there is no trading mechanic whatsoever and it generally feels incomplete as a game and you ultimately seem ot be doing the same thing over and over again yet this is where i have the problem with saying i dont reccommend the game it is fun for the first few hours and i do want to continue to play it but im now playing a bit at a time and being bored because it is the same thing over and over again explore this star system investigate this anomaly its great while youre exploring and understnding everything but then its just the same thing over and over again and then you begin to see just how shallow this is as a game it really does feel like paradox are using this as a vechle to sell dlc which normally i dont have a problem with their dlc policy but this game does lack such depth it does lead me to think that they have stripped it of features in order to add them back in at a later date at a cost so yeah this game will be very good and im very excited for the next 12 months of this games development but perhaps if youre cash strapped wait for a sale honestly its the same thing over and over again
