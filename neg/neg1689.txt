2020 reviewing the game itself is easy it s the sims 4 and you either like it or not i like it and i would like to recommend it if i can play it that is half the time origin wants to update the other half of the time origin will block me from playing alltogether and after closing the game origin is still using resources does ea not understand that people want to play their games do they think their customers prefer to wrangle a badly designed and completely useless app
