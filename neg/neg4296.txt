2017 tl dr at the current state i cannot recommend this game not until the issues with the ai mechanics have been truly addressed civilization is one of my absolute favorite game brands so i was naturally really excited about the civilization vi and also preordered the game the reason for my late review is that my laptop unfortunately broke fairly soon after the release and i was without a pc until only very recently after around a hundred hours i ve now reached the conclusion that this game has a few core issues in how the ai acts that make it extremely frustrating and hard for even the most open minded player to fully enjoy the game i ve tried my very best to overcome the downsides for the sake of the many upsides and enjoy the game however in the end i just can t overcome the main downside of the game the graphical design is fantastic and the game packs with many welcomed ideas or enhancements like the districts and new wonder placement day night cycle new city state mechanics and the beautiful drawn map a major thing the civilization v was lacking was a proper diplomacy and that s what firaxis wanted to upgrade in the 6th installment of the series the ending result was the idea being great but the implementation not that much in this review i will focus on those few major points that keep me from recommending this game despite how much i love it otherwise the ai constantly denounces you for unrealistic reasons a few of them being your military is too weak you have so much that i do not having one other luxury resource that the ai doesn t you have accuired more great people than i have you have a different coverment policy than i have or you haven t spread your religion to my city yet it s absolutely frustrating when you try your best to be friendly with the ai but the relationship either starts right off negative or ends up going there very swiftly in short the ai most of the time thinks and acts like a very close minded pessimist the other negative aspect of the game goes hand in hand with the issue i mentioned above all the ai civilizations are more or less warmongers that seek any possibility to declare war on you my best experience was when in a very early game below turn 50 i met an ai and they immediately declared war on me this was followed by every other ai in the game 3 declaring war on me one by one during the next couple of turns half of these ai s i had not even met yet what makes the situation more absurd is that every time when you counter the attack of an ai who has declared war on you the other ai s denounce you as a warmonger the world shall know truth about you how does that make sense the recent australia update supposedly came with minor adjustments and tuning for the ai as well but i honestly can t see much of an improvement the core issues are still there instead of pushing out new dlc for the game i d hope that firaxis would patch the base game so it wouldn t feel so unfinished it is no coincidence that this game has gotten really mixed reviews so far and as a new buyer i would hold my purchase for now i will gladly change my rating later on when the issues with the ai mechanics have been addressed properly i love civilization and it greatly saddens me to give this game a negative review even if it wasn t my final opinion
