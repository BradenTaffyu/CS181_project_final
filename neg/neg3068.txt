2020 i have played this game a lot since the early days i have more hours than it says on steam because in the beginning i played the drm free standalone version a lot and switched to steam later it s a good game and i have phases playing it but it s just not the open ended sandbox colony sim it promises to be it s really a tower defence game you get raided by bandits at an increasing rate that scales with the size and wealth of your colony the only effective way to defend against this is to build quite limited and restricted kinds of defences specific layouts of walls traps etc in this game you don t build defenses to protect your colony you build a colony to facilitate the building of more and more defenses or you can neglect building the right kind of walls traps and bunkers neglect clearing away all the vegetation and obstacles for miles around your base neglect watching how the ai paths bad guys around the map to find the right squares to place traps and focus on building a cool colony only to have your ranch or artist s commune or secret munitions factory wiped out by attackers so you go back to building a base wall and traps and stuff that your artists commune would never build but there is no other way to survive there really needs to be other ways to prevent attacks like effective diplo or stealth or something of course you can play on easy mode with no raids but then the game is lacking any other imperative so this game is about building forts it s good at that i play it when i m in the mood to build a fort
