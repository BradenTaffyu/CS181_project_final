2017 its hard for me to say but do not buy this game its a broken piece of garbage and at its current state is only suited for multiplayer matches cause then you do not have to get frustrated by the veryveryvery stupid ai does this game has any plussides yes and no it has good ideas but the execution of those ideas is lacking and amateurisch at least we always get the promise from paradox that the problems will get fixed in the next patch or paid dlc but i have had enough the base game is just not good and badly developed its just to dumbed down and buggy a few examples 1 if you can avoid a war long enough you can steamroll the ai this because troopupkeep is non existent all the sliders from hoi ii and iii are gone because of that flaw the ai will continue to produce troops until he used up all of his manpower and place them at the borders then attrition kicks in so he starts losing preciously build equipment so after a few years you have ai countries that have massively huge armies with hardly any equipment left in previous games you had to stop building units at a certain point because you economy could not keep them up anymore 2 armycreation is so dumbed down that i have the feeling that paradox was just plain lazy and then made a pissjob doing it in hoi iii you could create divisions some had unique names like ss units etc armycorps armies armygroups and theaters with an entire commander tree in place mj general lt general general field marshallin iv you build a division jam them in an army and assign them to a commander and theater theaters are useless they are just in place so that your lower toolbar doesnt get crammed with army portraits then they implemented a nice feature called the frontlines and defensive lines etc its nice but you have to assign each army with its own frontline and on a large front becomes very tedious and the ai isnt helping either once you start gaining ground to lines shift so irraticly that you are managing more the frontlines then your armies cause overextending happens a lot so something nice done horribly wrong 3 aircombat and naval warfare are broken as hell the creation of aireal units with officers is gone just jam a number of units on an airstrip and have at it or get ready to get frustrated the mechanic of an airplane in my book is that is flies from point a to b in hoi iv thats not the case here the airplanes pop up at the sector you assign them to attack for instance german bombers are bombing the crap out of london they are stationed in france so they have to pass through a zone called the english channel logic dictates that if i put interceptors up in the skies of the channel i will intercept the bombers before they reach the target right not in this game in paradoxes wwii simulator the people of the world use wormholes or warptechnology to reach the target area and again due to a lack of any normal resource usage in the game airplanes dont consume fuel so build 20000 planes you can let them fly for ever and ever without any problem never knew people in the 40 s were that advanced the same goes for ships in hoi iii at a certain point you had to stop building ships due to their constant need of fuel dont worry here givin enough time belgium can build 50 carriers without breaking a sweat 4 division creator is awesome and again the execution is shamefull and ill conceived why the do i need army experience to add or remove units from a division because of this you have to put your troops constantly on training in the beginning of the game to get enough exp points to create the divisions you want and need but guess what once you start training your troops you get a nice 6 percent atrition bonus that consumes a lot of precious created equipment i understand accidents happen during training but busting tanks and artillery without human casualties at this rate is to punitive like my army are a bunch of toddlers who constantly break stuff while smiling and pooping their pants also the organisation penalty for adding units is so harsch that you leave the creation of divisions for what it is its like paradox is deterring people for messing to much with division creating my guess is that paradox knows the ai cant handle it and that by doing so we would expose the biggest flaw of this game and thats namely the ai who cant even manage the simplest of tasks 5 the economy that is non existent in hoi iii you could select a province and build stuff factories infastructure aa etc in hoi iv you do this for an entire region at a time and i find this lacking it puts a brake on everything in the game everything is limited now and that problem is seen best for small countries they have few regions so they can build few factories etc for instance belgium and the netherlands are small countries but in comparison with larger nations during ww ii they had more factories and industrial power now they are limited with the regional approach of industrial buildings also factories in previous games used resources like electricity etc to work this was also a good soft brake for the game so that you couldnt factory spam your country to get 500 ic cause you didnt have to resources to use these factories now these regions become a hardbrake and its destroys the game for me now you have to expand military to increase your economy the resources that are still in the game are used to produce equipment but the trade in resources in dumdeb down the trading of money military goods or other resources with a certain country is deleted now you just give up one civilian factory for resources again ill conceived and created to simplify the game i can go on forever to try to convince people not to buy this game buy hoi iii instead the game has its flaws to but i enjoyed it more the this piece of garbage i understand that people say wait a year or so and it will get better i am done waiting im not gonna give paradox 2 3years of dlc spamming so the game might end up being good the fundamental features of this game are broken no matter how much patches or dlc they gonne trow at it is gonna fix it shame on you paradox and shame on me for buying the field marshall edition ps this is my first review normally i wouldnt spend time waisting it on a review but paradox disappointed me so hard and swindles me out of 90euros that i had to react and show that i as a consumer will not be duped ever again
