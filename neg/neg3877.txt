2014 early access review this game has potential but as it stands has some severe flaws zombies can and will break through any building material to the point of manageing to break through solid concrete after a few days zombies spawn out of nowhere and will continue to spawn even after an area is lit up special zombies such as dogs and mutated bees are impossible to shake baring them getting stuck on world geometry and are increadbly annoying pretty much every mechanic in the game is stacked against the player dispite all this 7 days to die is beautiful with a very transparent development team that deserves support
