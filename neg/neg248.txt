okay this hurts to write i ve waited on giving my review on payday 3 as i believe overkill would be able to fix the mistakes they ve made at launch and within the first two months but they ve only managed to put a band aid on the wound rather than suturing it up payday 3 is disappointing i ll start with the positives of the game the graphical upgrade is amazing legacy maps like turbid station and cook off look absolutely stunning and makes me wonder what legacies they bring back will look like the engine change to unreal engine is a life saver diesel had its funny quirks but payday is definitely a game that requires a better engine to be the heisting fps it was always meant to be and with unreal we got that the music is astounding with the departure of simon viklund i was excited to hear what the new musician would bring and i can firmly say gustavo coutinho has done an amazing job at living up to simon s legacy with his work on payday 2 and now payday 3 i can t wait to see what his genius comes up with for future tracks the gunplay has been improved drastically it makes me feel like i m in more of a real life police assault rather than a fake horde shooter guns feel more real in this game than they did in payday 2 stealth changes the changes to stealth are amazing stealth was definitely in need of a makeover and the new mechanics such as being able to do more in casing mode and the ability to full on beat stealth heists unmasked adds new challenges that payday 2 could t do now onto the bad side of things lets start with the obvious online only i m sure overkill you have your reasons for online only but by going with live service you completely alienate whole sections of your community who would love to play your game going online only because almost every big game like apex fortnite overwatch 2 and others or because it s industry standard is not the way having online only can make it impossible to play if servers are down if i paid up to 90 for a game only to be unable to play it because servers were down i d be pretty pissed an offline mode needs to be added it should not be on the table for discussing it should be on the table as a feature that needs to be added an offline mode brings back the sections of the community you alienate and brings more players to your game payday 3 should stand out among other triple a games or industry popular games by using what payday the heist and payday 2 have learned for it those games crawled and walked so payday 3 could run and right now it s not running 40 for a triple a game made with the latest engine more than fair 60 for the game and half a years worth of content also fair 90 for the first full years worth of content and the game itself also fair if you fix the online only issue the problem here lies with dlc pricing in the heydays of payday 2 a dlc costed around 5 and with that you got a heist tons of cosmetics and at least two weapons in the late days of reviving payday 2 it got more expensive with dlcs costing maybe around 6 but there were bundles which included all dlc for that campaign payday 3 on the other hand has dlc heist yes just the heist costing 10 the weapon bundle 6 tailor pack 5 lootbag 4 to expect your player base to pay so much for the dlcs with the game quality being as it is right now is insulting it s a spit in the face to your players removal of crime net where did crime net go instead of crime net we got call of duty like selection screens for heists making searching for specific lobbies basically impossible as there is no filter system for heist tactic you are just expected to click and hope for the best if shade was a friend of bain s you d expect she d be able to get crime net running again pre planning why have we gone backwards to pd th s form of pre planning rather than payday 2 s pre planning feature that was introduced with the dentist with unreal engine at the front it should be able to handle a pretty in depth pre planning system in 2024 the pre planning should have been at least like payday 2 s if not more in depth leveling dear god instead of xp that you get for completing a heist at launch we got a challenge menu they have changed it to where you can rely on both just heisting or challenges to level up but the level system for weapons is still atrocious instead of having to buy or receive attachments from card drops you now how to level the weapon up super slowly might i add and then purchase the attachments the game has become less like payday and more like call of duty with these changes if you want us to level up the weapons then increase weapon leveling speed and or remove cost of attachments since we already have to level the weapons up speaking of call of duty the menus are straight out of it boring with no personality payday is a game that has had tons of personality payday 2 had the most with it s menus looking like you were using an actual hidden network of websites to find contracts purchase weapons and such now its bland menus finally lack of communication the lack of communication from overkill has just made the community more mad as until recently they haven t said a lot about fixing the game and or listening to the community and now we have it again with their plans for february i m sure an nda is involved here somewhere but communicate that you are listening and are doing your best to fix issues the community finds wrong with the game i want to recommend this game to people and to my friends i want to talk about this with them constantly but i feel like i can t because of whats wrong with it please overkill make payday 3 the sequel it was always meant to be
