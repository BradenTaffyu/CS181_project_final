2017 loved this game along with all of the other bethesda games that have come out within the past 10 years modding has been a big part of my experience i might even go as far to say that modding became the game for me this new curators club update is horrifying mods have been still are and should always be free nexus has the right idea when it comes to users endorsing their product you dont have to pay for a single mod but if you love it and feel like the creators should get something out of it then you can donate to them this is not the way to go bethesda within a month skyrim will be the same way and i look forward to writing another bad review on the games i love in hopes of getting across to the devs
