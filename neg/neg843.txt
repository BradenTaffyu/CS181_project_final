2018 bethesda took the old fallout formula consolidated in f3 and new vegas and has turned it into a settlement building collect a thon with solid shooting mechanics and an average crafting system while this does change the nature of the game making it unfair to compare it to it s previous iterations the classic rpg elements of the franchise are missed another negative aspect of the game is that it is the first game in the franchise to actually shift from the traditional fallout continuity to doing whatever new bethesda thinks it s cool as is perceived by f76
