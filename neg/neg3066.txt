pros challenging early to mid game imaginative setting replay value addictive gameplay loop grind interesting trade system surgery and limb health system you can organ harvest replace limbs with bionics this is probably my favourite part cons runs on one core meaning massive fps drops are certain shallow diplomacy slow too much hurry up and wait it gets boring interface is clunky and unintuitive once you ve figured out the mechanics the magic is gone and winning is pretty simple there are no story events or anything to narratively spice things up late game is just dull graphics are basically an animated doodle stuck on a proud parents fridge expensive especially the dlc gameplay has changed very little in eleven years conclusion all in all this is just a colony simulator under the guise of a story creator it kills some time and has its moments but the only thing that really makes it stand out is the ability to do quite horrible things to your colonists other than that i would say this game is propped up by mods that frequently get broken and a fanatical community fully committed to the sunk cost fallacy if the price was reasonable that would be fine but as you can see the price is not reasonable the developers greed and laziness continues to grow at an astonishing rate its up to you whether you pay the price demanded i would not recommend it there is simply no good reason for it
