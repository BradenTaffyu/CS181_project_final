2018 are you looking for a good history game don t waste your time with this one this is a fantasy based game now according to ca rome ii has been patched to be historically authentic not historically accurate those were their actual words if you re into history this game will only frustrate you ca decided to destroy their integrity for the sake of virtue signalling not worth buying edit ca tried to flag my review as abusive i want to thank the valve mods for not censoring reviews i could not have less respect for ca right now
