2023 it used to be good used to and what a shame in the good old days the game revolved around a circle of ships that countered each other though their were things you could do to ease that battleships countered cruisers cruisers countered destroyers destroyers countered battleships aircraft carriers were introduced at first with something called the rts system but that changed to the detriment of the game because apparently the captain of the carrier also flys the planes or something at least that s what wargaming thinks happens in real life this was the first worrying sign as now a class of ship was introduced that could effectively counter everything its planes can spot thus rendering dds pretty useless however aa on ships was somewhat effective that would not remain true wargaming however started getting more and more greedy they noticed that people who play carriers tend to be the ones who spend the most money so they can play with their new toys thus wargaming began to focus on appeasing them introducing more and more overpowered ships but the balance was still there sort of fast forward to now submarines counter everything they are fast have magic homing torpedoes and can outspot anything and tanky to boot even destroyers that are made in real life to counter them just try to avoid them wargaming itself in fact stated once they would never introduce subs as it would break the balance of the game well that didn t last wargaming itself has doubled down on its greed introducing made up ships such as the disgusting hybrid ships because apparently they think people needed more sky cancer flying about matchmaking is in utter disarray due to wargamings obsession on getting new players and selling tier 10 ships you will find new players at higher tiers often one team will be almost entirely new players or bad players whilst the other team is made up almost entirely of seasoned veterans what follows can only be described as spec ops vs a group of blind deaf children most games will be blowouts where you or the enemy will get utterly obliterated typically the former enjoyment is not a factor in wargamings decision making process doubloons the premium currency costs more than bitcoin it seems and you need a lot of it to get anywhere as well as to do things to reset skills and etc oh you can earn it in game about 100 every month when you need about 20000 to get a halfway decent ship wargaming also does these constant token events where you can get tokens and new ships by completing objectives sounds fun right well what they don t tell you is you need doubloons to actually purchase the ships don t get me started on the auction house event 99 9 of players need not apply many of the missions are designed to cater to whales who do nothing all day but play and spend money especially dockyard missions they will often require you to do say millions upon millions of damage or earn millions upon millions of exp credits and etc its designed to be as long winded as possible unless you constantly play or of course pay to skip stages you will not get anywhere close so for people with jobs and a family you are done oh containers that hold premium time are activated the moment you unlock them so you can t hang onto them they also have a battlepass system there are two tiers free and premium here s the catch premium time doesn t give you the premium pass nope spend more money i get they want to make money however the game focuses on pulling in new players whilst older players are left to rot many ships are laughably unbalanced and many ships have not been touched in years and are uselessly outdated wargaming is focused on introducing as many silly ships as possible does not make sure they are balanced and then moves onto the next gimmick if you decide to play subs and cvs be prepared to be abused because people will hate you and they will not support you at the moment the game is dominated by submarines and carriers if you want to play a surface ship you will be at their mercy just as wargaming wants wargaming does not care many idea have been put forward to fix this and people have been begging for balancing wargamings response to this is oh look a new shiny ship look duckies i did enjoy this game when i first started playing but i can t recommend it in its current state nor would i with wargamings greed and utter disregard for their player base edit i also suspect wargaming to use bots to review their game and praise it a lot of 1 game accounts just loving warships something is just off and uncanny another edit 25 08 2023 i highly implore people to change their reviews to negative because only then will wargaming listen they recently shut down the forums to shut down any criticism of their brain dead decisions my review still stands though i have now completely stopped playing and there s very little reason now to return due to wargaming being corrupt you can add mines to the list of nonsense too
