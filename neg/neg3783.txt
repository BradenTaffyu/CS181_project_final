2018 early access review this game has and always has had massive potential to be actually good i do like this game but to be honest it is really just trash as much as i love it honestly it ll probably never make it out of alpha and if it does it ll be half assed if any of the updates over the past six years show anything about where this game is going tl dr devs are removing features instead of adding game has become grindy and updates are few and far between most of the game is unity asset flip and the world is bland and feels so empty it feels like 7 days to die is just a proof of concept right now seeing as it is still in alpha but the thing about that is that this game has been in alpha for six years on top of that it s not like there are just 2 or 3 people working on it 30 people are working on this game the devs say that they re still working on it but the most recent update alpha 17 has been a massive dissapointment the time between alpha 17 and the update before it was over a year and in that year they didn t add very much the patch notes are long but for the most part alpha 17 called the biggest update so far hasn t really added anything huge other than optimization and bugfixes a few vehicles were added but not much else was added instead they basically changed a lot of the game mechanics to make it more challenging by making the game a whole lot grindier there are over 30 developers of this game and they are letting it stagnate and alienating their own community they changed the basic mechanics of the game that everyone loved and made 7 days to die unique now it s become a lot grindier because zombies are no longer lootable which makes killing them feel less rewarding they have a small chance of dropping a loot bag but it makes less sense seeing as all the zombies were once people they probably would have something on them killing and running away without at least getting their clothes or their cash to barter just feels wrong and in a real world scenario makes no sense you need to eat and drink basically every few minututes or else your max health and stamina are capped in previous versions eating would increase your max hp stamina and dying would reduce it but now it ll drain just by playing the game you used to be able to make a forge on the first day if you were lucky now you need to grind to level 20 just to make tools better than stone bullets have turned into confetti in previous versions guns were useful without even leveling up my skill in them in alpha 17 a sneak attack 2x damage headshot on a basic zombie with a 7 62 hunting rifle point blank will barely damage it you can no longer sprint backwards making dodging a fast horde much more difficult there are many more things i can rant about but i feel like this game isn t really good for most players the early 2000s graphics and the removal of features instead of adding new things makes this game feel like it isn t actually going anywhere
