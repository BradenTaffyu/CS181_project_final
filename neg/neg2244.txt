2023 war thunder is the best worst game of its kind it has huge potential however gaijin is squandering most of it this game has fundamental flaws in its gameplay and other things one of the biggest problems is how fundamentally broken top tier air and ground rb is starting from maps gamplay and gamemodes ground maps are mostly designed for ww2 vehicles and not mbts from the 2010s and it shows also gaijin has almost totally lost interest in adding new gamemodes which have been almost unchanged since the beginning new gamemodes have the ability to present something new and at least give the lackluster gameplay a chance for improvement such as adding an enduring confrontation mode for top tier air rb however gaijin appears to have no interest in making such improvements probably for the same reason as the suggestions that have been denied beforehand cue times maybe the cue times would remain the same or improve if gaijin would actually care about improving the fundamentals of their game but instead they are adding more and more half baked top tier vehicles that are almost unreachable for new players due to the extremly long and tedious grind they require gaijin shouldn t be suprised if many new players don t stick with the game for long considering how overwhelming the research tree appears in combination with the horribly low rp rewards i suppose those terrible rp rewards are supposed to drive you towards buying premium which is almost required if you still want to have an ounce of fun while grinding some of these vehicles in summary i would not advise other people to play this game as long as gaijin is unwilling to improve their core gameplay
