2018 i am a fallout fan this game is not for a fallout fan this game is a aaa poorly designed fps running on a polished version of a decade old engine with the fallout license and skin in this iteration of fallout you are a yes man woman on the search for some family member that your supposed to care about immensely whatever the plot doesn t really matter because it is loosely applied and terribly written what this game is actually about is running into a bunch of mini dungeon like buildings and shooting things while picking up every piece of junk you can carry all quests align you with lawful good you can kick and scream all the way through but you ll still be playing mr nice yesman and doing whatever your told like a good little vault dweller your character is voice acted poorly all the story archs are a mile long but an inch deep and you ll keep waiting for the moment when the game gets good but it never comes but hey at least you can do it all while listening to a 50 s radio soundtrack right no even that comes paired with an annoying radio dj that won t shut up long enough for you to actually enjoy the music
