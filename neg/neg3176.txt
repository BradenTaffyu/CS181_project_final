2021 tl dr don t even bother with this game the developers publishers do not even bother listening to the player base and actively gaslights them about pretty much everything if you like it ship to ship combat maybe but certainly don t put money into it edit 09 08 22 i like this game i was convinced to play it after someone me that it was similar to the naval gameplay of ac4 black flag in a way it does hold true and in many ways it defers i have been playing the game since late 2017 before it went to steam i had just missed getting the t5 october revolution battleship at the time and some time after that i enjoyed playing the game from the pve perspective it is entertaining if not challenging scenarios are quite a bit harder but more fun imo especially after the numerous scenarios that were released after pvp hadn t been my forte for some time but it can be a challenge if you can tolerate the constant insults and blaming above it all there are small things to learn in being good at the game ballistics shell type angling to name a few the recent introduction aug 21 of the new submarines have been met with mixed reviews while i personally find the new submarines new somewhat different and interesting other players have pointed out and i agree the issues that some ships have next to no counters against submarines relying on those brief moments a submarine decides to surface this further exasperates the issue of the new aircraft carriers attacking from beyond the range of most normal ships and having unlimited aircrafts to attack with all that said the new submarines are still in the testing phase so there is the possibility of further changes having said that there are certainly problems many of the fun scenarios that were added have since been removed the aircraft carrier rework have changed the ways carriers functioned so it now feels more like an arcade plane simulator instead of the older rts style which did have its own faults and resource management the captain skills rework is an example of a problem that did not need fixing then some of the ships in particular older ships that are considered overpowered are locked behind loot crates the missouri for example is a ship that is greatly desired and people would be willing to buy the ship straight up but it seems that wargaming believe they would get more money exploiting that desire by locking such a ship behind loot crates when most premium ships can be bought outright these things while greatly irritating i can tolerate what has lead me here is the failure of wargaming to listen to consumer feedback and value the consumer only as an endless supply of money they have been told numerous times not to implement certain mechanics or change certain gameplay and yet they do so against their recommendations their resistance to consumer feedback is so strong they won t even listen to their own community contributors of late they have belittled one cc littlewhitemouse a person who is widely respected and is considered a pillar of the community to the point of resignation with most of the biggest ccs following an example of the labor she has put into the community can be demonstrated here another example of wargaming s failure to listen to consumer feedback is the torpedo bug that has been affecting players largely destroyers for months as a player maneuver their vessel launching torpedoes will not head towards the direction in which the aim indicates considering many destroyers rely on their torpedoes for the bulk of their damage and it is already hard enough to hit their target since torpedoes move significantly slower than shells this is rather disastrous to many destroyer players to my knowledge this bug still exists while i like this game and while i might want others to like this game i would certainly discourage anyone from putting any more money into this game edit addendums
