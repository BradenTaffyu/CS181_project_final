2020 europa universalis iv is one of my all time favorite games i ve spent nearly a thousand hours playing through different scenarios its a sandbox game of risk you don t have to do any one thing you can play however you like and make your own objectives i love this game and will get absolutely lost when playing it is challenging and will have you struggling to win which makes it all the better you actually have to find a way to outsmart your opponents which in the modern realm of gaming is mostly a non factor most modern games rely on power structures which allow others to win as long as they play more often or faster that is not the case with europa this is a difficult strategic game and it takes a while to get good at playing it fact the game has changed so many times since its release that it is non recognizable to anyone who hasn t played for 6 months it is unplayable without the dlc s of which there are way too many europa universalis iv in its current state is more like europa universalis x europa universalis iv doesn t exist anymore since you can t go back to earlier versions before certain dlc s were released this is not the game i purchased 7 years ago this is not even close to the game i purchased 7 years ago and frankly its not the same game from last year i just want to play the game i purchased is that too much to ask additional review after giving the game another go i ve come to realize how stupid this game can be i want to love it it has everything to be great and then it has game breaking mechanics that can ruin what was a very successful campaign you make one one wrong decision a decision that has no warnings and seems completely innocent like spending merit as ming and then finding out you are about to have a looming distaster in 12 months because you spent it too soon and needed to wait so you have at least 30 remaining no warning and boom 500 rebels bahahahaha what a joke of a game ruined a perfectly good playthrough at 25 hours in this game wants you to lose soooo bad
