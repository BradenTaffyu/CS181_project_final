2015 i m going to split this review into sections so it s clearer and not just one long rant i m going to cover the air combat but alot of this applies to ground combat aswell tl dr at the bottomcommunity if i could go back to old warthunder pre 5 tier system i would still play this game daily this started as a great game but the dev team is just so stupid they constantly implement pointless and unwanted features they don t listen to their community at all and if you so much as hint at it not being good on there website you will be instantly and permenantly banned from their forums and the moderaters for the english forums barely even speak english probally with a few exceptions this game is mostly made of new players because the devs drove away all of the vets with this now the game just feels like a pub stomp even in the realistic game mode all of the youtubers that play this game except for a few big ones have quit because the money grabbing devs the never ending grind it was pretty obvious that they were slowing starting to move to p2w progress when they added the 5 tier system the 20 tier system allowed you to actually progress in the game instead of grinding for what seems like years for a single plane well if it was so much better then why did they get rid of it so you actually have a reason to give them money duh in the 20 tier system every time you leveled up you would get the planes for each level so if your level 5 you get all of the planes at level 5 level 6 you get the level 6 planes ect well now not only to you have to grind exp for each level but you also have to grind exp for each plane on top of having to grind credits to buy the plane this makes it so depending on how much you play you may need to grind for a month to get 1 plane the only way to speed up the grind is to either buy a premium plane buy premium time buy credits or buy gold to convert free xp which you have to grind by playing the game in the first place i thought it was called free xp not pay me money so you can use the xp you ground out already i have around 2 million free xp that i could easily get a jet for but it would probally cost me anywhere from 75 150 to convert it and i refuse to give this company any money balancing the 5 tier system was doomed from the start cramming houndreds of planes into 5 different tiers of equalness makes no sense which is why they brilliantly implemented battle tiers sarcasm basically the battle tier system takes how well a plane is performing in the average players hand and appropriately places it in a 20 level battle scale before i even address how flawed this system is why did they even remove the 20 tier system in the first place if they are just going to do this anways this battle tier system is just so flawed like come on wasn t it obvious what was going to happen gajin when terrible players are put in good planes and perform terrible they are placed at a lower level then good players get in the same plane and absolutely stomp also the nations that are played less lets use the for example are placed very wrong on the battle tier system most players start off using the americans or russian planes when they learn the basics of the game from getting higher levels in these nations they gravitate to the nations that are used less so when they do good in that nation there are not enough bad players to balance out the battle tier and the planes get placed at a higher battle rating and get put against unfair opponents this is especially true for the japanese in realistic battles with planes from 1939 against planes from 1942 every nation is the same every single nation ends with the same planes even the have a f86 saber almost every nation has an iconic premium vehicle from another nation americans have a spitfire brits have a mustang ect this makes the entire game feel pointless and cheesy when you want to play realistic battle and try to use your light and agile zero to out perform and out turn a clunky heavy mustang only to be greated by the 20mms of a premium spitfire that some 8 year old begged his mom to buy for him economy the economy for this game makes about as much sense as russian ww1 wave charging tactics it s pretty similiar to the battle rating system actually basically it takes planes that are popular and makes the prices to rearm and repair them more exspensive which means that the limited planes at lower levels are ridiculously pricy and make it harder to grind past playing the harder game modes used to pay out a much larger reward for making the player challenge themselves now you are just barely making more than arcade mode it is way more rewarding to just sit in a bomber at 20000 feet and drops bombs for 10 minutes wait for a fighter to spend 5 minutes to climb up to you and then suicide in the ground and respawn then to fly around and have fun in a fighter plane summary i spent about an hour writing this review and could easilly spend days on it because this game is just so bad now i mean yeah its fun to jump in a biplane and shoot at stuff for an hour or two but when you put some serious time into it like i have you will realize that it is just one big marble block of disapointment that could have been a grand scultpure of a great game i have put way more hours into theis game before it was even added to steam and every time i see how much time i put into this game it makes me want to kill myself i left out a bunch of stuff because im lazy and am sick of thinking about this game pro s flying is fun shooting is funcon s literally everything else about this game
