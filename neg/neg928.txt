2017 tl dr huge downgrade from the previous games would not reccommend it even if you re new to the franchise where do i begin let s start out with the fact this is barely an rpg anymore the previous games had very little backstory to your character you could easily come up with the majority of your backstory for example fallout 1 you are from a vault and said vault s water chip has broken so there s no way to purify water no water no vault nothing about your character as a person just where they re from and why they re in the wastes fallout 2 you are from a tribe that came from the residents who left the vault from the first game canonically your character was expelled from the vault so he left wandered around and founded a small settlement originally a tribal village they helped out the the peole who lived there with his knowledge of the outside world you are the grandchild of your character from the first game heading out into the wastes again to search for the geck again where you re from albeit more detailed and why you re heading out into the wastes you can still choose who you want to be you want to be someone who can talk their way out of combat you can do that then we come to fallout 3 you re from a vault and you leave in search of your dad again nothing set in stone about how your character acts you can literally build your character from the ground up as the game opens with your character being born fallout new vegas you re a courier who was delivering a mysterious poker chip made entirely out of platinum to the strip you re ambushed on the way there shot in the head and left for dead you again can choose what you want to specialise in and then we come to fallout 4 where all of that choice is taken away from you as you can only be a male solider or female law school graduate you ve already got your background you re given a spouse and a child and you cannot deviate from that you can t be a female character who served in the military for example you cannot choose your background or anything almost all of your character is set in stone this is fallout for god s sake one of the main principles of fallout is player freedom and yet in this game it s taken away from you the dialouge system is downright awful only having four options is an absoulte joke and the only thing that matters in dialouge is how charasmatic you are if you want to pass any checks you have to put points into charisma nothing else nothing like any of the previous games where you had speech checks and skill checks a good example of this is ricky from the honest hearts dlc from new vegas and you can pass many checks on him using different skills and other perks example one of his many lies are that he killed a bos paladin by shooting through the eye slit with an 11mm smg with guns 45 you can say there is no such gun or if you have been to the brotherhood and acquired power armour training you can say that the eye slits are bullet proof with a medicine check you can see he s a psycho addict and you can sell him psycho or fixer or you can tell him that withdrawl in the middle of the trip would be bad and convince him to ditch the trip or blackmail him into carrying some gear for you none of these intersting checks in fallout 4 probably due to the fact they removed skills and there s no funny writing or clever dialouge i honestly cannot remember any of the lines in fallout 4 that were meant to be funny yet in fallout 2 you ve got things like this youtube video fallout 2 has interesting dialogue views 1 445 499 an example of some interesting dialogue featuring the enclave communications officer from fallout 2 14 years later this game is still neat i m honestly really bad at explaining many of these issues most of them are explained in here youtube video views 0 yes it s three hours long and yes i watched the entire thing i would also like to mention that this is the only fallout game where i haven t bought all of the dlc for i find the dlc uninteresting and the workshop dlc was an awful idea the season passes price was hiked up because the content was of a higher quality or some such nonsense it s a load of the game and dlc are objectively bad having only two endings is also extremely stupid and no the surface endings are almost exactly the same it would be better if you got a slideshow ending like new vegas or 3 where depending on what you did the ending would change but nope we just get two almost identical endings with absolutely no effort put into them i mean it s barely even a fallout game go and buy the previous games they re actually good this is also wip so i ll likely update and add to this review whenever i think of anything else
