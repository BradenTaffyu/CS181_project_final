3000 hours on coh2 100 on 3 disappointing homogenisation and lacklustre campaignintroduction company of heroes 3 fails to live up to its predecessor s legacy offering a disappointing experience marred by several key flaws faction homogenisation in company of heroes 2 each faction had a distinct flavour akin to chess with intricate counter play coh 3 however strips away this diversity leading to a bland game play experience where no faction feels truly unique until late game upgrades a departure from what made its predecessor great and reminiscent of the homogeneity seen in every game that desires to foster a competitive scene the game is an rts the most fun is had in 4v4 1v1 2v2 balance sweats are such a small percentage of the playerbase catering to them is nonsensical single player the campaign in coh 3 is a tedious affair lacking the brutal visceral storytelling that defined company of heroes 2 where its predecessor excelled in narrative depth and emotional impact coh 3 feels like a watered down stroll through generic scenarios the potential seen in ardennes assault remains untapped leaving a void where innovative rogue lite elements could have vastly improved replay ability and engagement multiplayer despite its aspirations coh 3 s multiplayer scene is a ghost town compared to its predecessor the dwindling player base speaks volumes about the community s preference for the older title highlighting significant dissatisfaction with the current iteration s game play and design choices aesthetic and atmosphere gone are the gritty realistic elements that defined company of heroes 2 coh 3 opts for a cartoonish overly cheerful aesthetic that undermines the game s historical context and thematic seriousness the absence of gritty swearing units and visceral combat contributes to a superficial un engaging atmosphere that fails to capture the intensity of world war ii conclusion as a long time fan who invested over 3000 hours into company of heroes 2 coh 3 is a bitter disappointment its lack of faction diversity uninspired campaign and failed multiplayer ambitions make it difficult to recommend for those seeking the depth and authenticity that defined its predecessor coh 3 falls short leaving players longing for the grit and strategic depth that once made the series shine verdict i cannot in good conscience recommend purchasing company of heroes 3 with a mere fraction of the engagement its predecessor offered it fails to justify its cost let alone your time buy the second game there are still more of us playing it than this garbage whatever relic used to be it is a ghost of it s former shell i wish this game was just as good but no amount of half assed patches and further homogenisation of the game will make it better it s a dumpster fire anyone who tells you they prefer the third game to the second is smoking crack
