2021 the thumbs down is due to the fact there isnt even one australian server i played way more then what steam says from master dar nala server back in the day and was in a big sith empire guild which fell through the ground after a week of the games release poor leadership mainly game is rich with story but you can do them as many times to see different dialogue options but thats it i d love to get back into pvp and pve content but playing with 280 ms 310 ms with 1 gbps internet connection is horrible i d imagine with the amount the game makes with microtransactions and ea behind them a single australian server shouldnt be4 to much to ask
