2018 early access review unfortunately i can not recommend the game anymore for almost a year they tell us next month and then today we get the message no release dates wants to be estimated it s done when it s done after 4 5 years of early access is just a sad joke finally an empty phrase maybe the developers felt a bit too safe there is no transparency anymore the community is no longer taken seriously through their infomation policy they have lost all sympathy i know its a hard way getting the game done i know they are a small team i know it could get a nice game but as i have read this old phrase today it s that kind of arrogance that makes me feel so angry and just sad if i would give that message to my customers they would smile and say goodbye and they were right this is not the way to get the community on your side
