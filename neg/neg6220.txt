2023 it works but it feels like pre release probably it should have been early access your npc allies are bigger threat to you then enemies combat randomly lags most of puzzles are not fun just designed to waste your time maps are big mostly empty large are 1 or 2 quest rest of is random trash fights act 4 has huge difficulty spike even on normal if your builds are no optimised your going to die in last acts 4 5 there are so many random decision to waste player i was skipping most battle with toybox
