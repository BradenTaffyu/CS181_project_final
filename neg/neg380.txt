its fun until you run out of storage space i hate being limited by everything vendors gold bullion etc i did one event and maxed out the vendors and filled my box i just get so frustrated by having to sort through and manage storage its such a waste of time it takes the fun away not being able to keep things i ve earned unless i pay seems so unfair the game takes up 100 gigs of my ssd yet if i want more storage i have to buy 1st us players build our systems to play games multiple games when spending 2k and up on a pc game cost stupid monthly fees to play it is it really worth it because your stuck playing and paying to play that game for the entire year if you want to play a different game guess what more monthly fees you should be able to keep the things you earn without a monthly subscription
