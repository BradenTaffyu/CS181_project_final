2016 fallout 4 is a worthy sequel to the much appreciated fallout series but it is far from great and it has many flaws positive many weapon types and therefore ways to play the game interesting leveling system world design and simple scope of the world many interesting places and non storyline quests built with lovenegative uninteresting counter intuitive settlement builder a repetitive grinding feature mainquests are lacking any emotional character or other distinct features where are the guilds we used to see from bethesda games the minuteman quests are so ridiculously bad it s a shame weapon customization is a nice idea but many features are unbalanced or not useful scopes still bugged overall im no fallout fan i always had my fair piece of respect for the fo franchise i really recomment this game to you if you are a fo fan you ll have a great time because atmosphere gameplay for you at least probably but judging from a gameplay first point of view i cannot recomment fo4 since it lacks uniqueness replayability and storytelling
