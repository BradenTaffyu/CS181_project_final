product received for free edit for 1 7 game still has terrible spammy gameplay think like a bland budget starcraft loop vehicle phasing is still terrible and the game rewards blobbing more than cover utilisation or tactical gameplay in most instances new sounds are just okay but could still be better the new art is beautiful and the new icons finally feel polished new ttk is also a step in the right direction but underwhelming as about half the roster is unaffected towing seems to be a lot better placeholder icons are finally gone the qol features like random faction are awesome but somewhat moot when the core gameplay is still rotten to the bone overall patch is good game is mediocre with extremely poor balancing continues to suffer from design problems introduction i cannot in good faith recommend this game even though there are elements i do enjoy i will admit the game has come a long long way since release but that is no excuse for the state of where we are currently at be prepared to wait 1 2 months for a major patch on a platform with frustratingly poor matchmaking lack of players and lack of content vs coh1 coh2 more incremental frequent patches with minor changes for the most abusive balance issues bugs would have gone a long way at providing a more positive and fresh experience but that didn t happen things done well performance stabilityperformance stability are the obvious pros of this with the game running on the latest essence engine visuals visually i think the game is in a decent place with the recent patch the new effects physics are pretty damn good and have improved a lot global upgrades factions i would argue that a strong area for coh3 is the us wehr brit faction designs they re not perfect but are they better designed than the abominations we ve had in the past with brits in coh1 okw in coh2 dak goes into the negative pile here regrettably that s pretty much where the benefits end which is disappointing when you consider this is the third entry in the franchise where a lot of the flaws have already been adjusted in prior entries not done well one thing i vehemently hate about this game is the atrocious icon overlap barrage of ambiguous circles hovering over each unit this clutters the game to an extreme degree and in most cases offers virtually no information for what is even happening there s still no explanations to be found anywhere within the game itself coh2 did these so much better by having them fully coloured animated with a spin only displayed over the entity of the unit itself infantry would have a temporary cross over their heads as they were healing which eventually disappeared as men were fully healed creating a satisfying visually clean process coh1 did this even better pathing since pre alpha it seems relic has been trying to combat the egregious pathing of units making seriously questionable changes like implementing partial phasing into the game this actually does not work as it is described and there s nothing partial about it any vehicle will physically half phase into nearby entities and then proceed to drive through the centre mass as if nothing was there creating a huge pile up on the same spot not only does this look incredibly pathetic for an rtt of this calibre but it also prevents skill expression or interaction from opponents or yourself whereby you could block vehicle movements and trap units like you can do so in coh1 coh2 i d like to add that you cannot physically body block infantry even if a squad is surrounded by 1000 entites on either side a path will be found and infantry will phase through each surrounding model completely removing skill expression and micro for the sake of simplicity i guess sound moreover sound design is now decent but not great explosions have a bit of weight to them and the camera shake goes a long way in helping immersion but i personally feel coh2 still did this better the voiceovers are actually the stronger part of the experience for the game but even so leave a lot to be desired the brits are arguably the best here and kudos for that nevertheless this does create a very uninspiring monotone experience overall that is just not immersive battlegroup faction design general design dak as a faction is exactly the same mistake that was done for usf okw in coh2 brits from coh1 to a lesser extent not quite as bad reliance on weird call ins incredibly mp starved with an economy that simply does not work or create interesting pace making you are punished for building mainline infantry because the faction crutches on broken units to keep momentum going through the various stages of the game add other hilariously bad passives from other battlegroups factions like the economy cheats where mp reinforcement costs are reduced by 25 and you seriously skew games for the worse essentially making it feel like decisions attrition just no longer matter if you do not counteract with a cheat of your own a controversial one but i think one area that propelled coh2 in the right direction were the ttk time to kill changes in the famous march patch coh3 needs something similar it currently has a ridiculous 20 damage reduction for retreating units negates any damage or grenades on retreats for example and such a high ttk where you could sit around and watch units blast each other in the face with no effect not exactly the immersive ww2 experience you d probably want edit better but still spongy the 20 damage reduction just flat out needs to go balance gameplay loop by far one of the biggest offenders of the latest state since the patch did not do a lot to touch balance we still have 0 pop bunkers free abilities across the board economy cheats terribly designed factions dak this will most likely be further addressed in 1 8 but that s a good 2 3 months away missing features for parity these are features that are straight up missing i acknowledge relic needs to recreate these due to the game engine but it s quite frankly embarrassing when you recall that they also added a minimum ditch effort skin store with freemium fomo currency before the game was even remotely cooked observer mode is still not present at the time of writing this review unit paths are displayed as a straight line on the tacmap coh2 had the actual path taken by a unit these things are minor but go a long way at enhancing the overall experience control group icons are not displayed on the tactical map why is this missing no classic hotkeys just a default grid system that i know has minor rebindable elements but you still cannot create a situation where reverse retreat are separate keys as they share the same slot completely stupid when you have multiselections that involves infantry vehicles are you retreating or reversing lack of content somewhat understandable as relic has been trying to fix the core experience but it is still a little light compared to coh1 or coh2 no vehicle crush no pinned squad crushing does not count considering pinning a squad takes an unrealistic amount of time that in 9 10 times will never happen in a competitive game conclusion the game has improved there s no doubt about that but it is simply not where it needs to be to retain the new players that do check it out i know of plenty that have tried it again and have just reverted either to coh2 or simply moved on i fear we are at a precipice where it is simply too late as most of the fans have already moved on but i hope i can be proven wrong and we do see an eventual resurgence for the game franchise as a whole if you are thinking of buying it at least buy it on a deep discount
