2018 early access review it has been over 10 months since the last pc update the game makers have been bragging and showing snippets of a a17 update that is set to bring many new vehicles sounds and interactions but not much anything else like stated they keep mentioning it even stating it would be released at the end of july 18 its not mid aug 18 and still no update this game is going to be like dayz in that it took them so long to push an update with new stuff that the game will die out and not recover it will have a small spike in user but it will die out fast and go back to being stale currently the game is semi enjoyable but only because of the dedicaded user fan base that spend weeks making mods that make the game more enjoyable the user made mods bring in vehicles skins even more weapons and zombies conclusion the game is dieing because the maker cant keep it word on fast updates mods keep it breathing but they can only do so much
