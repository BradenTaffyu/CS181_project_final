this is from someone who played cs1 both modded and vanilla with access to the dlcs some features of which should have been in the base game and others available as working mods from dedicated modders i would not recommend this game in it s current state as it is buggy and does not work once the zombies take over note this is not a zombie survival game ui roads will glitch when creating intersections offramps etc which is probably why they recently released a visual patch that allows adding pavement etc your processing speed will slow down every time a zombie is created how is a zombie created you may ask simple if you purposely or accidentally destroy a building that houses any amount of people those people will walk out to the street and just stand there looking for a new place to live but since you most likely have an outside connection i even tried without an outside connection still broken those available homes will be taken by new people and thus a zombie is created as moving in or idle if you destroyed a commercial zone you create shopping zombies these citizens will stay in your city and slowly eat your processing power until your game speed of 3 is 10 minutes for an in game day to pass unsustainable and game breaking only the first of many game breaking issues with this game sometimes the weather works and other times it does not and just glitches to the next day when it is sunny again traffic the ai doesn t respect lanes no surprise that the ai still does not work when it comes to traffic as they will turn in no turn lanes and do six to twelve point u turns wherever they can multiple times this is more common if you add or remove a road anywhere in your city and it also happens when you add a sidewalk or crosswalk this common task causes the ai to re think and recalculate it s route which causes them all to shift their routes no individual lane control which means the dedicated turn lanes are determined by the angle of connecting the side roads and a matter of one pixel will determine what the lanes do in response also the traffic signals and signs are node specific so there is no way to put a stop sign on just a sidestreet etc this was fixed in cs1 with mods cargo train stations are broken they will not deliver goods between cargo stations cargo airports or cargo ships and goods that are created locally from industry go no where and commercial starts importing everything individually anyway causing your industry to basically do nothing but create pollution no weather related buildings heat ice rink sowplows etc as they probably want money from a snowfall like dlc from cs1 power water combustion banned zones should have increase power consumption and there are no charging stations for evs only gas stations for fuel green cities dlc you can start a map importing power but not water so if you want to export water from the beginning tile you cannot only for those that play with just 1 tile no water removing services so enjoy those floods when you make a mistake population game breaking bug that i have no idea how it made it out of qa and passed dev zombie homeless just stand on the road taking up processing power although some of them become homeless people that pay taxes and work but don t move into an available house or move out of your city or actually go to work and eventually become zombie robbers that kill your city as mentioned earlier this breaks your game in 1 way or another i still don t understand how it made it out of dev and qa and was released in this state it is incredible how little it seems co paradox cares anymore healthcare no deathcare or childcare probably want money from a sunset harbor like dlc from cs1 the aforementioned zombies still negatively contribute to the overall health of the city also killing your city and when they get sick or die healthcare and deathcare cannot pick them up so you get stuck with symbols flashing on your screen on of sick and dead homeless school there are no preschools or daycare as mentioned earlier no law school or dorms probably want money from a campus life like dlc from cs1 more people stuck in building then eligible to be there zombies live in schools and other buildings so even if a certain amount of people are eligible to go to school they can t because every school is completely filled until you have a map that is just elementary schools educated sims still become robbers at an incredible rate and soon you will have a city of well educated homeless robbers who are happy and wealthy good luck getting rid of them no amount of taxes or lack of city services will deter them police well the police are currently broken as they cannot arrest homeless robbers and since there is no way to control patrolling or set up stationary standing locations for police vehicles 3 police cars will drive around chasing 1000 criminals in a town of 500 people causing the crime to kill the city at least my police helicopter flies 10 feet south above my river on it s routine patrol just to turn around and land also fun to watch my 3 police cars drive into a crime scene look at the robber or group of robbers as the ai just stand there and then drive away without making an arrest fire a waste of money being on all the time as they don t help with traffic accidents or house calls for ems or hospital etc can just turn it on when a disaster strikes or a fire starts but other than that it is super expensive to do very little parks no parklife benefits i e parks built on sidewalks etc also no amusement parks zoos aquariums etc because of course they probably want money from a parklife like dlc from cs1 no professional sports stadiums which i believe was actually free from sports venue dlc trees are easier to plant but can no longer clean polluted ground and do very little if anything in stopping noise pollution disaster when an area floods there is no way to remove the water without destroying buildings and using landscaping tools to push the water back cars will just drive through it zoneable buildings will build underwater staying in a permanent destroyed state and other buildings will just stop working unless you notice the water surrounding it only tornadoes and forest fires every 10 minutes or so without fail and no disaster routes or control of the shelters that are available probably because they want money from a natural disasters like dlc from cs1 zones no real district control as there are laughable amount of polices that do very little imo no historical buildings no way to save a building model you like to preserve it no hotels motel gas station manual control even though it is purposely built into the economy 2 0 again things that were basic in the after dark leisure and tourist spec etc hotels retreats and green cities dlcs no industry zones which means no control of what companies move in even though this is a big deal in economy 2 0 no way in vanilla to even see company info no standalone warehouses or industry company specific warehouse control to pick from again because industries dlc made this available in cs1 another paid dlc zoning too much will create broken empty buildings common in industry creating warehouse ui models but no company will ever move in or houses that remain empty even though homeless people are looking to move into a house or college kids moving out of their parent s house live in a park or become a zombie instead of moving into one of these buildings or you will get 5 of the same company in a row or 5 gas stations albeit different companies in a row or very close to each other
