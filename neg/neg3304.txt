2016 this game is only partly finished although there is a lot of potential if paradox patch it and improve it with dlc s in time 1 ai is very bad worst than in previous hoi games most of the time the german ai goes to war with poland and the low countries at same time and can t hande offensives on two fronts and as a result fails to conquer poland and france so the war in europe becomes a stalemate most games japan ai does not launch amphibious invasions of phillipines dutch east indies or any pacific islands and thats even after conquering both china and india usa ai is totally inactive in the pacific british ai constantly launches small futile invasions of germany and italy while leaving north africa undefended 2 the game forces you to give armies to ai command as manually you are only able to give basic orders the ai command is not very efficient and often dumb air force generals do not exist other than that i still like the game and will try again in a few months and hope it would be improved and fun and if so will happily write a positive review
