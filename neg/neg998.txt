2016 there was a guy who frequently bought cheeseburgers at mcdonalds one day he read a mcdonalds ad in the newspaper for a new cheeseburger this new cheeseburger was advertised to have a bigger juicer and tastier beef patty than the old cheeseburgers now after seeing the advert he goes to mcdonalds and pays full price for the burger which cost more than the old cheeseburger when he unwrapped the wrapper for his cheeseburger he was greeted by a smaller beef patty that just tasted like the old one four hamburger buns and there were twice the pickles than in the old one the main focus of the fallout franchise was about the freedom of choice how choices you make impacted the world around you and this is what immersed people in the universe of fallout everywhere in the story and side quests it always forces you to be somewhat moral you can barely be evil in this game the freedom of choosing whether to be evil or good is butchered by the game being more linear rather than non linear the karma system which was one of the main aspects of the previous games is no more already while i don t mind having a voiced protagonist it really restricts the amount of content of all the quests as the voice actor can only record a limited amount of lines during the time is used for developing the game so naturally and unintentionally the main and side quests have become even more linear because of this restriction the gameplay is definitely an improvement over the old games it feels more exiciting to put on a suit of power armor and the fights feel much more engaging however i ve noticed bandits and supermutants throwing grenades at walls only for them to bounce back on themselves the a i is the only thing about combat that bethesda didn t quite get there is a large and noticeable amount of game breaking bugs there are killer abadoned cars that suddenly fly towards you and kill you corpses turning inside out and moving up the damn walls like the excorcist and dogmeat is suddenly phases through the elevator floor plumetting 10 stories down these are just a few bugs you encounter in the entire game bethesda really tried to mimic the features that made alot of the blockbuster games out there succesful yet all they did was create a messy chaotic game with littered with bugs in every corner while the concepts in this game are great they just seem very unpolished and incomplete i just feel that bethesda missed out on taking fallout 4 s hidden potential and turning it into what could ve been a better game fallout 4 was advertised to be a polished rpg game but what i bought was the opposite of what was advertised what disturbs me isnt how fallout 4 lacked content but how everyone is just willing to shell out money for incomplete games nowadays there s barely anything in this mindless wasteland
