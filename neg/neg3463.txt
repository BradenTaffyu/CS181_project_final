2023 absolutely horrendous performance rtx4070ti i7 13700k and 32gb of ram and without touching any settings i am getting 20fps in main menu after changing some settings i am getting 60 70fps in an empty city any additional changes which bump the fps to 90 make the game looks very bad eg blurred commercial buiding logos when zooming out the game can freeze for a moment the gpu usage is constant 97 rtx4070ti even with those 70fps i have a feeling that after the city grows larger the game will be unplayable because of lags update 1k population 40 50 fps it is a shame that it was released now because the performance makes the game unplayable and the game itself looks very good a lot of good changes compared to cs1 avoid the game until the performance is improved it is a great game that is not working
