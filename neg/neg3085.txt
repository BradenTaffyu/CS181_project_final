2022 rimworld is a game i wanted to love but it just isn t fun you are not leading a group of rag tag survivors through brutal winters existential threats or interpersonal drama instead you are there to troubleshoot the terrible ai and micromanage every action the game has been built over a long period of time and you can tell systems are tacked on to one another menu options are scattered nonsensically through the games 12 important menus excluding the many expansion menus that were added the game has a ton of complexity creep and almost no quality of life updates the expansions do nothing to address these core faults troubleshoot micromanage defend from disaster die it s a tedious system to manage overall most of these problems can be fixed with mods but the developer is over reliant on mods to make the game playable after 342 hours of learning the ins and outs it s time to put it down for good maybe rimworld ii will fix all the annoyingly frustrating parts of the game but this version of rimworld is only for those hardcore min maxers or creative players who turn off down all of the threats
