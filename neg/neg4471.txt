2017 oh how the mighty have fallen what was once the premeir franchise of 4x excellence has been reduced to this shell of a game you ll find all of the features of civ5 with next to no new mechanics save districts now your city can expand to several other tiles but not in an organic way like endless legend and a new civics system arguably the only new mechanic that has improved gameplay first and foremost the main problem is the abismal ai every facet of their ability is lacking and it makes your decistion making process irrelevant they will settle on top of you in areas that lack resources for no reason they will go to war with you across the map and not send any units they will build both settlers and armies much faster than you canthey will denouce you if you are winning despite being an allythey will go to war with you constantly regardless of military strength win or losethey don t behave like they are actually trying to winthe difficulty that has been built into the game is artificial the game isn t difficult you need to do several things to counter the imcompetance of the ai and then you will win it s just not fun to play it s less of a strategy game where you build and manage a civilization and more of a puzzel game where once you figure out a few perplexing behaviors every match is easy if you are planning on buying this to play with friends then maybe this game could be worth it but there are several other 4k strategy games out there that offer much more for lessdon t even get me started on the dlc which doesn t add any value whatsoever scenarios want to play a game of civ where all the fun parts of empire building have been done for you and you only need to click through unit cycles check new civs want to pay for single new civs to play with when you could just download vastly superior and more thought out civs from the workshop check other new features no just no they didn t even bother trying to add anything the dlc is literally just a few new over priced civs please avoid this it s too late for me but you can have your money and your time speak for you don t support a company that took one of the great gaming flagships and ran it into the ground pass on this travesty
