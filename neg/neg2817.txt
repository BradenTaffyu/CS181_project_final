2018 you might wonder why someone with 500 h on this game would leave a bad review well as is the latest patch changed the core of the game itself this is not the game i preorder and not the one i played for 500h i could pass on the fact that stellaris is not optimized on late game 20fps with beefy computer i can pass on the fact that as usual for a paradox title it s a mess for years until it s fixed even on the dlc policy but not when the game is dumbed down and changed entirely so what was stellaris and what it is now well stellaris wanted to be a different game than all other x4 which is why i bought it over endless space 2 with random factions ftl type lane based like endless space sins warp like distant universe and wormhole like stargate 3weapon type railgun missile laser each faction was bound to be unique with a wide variety of ways to fight but with the last patch they removed the ftl and the weapon randomness now everyone has the lane flt and all the weapon essentially turning stellaris into a generic 4x and now it get worse tons of mechanics where basically taken from europa universalis 4 a ground based game and put into the game turning stellaris from an original space 4x into a dumbed down mod for eu4 with a fancy galaxy picture on the back you might wonder is the game fun i mean that s the most important right well no this is so hilarous you wonder how it make it up all the way to to the patch a galaxy can have up to 1000system to win you need 60 of the habitable planets of said galaxy while thats not 600stars that s still a lot to claim a system other than war you need to build a space station imagine doing it on dozen if not hundred of system on top of this absurdity we have a game that is slow not good and slow more like watching grass grow will you accumulate enough resources to build a space station to claim yet another meh system i played about an hour and didn t accomplish anything of note it was not fun not even a bit conclusion if you want a classic 4x look to endless space 2 and others they started like that and where developed in that way and they do better what stellaris is trying to do now stellaris was something else and is a complete mess
