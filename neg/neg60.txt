2017 early access review pz shines in many ways for a zombie survival game however i would not recommend it for anyting more than 5 10 dollars for its early access state there are a combination of features that makes pz somewhat unique compared to other survival games for example 1 nutrition system what you eat actually affects you 2 moodlets with its accompanied effects well thought out moodlets that makes your character feels alive and with a personality eg panicked sick etc even fallout 4 survival mode does not have these character moodlets xd 3 balanced character traits the game forces you to choose negative traits to balance out your positive traits this somewhat creates a bond between the player and the in game character and one of the factors that makes this game a gem 4 permanent death in my opinion no game is truly survival unless its perma death the 4 points above are what attracted me most about this game compared to other zombie games however with all that being said do consider the negatives below before purchasing the game at full price 1 the great long wait the game s development feels progressive with the minor updates but it s horrifyingly slow for major updates waiting for years for a major update is ridiculous sure the devs are working hard and committed to the cause but in the end of the day the devs fail to deliver in a timely manner even the community sees the word npcs as a bad word 2 currently lacks of open world dynamism pz is set in a somewhat open world game but it s a stale environment you will not encounter a random survivor looking for trade extortion you will not see animals roaming into the vicinity in search of food you will not encounter any sort of quest to investigate into the lore of pz there is not much zombie variation making zombie encounters somewhat lackluster after a while the list goes on in my opinion this is the biggest downside of the game compared to your character s dynamism with the chaning moodlet and stuff the environment in the game is dull 3 graphics are really outdated the focus of the devs are never on the graphics and the same is true for most in the community while this may be an advantage for the development process most from the younger generation may not be appealed to this game which is a waste however i belive the devs recognize this and the game went through a graphic overhaul and now the animation update is in progress albeit slow as well 4 difficulty in adjusting for the right difficulty mode usually a game lets you choose a difficulty that would be fun and balanced for yourself perhaps through time and experience you will be able to conquer the harder difficulties this game however does poorly at it previously i thought survival mode was the go to difficulty for a balanced experience however after an update survival mode became too tough for me due to the crazy spawn rate i tried an easier difficulty but it was boring now people just tell you to adjust the sliders until you find the right one for yourself since its sandbox or they d simply tell you that this game is the story of how you died lol you weren t meant to surive in the first place in that sense you either succumb to boredom and die or you simply die to frustration tldrpz is certainly one of memorable survival games in my steam library however if you insist you should only buy the early access sate at discount or wait till full access i bought this game at full price to give my support for the genre but i feel that what i get more value for what i paid for fallout 4 played survival mode on xbox one than this game despite the price difference i will revisit my review once the game is at full release with every passing moment the expectation of what was promised to the community increases i highly doubt that the great long wait is worth whatever the full relase may be we should be thankful that the devs comprise of a humble team of nice people with great ideas for the genre however the sad truth prevails that the community is bought into these promises for years and perhaps also years to come
