early access review dear wildcard studio as a gamer with nearly two decades of experience and thousands of hours spent playing ark survival evolved i was thrilled to have a new reason to immerse myself in a world filled with dinosaurs however after experiencing significant performance issues and frequent game crashes in your first game i was initially pleased to read your statement we did everything from scratch this led me to believe that you had learned from past mistakes and would deliver a game akin to ark survival evolved but with improved graphics consequently i purchased your new game and have dedicated over 430 hours to it since december now i feel prepared to offer my review let s start with a conclusion and then i ll explain my reasoning wildcard you have been a pain in the ass firstly if you truly started from scratch why did you repeat the same bugs and glitches already fixed in ark survival evolved issues like dinosaurs getting stuck in structures or baby dinosaurs starving if not rendered are still prevalent to me this seems akin to a scam it s like selling a brand new car that has already clocked 300 000 km but the situation is even worse considering the state of your server application with merely 16 players connected we experience pings between 500 700ms server crashes and unhelpful error logs it baffles me how a backend programmer could fail to write informative crash logs how can problems be fixed without logs detailing the issues jeremy stieglitz himself said the servers are ass they run like ass and their stability is ass it s clear that the problem lies with your server application not the servers themselves we use a root server with ample ram and a capable cpu yet we face the same issues as every nitrado server this reminds me of a situation a decade ago when faced with high end pcs barely reaching 30fps your response was well buy a better computer it seems easier for you to blame others for problems stemming from subpar game development your development team appears to be at such a basic level that they could easily be replaced by students and not necessarily those studying programming anyone with basic google skills could potentially do a better job thus i feel like i paid 50 to work as an alpha tester for a game that was ostensibly released six years ago to be absolutely clear your approach is deeply disappointing in an industry often accused of neglecting its customers in pursuit of profit you have managed to stand out as one of the worst offenders
