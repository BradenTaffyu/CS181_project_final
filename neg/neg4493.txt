2019 have not played in a year figured i would give this a go its gotten worse filled with gretta sjw npc s that vomit about how i m destroying the ocean and environment while in the stone age how dare i right or better yet in the start the characters are always talking about their struggles also so much for historical accuracy lol canada having rcmp as combat units played a domination victory game only to lose all of my captured cities do to this loyalty mechanic which renders domination games a pointless waste of time if you enjoy civilization games please save your money and sanity don t get this game stick with civ 5 or later this dumpster fire does not deserve to be called a civ game edit 2 july 24th 2020 to hope they would punt the sjw marxist s from development and make an attempt to repair the franchise is foolish after the recent dlc there is no comming back from this one fellow long time fans of the game for the creators reading this there is a difference between being inclusive in a diverse game and pushing an intolerant marxist agenda to appease the people that don t play your games
