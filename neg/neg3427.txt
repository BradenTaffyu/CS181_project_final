the game has been storied quite heavily recently and im not going to add to the pile of trash by saying the same thing but what i will say is that it is slowly getting better however it still very much feels like a much unfinished even more basic version of its predecessor i cannot in all good conscience recommend this to anyone given the amount of bugs graphical requirements and flaws in economy and pathfinding especially car lane changes the game currently has that said i believe in colossal order and i believe they will get it right in time maybe i will change my mind then
