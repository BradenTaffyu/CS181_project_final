2016 okay this game technical delivers on most of what it promises but the bottom line is that it s waiting for an expansion full of tweaks and and extra content not just dlc faction content to make it really worth sinking a hundred hours into full disclosure my last total war game was medieval ii which was one of my favorite games of all time pros it runs pretty well on my cheap laptop it s always nice when game companies include those of us who play on low settings wonderful fidelity to the warhammer universe warhammer specific additions like lords and monsterous infantry are actually really fun exciting quest battles rpg elements magic items add fun customization and rewardcons extremely simplified campaign gameplay there s simply not much to do when you re running your civilization by turn 50 or so i had maxed out my starting province that meant it was strategically inert for the next 150 turns you couldn t upgrade the roads expand trade networks build improved armories you couldn t adjust taxation rate there s a tax on off button this essentially ditched the campaign gameplay in justification for the battle system the campaign desperately needs more content decisions and control or else a change in campaign design so it doesn t take 250 turns to win extremely quick battles my second campaign i played on very hard mode which disables loading awesome and disables pausing stressful but fun this really makes you realize how short battles are since they aren t padded by excessive micromanagement many are over in five minutes in fact in my largest battle ever three armies of chaos included archeon the king evil guy were pitted against four armies of my undead horde it was twice the size of any battle i had had before it was over in fifteen minutes monotenous battles most battles played out the same regiments would immediatly break ranks upon contact with soldiers meaning battles would devolve into blobs armies tended to immediately engage there are no bridge defenses night battles battlefield objectives crazy set pieces occupiable villages or walls or forts no hiring of mercenaries from other races no sudden third army of beastmen i rarely maneuvered cleverly in my battles and rarely felt punished for it in 70 hours of campaign gameplay all vampire counts i fought only dwarves and chaos warriors excluding quest battles worst of all are sieges which are essentially pitched battles with towers awkward magic the magic was fun but just not quite right one wizard was pretty much as powerful as another regardless whether he was a lord or hero there was rarely reason to take more than one in playing i never felt compelled to cast anything other than the cheapest spells the system just needs tweaks if the cooldown of spells were 60 seconds each then having more spells would be more important and upgrading their cooldown time would be worth it stuff like that poorly paced campaign so the first chaos invasion happens like around turn 70 then they come again thirty turns later then the next thirty turns they completely overshadow fighting against other races they don t even let you interact much with other races before they come worse still even if you somehow manage to eliminate the faction you re faced with the impossible grind of destroying practically everyone else it s boring setbacks are frequent instead i think they should have different victory objectives for each race for vampire counts they should have to complete all quest battles sack the empire capital then fight a final quest battle somewhere far away for a book of nagash the dwarves should have to end the book of grudges and have x amount of gold or something other than eliminate 600 enemy provinces finally the chaos invasion needs to be paced better as an endgame thing lack of choices custimization in the beginning you have to choose between two different lords oestensibly who you pick will determine your play style mages or infantry economy or fighting ability that sort of thing in reality the benefits are negligible as a faction defining feature i e 5 extra campaign movement and worst of all you actually get both lords in the course of gameplay anyway i found myself wishing my vampire army was different based on my lord i wish one lord allowed one high tier unit but eliminated another i wish some skills or research were either or i wish i could choose a vampire bloodline finally when recruiting lords and heros each came with only one trait meloncholy magnamimous etc alas i dream of sharper distinctions so in the final analysis there just isn t enough content and strategy out of the box to justify the time it takes to meaningfully complete the game the campaign map needs more strategy and interesting late game content events battles need more variation including occasionally taking longer than 5 10 minutes the game needs to continue feeling rewarding to play past turn 100 and oddly enough it needs more races beastmen wood elves and a southern tomb kings invasion would make things much better without these i just don t feel i can recommend you sink in the 100 hours it takes to play a couple campaigns required to win all that being said i did have immense fun with parts of it and i really enjoyed the warhammer world if you messed around with warhammer as a kid you ll get a kick out of it but otherwise i d wait to see what dlcs patches big mods and steam sales have come out in a year or two and rather than buy content dlc i d much rather fork over 40 bucks for an expansion that looks for a holistic revision improvement of the game rather than adding piecemeal to it also despite listing over 180 hours spent on this game i ve only spent 70 80 on gameplay the rest is phantom time
