2021 product received for free this games matchmaking is horrible you are constantly put in matches with tanks that are 1 2 tiers higher than you and the result of that is often getting blown up in 1 2 shots extremely unfair and unfun edit in response to the developer my thoughts about the game itself are that it caters to people who dump money into the game i have to strongly recommend to any newcomers to stop playing before you waste to much of your time if you read the first page of this patent that wargaming has for wot you will notice that it blatantly states the battle table may provide an advantage to premium vehicles by limiting the tiers of other vehicles against which a similarly tiered premium vehicle may compete meaning that premium vehicles are specifically placed in matches with lower tier vehicles now we all know the developers don t seem to care about the community and only seem to have a single thought witch is money gain but how you gonna reply to my negative review clearly stating that i think the game is unfair because of its matchmaking and ask me to add thoughts about the game itself like dam my thoughts about the game are that its designed to be unfair to people that don t pay from getting sighted no matter where you go on the map to being shot by people you cant even see 10 times its all unfair i cant tell you how many times ive been behind 2 3 bushes and i fire once and im seen but other people can be behind bushes and fire what seems like 10 shots without moving and still go without being seen penetration is an awful mechanic there is no reason that 1 section of a tank can take 15 20 consecutive ap rounds and not have a single one penetrate its unrealistic and its unfair but we know from reading page one of the patent that wargaming intentionally puts you in unfair matches so they can cater to the people that spent money here is a link to the patent so you can view it yourself page one scroll down to where it says 57 abstract and you can clearly see it for yourself is what i have to offer to new players deciding whether or not to play hope its everything you were looking for developers
