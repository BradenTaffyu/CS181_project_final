2018 this game shipped broken from launch and remains broken i am a major fan of the old rome total war but this rome ii is not worthy of it s legacy the spyware included in the game shows you what they think of the consumer software that tracks the user beyond what any person would consider reasonable and the lack of regard for historical accuracy is nuts now 50 of generals and leaders are women women in games is great but not to sacrifice all historical accuracy i can t believe they wasted the development time on a dead game for the sake of politically motivated historical revisionism and to top it off the tech trees are kaka i won t be coming back until i can mod out the nonsense i don t know if i will be buying a creative assembly game again
