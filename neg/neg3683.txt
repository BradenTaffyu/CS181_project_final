2019 early access review this is how a good game dies in thunderous applause this used to be a great game with huge potential now the un developers keep removing every fun aspect of the game zombies taking fall damage gone underground bases ruined by digging zombies with such changes in direction i strongly discourage from buying it until it s out of early access and even then take a close look if the devs aren t messing with it
