2023 early access review the game has a tedious amount of unnecessary detail with everything you do except when it doesn t in one case i stepped on glass barefoot which involved 5 different actions to apply proper first aid including treating my hands which apparently got injured pulling the glass out of my feet ok cool then weeks later spent 3 days catching and cooking fish for my teammates at a campfire next to a giant lake inexplicably catch fire moving past the campfire toward my tent option to stop drop roll nope option to beat out the flames negative option to i dunno jump into the giant lake 2 feet from me nope you can t enter the water at all first through third degree burns to treat nah i watch my character simply burn up in 3 seconds and turn into a mound of ashes wile e coyote style all my gear gets instantly incinerated including 2 firearms canned food metal tools all the flame resistant firefighter gear i was wearing poof survived all the tiresome minutia this sims win95 zombie edition throws at you for weeks just to die in the most ludicrous and juvenile way imaginable gg gfy
