2022 after 10 years of development the game got less features than warband does and still feels extremely unfinished in areas when i heard they were releasing soon and they spent more time porting for consoles instead of giving players the features we were promised i lost all hope in the devs go buy warband for a fraction of the price of this game you ll have more fun
