2023 this game is like a pretty shell but empty the characters are badly written especially the main character they have no personality and they re very pg13 if it makes sense the story was boring and the ending was a disappointment the side quests and enemies are very repetitive and nothing in this game really stands out to me it just looks pretty as a walking simulator but nothing more than that i miss the old harry potter games especially harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban
