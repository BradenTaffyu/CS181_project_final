2022 you know the drill dark souls 3 single player is great and worth price of admission alone contrary to the memes the game is not that difficult it s true then why the negative review you ask because dark soul 3 s thoroughly lacking net code for online play is extremely dangerous at the time of writing at least two different unpatched remote code execution rce exploits in dark souls 3 duckduckgo com have been found rce exploits allow bad actors to execute arbitrary code on a player s pc remotely rce exploits are the dark souls of cyber security i cannot understate the severity of this and dark souls 3 when connected to online multiplayer leaves your system wide open the first rce exploit found and detailed in april 2021 has persisted for almost a year without any reaction from bandai namco fromsoftware it fell on the community to provide unofficial anti cheat software entitled blue sentinels www nexusmods com to protect dark souls 3 players from malicious actors online the second rce exploit was made public in january 2022 by members of the dark souls community the exploit had already been previously reported to bandai namco fromsoftware in december 2021 www fanbyte com as of today 2022 02 09 online play in fromsoftware s souls games ds ds2 ds3 has been disabled for more than two weeks www theverge com following a public demonstration of this second rce exploit on twitch clips twitch tv ostensibly to mitigate risk and give fromsoftware time to fix the issue before the launch of elden ring 2022 which is assumed to share a considerable part of its net code with the older games the fact that the revelation of the first rce exploit last year did not warrant an immediate and coordinated response from bandai namco fromsoftware is frankly unacceptable adding insult to injury it took a second rce exploit and the resulting financial risk of it torpedoing the launch of their highly anticipated next title to actually spur bandai namco fromsoftware into action needless to say this is extremely irresponsible behaviour by a software firm selling its product to millions of customers the only silver lining is that the temporary take down of online functionality at least mitigates the present security risks a much belated software patch to fix the exploits might be incoming buyers beware
