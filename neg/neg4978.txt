2021 total war three kingdoms is set in the titular period that most of us probably know from dynasty warriors the good probably the most aesthetic game of the franchise everything from menus to cinematics interesting new setting is well presented and sticks to the formular diplomacy has never been better hopefully this system will be carried onward to all new titles the romance option and legendary duels do feel pretty natural on the battlefield the bad feels like a heavy case of style over substance the menues have never been worse this in turn carries over to battles where so much information has been curbed for a cleaner look naval battles have been all but cut out but can be auto resolved knowing the battle calculator it can really suck despite unique faction features the clans all feel so very similar the new recruitment and supply systems slows the early game down immensely bottom line tw three kingdoms is not bad but it is a mediocre entrance in a series with great games if you are really into the setting get it on sale
