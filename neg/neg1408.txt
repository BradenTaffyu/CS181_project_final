frustrated to see one of probably one of my favourite games of all time to be developed at a snails pace with devs who leave it to modders to complete and fix their game any major updates are always a massive disappointment to the community with little being done to address the games actual issues i e diplomacy war crazy and brainless ai boring end to late game a map which can be expanded upon massively but has stayed the same for years etc please please devs give us some proper updates and changes rather than bug fixes and tiny changes to the games mechanics
