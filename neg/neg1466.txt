2020 early access review please note this is a long review it s important to note that when you re looking at the reviews the vast majority of the positive ones are only mentioning the singleplayer this is because no sane person could write a positive review about the state of the multiplayer right now so don t be fooled by the fact that the game is rated as very positive i will go into why the multiplayer is terrible in almost every way later on but the fact that an na tdm server on warband a game that is a decade old had more players than both official na tdm servers for bannerlord a game that is just 2 months old and that there seems to be just a generally higher number of warband mp players than bannerlord mp players right now should speak volumes if you only care about the singleplayer and that is all you plan to play i would say to go ahead and buy it it s beautiful it runs well for me and there are already a wide array of mods to enhance your experience but it sure as hell isn t worth 50 on it s own however i am a multiplayer guy all but around 100 of my 1 700 hours in warband were in multiplayer as it stands the multiplayer in bannerlord is a disgrace all you have to do is go on the multiplayer section of the taleworlds forum and read for yourself how the community feels with bannerlord taleworlds tried to experiment with something new the class system while i welcome them trying new things to improve the game i even think the class system could work if they changed some things it quickly became clear that this system as it is severely restricted the gameplay this was an issue that was brought up during the beta yet taleworlds seemed to ignore it and even now as the complaints grow on the forums taleworlds continues to ignore it combine the class system with the fact that there are only 3 actual modes skirmish tdm and siege and you re lucky if you even get into a half populated siege server with only 3 maps for skirmish and 2 for tdm and you have a game that quickly becomes incredibly stale repetitive and boring perhaps the biggest reason for this is that the community is unable to host their own private servers so we are stuck with the extremely limited selection of official servers and modes that taleworlds has provided they said that they would release the server files before the end of ea but then again they also said that bannerlord would have a refined combat system when it s actually a joke compared to warband so who knows the combat is a whole other topic that i could cover but this review is long enough as it is i encourage you to read the countless combat complaints on the forum i think the state of mp is best summarized by this statement i found on the forum i assumed that they would have honed their successful formula into something even greater and truly special worthy of being a successor to the games that made the franchise great instead what we got was a complete disgrace to the name mount blade inferior even to other gaming companies who saw mount blade and created their own games out of that inspiration it s a failure of understanding at a fundamental level between the game s designers and it s community so as everything is if you want to play the multiplayer i cannot recommend buying this game in its current state and surely not for 50
