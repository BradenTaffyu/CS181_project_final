2018 before i bought this all my friends were telling me no don t do it it s a good game but it s not a good fallout game that sounds stupid what does that even mean i ve seen gameplay and let s plays and i can t see anything wrong with it i liked fallout 3 but it was too dark for me visually the settlement builder looks pretty cool too i d like to build a fortress and have a place to come home to and the death animations are cool they took fallout 3 added highlights from skyrim and gave it shooter controls so you don t need to buy time until vats recharges and with a voiced protagonist unkillable companions and a new story i was sure this would be a hit but they did something wrong they delivered i got a huge open world with some amazing visuals i had a great fighting style my dog wouldn t die and i felt like a powerhouse i built a settlement with the materials i had and kept it safe i got mods to make my life easier and my arsenal bigger i killed a deathclaw with a minigun and watched as another one ripped me apart an hour later it was exactly what they promised it wasn t fun i don t know why the whole adventure just didn t seem exciting maybe i was just getting bored of the genre i booted up the 360 and went for some fallout 3 but it was fun i wandered around the wastes picking off raiders with my trusty 10mm i went for skyrim same thing despite my thousands of hours i still enjoyed myself so why couldn t i do that in fallout 4 i know you re expecting me to conclude with an answer i can t pin down the exact problem but i ll give you my best guess i have 2 guesses 1 the story is pathetic i ll be the first to admit i haven t reached the end of it but it doesn t have that feeling your son shaun gets kidnapped your wife husband gets shot and kellog s frosted flakes is set up as your antagonist cool your character is understandably distaught you however don t feel a thing there s no reason to care you barely know these people so your character is out on this revenge quest to kill a man but you re here to explore i ll be honest i couldn t remember the names of anybody because i couldn t care less about them sometimes i d be launching mini nukes at super mutants and then remember hey i m supposed to be looking for someone i wasn t mad at kellog they killed off the people i was supposed to care about long before i could develop any feelings for them there s no reason why i the player should be following this storyline for any reason other than to unlock more quests and get exp 2 powerpicture this i am a regular human being who has just woken up i get out of bed make breakfast and go outside then i see something glinting in the bushes it s a minigun i shout heaving it up without any issues at all i fire it at my neighbour who is watering his plants across the street i peg him in the head with thirty well placed shots i warned you gerald that s what happens when you don t clean up after your dog i don t know about you but something seems off here can you see it exactly i shouldn t be a god with a minigun just after picking it up and why is this minigun in such an easy to reach place you d think the owner wouldn t want someone just walking up and grabbing it i m impressed you ve read this far so i ll keep it simple the character is perfectly competent in everything sure he might have had military experience but there comes a point where i just wish i had to work for it you know when you get a set of power armour and a minigun ten minutes into the game ten if you had any thoughts about being a survivor of a catastrophy who needs to get by in this post apocalyptic world get ready to throw that away you are iron man you are the terminator you aren t some lowly wastelander you re a power fantasy isn t the appeal of fallout s world based on how harsh the land is and don t get me started on how that translates thematically tldr the unfitting and poorly started plot mixed with a ton of handouts does not make a good fallout game this is coming from a guy who couldn t be bothered to finish the story so take it with a grain of salt the mechanics are nice the asthetics are alright and it sure as all hell isn t no man s sky but it doesn t work
