infuriating to the extreme as a new player 1 build a deck 2 win a few games 3 then get matched against decks that counter yours 4 or decks that don t counter yours but you ll draw no lands 5 or decks that don t counter yours but you ll draw only lands 6 every now and again win a game but your opponent just makes you wait 2 minutes until they timeout 7 get sick of the situation and look to build another deck 8 you don t have the required cards for the deck that looks interesting 9 spend an unholy amount of money on packs10 goto 1it s too late for me now i m addicted to the frustration and pain save yourselves
