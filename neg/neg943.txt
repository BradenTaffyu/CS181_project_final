2017 released over a year ago and it s still littered with bugs no pun intended game crashes once in a while out of 10 hours playing i ve had it crash it 3 times invisible monsters npc s that walk into walls and objects subtitles sometimes isn t synced with the npc talking the music cutting dialog audio not so great animations the story seems very rushed too the plus side i like the world and its locations the environment changes radioactive fog night day rain from time to time is great to sir up the gameplay but look for another game to spend your money on
