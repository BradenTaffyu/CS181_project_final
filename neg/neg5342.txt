2023 mixed feelings due to insane predatory monetization they ve removed the t from tcg the cards have no value and the crafting system wildcards is a joke you get very few rares and mythics if you enjoy brewing and play jank you ll have to spend big or be a god at drafting to grow a collection for cheap every system within this game was built to give you as little as possible to incentivize you to open up the shop and spend more money they ve even nerfed rewards from drafts and other events that you could grind i cannot emphasize enough how greedy wotc is this will also reflect on the gameplay every 2 out of 3 games you will be playing against an aggressive red deck that tries to end the game in 3 4 turns this is due to the fact that these decks are some of the cheapest to make and are always meta relevant which is why many people choose to play them for a game that prides itself on its massive library having to play against the same meta decks can be exhausting this is more of a rant than anything tho alchemy and digital only cards in general also seem strange and are not very popular among the community but wotc keeps pushing it down our throats
