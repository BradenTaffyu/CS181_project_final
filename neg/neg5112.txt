2017 sorry ca or and sega no thumbs up for you here yo make decent games but since shogun 2 your dlc policy of selling cut content makes me really upset and the situation with splitting this game in two and selling parts separatly both with units and factions dlcs no way i ve been playing your games since the very first shogun and i take it really personally how you see me not as a client and gamer but as a cow you are milking for money
