2017 loved the first one to bits was so hyped for the sequel didn t get into the early access as i didn t want to spoil the pleasure but bought the game soon after the official release played it with my gf via split screen coop the experience can be summed up with one word a chore pros the narrator is awesome the voice acting is decent some characters are excellent some dialogues are smart and funny mostly pet pal related stuff it s got dwarves in it the co op component is implemented in a very intuitive user friendly way the music is better than in the first game it s got dwarves in it other games take example character progression and itemization are ok the game comes packed with various roleplaying options and features the storyline is quite open there is no good guys vs bad guys it s not clear whether we as a party should be doing the things that we re doing it s all grey area sacrifice for the greater good sort of story but it s always up to the player to draw the line the journal is a nice touch way better than your usual quest tracker unfortunately navigating it with a controller is a chore the game master mode is pure gold cons the main story is terrible seriously the first one wasn t that strong either but at least it didn t treat itself overly seriously the sequel is cheesy and plain stupid but it s oh so serious about the plot it feels like a third grade fan fiction or a tabletop rp game run by a weak but overly ambitious 14yo gm the origin stories are weak the characters in general are weak and not interesting couldn t care less the pace of the game is uneven often times you will find yourself wondering what s next where should i go or why am i here in the first place unfortunately the game is designed in such a way that even 1 level makes all the difference in the world so if you wonder off the road or arrive in a certain place too early you will run into some tough unfair fights this was similar in the first game but in the first game you could handle some tougher enemies by being creative and careful here s not the case due to terrible encounter design shallow tactics and linear flow of combat more below the combat the highlight of the title the thing that kept me playing through the first game is utterly boring the encounter design is terrible i loved the fights in the first one the planning the strategies the enemies here 99 encounters feel like trash fights all are virtually the same every enemy can fly cast spells teleport shoot heal etc usually your party gets ambushed with enemies popping out of the thin air there s no preparation no scouting no positioning cc spell combos buffs debuffs positioning etc all are next to useless raw physical damage is the way to go most of the time boring some encounters are just plain stupid do not confuse stupid with difficult the first game had some very difficult yet enjoyable and rewarding fights here it s just not fun the enemies cheat all the time the game can instakill you on random the fights are long and tedious sometimes there s a key component to a fight and if you don t know it you are bound to lose you either fight a long unfair mostly boring battle you are very likely to lose or you can easily cheese the crap out of most encounters lame design the bloody necrofire seriously it s ugly it s overused it s annoying it s hard to see or select anything yet it s up 80 fights the game is riddled with bugs nothing major so far mainly ui and controller related stuff but the little buggers take out another chip of enjoyment from this game it s been in development for so long it s unacceptable the ui for the gamepad is cumbersome way too big cannot be scaled down loading screens are waaaaaay to long the first game was lighthearted and fun the combat system was excellent the encounters were very well designed and interesting the sequel is a bloated mess the story is overly serious yet very silly and childish the combat system offers less variety feels slower and unbalanced the combat encounters feel uninspired repetitive and boring beware of bugs been waiting for this game a long time but i sincerely regret spending money on it it s big it looks good all the components look good on paper but it s just not fun to play going through the main story is a chore reading the dialogue is a chore fighting your way through boring fights is a chore exploring the world is a chore there is a good game somewhere underneath i guess some people will like it as it is i didn t verdict a chore 4 10the only good additions are the narrator the dwarves and the gm mode
