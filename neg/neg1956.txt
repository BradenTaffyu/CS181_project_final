2017 well i ve had a nice run but i just can t recommend this game anymore gaijin has a very bad tendency to allow the players to run the game instead of focusing on making the best game they can one can only stomach so many tech tree battle rating and economic changes at once i deleted my account and good riddance every single major update changes the balance of the game and you are forced to re learn an entirely new matchmaking dynamic every time the price of new vehicles has changed at least a dozen times both in the amount of silver required to purchase them as well as the research points needed to unlock them add to that the slow drain of reward you receive for playing matches itself and the game simply becomes a never ending grind fest evidenced by the number of players who enter matches specifically to strafe ground units die then play again that s called points farming and is a regular feature of every match you play the player must farm points otherwise the rewards you receive don t justify the time invested in playing add to that the very repetitive nature of the game itself with some days leading you to play the exact same map dozens of times including playing the same map multiple times in a row and you ve gotten a recipe for mindless grind endless tedium and keyboard snapping frustration of course one can skip all of that frustration by simply allowing gaijin to vacuum money out of your wallet but even the pay for play economy is far too small for the amount of cash you put into the game if you want to enjoy this game to it s maximum potential you d better have a full time job and put all your spare cash into only this game don t even get me started on the entitled c nts who make up the majority of the community for this game either the words uncooperative uncommunicative simple minded and moronic apply in equal measure if you don t bow down and worship this game you re good for nothing but abuse as evidenced in the comments below to be clear i ve been playing this game for over three years i have over 400 hours in my record i have given gaijin over 100 of my hard earned cash i have progressed up every single nation s tech tree to some extent unlocking and purchasing over 100 vehicles and finally i am sick and tired of this game period
