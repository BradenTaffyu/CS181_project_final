2020 early access review this review is about the singleplayer portion of the game i ve very little interest in the multiplayertldr wait and watch the development don t get it now unless it s heavily discounted and you trust the developers with your life edit to tldr there s a huge lack of content from what i ve noticed and that s coming from someone who s never played a m b game main quest line is insanely tiresome and random kingdoms are pointless to make as they re not finished and by the time you get to the point of making one the entire map is filled with 2 powerful factions you could never hope to compete with tone down the snowballing please is what i m saying the horrible memory leaks horrible game breaking bugs all of it i d be able to stand if there was a lot of content there simply isn t after 3 corrupted save files and 20 hours dedicated to one campaign i ve seen all the content edit 1 apr 04 2020 the devs have been consistently releasing daily patches fixing bugs and improving the game s performance although it seems with each patch i discover a new bug in the game today for example i can no longer see red and green numbers when comparing two like items sword and sword shield and shield etc like i used to making it much more tedious to compare items i ll give it to them they re improving the game keep doing so and this review will flip to positive edit 2 apr 04 2020 struck out my initial thoughts on battles and made notes about their lack of challenge vs ai completely rewrote my thoughts on battles i m going to give the developers some criticism here so they can actually improve their game and not suck their and fanboy the game with a positive review that says nothing about the game other than a meme this was my first mount blade game i was recommended this by a friend prior to its release and looked like my kind of game what a disappointment strikehowever i ll continue playing it to see if i m missing something much later in the game strike though if i have to play for 35 hours to get to the good part that s not a good move that s something assassin s creed odyssey did and what a terrible game that was it s in early access give it a break it s a 50 early access game 50 that s a fair bit of money for a game i ve played a lot of early access games and those games were somewhat functional and had most of the features implented if they didn t they were from extremely small indie teams not a team with successful titles under their belt this game was obviously not tested there is no way the developers would ve missed half of their quests being broken had they tested the game the ai suddenly deciding to just stop mid battle and have a nice chat with the player the ai getting stuck on rooftops in a gang fight and over the quest that s also not including multiple ctds and freezes for no apparent reason so no i won t give a game with 8 years of development a break one of the things i ve learned while in college for my computer programming degree was to always test your product before showing it to others which the dev team obviously neglected to do besides the mountainous list of bugs that i won t list the game has many other disappointments firstly the villages and cities are lifeless why give the option to walk around them when you can t do anything in the copy and pasted cities and towns you can t go into houses you can t steal items you can t have any meaningful conversations with npcs you can t visit shops except a few in some cities there isn t any activities to do other than go to the arena and play boardgames which all but 2 of which are broken and are unable to be played why bother with the option to walk around town kingdom come delieverence is an indie studio and they had tons of life in their villages with unique quests great voice acting and unique dialogue depending on in game events and an immersive atmosphere for their villages why not here there s no reason to walk around you click the npc with an exclamation point click talk and get a generic quest that you have to pray doesn t break i get that kingdom come delieverence isn t nearly as complex as this game is but come on a few more villagers some nice atmospheric background noise maybe some people talking about the poltics and the happenings of the realm and bam you ve got a much better city village there s next to no tactics to be had on battlefields if it doesn t spawn you 20m in front of the enemy giving you exactly 7 seconds to react and form a plan you can probably think of some neat stuff you could do sadly in the end it is all for naught as the ai is simply too easy to beat even when they outnumber you 2 1 once you ve gotten more than 10 hours in the game just it f1 and f3 charges all units and you re good or hit f6 puts all units under ai control for essentially the same thing this is disappointing for someone who likes strategy games like total war and while not as related europa universalis the loading screens good god i have an m 2 drive but there s still a 5 25 second loading screen for everything go to town load talk to someone and end the conversation load sometimes talk to a caravan on the map load ask them a question kicks you out of the conversation creating another loading screen so you re forced to click on them again to endure another loading screen to exhaust the rest of the dialogue not that there s anything useful you can talk about to any npcs loading screen loading screen loading screen thank whatever god s you believe in for the fast dialogue mod to skip these damn loading screens i ll stop here before this gets too long there s some elements of this game i really enjoy if the developers fix their game and add more to the severe lack of content it s definitely something i d put hundreds of hours into just not right now in the future i may flip it to positive assuming contents is added and bugs are fixed which i am very optimistic about
