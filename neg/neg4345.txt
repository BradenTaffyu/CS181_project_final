2020 it s a much prettier game to look at then civ 5 it is from a graphical point of view amazing however the game becomes dull and boring really quickly the first 100 turns in any campaign are really fun and exciting however once you start getting deeper in building any sort of momentum with the game is really challenging because every other turn you have to make small micro decisions that actually don t change that much and take quite a bit of mental energy to sort through to find what you want need plus in the context of civ it might be better to say that these are super micro decisions micro for districts micro for world council micro for policies and policy cards in theory it sounds and seems great the first couple of matches you play you deal with it micro ing away as best as you can and micro ing to that level does sometimes give a pretty satisfying feeling like itching a really itchy spot but then you re on you re 10th match and you kinda start realizing that policy cards pop up way too much don t actually change all that much and interrupt the flow of the match just want to battle it out with ghandi aw shucks but i gotta slot in those policy cards every two turns hmm better spend 15 mins planning my districts out to get max bonuses even if in the end they don t matter that much okay now i can dook it out with ya mr ghandi i guess that s the problem micro ing in the early game should be insanely powerful and useful and would make early game a lot more diverse but instead you just use the same policies because other policies don t match up i don t see how anyone doesn t start off with the 5dmg vs barbarians and 1 faith and gold for the palace every match right off the bat the other cards are just sort of useless and then by the mid game you ve got a lot more on the go and micro ing just becomes an annoying pain in the ass and makes it hard to enjoy the game no i don t want a pop up screen every 5 turns and then late game eugh policy cards world emergencies climate emergencies requests for aid regular world council planning districts recovering artifacts needing to manage builders because they disappear after 3 uses see where this is going to me civ 5 is much better gameplay and fun wise even though the graphics are horribly out dated it is just much more satisfying to play civ 6 introduces a ton of new mechanics some are good some are not as good try it out for yourself you might enjoy the micro aspects a lot more than i do but nobody is going to convince me that this game is better than civ 5 edit too complex for a small brained alpaca someone donate me a bigger brain so i can enjoy pls
