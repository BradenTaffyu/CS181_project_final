2021 let me make a quick note while i have put a do not recommend it s more for the sake of the devs need to see that there are issues and not we re getting good reviews no need to read if there are criticisms written in those reviews firstly yes if i had to weigh the game like a scale it would lean more to a positive however there are striking issues and it s being repeated everywhere so repeat some more the campaign was short but i realized the things i wanted out of the campaign were put into chaos theory and challenge mode kind of an odd choice but so be it the campaign is a joke it should be relabeled to tutorial challenge mode has a nice here s your general mission complete it as you feel there s some small restrictions cool good chaos theory is basically the same but more of a build a park that s themed after x film but has little to do with that actual film eh oh well interesting call backs sandbox mode however is not how i wanted it to be unlimited money all dino dna s at full there s no building involved it s just a slap things down mode i d rather a build from scratch mode where each time you play is up to you on how it ll be different which dino s will you try to go for first how will you as the player make this park unique from all the other s you ve made but with regular restrictions here s the entire catalog of dino s you ve unlocked through the other modes now make your own map park sandbox god mode sandbox means creative i dont want everything already served up at full i want to still work for it like any other park speaking of working micro management is an annoyance that pair of dilophos 001 and 003 keep slapping and spitting at each other another concussion fracture organ damage grab a vet van send him out to find out what the injury is now that he knows what it is even though he can treat it you have to select the vet van again and heal the dino he wont just heal it on his own even though he s the same unit that treats minor injuries and diseases no you have to manually tell him to to it again oh wait this time it s a major injury well take your ranger heli and tell him tranq the little bugger then make a call up to the helicopter delivery team and send the dino to the infirmary for that concussion then allocate one of your limited scientists to remote control some robot arms to spray disinfectant spray on the dino for another 50 seconds oh the dino s healed well we wont take him back to the paddoc ourselves you have to tell us to do it and juuuuust to make it interesting dilopho 001 and 003 didnt settle their score the first time so within seconds of him coming back from the icu they throw down again just to repeat the 5 minute long multi staged completely manual task all over again maybe there should be some sort of hidden cooldown on a dino intentionally getting their ass beat like having it run away from it s aggressor alpha i get this can be avoided by specifically genetically modding a single species of that pack to have the highest dominance and attack score so when they re crowned alpha they dont ever get challenged anymore but it s an obnoxious process just add certain injuries to the tasks a vet van can fix like concussions rather than having to send it all the way to the dino hospital and choke up resources like scientists also have the vet vans automatically tend to a dino they scan if it s something the van has the ability to treat dont let the van drive halfway back to the garage because i was busy trying to build a new enclosure or deal with guests crying over this small 5 long stretch of pathway doesnt have a drink stand i need my chocy milk oh btw park manager there s 3 other species of dinos doing the same fight and repeat thing all throughout the park better spend the next 20 30 minutes manually telling each of those multi stage treatments to heal all of those dinos that just wont learn their lessons of and when those 30 minutes are over start over all over again with the first batch its a never ending cycle of healing for you player that aside there s a new likes system sure its annoying that i cant put stego s with other stego s nor can i put any willy nilly carno in with another carno but if carno s like another type of carno and their comfort is 100 why are they fighting why does every carno like compies but they just eat them like a bite size snack if carno s and majunga s like one another why are they constantly fighting and killing each other no point in intermingling carno s and if that s the case why even have herbo s like dislike specific species if the system just has them fight even when comfort is at 100 its also the same for attacking the tour vehicles and ranger jeeps but that s another whole other question there s a lot of dumb little annoyances that were clearly programmed in by someone otherwise they wouldnt be there however if you can look past those annoyances it s a great game and yes it expanded upon the previous game but it still feels like it s missing things for a zoo simulator yes more decorations for the park but why not some actual areas think building like amenities that are essentially fluff decoration for guests to have interactions and animations with that arent your typical shop ride viewing building a seating area that adds some kind of accommodation rating like the hotels instead of some tiny little decorations that you sprinkle around the pathways that dont serve a function or purpose and are just decorations in name i ve tried to build luxury paths with the planters and table benches but they just seem worthless with how the paths system builds in operation genesis there was a hot air balloon ride made little sense but it was another ride that guests could use and it was more diversity in buildings thoughts for dlc i guess if we spent less time micro managing dino fights and other interactions that should have automation or if refuel repair orders notifications popped up on the side with a convenient button to address and solve the issue so you dont have to derail whatever action you as the player enjoying yourself were currently taking that would make things feel a bit better and less of a development oversight out of 10 i give it an 8 10 good visuals great ambiance its an up to date dinosaur theme park builder micro management issues take one point and lack of a build your own park mode that isnt unlimited money everything unlocked takes another point maybe i ll come back to this post maybe i wont but that s my take
