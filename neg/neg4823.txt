although a game with great potential total warhammer 2 is hamstrung just like its predecessor by predatory business policies that try to re cycle basic game material as heavily overpriced dlcs most of the base game factions have significant portions of their army roster locked behind dlc packs and one can t even completely confederate the race one plays as by chance a great deal of the other legendary lords will only be available through the aforementioned packs this forces a player to buy every dlc in the list to have a complete experience of the game which is honestly a pretty way to wring dollars from your player base not to even go into ca s attitude towards its player base that became even more toxic after the release of tww3 most of their deplorable practices have their origin with these first entries the vortex campaign is fine yet it does not allow for a free sandbox affair you know the basic campaign mode that all total war games prior to this entry had and one is forced to buy tww1 again what does this actually achieve it forces the player to spill extra cash for material he may not like own neither does this practice allow him to explore the map of the vortex which is more detailed and larger than the map given in the mortal empires expansion without the interference of the on rails ritual quests so not only does tww2 only offer the sandbox experience to those who buy the first game but the sandbox mode that this arrangement provides is not even available for the base game s detailed new world section of course all of these problems add on top of a steadily mounting laundry list of gameplay and campaign problems that the total war franchise has been accumulating since at least rome 2 and more realistically since empire total war the which laundry list ca has been continually overlooking in favor of a streamlined but not easier necessarily experience
