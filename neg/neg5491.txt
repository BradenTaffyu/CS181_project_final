2018 yes this game is great yes i really like it and yes i played it a lot and will play it but it s not the game that made me not buying another total war after this one again but the begining of the dlc policy with tw rome ii and every following total war game this is a joke first of all yes these dlcs are way to expansive i was already mad about napoleon and these units dlc but okay simply don t buy them and now how many dlcs are there like one or two of them are okay even if a bit too expansive but they are actually okay but buying a lot of factions to being able to play them in the campaign really buying units again which could have been in the core game really how did this in rome total war worked was this game actually a minus business with only 2 dlcs i don t take this change this dear total war team and creative assembly and i may think about buying a good game again until that i say no maybe if the games are on sale with all dlcs around 20 i may buy them
