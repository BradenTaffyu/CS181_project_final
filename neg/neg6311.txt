2023 hogwarts has never been more beautiful than this the graphics the music the ambience is near perfect however this is where the praise ends because this golden palace is filled to the brim with sh t the major problem there is no immersion you are a perfect mary sue without any backstory everyone loves you there is no friction at all there are no consequences there are no friendships or romances there is simply nothing that defines you and your journey through hogwarts other than the fact that you are perfect and chosen all other characters bar sebastian are lifeless and dull interchangable really almost every corner reeks of cut content the mechanics for quidditch are there but it wasnt finished sebastian clearly is supposed to be a romance the other three companions however werent finished at all most noticably in poppy and amit instead minigames and riddles are thrown at you at any moment to breath some life into this but unfortunately it only breaks the immersion more again you are the only one to solve these riddles because you are perfect the other big issues to this day i am having severe graphical issues the first 2 weeks this game was almost not playable due to poor performance now the performance is alright but textures dont load or load extremely slowly even on medium settings the combat is fun for like an hour or so then it gets tedious extremely quickly because there are only like 5 enemy types or so i dont even wanna go into detail when it comes to the overall storyarc its so bland i just wonder how people like that can call themselves authors and how anyone can greenlight that crap overall this is the biggest disappointment since cyberpunk for me
