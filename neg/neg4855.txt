2020 look i m loving this game but can we discuss the fact that when everything is on sale you re paying 94 86 at time of writing across 2 games to get all the dlc and do keep in mind that is prior to the 71 99 cad for the base game and the 71 99 cad for the original game which means that for me to get the actual full experience from tww2 i would be spending 238 84 cad on a single game i will accede a game and a half without any collectors items i just did a quick google search on things i could buy with 280 here are a few of the results 1 a 55 4k smart tv from tcl2 an mjs bugs 2se drone3 an eddie bauer parka 4 concert tickets5 a refurbished 500gb xbox one any of the above things can be purchased for 280 or less and they were just the first things to show up in my searching frankly i have an issue when i can buy a new tv for the price of a complete gaming experience with just one game even if that tv is objectively cheap even if we take the original and it s dlc out before taxes we re looking at 54 30 cad again the base game is 71 99 it seems a bit excessive to me to have created so much content or cut so much out of the base game that the dlc on sale is 2 3rds of the price of the game not to mention that when its not on sale the dlc for tww2 alone totals in 89 43 cad before taxes literally more than the base game itself there s something not right about that
