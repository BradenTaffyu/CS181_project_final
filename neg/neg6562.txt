2019 honestly i m not a big fan of dark souls iii truth be told i kinda hate it i ll say now that most of this is probably personal bias to me this game feels a lot more artifically harder than it needs to be the lack of any hitstun from just wearing armour can be bloody unbearable sometimes like when some tosser hits you with a knife and your guy staggers as if he just got hit by a bloody bomb while wearing full metal plated armour and yeah there are hyper frames when you swing with great ultra great weapons i know the melee combat is fine obviously it s a souls game simple if you just boil it down to it s basics which would be press circle b when bad man swings press r1 to hit when bad man no swing just like the other games the spell casting is different this time around and i kinda enjoy it it s probably one of the few reasons why i occasionally revisit this game i find a fair amount of enjoyment rolling around a boss and throwing a massive orb of fire in their face or slamming a lightning stake right into the feet whenever i get the moment to the progression isn t too bad i suppose upgrade materials are fed out at a reasonable rate though i dislike how rare infusion gems are you get like what one lightning gem the entire game unless you re willing to farm lothric knights good luck with that though there doesn t seem to be many options early mid game either the game might be a little rough early game if you pick a caster as a starting class and dear lord pyromancer starts off with some awful stats which is fair enough i suppose since they also start off with pyromancy and high faith int the weapon arts are also new kinda every weapon has some kinda gimmick attached to it that you can use when two handing many straight swords have a stance that allows you to break guards if you land the hit or close the distance with a lunge some weapons can buff themselves and some weapons have completely unique weapon arts weaponarts use fp and to restore that you ll mostly be using ashen estus to restore that and you ll have to carefully balance what amount of estus you convert into ashen estus to use both weapon arts and spells which is fair enough i suppose spells can demolish bosses pretty quick so you ll have to give up some healing to kill em with just spells so carrying 20 soul spears and 20 estus exaggeration but still i don t really know what else to say to be honest it s a decent game i guess but i still kinda hate it maybe it s just not what i d expect from a souls game or maybe i m just awful so maybe you ll like it maybe you won t just keep in mind it is difficult at times and in my opinion it feels hard for the sake of being hard rather than challenging and dear god the first dlc is bloody dreadful it s short some of the enemy encounters are just outright unfair and awful dlc2 is eh i didn t like it i suppose it s just more dark souls 3 really though it did have one boss i enjoyed who was gael he s a pretty good fight and i had a lot of fun with that boss
