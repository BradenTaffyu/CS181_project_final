2020 update 8 14 2023 made my own mod because modding this game is simple made the game fun played an entire run as a devouring swarm won bought some dlcs played 2 more games enjoyed it would i recommend the game now no there are still issues with the ai making dumb choices leaving the only real viable means of enjoyment to purely genocidal runs harder difficulties are only difficult due to ais being given bonuses their decision making is absolutely mind boggling after 200 in game years 15 20 hours the galaxy tends to shift towards a few massive federations or you have ais start making large overlord holdings filled with vassals the major gripe is that once they become a vassal they tend to stay a vassal unless you perform a liberation war to free them there is just not enough conflict in the universe and it devolves into a boring stalemate optionally if you are a genocidal faction then you have 60 80 of the entire galaxy descend on you no matter how strong you are you will not be standing up to the doomstack of computer lagging fleets that show up and crush you complicating all this is the sure you do not need the dlc however you really need the dlc practice by paradox for example i had an issue involving a rival megacorp joining my federation because the other members voted them in this prevented me from performing a hostile takeover and claiming their assets if i owned the nemesis dlc i would have been able to perform spy actions to sour their diplomacy with other federation members but i do not own that dlc the vanilla means of gaining favors in order to attempt to sway the other members into kicking this megacorp out took far longer and was more costly however my solution was just 12 50 away until the ai is improved and they change their business practices i still recommend staying away from the game original review below it s not a single aspect that makes me no longer want to recommend stellaris but a compilation of them that lead to it being not fun to play to get it out of the way the base game is a shell for dlc you do not require the dlc to play the game as you can join anyone in multiplayer who has the dlc and it ll just activate that content so you can try it out for free however the base game is lacking a majority of features that the dlcs solve when you start the game there is this great sense of exploration that you will have with your own custom race you are guiding the entirety of your species on either their success or failure this is dotted with plenty of choose your own adventure style decisions which can be very exciting this is good and i absolutely love the exploration phase in the early game the writing of the various discoveries you come across is fun to read and always leaves you wanting to see the next one soon you ll encounter your first other civilization and realize the first garbage mechanic diplomacy it is an absolute chore assuming you get it to work no matter what you do to encourage that other ai faction they easily have as many ways of reducing your relations unlike other 4x games there is nothing you can do to alter this there are no techs to research no buildings that i was able to locate to improve relations even after them recently adding a new envoy you can assign to raise lower relations it s difficult to get an aggressive race to be non aggressive as they can arbitrarily drop an insult every few months and keep negating all you ve done diplomatically this boils down to taking the highest resource stockpile usually food and just throwing it at the ai then there s the research while it s a great idea on paper where it deals random cards from a deck then shuffles the cards it leads to some major issues say you get locked in early in the game and you have planets you could terraform well you can t rush that tech you have to hope you luck into the right combination of cards this can be absolutely devastating in combat if an enemy has the tech advantage you might not be capable of reverse engineering their technology or rushing some other tech fast enough to create a counter to their design because you might only have drawn the research cards for industry enhancements as opposed to the weapons next the resources you have money and building materials energy minerals respectively you have food to feed your population and then consumer goods which are all the basic needs of the population and you must supply these or they revolt then there s alloys for ships which eat up space from your planetary special buildings or you might have to give up on those alloys for consumer goods so you can stop paying such a high price you then have influence which is more or less a static resource that you can t directly affect which controls map wide abilities and your empire s physical space you occupy then there s a variety of rare resources that filter down into specific weapons or upgrades the rare resources require you to have the tech to mine them but even if you research the upgrade for a building you cannot then go to the market and just buy that resource you have to have the research how to mine it yourself couple this with the randomized tech tree and it s just a huge headache not to mention everything has upkeep in either money or resources depending on what it is finally unity which is entirely separate and comes from your population or special buildings you then spend unity on a variety of mini skill trees that offer bonuses for selecting them 4 5 bonuses within the tree and a bonus for completing the tree along with a super ability most people pick the special that makes it so your tech cannot be reverse engineered see issues with research tree above the final nail in the coffin for me is taking that headache from above about resource management and buildings now multiply that by 10 20 50 maybe 100 you have to do this for every single planet when the game first released the idea was you d take all these other planets and throw them into sectors and then the sector governor ais would take care of them for you because you couldn t control that much stuff personally you had to delegate it much like crusader kings 2 you re a ruler and busy so you delegate stuff unfortunately unless you re a big fan of imbeciles managing your stuff you re going to have to manage it directly the ai is absolutely brain dead the automation for sector ai and planet ai doesn t know how to be efficient at building anything on that planet for example i selected a forge world focus on alloys the ai built luxury housing taking up a very needed spot for an alloy foundry to fight a war i had to shut the ai off and take over for it and in the mean time hope i didn t lose the war while i waited for them to bulldoze the homes and build the foundry the micromanagement gets to be insane you could have several hundreds of planets and you have to manage every single one of them because you can t trust the ai to do it with any semblance of reason or rationale applied to what you need or what you told it you need the shoddy ai has been a major complaint levied against the developers since release without going into further details there s also the war exhaustion mechanic to keep you from just rofl stomping through the galaxy makes sense as civilized races however if you want to be a devouring swarm or play as a the borg like race you still have to follow the mechanic there is no way to disable it either i imagine this mechanic exists primarily to stop players from crushing one another too hard in multiplayer but an option to turn it on or off would have been welcomed tl dr micro bad design and buggy ai since launch makes game not fun
