2017 i am an original total war fan i fell in love with the massive battles and the sprinkle of 4x i have always said it needs more 4x not less well we got a whole lot less you can just look at my playtime on this game and other total war titles then you will have about a 4th of the time i have played in them i have had an account stolen and sold another in the past with a computer so my total play time in total war games is in the multiple of thousands of hours this game runs ok not great i have a 6700k and 1070 gtx 16gig 3400 ddr4 ram ssd etc the battles are way more dumbed down than ever before the campaign is super dumbed down with the 4x elements almost all being removed this is a cash grab for sure even before you look at the dlc let s talk about the dlc real quick here is the flc free dlc blood knights adds 1 unit to 1 faction this was already added to the game via the workshop by the community at the time fyi amber wizard again 1 unit 1 faction vlad von carstein 1 unit 1 faction wurrzag 1 unit 1 faction grey jade wizards 2 units 1 faction so to recap flc 6 units 4 for empire 2 for vampire this is the glorious flc everyone is talking about in their reviews laugh out loud to say that the community outdid this content in a single day would be an understatement longtime fans know what a complete backstab ca has pulled on us since the early days when we had a free hand at creating content now look at the dlc 15 dollars for the elves and beastmen each a new dlc is on its way norsca 15 dolla sorry but paying 60 bucks for a game and then having race after race locked away behind a paywall is not the way i want to support going into the future
