ive not felt this disrespected as a loyal customer before bought the ultimate edition for this game it came with the carpass the carpass is what gives you new cars post launch conveniently the greedy developers stopped adding cars to the car pass and started adding car packs that you have to buy they are not included in the most expensive version of the game i can ignore the cringier than cringe dialogue this game has and the horrible music choices but buying the ultimate version of the game and not recieving all the content is a lame after stopping the carpass they added 65 euros worth of car packs thats a full aaa game worth of microtransaction
