2022 i m guessing they are hoping for the modders to finish the game like what happened with the original games bought this two years ago in early access got the notification it s released queue me updating the game and playing the campaignthe plus overal combat is fun controls are ok the upgraded graphics are nicethe minus its warband 2 0 but without all the features we were promised they took it out of early access and not a lot got added no real diplomacy no real options with town city management limited options on controlling your caravans workshops game behaviour of war supplies attrition is nonexistant enemies just get their armies respawned and you can conquer everything and still have really bad peace balancing options interactions with other characters or features are the same things on repeat ad infinitum some more thoughts bought it in early access and was looking forward to the roadmap future progress now that it is released in the state as it is i m actually playing it and i m both disappointed and bored with the experience it offers you can either skip a lot of the content because it is just the same not funor it is just a grindfest because of the lack of diversity eg looters are always same type of group and you see these guys a lot not even a few archers in between few options with workshops trading after speaking to an npc type you can just forget about doing that ever again because they all have the same one or none speech options example i want to discuss something with you never mind sole option return to overview dialoguethat is excellent dialogue that really brings the world to lifei expected more
