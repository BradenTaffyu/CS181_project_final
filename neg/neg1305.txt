2020 early access review this is one of the most imaginative and interesting rougelikes and it s biggest failing is that it s a rogue like the main quest is always the same and it s plot driven enough that replaying it is really not fun except for the first few times yet the game has permadeath and literally hundreds of unfair ways to die imagine you are playing skyrim and you walk up to a giant for the first time he bops you into the orbit and your save game gets deleted this is qud the world is vast the descriptions of items are pure poetry but then you wonder if you can explore that weird ruin you found you get a rocked launched in your face and your save gets deleted also the combat is not that great depending on your build you either have to use a different active ablity every turn and this get s boring quickly or you just use basic attacks to walk into enemies untill they die which gets bored even quicker the strong suit of this game is exploration and lore but there is not much of it at leastt not the procedurally generated lore which is so bad i won t even mention it in this game you either savescum or cheese there is no other way to enjoy it when you do the game is great but i fear the complete disconnect between the mechanics the plot and the genre will doom the game to this state of i have to play a very specific way to enjoy it or cheat recent balance changes seem to confirm the notion of having to play as the devs envisioned it return in a few years to see if something changed as it probably will also the devs are apparently insane and will insult you for roleplaying your character wrong and ban you from their discord for asking questions
