2018 hands down the most disappointing fallout game out of the series hopefully bethesda spends more time on the next game of course thats after they port fallout 4 to every device known to man like they did with skyrim instead of spending the time and resources on the next game because instead of having a better game id rather be able to play on my refrigerator
