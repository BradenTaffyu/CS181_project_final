2016 the base game was a solid even if not noteworthy entry in the total war series the gameplay itself is good and the campaigns are enjoyable the dlc policy however is reprehensible in the extreme one would have thought the producers even as the reprobates that they are would have learned their lesson the first time during the controversy with the first dlc but apparently not to quote everyone s favorite sadist roman emperor tiberius it is the duty of a good shepherd to shear his sheep not to skin them tiberius realized what sega cannot we the total war community are the ones being skinned sega is covetous of the money in your wallet and won t be stopped by good taste morals or ethics observe if you please the lack of the promised free content oh and by the way if anyone thinks the free race won t be bretonnia think again all they have released are the blood pack and the chaos warriors dlc both of which should have been in the base game honestly may i ask if anyone knows of another game series that releases blood and gore as a paid dlc for a war game the situation seems like it should be the topic of an snl skit rather than company policy now the producers ask the we the community pay 18 99 for a single dlc that price is approximately a third of the price of the base game that is abhorrently expensive for a single race i am not unlearned in the ways economics work in game developing in order to meet expenses developers must count on a big release and dlc by buying this dlc a precedent will be established at the company that this price is acceptable to the community in conclusion the only way to stop this is hit sega where it hurts their ratings and their wallets if you read this and agree with my sentiments please refrain from buying the dlc until the pricing is reworked thank you
