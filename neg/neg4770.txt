2018 early access review my friend once described deadly premonitions as the best worst game ever he was right it was a terrible game but quite enjoyable i think i d described my summer car as the worse best game ever it s got everything to make it an incredible game and yet it s so abusive that it s just painful to play honestly i ve never seen anything else like it it so accurately simulates the mechanics of the car that i m just in awe every mechanic just feels so lifelike while still being fun the game s got so much meat too summer jobs to upgrade the car scavanging for parts exploring the town the variety of machines and upgrades available everything they say is true this game is a real masterpiece but with all that said the game is just unforgiving and user hostile borderline abusive the simplest example i can give comes from the community itself suggested a pause feature and it turned into a 5 page 6 month argument on the forums keep in mind even with permadeath off and shameless save scuming it s still easy to lose a whole multi hour play session in a couple seconds and yet the forums openly say that the ability to pause the game would break it s realism with permadeath you can die and lose all your progress in this game that progress is painfully claimed and that death is easy without permadeath it s still nasty a car accident can still destroy your car and leave you searching the night roadside with an underpowered flashlight for that water pump oh and did i mention that there are hundred of unique irreplacable parts on the car so if you misplace them or can t find them after a bad engine failure then there s nothing you can do my first game i got the car halfway assembled which was a big accomplishment then i rolled the van on a grocery run i died but respawned in town so i tried to walk home and died of thirst on the highway after a half hour then i spent a some time on the wiki figuring out where and when the bus travels then i spent 10 minutes waiting at the bus stop and another 10 minutes on the bus and by then it was night and i got lost and died of thirst again so now i ve spent a more than two hours trying to get the game back to a playable state after it autosaved after my non perminant death and i just gave up and started over forgot to pay a speeding ticket you go to jail and stand in a cell for several rl hours you can t just leave the game running while you re afk the character still has to eat regularly threw a piston after a bad downshift and can t find it well keep looking cuz there s no way to replace it forget to shut off the stove when you ran to the store the house ll be burned down when you get back and there s no way to repair it run out of gas better hope you brought some fluids cuz you won t survive long enough to walk anywhere on the highway those things are all funny at first and create an incredibly rich gameplay experience but when you have to restart and rebuild the engine again it becomes so easy to put the game down and miss everything it has to offer the game is so impressive that it s really a shame they make it so unplayable the devs have in part worked to make it less unforgiving irreplacable pieces will sometimes clip through the earth and disappear but they added a mechanic for them to respawn at the junkyard each time you make a mistake and get screwed it really is amusing the game is so hillariously desrepectful and realistic that it s just fun to play even when you re losing everything but restarting for the twelveth time after losing everything it starts to get a little frustrating i think a few small changes could salvage this game first all failures should be reversible the burnt down house should be repairable you should be able to buy replacement parts from the mechanic there should be some way of getting through jail time second the game should auto save regularly it certainly should autosave on exit if permadeath is off maybe the last three or four saves should be made available and a better mode of public transportation should exist so players have a recourse besides simply reload or restart if they find themselves stranded somewhere i really hope they can make this game a little more accessible it really is an incredibly rich and nuanced world quite funny at times too if you play it as is you re in for a incredible experience but you ll have to wade through alot of crap to get to it play with permideath off save regularly and manually back up copies of your saves each time you save even so be ready to have to restart a number of times you will have to spend alot of time on the wiki figuring out how to do things but if you can get through all the crap this game really is incredible
