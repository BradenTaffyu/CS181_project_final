there is no vague entity shadowy group or general descriptor to blame for why this game sucks ass it s mio hey bro go work for ea or ubisoft they re the ones in the business of making games that aren t fun seriously all the systems that you are responsible for are you ll fit in with that crowd a lot better skill system sucks ass yeah i wanna micromanage three buffs in order to activate an effect that is maybe noticeable if i squint really hard payday 2 had skills that were fun and not boring you know like they were actually interesting to use 3 on the other hand i cannot remember a single perk besides a few in the armor tree because they were always required for loud that were actually useful also the little activation requirements for certain skills aren t fun especially for such boring rewards armor system this is honestly a worse crime than the crucifixion against christ let s design a system that encourages you to prioritize finishing the level as fast as possible can t let you have fun with guns too long can we when i played this heap which was a bit ago because barely anything has changed so why the hell would i waste my time with a and boring game the armor bag was the undoubtedly best item in the game to bring to a heist because it was the only way to replenish a finite resource needed to not fail you were throwing if you didn t bring one now i see that after all the outcry mio has added adaptive armor aka my design was but i m hardheaded so i ll add a fusion of my armor system with the one fans actually like surely this isn t a colossal waste of time and i shouldn t just rework the armor system to resemble payday 2 instead already right on launch at least guns felt the scar h and revolver were the best undoubtedly and the only ones that actually felt like they packed a punch there is no reason to use the earlier guns compared to the later ones i liked payday 2 because even the worst guns in that game could be modded to feel fine that s another thing that sucks gun customization again at launch at least gun attachments displayed no numbers so i had no idea what they were doing and i couldn t feel any noticeable effects from attachments at all and that was after you had presumably grinded like hell for the attachments seeing as how without the 99 boxes glitch it took two ice ages to max a weapon cool moving to something that i don t know who exactly to blame for the always online decision sucked seriously hey guys i know our company messes up everything we do but surely releasing an unfinished game adding the barest amount of contractually obligated content and scolding players for not liking how it all is will work out for us right along with not letting people just play solo what the were you thinking genuinely also bots suck since they don t revive each other so you have to play babysitter if you play solo also almir s little stream screw up where he went like you need to play payday 3 now so there will be a payday 3 in the future not if it sucks i won t somehow you all made payday not fun an astonishing achievement really maybe don t release a game unfinished and have the gall to be upset that people aren t grovelling at your feet for it honestly and being the most sincere i can be i don t care what list of excuses you can pull out of your ass for why this game isn t good from payday 2 s launch to now it s always pointing blame to something out of your control oh it wasn t us we want the game to be cool and good but our hands are just tied i guess no they aren t did a shareholder demand the new armor system or the skill system face reality and admit you made retarded decisions when you cry wolf for over ten years it stops working i don t give a what happens to this game or your studio or each of you in general all you have done is waste my time with this which sucks since 2 is fun although you screwed that up with the matchmaking update and damage fall off and other unneeded time wasting decisions i didn t even mention a lot of other things wrong with the game but honestly it s a wasted effort you have had people telling you that something you are planning on doing is a idea for years and yet what happens then oh we went through with it anyway i m sure people will definitely buy anything else you all put out after so many avoidable failures
