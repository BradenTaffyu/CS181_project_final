2018 although this game is kind of good with it s concept graphics characters and joja corporation i didn t have as much fun as i expected i bought this game because somebody told me this could be a good stress relief game but ironically it did the complete opposite for me it was very stressful because i have to do the things i want to within 22 minutes 1 in game day before falling asleep which causes me to lose money in this low stress game i had to rush everything which causes a lot of stress i manage to complete the story part of the game in 5 in game months 1 year and 1 month in game and everything got repetetive from there grind sell run to bed shop grind sell run to bed pointless holiday walk to bed with no items to sell grind sell run to bed the characters do feel like soulless animatronics after a while to the point of ignoring them due to their predictable dialogue and where they will walk to next and when but my favorite thing in the entire game is joja corporation just having a realistic villain company threatening corporate takeover of the town and leaves room to your imaginaton to what the corporation is like well that s my experience with this game this game is clearly not designed for me but i play it from time to time but if you grew up with the harvest moon series this game might be for you i m not stopping you from playing i just want to tell my experience with this game who knows you might like this game unlike me
