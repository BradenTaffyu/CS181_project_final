2017 if you like total war and warhammer then you will like this game the obvious stated here is why you shouldn t buy this game unless its on sale the base game consists of a grand campaign in the old world of warhammer which pits you in an all out war between 10 factions with the imminent threat of chaos looming over the world this all sounds amazing until you get to the faction selection screen and realise you can only select 4 races of the 6 available 2 races have to be unlocked buy paying more money there are factions within races to chose from but having played a few of these they do not offer much difference in play style merely substituting a few mechanics to pretend its a differing play style once you are in the game you get right in the action with cut scenes and an epic battle to start you out into the campaign in which early on quests are thrown at you left and right 40 turns later the game becomes stale quests are few and far between and it just feels like a bog standard total war title it really feels like ca phoned this one in i can see why it got good reviews because they obviously didn t play the game for long its great starting out but once the game starts to stagnate you are hungry for more content this means you are likely to have to pay more money to get a fresh experience this game is literally rome total war ii with a new paint job meaning it cannot have been too taxing in development making the lack of initial content all the more perplexing i refused to buy any of the overpriced dlc which include upto 14 to unlock a new race really and 2 to unlock blood in battles farce in my opinion this game is worth about 19 99 new on release if you take into account the content present charging 39 99 is just ridiculous considering all the underlying technology was already developed this game feels more like a mod than a full game overall opinion tread carefully buy if its on sale be prepared to pay more money after playing for a couple of days not recommended
