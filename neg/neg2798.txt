2021 while not really a don t buy this game i feel more frustration than fun with the game can you play it for hours on end yes but then i look back and think of how it was only filler fun instead of actual fun while fun when you don t know what to expect you ll quickly realize that the gameplay is just so shallow at the end of the day every system is so basic and one dimensional that you re just playing the exact same style of gameplay regardless of what kind of empire you ve built seriously your robot collective because you can t even be robots without a collective will play almost identically to a fast breeding space bug swarm except one farms food and one doesn t empire building is hardly there diplomacy is just awful with the ai and you research the exact same stuff in the roughly exact same order every time it s a game that is basically just for wars but then why is combat so bad there is almost no strategy at all defend a chokepoint of which there are so many for a space game because lane travel only and build a higher strength number than your enemy smash the fleets together one wins repeat there are no real types of ships just bigger ships that just do more damage and nothing else worst of all they constantly overhaul the gameplay and somehow make it worse population growth was seen as a mid late game issue where it got too high so their idea to fix this was to add a poorly thought out empire pop cap not planet and just threw away most of the planet building slots that were tied to population levels except they didn t remove the high pop requirement for the good buildings so you just build some stuff on your best planets and like nothing everywhere else because there is nothing to build when you have no workers in what world is just removing a whole gameplay feature replaced with a shoddy patchwork for a replacement a fix to a problem not to mention this breaks any mod that worked around buildings which commonly happens to mods due to terrible reworks of gameplay overall if you have a friend who owns the dlc you can get it for 10 and probably have fun for a bit hey even without the dlc you maybe can get a bit if fun but since there is so much dlc and you d have to sink so much to experience all the shallow systems to make the game slightly less boring overall it s just not worth it such a shame because you can really see how this game could be amazing if they actually put some real effort into it and not the lazy dlc sold for full price and half baked revamps thrown in to make the game even less fun and ya there is no option to have these revamps turned on or off they re just the game now
