2015 oh boy guys this game is the bee s knees this game is really good insofar as the dlc policy makes you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty flensing knife don t you love it when you go into the classical era and you can t play as the classical greeks because you have to pay seven fiddy for the culture pack oh boy check out the all new and amazing unit packeroni for the mouthbreathii out in the middle of nowhere only ten thousand of your hard earned doubloons you have to pay for blood blood in a war game i get that the germanians never gave up their backwards censorship culture but just do what valve did and replace the blood with gears or something how would you feel if nintendo took out the ability to play as luigi in mario kart you can still race against him just if you want to play as him you have to buy the we a takin your a money culture pack when you pay 60 bucks for a game you expect to get the full game am i right i m wrong they did the same thing in attila and most people are just accepting that they are being taken advantage of no one knows what is going on anymore no one buys a game and expects anything more than a piecemeal half baked omelet that requires the salt and pepper dlc for 10 million dollars hey guys when was the last time you bought a game and you got the whole game no strings attached almost a decade ago for me unless you count indies we dont need a socratic dialogue to see that the aaa sphere is an abhorrence to anything good and pure in this world i ll now list the pros and cons of this game nice grafix nice gameplay ai is total garbage hey ca maybe a was ok in the days of yore but there should not be an ai this terrible in a modern game make some better algorithms pikmin 1 on the gamecube has a much much better army style ai and it was released in 2001 hey if you want to see the rest of this review you have to give me 20 billion dollars as part of the god i just want to end my miserable life review pack dlc all in all i d like to bestow upon this game a rating of to see this rating buy the end reviews review pack dlc for only 300 trillion dollars and if you think that joke is getting stale well for you it s a joke for me and the people who own this game its a harsh painful reality they have to deal with everyday oh boy scary face guy they dun diddly did it again with warhammer thanks for telling me that me now i ll just bestow upon you fellows my incomprehensible rage chaos is dlc my friends chaos for those not in the know putting chaos as dlc is like putting carthage as dlc basically we are now getting the shafterino againerino hey this probably won t be the end of it make sure to buy the game 2 years after its out to get the whole actual entire game that they should have released from the beginning at a much much cheaper price why on earth is sega doing this why why what did we do to deserve this i want to give you my money but y all are acting so incomprehensibly asinine that i don t think i can at least not without having parts of the game locked out from me its downloadable content not hey we took it out of the game lads play4only 4000 quadrillion content no we re not done lads i want to play as my ancestors the scythians but thats a unit pack we steppefolk don t like getting scammed out of our hard earned mnai by some uppity publisher that thinks it s disgusting dlc policy is smart there s less money in the industry than there should be because consumers are untrusting of scummy companies ya think well that ends my magnificent opus odimini seriously though buy the complete edition read the actual whole game in a few years and save yourself the hundred dollars buying the dlc 11 23 16 one year on and no sign of the full game edition b c of sega and ca grubbery i nominate this half game the sad steam award sad b c all your money was stolen by the devs for dlc where are the good games where are the games that make you wonder that blow you away that up end your worldview where are the games that pick you up slam you against the furniture and leave you wanting where are the games that you pick up on a hunch and become family treasures that you cherish till end of days where are the games that don t follow cliche to make money but make money through grassroots watering con good gameplay good sound good grafix good story good character where are the games that are fun to experience fun to play not just difference exercises but works of love passion and beauty where are the games that save you and love you and make you love the world and yourself with no guilt as guilt is no concept permissible in the reality of the game where are the games with ai so good it isn t artificial and it is intelligent where are the games with music and graphics so good you see the game s reality better than your own where are the games with story so good you feel as though you weren t narrated to you weren t told what to think you weren t told what to do you did it because you wanted to do it because you love the game because it loves you because you are and it is love made manifest where are the games with gameplay so good you rolled with the licks and nicks and ticks because you felt the ribbing and it s like a cold febuary morning drinking hot chocolate when you say something off and your big bro whacks you on the arm and it doesn t hurt tho it should because you have a family and you re together and you belong and the rapport is fun and the highs high and the lows high and you re feeling tired and satisfied and happy where is the hope wander through the eons of miserere the darkness of modernity clouds us makes us stupid turns us against each other the fog of modernity blinds us worse than acid lobotomizes us the poison of modernity is supped with gusto by those who can t take they re in a feudal society but no free housing no free food if not for video games television internet books suicide would be the order of the day the kali yuga is unbearable the dark age is a killer the age of darkness is a merciless flayer a mindless flayer the machine engineered with one purpose and that is to enrich itself con the blood of the two legged cattle it flays where are the hope where are the hope where are the hope where are the games that aren t two hundred billion buckaroonies for the whole package creative buttembly you shekel grubbers
