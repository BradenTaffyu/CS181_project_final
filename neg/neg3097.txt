2020 now this is a game that is really difficult to review there are som gradings here that is going in opposite directions the driving simulator in itself is fantastic if you are into these types of racing simulators you will love this one it is really fun to drive and feels realistic can t ever be sure since i m not a car owning millionaire one thing that sucks more than in any other game published the last 20 years is the multiplayer aspect i m not talking about the multiplayer experience that you get in iracing with races being automatically scheduled every 30 mins or so i m talking about the more primitive multiplayer experience where you can login and perhaps see that your friend is also logged in and join that friends server i m talking about the multiplayer experience in where you could perhaps even offline compare your laptimes with your friends i m talking about the multiplayer experience where you could even see if a friend is playing at all none of these things exist in acc no multiplayer features that promotes driving with friends you can join servers but you will be playing with strangers when it comes to servers there are no filtering options there exist some non functioning weighting options that are quite useless you can t for instance filter out servers that you aren t allowed to play on because you might lack some skill stat insane if you love racing simulators have no friends and don t mind jumping into servers without any control this is the game for you
