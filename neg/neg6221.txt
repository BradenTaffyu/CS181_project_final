the first 3 chapters of this game are genuinely really really good companions are interesting story is engaging combat is challenging enough and then suddenly you get to chapter 4 and it becomes a nightmare the game was clearly not ready so many broken quests half baked ideas glitches and then suddenly the game ends the final sections of the game are just kinda there combat becomes a chore and the story doesn t make it worth it anymore
