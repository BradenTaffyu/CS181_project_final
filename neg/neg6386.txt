2021 lying developer with the premium 99 bucks edition they promised to give you all the future dlc cars guess what they just released a 5 bucks additional car pack and premium pack holders don t get them do not buy this game it was already bad with ai and obnoxious community rules now it s officially a scam update even more scammy dlc packs and no fixing the atrocious fake difficulty ai or the ludicrous online glitched scores bravo playground you drove the game into the ground if you value lots of car lots of places to just hang around and build your dream car this game is awesome but if you go to highter tier difficulty pro unbeatable prepare for frustration not because the ai is good but because those lazy developers made it so enemy cars don t answer phisics change of road type you drift like mad as they go on rails high jump you could bottom out and lose lots of speed while the ai simply lands softly without losing speed found a good trajectory sorry enemy ai slams you from behind they could have just taken the top pilots used their times and telemetry to actually make good ai this is pure lazyness from the devs who could have made us face the best of the best pilots of this game and get amazed by perfect tunings and trajectories forcing us to sweat to improve to their level instead they made the ai cheat its way to victory forcing you to either slam into them to break their speed or find other cheesy exploits this is why until they fix the ai i will keep a negative review fix the ai and it s a most reccomended game can you win at pro unbeatable yes you can not impossible but you will end up smashing into cars to slow them and slam into corners to keep as much momentum as phisically im possible for a racing game it s tatamount to need to cheese the game to out cheese the ai it s not something one expects from such a aaa game studio and of course if you ever let the lead car go beyond 100 metres it will completely ignore obstacles so the small branches slowling you down or somewater will have zero effect on a too far away car meaning you get the penalty of obeying in game phisics as the ai ignores it completely update it s useless to write lol u bad if you never saw the ai cars glued on the ground for what would have been a 100 meters jump you are literally blind kudos on playing a game about cars while blind tho that takes skill update 2 incredible now the fixed the game and by that i mean they updated the code of conduct in a game with no chat and the usual railroaded ai car that sprint more than you and ignore phisics is still there in all its glory and for new cars we got some electric stuff and nothing much more what does a man have to do to have a mercedes slr the latest bugatti instead of this silly things give us cars and ai based on real track statistics and fix the exploit yous till have people submitting almost zero time in tracks update 3 now even more car packs just 10 euros for 5 cars i mean after all their combined cost is almost at the same level as the ultimate edition that went 99 dollars to include all the packs but unfortunately it did not do so this kind of predatory tactics is best left to telemarketing scammers not a videogame
