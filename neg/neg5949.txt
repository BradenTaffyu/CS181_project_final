2018 i love this game i really do but i can t reccommend it the game will cost you way over 200 for everything and i absolutely hate the dlc culture the final straw for me was the release of dlc a followed by dlc a content pack hold on a minute dlc stands for down loadable content content being the important word here most of the dlcs lack exactly that and come with a huge price tag half of them contain over priced content that should be a patch and the other half of them don t contain any content because their content has been taken out and sold seperately as a downloadable content content pack that is the content that should be in the dlc in the first place put the content back in the dlcs paradox that would make them closer to being worth their price points some of the dlcs are already worth it but read the reviews very carefully make no assumptions and only buy when they are on sale the game is an incredible expansive and wonderfully captivating thing that holds so much replayability you can see how much work and effort has been put into it which makes me feel more okay about buying some of the on sale dlcs but paradox is determined to milk it dry they threaten to milk my enthusiasm right out of it with another 15 dlc without its content even after so much anger from the community i m not even sure paradox cares about its community anymore apart from to serve as an over milked cash cow
