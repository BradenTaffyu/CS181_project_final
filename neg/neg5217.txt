2016 i will start by saying i am a huge fan of the warhammer franchise and have collected the models since i was 10 with games workshop ruining the tabletop game with age of sigmar this has been a game very close my heart the cost of the models when i was a kid made them hard to collect and this dlc is a lot cheaper than even buying a basic unti box i dont want to harp on the price of the dlc because plenty of people have already done that however when downloadable content was first created it was not about charging extra money it was about expanding upon a storyline adding features companies such as ca have turned it into a way to get more money over the lifetime of a game i am not saying they should not charge you anything but charging you for everything aside from a few free heros has just gotten to the point of being asinine yes it is cheaper than collecting models yes it is enjoyable and yes i will continue playing this game however if you are looking into getting this game i would wait until the price is cheaper there is a sale this game for 30 dollars even 40 is a steal especially if you can get it bundled with dlc however i would not recomend paying 60 dollars to get the base game because if you want to get the other factions unlocked you will have to pay a total of around 110 or so dollars
