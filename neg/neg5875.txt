2015 i ve been an avid fan of the total war franchise for as long as i can remember and honestly speaking this game is quite disappointing does this game bring a new experience to the rome series most definitely does this game succeed in evoking that wow factor when you play a new game not a chance the average i say this kindly ai this game sports is quite insulting and ca has effectively butchered many features that we have come to love in other tw series while promising more pros massive campaign map fresh ui and new cinematic mode play as the greatest empire of all time unit design is satisfying testudoooo cons weak ai poor ui design especially skill trees inability to control certain aspects of family minimalistic in game cinematics events are repetitive and boring politics is blunt and unsatisfying unexciting siege battles
