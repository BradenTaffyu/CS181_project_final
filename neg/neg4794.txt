2021 i really wish i could give a medium review because the thing is i love playing this game buuuut not for what the advertise and what they do advertise is actually very lacking i ll start with the bad to get it out of the way the actual content of the game is shallow and has a few annoying bugs despite the devs having added modding options though there actually doesn t seem to be a way of adding content to the game only assets like furniture and floors looking at the workshop there s no option for new houses to buy new renovation jobs to do nothing like that all of which is the actual content of the game and it s sorely lacking even with dlc all the modding community can add are assets and on the topic of assets there are many assets that are in the game in various houses but you can t actually buy them but then a lot of them are broken in some way yet you can t repair them or replace them with a proper match you have to sell the whole set and re buy something you can actually find in the catalog i think that if there s an asset for it we should be able to buy it the game also desperately needs a clone item button both for situations like what i just mentioned and for when you have no idea what colors you selected hey maybe they ll put that in a paid dlc because that is definitely a trick they re pulling here there are also features that are hidden behind paywalls you can t do anything to the outside of your home without the garden dlc and that includes basic stuff like clearing weeds mowing the lawn or putting a chair or the porch you cannot modify the exterior of your home at all except for painting or changing windows doors from the inside unless you have the dlc you can t even change the flooring of your porch or put a chair on it unless you pay money for it another missing basic feature you can buy changing exterior walls in the past the devs have stated the game is about renovating homes not building them yet they re adding it in an upcoming paid dlc according to the advertisements for the farm dlc to me this reads as the devs wanting to be paid extra for basic features while lying about why it s not in the base game to seem cool and honorable they wanna seem like they re upholding the integrity of the vision or whatever but they also want us to pay more i really wish they d just outright say it it s not in the base game because we feel it would fit better in a dlc don t lie to us and say some crap about what the game is truly about or whatever these are all issues with the game and the lack of content is probably the biggest one for a lot of people for me the lack of content is actually one of the smaller things because i ve found enjoyment in other ways so onto the good parts i have been a long time fan of the sims series but i ve always wished there were different ways to play the game maybe first person or co op where you manage a family with a friend or you each have a different family in the same save and they know each other for me this game kinda scratches the itch of the first one i get to be in first person to feel like i m immersed in the game and i get to redecorate and everything just like in the sims and it s honestly really really fun the upcoming pets and farm dlcs seem to be leaning into this adding in more stuff to do outside of just the house flipping stuff for me this is a positive but it s also a step away from the core idea of the game which is a big part of why i had to mark the review as negative because for how much i love this game it really doesn t do what it says for me it does something way better i have spent hours now working on perfecting my office i bought one of the buyable houses and transferred the office there and made it a beautiful little home for myself and i have truly enjoyed it but if that s not your cup of tea if you really and truly wanna renovate houses like they advertise this game may not be the one for you with how quick the content runs out i personally fully plan to buy the farm dlc the second it comes out because again it adds to what i personally want the game to be but what i want the game to be is almost certainly not the same as what a lot of others want the game to be especially based on how they advertise they game i think that if they re going to go in this direction they should be embracing it and advertising it appropriately since they currently aren t i have to mark this as no i don t recommend it because it really does not fulfill its advertised purpose despite being a wonderful game in a very different niche if you re like me though and you re looking for a home designing game rather than just a house flipping game then this could totally be the game for you and i hope you have fun with it
