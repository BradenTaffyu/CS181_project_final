2023 i mean i like some of the new mechanic i like the battles for the most part the battle ai seems a few steps above other total wars they ll actually try to make a break through your line they ll flank they ll counter flank to an extent but the campaign ai oh boy is it the worst ive ever seen lets be me in my last 5 campaigns constantly getting declared war upon by factions across the map already fighting three wars and it wont just be one itll be 3 or 4 every campaign multiple times i get it if their are my neighbor or at least semi close but this is just ridiculous id rather play wh3 and thats still trash
