2018 early access review while this game is certainly fun to play with friends it s been in an alpha state for nearly five years now and is still fairly horribly optimized though granted it s not as bad as it used to be until the developers decide to actually sit down and finish the game i just cannot recommend it an unlikely scenario seeing as even minor updates can end up being released months apart
