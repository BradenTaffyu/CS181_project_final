2016 they took out what made fallout stand out in this crowded rpg genre the immersive dialogue with multiple choices the interesting story with different endings and consequences the interesting npcs and cool side quests the great writing and amazing set pieces instead we get a game with polished gameplay average graphics with preety bad optimisation on launch poorly made ui and repetitive side quests along a bad main story that ends preety much exactly the same no matter what you do same exact cutscene all this would have been acceptable had it not taken them 7 years to make it it s not a bad game but it s not a good game either it s just fine and fine is not gonna cut it after 7 years in development this is just dissapointing the skills are gone the story is gone the dialogue is gone verdict 6 10 average shooter with some rpg elementsif you want a shooter with rpg elements kinda like borderlands but with an average story and horrid dialogue by all means buy it on a sale if you want an rpg with shooter elements with a very well made skill system great story with amazing dialogue with completely different endings based on your choices that make a huge difference and some great characters and locations do yourself a favor and buy fallout new vegas it s better in every single way imaginable
