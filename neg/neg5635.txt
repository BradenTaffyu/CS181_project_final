2020 user interface is a well desinged indecipherable cluster its extremely difficulty to understand what is happerning and why that integrated encyclopedia is garbage units its just you have to dig dirt with bare hands to get what info you need to make your decisions this combines well with almost all of the working mechanics unexplained the ai cheats like a lunatic and im not talking about legendary difficulty its super fun when your upgraded spy fail a basic action 7 times out of 7 attempts with 69 chance of success and then the ai kills your top 3 generals with a level one champion
