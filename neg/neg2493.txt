2021 well i wanted to enjoy this game i really did climate of the game is great music also with a 9 11 graphics but after playing 30 h i cannot recomend it i can say it is barely a game it feels more like checklist of what you need to do in that specific order or else well try again next time this is not a proper city builder you basicly can not make any mistakes and yet a game throws a ridicolus event that no way you had any reason to prepare oh you failed well try again next time game on higer levels of difficulty suppose to be more challenging but it is just about demanding even more perfect execution via a script you can not test or play a scenario diffrently because well there is like no time usually to do anything else that is nessesary to survive and yet once more be the good boy and follow the script you can t even test something diffrent in sandbox unless you buy dlc gj devs love that decision you can t play with cool robots every map because resources you find in the world are allmost allways the same not enough stream cores to build better follow the script that was prepared for you to follow mate the whole game feels like a on rail scripted event that punishes you if you want to do anything diffrent than what was intended first reaction was great but it faded quite quickly
