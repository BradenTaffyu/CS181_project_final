2022 early access review let me start by saying that i love this game series but until the full release i would not recommend buying this game it has come a long way since its release but there are still too many things that need smoothing out or reworking some updates break stuff that worked before or the turn of one cog effected other cogs and lead to new problems arising hence my advice to wait for the full game i guess i would not have come even close to 400 hours played without mods i cannot imagine playing this game vanilla mods are what keep me coming back since you can modify the game to your liking and luckily there have been a plethora of mods since release but this leads to the next problem the regular updates break mods and many great mod creators have had enough of regularly updating their mods to everchanging parameters always depending on which part of the game the update affected and have stopped supporting their mods more than once i reinstalled the game to give it another go just to find out that an important mod is currently not working now you get to choose between waiting for an update or try without maybe missing out on features you find absolutely necessary currently there are many gameplay elements that feel unfinished or badly planned ai for example is non existent unless you are leading your own kingdom you are in for a lot of pain there is enough pain when being king just a tad more control on your part lords breaking a siege instead of attacking suddenly wanting to cross the continent to visit a city or start sieging some castle preferably the one furthest away from your current position or hey you re in a war with 2 factions stronger than you let s have some lords with too much influence initiate a vote on declaring war on another faction when you re king you re at least able to veto votes by investing a fortune of influence as to not have 4 concurrent wars and you always get to lead an army since you have most influence if you haven t just sunk over 1400 influence into saying no to some stupid law or war a lord wanted to start and it s never only one proposal you ll have some downtime and then bam here are 4 brainless proposals for your kingdom and even then the other ai armies are completely brainless not running from a siege if a bigger army arrives and getting smashed but you can bet they ll lift a siege to defend a castle halfway across the map and the ai cheats oh it cheats let me show this with a generic example you siege city army comes to defend smash it release 1 or 2 lords to increase opinion as to maybe poach them in the future before even being able to finish building one ram or siege tower another full stack army with the same lords appears and attacks again how fun after being at war for a while in comes the next fun part the calculation of tribute when proposing peace seems so broken i cannot make sense of it having 95 of lords as prisoners and having conquered several settlements and having inflicted much more casualties leads to me paying them ai kingdoms you re a part of especially enjoy taking unfavourable peace deals as the winner and if you re king most likely your lords won t want to end their fun which leads to even more invested influence gameplay wise my biggest gripe is how grindy this game is starting a new game is cool for the first 2 times but after a while and having regular save breaking updates i don t want to fight a hundred looter bands or tournaments just to be able to be a mercenary or at clan lvl 2 join a kingdom as a vassal and the fun does not end there reaching clan level 4 or 5 is another level of grindy even with mods that slightly increase gains as to not have to grind that hard my kingdom almost controls all of the starting empire lands and i just reached clan level 4 so my guess is i will reach lvl 5 once i control all of calradia i get the approach to be a slow game but there is not too much to do beside warring it s more of an empty grind during peace you travel from fief to fief to see if another building can be put into the queue replenish your army to capacity and do the same quests for the 100th time and having to fight 40 battles during one war which sadly gets old really quick once you figure out how the ai fights smashing army after army just for a new one to spring forth does not feel rewarding all the while your own numbers dwindle and you gotta slowly crawl from settlement to settlement to hire between 3 9 new men the ai just spawns fresh with new troops ready to band together again and get another go at you some updates even implemented certain changes to things that were too quick or strong while some things have been broken since release workshops in vanilla the only good passive income beside city taxes have been nerfed so hard you cannot afford more than 100 men without having several fiefs with a garrison that can defend said fiefs without mods this is just tedious i get that there s a lot of work to be done and some things are easier to fix than others but it just is not cool from a players pov for everything that is really great about this game there is something very tedious to hamper your fun wait till full release and maybe even wait a little then so the mod creators can update their stuff for full enjoyment of the game just to show you a small list of addons i cannot play without kaoses tweaks the single most important mod you can tweak so many small things like influence and fame gain or how many followers and parties you can use diplomacy since there is hardly any implementation of several functions that seem so very basic for a game such as this improved garrison so i have a small level of control over my settlements defenses cultured start so i do not always have to start as a peasant and grind my way up for over a week many interesting start options i personally prefer noble in exile where you start with clan lvl 2 while being hated in you origin culture at the start fill stacks removes the cheat units lords get when respawning making battles more impactful since the ai cannot just cheat half full armies into existence and has to slowly collect troops like me distinguished service once your kingdom is somewhat grown to the size of other kingdoms you have too few clans nobles and governors to effectively rule your lands hence this little helper that increases companion size for your clan and lets me promote successful soldiers after battles to make them into governors or party leaders
