for decades now there has never been a shortage of collectible card battle games from their analog roots to their modern digital ubiquity there s always somewhere you can go to pick up at least a few hundred unique cards and a set of elaborate rules that immediately deter any casual onlooker marvel snap is another one of these but makes its mark not simply by adopting a popular franchise but by having a game loop that makes it easy to get started and even easier to never stop abbreviated review youtube video another great f2p game ruined by microtransactions marvel snap views 1 580 you may be wondering if i ve learned anything interesting about marvel characters over the past month of playing this game for nearly 100 hours the answer is no the familiar foilsthe initial setup of marvel snap isn t something that will surprise most people who have played such games cards have two noteworthy numbers a power level and a cost they can also have distinct abilities in the text on their body that perform a wide variety of effects on themselves other cards and the board itself marvel snap doesn t have a head representing the player like magic the gathering or hearthstone even though the lead developer of the latter left his creation at blizzard to develop this game while the basic tenets here are fairly standard across the deckbuilding world the differences lie in the way these cards exist and interact in the environment decks are small only allowing an exact total of 12 cards in each one but that s all you need as every match is typically only six rounds each round you ll gain one additional maximum energy allowing you to play more costly cards or several lower cost cards every turn onto an ever changing battlefield that battlefield is one of the most dynamic aspects of the experience it s split into three rows that are separate from one another in their interactions to win the total power on your side of at least two of the rows must be greater than the power level of your opponent s facing row these lanes aren t static features though on each of the first three turns they reveal an effect that can dramatically change the entire flow of the match potentially hamstringing your deck or turning it into a monstrosity every match you play even with the same deck can be an entirely new experience solely because of the nature of the lane effects this is why there s one aspect of each match that can significantly boost or mitigate the variance in these encounters the snap as the title indicated a core mechanic in marvel snap is the snap itself drawing its name i presume from thanos s universe culling infinity gauntlet action this feature can double your commitment of points toward victory that doesn t make much logical sense but from the standpoint of the game it is a great feature in a normal match you can win or lose two points but if you snap both sides commit one more point for a total of four and if both sides snap eight points will change hands launching the winner a full level higher in the ranking system this brings not only a way to mitigate your losses by retreating before the end of the match only losing one point or whatever has been committed through snaps but it adds another strategic layer it makes sense to snap if you think you re going to win but it s reasonable to snap even if you aren t sure as it may instill just a tiny bit of doubt in your opponent just like bluffing in poker you may steal a victory when defeat is all but certain it also feels immensely rewarding to win a double snapped match and see your rank fly up in the few minutes it takes to complete a single competition the ranks themselves are fairly straightforward they are used in the matchmaking process but also reward you at every ten levels with a small incentive once you reach 100 you get ranked on the scale of everyone else who has achieved that and get to continue your competitive endeavor ascending or descending hundreds or thousands of positions with each match relative to the tens of thousands of other players tapping you credit card for manaas with every free to play game there are plenty of microtransactions to keep the cash flowing and as with far too many free to play games these are a detriment to the experience your initial foray into the game has you bombarded with new cards through the collection system that ranks up as you upgrade cards with two of the many in game currencies you re able to climb this ladder getting new cards and more resources at a satisfying pace yet this rather suddenly drops off as you get into the game and you begin unlocking fewer and fewer cards through the mostly randomized process of card pools that are accessed with higher rank the only way to get around this is to spend real money to obtain more in game currencies and either buy cards directly or hit up that collection ladder again there are a few other ways to obtain new cards but they are even slower than the aforementioned the thing is i believe marvel snap could be financially successful just by selling a battle pass and cosmetics because the card back and variants are great collectible items and feature some incredible artwork of course it does sell those things just in addition to the part where you barely get new cards while facing off against cards you don t have so you want to buy access to more like virtually all games that do this people are vocal about how it is scummy but probably a hundred times as many people silently spend the money and keep the company rolling in cash but if monetization was marvel snap s only problem it would probably still be a decent game given how far you can get for free there s a lot of great design in both the card functionality and the unique setup of the battlefield enough that it makes this game pretty addictive however with only a passing run at balance the cream rises to the top and the most powerful cards are ubiquitous in decks you ll ultimately see some of the same exact deck designs copied and pasted from match to match totaling maybe a dozen distinct experiences if you choose to make something different you might find some success but at the end of the day it feels like it depends more on the randomized lanes than you being able to outplay your opponent the game often boils down to just whoever triggers their ridiculous power combo best and when you re limited in what cards you have access to that makes that worse when you combine this with an interface that s somehow clunky both on mobile and pc and weird omissions like being able to see what cards have been discarded or destroyed for each player it just stops being fun i doubt any of this is going to change given how long the game has been out i don t recommend anyone follow in my footsteps only to hit a soft paywall and feel like you ve wasted all of that time if you d like to see more of my reviews check out my curator page here endyo sindies
