2020 don t get me wrong arma is a briliant game with an amazing level editor and great customization that gave birth to lots of mods and even games like arma life day z and lots of other fan made goodies like sound graphic improvements and so on so yes the game is worth its money but should you buy it i think personally that this engine is too old it breaks almost every computer when a smoke grenade pops off and i think it s time for a new engine if you are a new player you d have to prepare yourself for the huge step backwards in physics ai movement or even the movement of your own character you can t jump i don t think that was a choice i think the devs didn t have one so i would recommend waiting for arma 4 because the devs have showed us that they are really capable and open to the community i like to believe the developers are limited by the 90 s engine and the game suffers because of it there is so much potential and i would love to see that on a newer platform
