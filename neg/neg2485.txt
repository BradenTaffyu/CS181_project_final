2018 i was really capitaveded by this game when a started the main mission i love city building simulation games and frostpunk really gives you a challange i m sure you ve read other s review of how great the graphics gameplay and moral choices the game offers and i totally agree that the game is great and worth playing but my reason for not recommending giving it a thumb down the game is not that i don t like it i would like steam to have a balanced thumb option for reviews my problem with the games is replay ability the main story is fun the other scenarios offers the player other but yet familiar problems to handle when you have figured out the mechanics the late game becomes a bit boring i ve tried the main story a handfull of times now and the story evolves exactly the same and that is not very challanging i miss some sort of sandbox or open scenario where you can expand your city or send expiditions to found other cities maybe fight with another city over ressources there s a lot of possibilities for frostpunk to evovle the game and replayability
