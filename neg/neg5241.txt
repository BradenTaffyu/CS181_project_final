2016 while i ve never been really big on total war games i bought this almost soley because it s warhammer and for that alone i do love it but what i don t love is this bs with the dlc s and their pricing much as i d love to give this game a good review in support of all of the other like minded players it s getting a solid negative review until there are some changes made i m not sure if it ll make a difference but i do hope they see the horrible feedback they re getting lately and make some serious changes for the sake of the future and legacy of this game
