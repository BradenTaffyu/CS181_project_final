i only bought this game due to curiosity but i shouldn t have because my friends does not want to pay for this game understandable so i decided to join random groups and while they are nice and hang out that s the only time the game is fun atleast for me however everything else sucks the real bethesda magic is from the modding community and since no mods are allowed the magic is bare i am not going to touch on the scum like practices that s happening in the store but i will say if you want to chill with friends in a somewhat not desolate wasteland fallout game then this is it get game on deep discounted sale
