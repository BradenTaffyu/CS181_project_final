2019 mediocre none of the game s systems are fun to play with an illusion of choice hides a min maxing necessity you spend much more time operating the game s interface and working around its clunkiness than planning and executing strategic decisions so it s not really a strategy game but a point and click puzzle scale of the game requires automation but implementation is poor so instead of micro managing units you have to micro manage the interface system nothing was created with a pleasant user experience in mind so everything you try to do is inconvenient and clunky example you need to modify production but the information you need what do i have where what do i need what may i be able to achieve is spread over multiple different screens and places or simply absent front lines are arbitrarily divided by country so you can t draw a western front or eastern front but you have to make fronts by country borders so in places with multiple countries your front line is an arbitrary bureaucratic mess you spend more time managing armies and fronts than having fun tracing and executing plans to beat the enemy through strategy drawing attack plans is so clunky it s very difficult to organize a pincer or encirclement the ai prefering to waste everything in attrition warfare airforce and naval management is just as frustrating and a mechanical chore instead of strategic the game couldn t decide whether it wanted to be historical or sandbox so there is a bizarre focus tree element which does not satisfy historical players because it has alternate options but also doesn t allow for a sandbox game because its decisions and effects are entirely arbitrary in the end it s not a fun game to play at all and consumes most of your play time in managing interface not doing strategy you may have fun the first time thanks to novelty but it wears off to frustration very quickly
