2022 with the release of tw iii the fact tw i dlc and tw ii dlc have not been lowered in price or at least been announced to be lowered in price is staggering i am not of the opinion that all the dlc matters or are necessary for a fun experience but i am of the opinion that the mortal empires is the superior mode with needing all 3 games to experience this mode when it is released for wh 3 means without prices being lowered it is 180 dollars to experience one albeit the best game mode for people who have been playing for years it is less of a pain point however for a lot of people who are jumping into the series with wh iii this is a substantial issue i think the best course of action is to either reduce prices or make it if you buy the two original games at full price they come with all their dlc sure you might make less money if you lowered the prices but it d be a lot cooler if you did
