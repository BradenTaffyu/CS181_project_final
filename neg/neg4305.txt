2018 a good game at it s core probably the most complex at release game of the series however there are some serious problems regarding the ai namely the fact that they are either petty incredibly spontaneous or both the unique modifiers for each civ leader disregard capability so the dutch with insult and berate you for not being able to trade with them when they re on the other side of the world they will also declare wars against you without any sort of warning despite the display showing that they are friendly towards you lying civ displays was a thing back in v as well but here it feels arbitrary and a constant frustration when your neighbors and everyone else suddenly declares two four or even six separate wars against you without any sort of real discourse the only time a civ will demand something from you is when they are displeased with you but know they can t win a war the whole system makes their poker faces seem more like a game of guess who when the other player keeps changing their character map generation is oversimplified compared to civ v which allowed for a variety of different map types in vi however you have less than ten different map types not counting the fairly minor variable modifiers with how the eureka and inspiration systems work you could easily find yourself trying to play a military civ without have any iron or horses spawning near you resulting in a far slower tech development than those lucky enough to do so this also happens with two of the earlier technologies which require you to find a second continent and find a natural wonder respectively both of which you could be easily screwed out of by no fault of your own this leads to maps boiling down to one of a small variety good starts bad starts and unwinnable starts yes those can happen if you end up next to a horribly aggressive enemy or get cornered by barbarians you can basically kiss your starting point goodbye because the ai will quickly leapfrog ahead of you on that note barbarians are horribly annoying in the early game but are basically required for the eurekas for most starting military techs if a barbarian scout locates your city and gets back to a nearby encampment and with a movement range of 3 that s more likely than not you re going to find a raiding army of three units heading towards where you settled note that this likely happens right out of the gate resulting in you having to put all of your development building military units so you can actually build and expand without your units being killed or abducted the worst part however are barbarians that encamp near horses those barbarians spawn horsemen and horse archers a barbarian specific unit that is both far more mobile than their grounded counterpart but also much stronger and you don t get the eureka for the technology to make spearmen until you kill three barbarians total this is even worse in slower games because barbarians spawn much faster than you can make military units to fight them off due to the barbarian spawning not scaling to the slower game speed religion which was only added later in the life cycle of civ v is in the base game but it is extraordinarily tedious and frustrating the ai will pursue religion with a crazy furvor using every single faith point it has in the most efficient way it knows how making competing against them to get a religious victory a trial of tedium in fact the easiest way to win a religious victory is to actually go for a military victory cities burned or captured and inquisitioned are much easier to deal with than trying to work the arcane religious combat system or throwing missionaries and apostles at any city who doesn t follow you over and over it wasn t even until rise fall was added did they allow your military units to stop religious units who would before then just walk right through your lines and provide scouting and intelligence honestly it s not a bad game but it is disappointing poorly balanced and if you want to just play a fun round you may end up hitting that restart button more than a few times hold off on it for a sale at the very least
