2023 tl dr the game is mostly decent if you ignore the fact that ca abandoned it before fixing a slue of bugs and crushes or just neglected a general polish that you would expect from any product what so ever that you are expected to pay for there are a lot of visual glitches and campaign bugs that require reloading the save for something to take effect or allow you to use certain faction mechanic that meet requirements but the game doesn t realize that until you reload granted the battles them selves look and play amazing barring the occasional visual glitch right after loading into battle like you would expect from tw game my biggest problem with it at the time of this review is that their last patch 1 7 1 kinda broke the trade agreements for liu hong campaign in mandate of heaven this is just an example for a faction available from mandate of heaven dlc but the issues mentioned here concern the base game and other dlcs as well mainly every or almost every faction that is supposed to use rivers for their trade agreements that are locatad in the western half of the map in fact i m pretty sure they forgot to game test this faction at all and probably a lot of other factions too nothing in liu hong s starting situation makes sense i didn t play as every faction just yet but there is a general sense that big chunks of the game feel unfinished not just bugs and crushes but the gameplay itself so here is a little rant the trade port you suppose to take as liu hong at turn 1 has no purpose since its only purpose was to give access to trade agreements with the entire empire but now it s situated between two impassable straits that block not only armies but also trade now your only option to unlock sea trading is to annex 3 counties all the way to dong that has a harbor which is nether fast nor easy nor as defendable as your capital commandery and don t give me that game engine limitation crap a bug is still a bug it s just an excuse for a lazy game design its their game and their game engine if they have a limitation then they should overcome it for instance leave it as a normal part of the river as far as the game engine is concerned but prevent the ai and player armies to ever use it for any reason with appropriate measures and presto you have piece of impassable terrain that trade can go through devs did this stupid change all because they wanted for gate counties to have a purpose which they still don t have just like in other games in their franchise honestly this problem of non standard territories that their game engine can t handle persists in multiple games for many years now e g gates that can be starve sieged from one side in warhammer you d think they d fix it already anyway in my game the big looter army that starts in liangxian went through hulao pass like it was never there i was possible probably because they went attacking my army that was just beyond the gate on the edge of luoyang sandwiching them selves between my army and luoyang garrison on one side and hulao pass garisson on the other yet another game engine limitation buy the way that looter army doesn t make sense ether before 1 7 1 liangxian was part of luoyang commandery and you were supposed to attack that army with your beaten up imperial forces that don t replenish for which is fine to secure your first commandery as per mission but now its part of nanyang commandery beyond the mountain range that you don t need or want at all the aforementioned mission to secure 1 commandery that was supposed to compel you to go after them is given and finished at the same time by colonizing that useless trade port ca might as well just could have given the reward for free without this so called mission and because of that the looters are just another thing that doesn t have any purpose and by the way whose insane idea was to bombard the player with missions that are finished ether immediately or in first 5 turns or so followed by missions that are so far into the future that you have nether time nor incentive to finish before you a achieve victory condition if you can overlook all that then sure buy it as i said before the game is mostly decent and those kinds of annoyances don t kill the fun of most campaigns but still i would have asked for a refund if i didn t play as much time as i have before realizing the games many many flaws p s dear ca we all know that you are money hungry after all every corporation is but can you please finish your products before you start spamming dlcs or abandoning them for a sequel we re paying money for this crap its the least that we expect p p s i realize that game engine limitations can be hard and time consuming to deal with properly sometimes to the point of not being worth fixing for one particular product but they are no excuse for selling products with broken or nonsensical game mechanics for years p p p s whats up with that ai impostor liu hong who is a subject of emperor liu hong located on the south eastern sea shore is it historical or what
