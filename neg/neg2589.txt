2019 update december 2023the audio in this game has been a problem since day one and the devs have done nothing to fix it they just ignore it and act like it doesn t exist i remember asking them about it on a live stream in 2017 and they kicked me out right away six years later it s still a mess i played the game again after a long time and it was so obvious that the audio was broken i hunted an animal and let the dog track it down i was standing a few meters away from the dog and i turned 90 degrees to the left or right the dog would be on my left side but i would hear it from the right side and vice versa it s not my sound setup i checked the windows audio test and made sure the left and right channels were correct i tried this on three other machines including a steam deck and the same problem was there i used different headphones and speakers like airpods sennheiser hd280s sennheiser pxc550 some old skullcandy headset and my studio edifier monitors there is no doubt that the sound engine is still faulty you will hear animals as if they are right next to you but they are actually far away you will hear footsteps that you think are on your left side but they are actually on your right side and you will scare away the animal when you look the devs will not fix it they don t admit that it s an issue and i m sure that it s too hard for them to fix because of their lacklustre development skills the game is seven years old and it still can t run on high or ultra settings and get more than 100 fps on a 3090 ti that shows that they only care about making new content and fixing minor bugs update april 2022 do not buy this game even when it s on sale why developers do not listen they add useless updates that just wastes space and cater to the console version they do not fix bugs major game breaking bugs dlc keeps getting priority over bugs that are five years old still now they have added an internal dlc store that is 18gigs which provides zero benefit for steam customers proving where their interests are content over quality if you decide to ignore this and buy the game you will 90 have a chance of crashing after you waited hours for your massive download yes you download dlc that you do not own to inflate your game folder the devs do not care look at the reply from the devs below from 2 years ago they said several of those bugs should be addressed now it s a lie almost all of those bugs are still there and haven t been fixed in five years dev below i might not fully agree to your statement about dlc since the team working on bugs not necessarily work on expansions and vice verca that is bullshaait if that was true big fixes would have come down with dlc but all that is being released is more dlc and zero bug fixes again do not buy this game update from march 2022more bugs more what is a qa team now the map has no poi at all i can t fast travel or see any need zonesthe graphics performance have dropped significantly and the fsr implementation is so bad most software companies have a qa team and don t use their paying customers as testerspoi icons option for both map and world how stupid is this setting never in the life of gaming have i seen such a stupid ignorance towards gamers you turn poi off then it s off both on map and world and the poi icons are so damn massive that it can take up all the hud and completely ruin the experience how did this get past any forms of testing i have never in my life seen such stupidity before if this isn t proof of greed over quality i don t know what is below is my original review which i would have removed but i still don t recommend this game and my opinion stands dlc is of higher priority than bugs and other issues the map issues have been removed which is a better experience but wow is there still a lot of issues present one complete game breaker is how the audio completely falls over itself i just hear my own footsteps and anything in like a 5 meter radius from me i have to restart the game to fix it animals can still teleport vast distances now to even more impossible locations i m sad that i have to now just uninstall it and not bother to try again avalanche got my money i guess that matters more at least people can get it on sale now and not lose too much if they are willing to take a chance on this game ah well i was an early bird to this game and bought it in the first week played it for many hours as you can see but there was so many bugs from the beginning and the game was costly at the time after nearly 3 years now this game still has the same bugs opening the map is slow as hell how can they still not fix this the map loads poi s needzones etc slower than google maps on an smoke signal network the map never remembers the last position it was closed at map mission zones needs movement to display zoom or move map maps on multiplayer take nearly 3 seconds to open wtf animals still teleport vast distances or through mountains animals still do the moonwalk against a tree non stop animal transitions are still janky as hell and has never been smooth binoculars opened and then fast travelling still keeps the binocular hud on screen there is so many more bugs and they just don t get fixed i buy every dlc and hope the added patch would fix issues but expansive worlds are pretending now that they are like ea and don t give a and rather push out content instead of squashing bugs i felt especially frustrated now because they add more and more bugs with their features which costs me diamonds and this game already cost so much in patience the developers just ignore the playerbase and continues pushing out features and ignores fixes i m done i recommend not buying this game even patient people will get impatient with this mess now
