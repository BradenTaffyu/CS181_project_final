2020 early access review 7 years to alpha another of those forever in early access games they said they sold over 10 million copies so about 20 x 10 000 000 yet they cant even get some 3d models and terrain that dont look like its from 2002 ive tried this on and off thru the years and whenever i come back to it its always just as tedious and boring as it wasedit 1 0 full release finally after like 12 years they released it did you think that means its finished now ofc not its still a half baked alpha half the stretch goals from the kickstarter campaign are still not in the game what is there is rather shallow or even pointless the rescource hogging voxel terrain they do nothing with it its just there but you can mine and stuff why theres nothing down below theres no end game theres no purpose other than surviving wich is quite frankly a piece of cake after 2 days ingame the loot is boring the ai is dumb the animation and hitboxes a mess world is empty and dead no pun intended the music is terrible yet they force an ad on u for the soundtrack every time you start the game ads in paid products its fun for a little while but once u realize how shallow and pointless it all is it quickly gets stale
