2018 while i do enjoy racing in the nascar owned series there are some things i don t like about iracing the first thing i don t like is iracing s business model i m okay with paying for a year s membership but i m not okay with having to make 100 purchases on cars tracks setups etc i feel like the iracing staff are really greedy and want to force you to have to pay for content to keep racing in the game i had to buy all of the nascar owned cars and tracks and the total was about 400 to 500 in short iracing s business model is a rip off the second thing i don t like is the tedious grinding that you have to do in order to increase your license class i enjoy racing in all of the nascar owned series but i really hate having to do so many races to get my safety rating up to 4 00 or higher to be promoted to the next class the biggest problem with the grinding is that if you re in a wreck you lose safety rating if you re in a chain of wrecks it literally destroys your chances of being promoted you then have to rebuild what you lost for safety rating but if you just don t have the luck then oh boy the third thing i don t like is that some of the series are completely worthless nobody s racing in the silver crown cars not a lot of people are racing in the whelen modifieds which upsets me not too many people are racing in the late models and super late models the series that have fixed setup usually attract lots of drivers and some of those series should have a fixed setup series cough sk modifieds and whelen modifieds the fourth thing i don t like is that you have to buy an artwork software program like adobe photoshop to download the car templates to create your own paint schemes if you re okay with paying 24 a year for trading paints pro it s all good but you do have limited paint patterns you can use with adobe photoshop or other artwork software programs you can do better i chose the trading paints pro over adobe photoshop because adobe is greedy there are things about iracing that i do like i really enjoy making paint schemes it s lots of fun and i have crazy ideas i can show in the trading paints showroom the racing is usually fun but mostly it s only one groove racing i really wish that iracing would improve the driving physics to allow for multi groove racing you can make friends or enemies in iracing i m doing live streams on iracing and people seem to enjoy watching my live streams unfortunately this is the only nascar sim racer out there nascar heat 2 is too arcadey for me i don t really recommend this game for people who want to not spend too much money on iracing i do recommend this game for the hardcore racers who are willing to spend a lot of money on the game
