2021 ca abandoned the game before their chapter packs even reached the actual three kingdoms there are still major bugs in the game especially in the different chapters adding to that cao cao and yuan shao got a nice update with fates divided yet liu bei and the sun clan are stuck with their release mecahnics liu bei s unique unit are the yi archers they are from the province that would form part of the kingdom of shu which will probably never happen in it s historical form in the game because we don t have a starting date for the actual three kingdoms and therefore the three kingdoms can be anything the northern area is still missing the northern barbarians we don t have chibi red cliffs nor the three kingdoms had ca called it quits after dlcs for the northern barbarians chibi and a start date early in the three kingdoms especially with zhang liao at his height then they would ve given this game a worthy end this way however they are leaving it in the dirt it s a good game but ca killed it off way to soon
