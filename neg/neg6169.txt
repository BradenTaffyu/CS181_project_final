it s clear the team that made this game had a great understanding of the 40k lore like all owlcat products it shows a great love for what makes 40k what it is while also providing lore friendly options for newcomers of the setting to ease into the grim darkness of the 41st millennium the characters are all introduced in great fashion and feel well fleshed out in chapter 1 if the whole game played like chapter one this would be a very different review sadly in the grim darkness of the 3rd millennium there is only unfinished products owlcat games have always been buggy a byproduct of it s engine and scale toybox is almost mandatory to ensure the average player isn t locked out of a rp moment or even an entire save file due to this buggyness i openly forgave this in kingmaker and wotr two other owlcat games but i can no longer condone it as being part of the studios quarks this is the 3rd game of this scale you ve released and it feels like the studio is rushing faster and faster normally i d expect a studio to get better with each game released but it feels like owlcat is sliding the opposite direction each chapter comes with more and more glaring issues many of which are fixable via 3rd party software toybox but each time you ll be breaking your own immersion to do so i m not going to nitpick at the system itself rogue trader that is there are flaws but to sit and point at them is like complaining about the ac not working in a car that won t even start i wish i could nitpick but to do so implies a state of playability that simply isn t here my final straw was in chapter 4 a recurring theme if you read other reviews when you are presented a task this task is a good thing a thing that both as a player and in character i really wanted to do this is a main story mission and it s clear the game requires me to do this to continue the story the only option i m allowed to select in dialogue is to spit in the dudes face and refuse so i reload mess around with the options same outcome now mind you the quest giver will force you to do it but it s a huge immersion break regardless so i look it up online turns out iconoclast the most common path taken dialogue for accepting the quest was as far as data mining can turn up never implemented in a pivotal story quest the only way for me to accept the quest in a positive way was to dig around toybox for 35 minutes to set individual flags then reset my character to be dogmatic instead of iconoclast and at that point i realized there was no reason to spend time on this when i ve already spent money for someone else to have qa d what should ve been a basic function the front 1 3rd of this game is a treat to any 40k fan but much like it s setting and comparing the 30th and 41st era s of humanity it only serves to highlight what the game could have been and what we have lost
