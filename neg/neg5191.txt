2016 this makes me wish there was an inbetween for reccomendationsit is a great game and a breath of fresh air for total war games however the dlc they keep chucking out for 10 17 is completly abhorrent i mean come on 3 for blood effects not to mention the base game has 4 factions 4 out of the numerous factions in the warhammer universe that ca is more than most likely going to keep pumping out for 15 a faction hopefully ca sees how far it is alienating it s fanbase and change their policy in shortgreat game terrible dlc marketing
