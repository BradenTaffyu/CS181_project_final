2018 the good combat is fun and engaging air and ground forces are unique and interesting when battles go well balanced teams the game is very exciting and rewarding there are game modes for everyone the game is split up in arcade battles for new players realistic battles for veteran players and people looking for more authentic vehicle characteristics and simulator battles for experianced players looking for a challange the bad the grind for better machinery gets old pretty quick arcade battle hold the majority of the player base causing the game to feel a little empty at higher skill game modes if a team is loosing in a realistic air battle but has slightly more ground units alive on the map that player just flees from battle by flying off to the very far edge of the map where no one can find them or if they have a fast plane they just outrun all the other players and climb away from battle resulting in a 30 minute long game of hide and seek where no one wins just because the losing player was salty about losing this issue doesn t happen all the time but it happens way too often the ugly battles can be short and unfufilling some end in just 5 to 10 minutes spawn camping is often a problem in battles that allow respawning bombers are almost useless in realistic air battle unless you cheese the enemy team with a bunch of bombers ending the match early robbing players on both teams of gameplay and leaving a lot of players upset realistic battles arcade battles single missions dynamic campagins and simulator battles all have not been changed or really updated in many years plaguing battles with balance gameplay issues that have never been resolved and likley never will be some players myself included are concerned that gaijin cares far more about making money than making a beter game every major patch just adds new content instead of fixing outdated game modes map rotation sometimes doesn t seem to exist forcing you to play on the same map 10 or more times in a row final thoughts honestly warthunder holds a very close place in my heart but i can t reccomend it it has too many small issues that while not enought to keep new players from trying out the game have many older players leave the game in disgust gaijin keeps adding content to keep players interested which on its own isnt a bad thing but needs iron out the rinkles that have been in the game for many years now eventually warthunder becomes exausting if you haven t played but really want to dont spend a single dollar on this game until you have played for at least 200 to 300 hours then see how you feel i want to love warthunder but it still needs work it might never recieve tldr don t play until the game gets fixed its a not a bad game but has had issues for many years that need to be fixed
