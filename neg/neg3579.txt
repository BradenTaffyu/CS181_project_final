2023 product received for free early access review wildcard is ark sad to not recommend i can no longer blindly support this dumpster fire of a company i put in over 1k hours on ase disregarding how broken it was just to get baited in to a fixed game sad day 1 unstable servers some things never change its still as cancerous as ase rollbacks crashes constant lag broken tame mechanics fixing one thing while breaking another etc 2 arguably the worst dev team in history wildcard is notorious for cutting their nose off in spite of their face they seem to care little to none for the community striking under the table deals to profit more while damaging the community never listens to the community takes ages to respond to any ticket and even then is a piss poor effort wildcard is completely out of touch with the community they do the bare minimum and call it a good day they have no organization no priorities no urgency on top of that they lie without blinking i can go on all day about the dev team and why you should avoid anything they touch but i wont only if another company any other company had ark it would be game of the year thats my rant the game has so much potential but is held back by a dev team that doesn t give a damn
