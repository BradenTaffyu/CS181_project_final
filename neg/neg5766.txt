2014 please for the love of god do not buy this game it depresses me to think how hyped i was for the release of the sequal to one in my opinoin the best games ever made sadly ca did not deliver at all even after how disapointed i was initally i thought to myself oh come on i have to give it a good solid shot so i did 60 hours later i feel embarrassed to be a total war fan i feel bad recommending the game to my friends because we couldn t even complete a single online match because of all the desyncs all the tech demos pre alpha gameplay is not in the full game please do not be mislead by the carthage demo that was uploaded back in 2012 the game looks nothing like that and the scale is nowhere near that large with less than half the amount of units and ships present in the real game the graphics are nothing like what you expect from the screenshots and frankly i can t believe it s legal even having them on the steam store page because they are completely misleading please invest your money into europa universalis iv or crusader kings ii games which are developed by are far more competent studio and will offer you 100 s of hours of entertainment a fraction of the price of rome ii if you grab them in a sale
