2019 you might be better off never setting your foot into this game in the first place if you are browsing the store now you might be too late for the show i ll explain why i think of it this way released in 2013 6 years ago as of writing this the game has been continuously developing and evolving which per se is great the current game is vastly different from what it was many years ago it can be said that with the dlcs and patches at some point along the journey the game became eu5 then with more dlc and changes it became eu6 however instead of releasing an entirely new next game they ve continuously pumped out patches and dlcs and piled them on top of the existing game now the current game with all its features behind dlc is about 450 cad in a sense eu4 was 50 ish bucks 6 years ago now the eu4 with updated features but without dlc content is still 50 ish bucks which is still more like eu5 with all the dlc contents which turns the game into more of a eu6 is 450 chances are you ll be hard split between spending hundreds of dollars in a single game which you may or may not enjoy for 2000 hours or so and spending that money you can buy perhaps 8 to 10 other games that may give you more variety and hours often the recommendation is to buy the dlcs are on sale but other games go on sale as well this made it very difficult for me to choose the dlcs to extend the life of this game for me and miss out on other games unless you spend enough money to do both you d probably experience this issue as well that said newer players and the casuals like me would never get to experience the latest eu4 the latest version became unreasonable to attain so if you for some reason decide to buy this game with dlcs omitted know that that s probably where you d stay i ve realized that at some point i ve stopped watching youtube videos or reading posts about eu4 what i had was no longer same as what those dedicated core fans played i was playing eu5 they were playing eu6 or 7 rants about the dlc costs are constant and abundant here and i m sure others are tired of seeing another one again yes the game itself is fun to the point of being addictive even without all the dlcs however this is not a pointless whine if you are fine with that go ahead and purchase the game however know that you ll always be aware of the features locked behind the dlc and the latest and the fullest game would be 450 or more as additional dlcs get released also keep in mind that with the same amount of money you can probably buy up to 10 or 12 other games with great reviews that said with all this headache even after admitting that even the base game is great my recommendation is to not set your foot into this franchise at this point the ship has sailed too far out to the sea at the very least try the extreme edition which no longer became fitting of extreme and see if you want to spend more money on a single game instead of buying another full game had the developers stopped releasing patches and dlcs and wrapped up eu4 at some point and released eu5 it may have been easier for the newcomers to get the full game in a sense the newcomers are forced to buy all the previous versions in order to get the full game this multi year ongoing development and trails of dlc style of system is great for the old fans but not for the newcomers
