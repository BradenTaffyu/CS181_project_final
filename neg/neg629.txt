2018 pros story is better than in 1 combat is mostly pleasant dialogues are voicedcons bugs bugs and more bugs multiplayer is an afterthought armor system a certain patch practically ruined combatin depth i want to say that i love this game but it is a horrible abusive love hate relationship i m very curious how many people that leave positive reviews finished this game because the further you go the worse it gets but let s start with the beginning the first 1 4 of this game is amazing it has huge variety in the ways you can do your quests very few bugs pretty good story all around this part of the game deserves all the praise divinity gets the next 1 2 of this game is kinda meh the worst part about it is the sheer amount of unfinished unsatisfying side quests quests that can be failed simply because there is no let s talk about it later option in the dialogue for you to think things through quests that fail without any warning if you go through other quests before finishing them plus the sheer amount of crowd control your enemies get at this point combined with crappy loot you probably still have makes combat much less fun and finally the last 1 4 of this game is honestly just a buggy mess including the final battle which is the most frustrating thing i ve ever encountered in this game without spoiling anything there is a place during the final battle that literally just has invisible walls on the field it makes no sense and ruins your ability to position yourself without teleport and if you do teleport you can cheese your way out of this fight by teleporting to the other side of the invisible wall while enemies run around this is dumb combine it with the fact that some enemies can one shot you and i m talking about normal difficulty here btw the character animations bug out enemies get stuck in the columns etc and while we are on the topic of endgame let me talk about multiplayer quickly you know in the first one both characters had something to say in the dialogue and any player could sway the npc his way well not here if you are talking to somebody the other players have absolutely 0 control over how the dialogue goes they can pick a comment after it like yeah i support you or nah i don t agree but that doesn t make any difference there is no morality or stat changes based on it and of course anyone has to live with the choices you ve made so what does it have to do with endgame well over the course of our multiplayer game i was tasked with talking to most npc because i had the best stats for it except before the final fight where despite me coming to the npc we needed to talk to they started talking to the other player and trust me we tried to force them to talk to me reloading multiple times to try and engage them differently however while talking to that player who was playing a male character the npc constantly addressed him as a female and i was playing one this seriously ruined any immersion we had left after numerous bugs and broken quests we encountered on the way there there are a few other fantastic examples of quests that frustrated us a lot but i can not talk about them without spoilers so spoilers skip it if you don t want any so there s a quest about a wedding the groom is being an who wants bride s riches but she doesn t know about it you can find his diary where he explains all his plans can you give it to her nope can you give it to her parents nope you can however confront him about it ok let s talk he tells you that he wants your help in killing the bride s father if you say no that s it the quest doesn t finish but you can do absolutely nothing else if you talk to father nothing bride nothing if you talk to the groom again nothing you can t change your mind to progress this quest turns out the way you finish it is accept the murder and then go about betraying the groom if you want yay variety facepalm there is another quest that involves a person who killed his master you can figure it out by talking to master s spirit and the person himself is sitting in the tavern talking about how he loves the stew a lot you can promise his master s spirit to deal with him logically the first thing that we thought about is poison the stew right makes sense you can do it in the crafting menu you can give him the stew great not great it has absolutely no effect on him attacking him is also a bad idea because it turns everybody in the town hostile to you turns out you must find a special poison that is not lethal but will make him run to the toilet where you ll deal with him and that s the only solution what the moving on here s how crowd control works in this game every character and enemy has physical armor and magical armor until this armor is 0 no crowd control of appropriate type works on them you can love this system or hate it doesn t matter it s how it works or at least it is how it used to work until one patch changed the single crowd control spell the spell is provoke and it does what you may expect taunts the target so it automatically attacks the one who used it and it ignores armor now imagine that the enemy taunted your whole party and you are now stuck watching them fight automatically and you could not prevent it sounds like fun to you yet wait there s more normally in rpg taunt skills make your characters use auto attacks and that s it which sure can be annoying for mages but it doesn t ruin the combat completely but no not in divinity here the taunted character not only uses skills which i remind you go on lengthy cooldowns and can cost source which is a semi limited resource but also uses items from your inventory your rare and expensive potions grenades magical arrows scrolls my character ate all my tea leaves which i was saving for the final battle and drank the super limited quest potion that again i was saving for the occasion after which she used some of my best skills randomly it s ai it is stupid and when i finally got control back i had a mage with all the skills on cooldown all my rare items used and nothing to do but auto attack or reload the save who the thought this was a good idea oh and to add insult to injury my character s summon used to have provoke by default as well guess what after the patch they removed it great job guys great job overall this game is fine it has nice tactical combat minus provoke mostly interesting dialogue at least for the one who initiates it and it looks very good with it s various elemental effects and armors but this game is just that ok it doesn t deserve any goty titles it doesn t deserve all the praise it gets it s not some rpg messiah it s buggy it has horrible balance issues it is a fairly bad experience for your multiplayer partners or for you whoever doesn t get to experience dialogues it has tons of unfinished quests or quests that just don t make any sense the more you play this game the more it feels like early access that needs a lot of polish to be good unfortunately i haven t seen it patched in a very long time 2 months at the time of this review it seems like the developers decided that it s good enough whatever well it s not i m sorry but it is not good enough
