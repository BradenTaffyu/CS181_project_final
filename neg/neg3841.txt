2017 early access review forever early access now as you can see i have played this game a ton and i did enjoy my time with it otherwise i would not have played so long so why don t i recommend it after so much playtime you wonder well i m only doing this because this game does have the potential to be very good but in it s current state it is not complete and if you look at the previous year of updates it does not look like it will be for another 2 years to give some insight into why you simply have to look at the past updates the large majority are graphical or assets building blocks perk systems and objects however they do not aim to improve or fix actual gameplay features an example would be the minibike the only mode of faster transport which was introduced nearly 2 years ago yet still they will fall through the floor and glitch out in multiplayer all the time an item that does take some time to gather materials for and changes the game allowing you to range further away a feature implemented 2 years ago that you still cannot use due to wonky code another major flaw is it s combat which is clunky and unrefined and the zombies lack in variation and animations the game often spawning in 5 10 identical zombies that all run move and attack the same and dropping out of thin air just yards infront of you basically they keep adding things without fixing or improving any previous problems so i recommend not buying this yet because i think you should get a better experience when you play this for the first time than going into it right now
