2021 early access review this is a neutral review its a fun game with a lot of depth survival crafting exploring and best of all co op pve i really really want to get this going again but i have recently put in 40 hours of gameplay a few of it was to try and get a server up and running and the multiplayer aspect is not good its not nice to get bitten just because you or the zed rubber band or if some map chunks did not load or you try and direct your co op partners but what you see and what they see is not the same not to talk about the connection issues to a self hosting or provider hosting server i really hope that this will improve but this game has been available for a long time single player is very good
