2022 the more i play the game the more i also hated it overall it s pretty damn fun while you re still discovering it but after beating it like once or twice it frankly became a bit too frustrating for me and the progress also goes into a slog after unlocking a decent chunk of gear i feel like the color system is a bit too strict especially with the way the mutations are handled and you end up going for the optimal builds instead of actually experimenting with other stuff melee options seem way inferior compared to the ranged ones and the mutations usually benefit very specific playstyles the weapon skill and enemy variation is good for sure although it can actually make your runs worse as the game s rng rolls you with the most gimmicky items and certain enemy types can get especially annoying with near instant detection and projectiles hitting through the walls i ve also heard that the developers constantly and dramatically change the balance of the game which seems pretty off even though it s admirable that they support it for so long a lot of the issues i mentioned could be improved using the custom mode though i can t help but think of it as something of a placebo the art design and soundtrack are very high quality too either way if steam had neutral reviews that s the one i d give to this game but with how the situation is now i ll give the game a negative one and take a break from it i might return later to check the rest of the content and possibly the custom mode although is still left a bitter taste after a promising 40 something hours
