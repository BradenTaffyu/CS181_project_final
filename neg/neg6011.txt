2018 when i first bought eu4 i had a bunch of fun for first 70 hours or so trying out each nation making a trade empire as portugal the furthest i have got into a game at this point i suck at finishing games yet as i got further and further in i realised that many key features have been ripped out of the game to force others to purchase dlc later the common sense dlc is the perfect example of this and its name is rather ironic too it s common sense to have these features in the base game you cannot increase development of your provinces without extremely rare and completely random events without this dlc to construct additional buildings you must have higher development i enjoyed this game until paradox once again flailed their greedy appendage in my face whilst taunting buy my dlc if you don t want to feel that this full priced game is a demo if i had the option to refund games no matter how long i have owned them or played them i would refund all the paradox games i own and their dlcs out of spite
