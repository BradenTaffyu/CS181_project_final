2020 early access review this is a hard review to write because i do enjoy elements of this game and the overall concept was fun and exciting when it was first released in early access way back in 2013 i ve owned and played this game since december 2014 i ve been playing since a10 of the game just to put this into perspective so that my review makes sense this game which is still in alpha is almost 7 years old in a few months for 6 of those 7 years i have been a fan of the potential of this game in the early years the formula was simple start with nothing craft tools build bases survive zombie encounters the game had bugs glitches and other issues but i ll leave those alone as that s expected what ruins this game for me are the following in no particular order 1 the leveling rpg element of the game has been constantly fiddled with to the point in a19 that it has progressively turned into a chore it s not fun it excludes players who do not have hours per day to invest in playing the game through each update the devs seem to have made it a priority to piss off players with ridiculous skill tree grinds 2 the schematics skills in the game can be advanced purely by grinding them out through xp or reading books and schematics these are generally fine but the developers can t seem the leave this feature alone without ever addressing a major issue that s been with the game forever you can burn books and schematics by reading the same ones repeatedly this literally does nothing for your character save for a few xp points what s most obnoxious about it is constantly having to check your player stats to see which ones you have read or haven t read for schematics you can t even check this you have to simply look up recipes in your personal inventory or the work stations and see which ones are locked it s a mess it s never been fixed it s only been messed with to the point where it got so bad the devs made them expire at one point to force you to keep finding and reading the same ones until you leveled up high enough to just know them that players essentially forced the devs to go back to the original mechanism 3 optimization it needs to be stated again that this game is almost 7 years old i run an i9 9900k paired with an rtx 2080 super playing on a 1920x1080 display maxed out i m lucky if the game runs at 80fps during horde nights which increase in scale as the player levels up the frame drops are easily in the low 20 s it essentially becomes unplayable they ve chosen to focus 7 years of development on assets content tweaks bug fixes which is acceptable and constant gameplay meddling where stuff isn t broken instead of optimizing the game the graphics aren t at all anything special not even by 2013 standards there s no reason for this game to run like other than laziness and or lack of interest in optimization 4 stability this game runs rampant with instability issues every patch seems to fix some issues or not fix listed issues that say fixed or introduce entirely new issues that we must wait patiently to be patched in order to enjoy the next update again 7 years in alpha 7 years of community testing and feedback the early access excuse isn t acceptable at this point 5 gameplay meddling it used to be fun and interesting building bases and creating ways to survive horde night throughout that last four or five updates it s just gotten worse bases are utterly pointless as the time and resources it takes to build anything by day 7 and the horde nights that follow result in structures that might as well be made out of paper most annoying is that i ve always seen the traders in the game as examples of what a truly fortified position should look like while i understand that horde night is intended to keep the game intense and interesting and give the player a true sense of purpose and survival what the prevailing emotion is for me is that the devs are sitting back like no matter what they build let s with them let s destroy their bases with impossibly vicious ai that tears through concrete with flesh and bone like it s cardboard it s not fun it s just plain stupid and removes the fun and satisfaction of building what would truly be a survivable compound in real life it makes the player s efforts worthless and rewards them with nothing for taking the time to think out and build a defensible position the only way i have found to make horde night manageable and entertaining is to turn on creative mode and lay turrets with 360 degrees of coverage cheating the ammo in to keep them fed without them your base is pointless 6 structural integrity i m a mechanical engineer so physics and structural mechanics are like second nature to me this game has had very fundamentally flawed structural physics from the beginning and it continues to this day i commend the effort to add it to a game like this but if you can t do it right or at least well enough to be believable it s best not to do it at all gussets angled supports between a vertical pillar and horizontal beam are particularly broken you can build a pillar extend out horizontally with blocks until collapse then rebuild with a single wedge block as a gusset and get a longer horizontal beam great now logically the physical laws that govern a gusset should dictate that if you expand that diagonal structure between your column and beam you should be able to also expand your horizontal support not in this game a 10 block long gusset has the exact same effect as a single wedge in the corner of your column and beam worse you also have to account for caves or voids under ground even in areas where no actual support is needed the way the physics in this game functions is that any void directly impacts the structural stability of all the blocks above it even if they are adequately laterally supported it doesn t make any sense 7 lastly is time in the beginning time wasn t an issue as tfp was small consisting of three guys with day jobs that had a fun idea and plan to make a game now they ve have over 25 full and part time employees since 2018 and still have not released a final product the game isn t even in beta yet people the problem that plagues these early access games and why i can t recommend them in good consciousness is because these indie developers have grown accustomed to taking people s money up front delivering spoon fulls of sub par product under the guise of early access and the player base has become complacent and accepting of this practice this game has sold over 2 5 million copies as of 2018 at 25 a copy that s 62 5 million usd as of 2020 it s nearly 10 million copies that s 250 million usd where is all of this money going the average 7 days to die team member has over 14 years of experience in game and software development working with or for many aaa video game companies this comes from their original kickstarter why am i expected to accept a 7 year old alpha as a fair exchange for my money with aaa experts spending 7 years on an alpha why am i expected to accept waiting for a final product that i will have long gotten bored of and moved on from in a 7 year time frame before ever seeing a finished release the promise of a good game to me was worth 25 00 back in 2014 today the guarantee of a never finished poorly optimized constantly messed with glitchy old looking mess for new players is not worth 25 00 yes i have fun in the game for what it is yes i still find general entertainment value in it no i cannot recommend spending money on it today these guys have a quarter billion dollars from people buying an alpha i ll recommend this title when it s finished
