2019 the best game in the series marred by iaps and lootboxes let me start off by admitting that yes i bought the game at the sale price of 1 that doesn t change the fact that the base price of the game is by a long shot not worth it that is not to say the game itself is bad rather it s the shady practices the company is pulling off and apparently rather successfully according to ratings that is the issue i ll format my review in the form of the good the bad and the ugly i m starting with the good because i really do feel like this game could be the best the series has ever seen which is saying something after the great experience that was btd5 the good the soundtrack is a step up from btd5 with more variety and less samey tracks though btd5 had higher highs for me the sound design is equally an improvement as it s less grating when there are thousands of bloons making noise leads in particular are less ear grating when darts hit them i found the voice acting for heroes to be average there s charm to it but it can wear out its welcome the graphics are nice i ll always prefer 2d over 3d any day but since the gameplay actually makes use of the 3d aspect i ll give it a pass plus that s more a subjective opinion and from an objective point it s clear a lot of effort went into the look of the game definitely more than bmc i ll miss the faithful style btd5 had but i ll still admit the new coat of paint does look good the gameplay is i cannot stress enough the best it s ever been while not outright eclipsing btd5 it s definitely an upgrade the game makes use of the 3d graphics by making obstacles block your path blinding monkeys to what s behind them and stopping projectiles that stray into them some of which you can remove at a cost this makes maps themselves much deeper than in btd5 on top of all this each map difficulty also has extra challenges you unlock after beating their base mode with classics like impoppable and deflation appearing and new challenges like primary only and the infamous chimps being added as well tower upgrading is also deeper than it was in btd5 easily before you had 2 paths to choose from and even if you picked one you could get a bit of the other now there are 3 whole paths for each tower so choosing both your primary and your secondary path are important decisions in addition for each tower there s a special 5th tier upgrade of which you may only have one for each path per tower while some are more useful than others these powerful upgrades can single handedly take on some of the best bloons with the humble dart monkey able to gun down a line of bfbs with a 0 2 5 crossbow master path the tricky part is where to place these towers as their limited nature makes this all the more important towers also have individual exp ratings to unlock these upgrades rewarding learning how to use each tower there are also insta monkeys you can earn which replace btd5 s free towers and are now stored separately so that you can stockpile them efficiently the insta monkeys can also come pre upgraded giving you an early edge in hard maps finally there are new hero monkeys that upgrade themselves automatically no cash necessary besides their fairly cheap initial cost bloons haven t changed a lot from btd5 though it maintains the vast improvements the previous game had regrows are still a threat and the new camo system is maintained one new sub type was added however fortified this new type only has a significant effect on certain bloons namely leads ceramics and the various moab class doubling their health while not quite as impactful as regrow or camo as properties it s useful for keeping lag down and for making the tough balloons sponge some extra hits there are also a few new faces purple bloons are essentially the glass bloons from super monkey 2 being immune to energy based attacks such as fire there s also the ddt the infamous moab class introduced in the bloons monkey city spin off and finally finding its way to the main series this nasty thing separates itself by being the only moab class to have the camo property as well as the lead and black properties and pink bloon speed just to make your day worse finally there s the bad which stops for absolutely nothing and sponges hits for days and guess what it contains all the new variety excels at keeping you on your toes and making sure your defenses are tight the bad there have been a few key feature removals from btd5 the extreme difficulty category for tracks has been removed when exp is more valuable than ever thanks to monkey knowledge points being earned through leveling the monkey money upgrades from btd5 have been entirely removed you can no longer purchase things like extended range for villages or double cash mode leaving monkey money to not really be good for much other than for powerups which are essentially the replacement for agents but with less personality and no pro versions while the monkey knowledge system which replaces the token system in btd5 isn t inherently bad and is far more in depth than tokens ever were it s disappointing that you can t trade in monkey money for knowledge like you could tokens tower specialty buildings are also gone so you can t invest in your favorite tower any more which also means one less use for monkey money btd6 also at times feels noticeably like a port of a mobile game there s times where the mouse scroll barely works and you have to drag your mouse like you would drag on a touch screen notably with the tower unlock screen in the early game or occasionally you do something and it accidentally sets off a touch screen control there needs to be a checkbox for that this also leads into the next part a bit the ugly part of the whole feeling like a mobile game bit is the in game store a game having dlc is one thing but a full price game having a full fledged iap store on a desktop release is another you can t use monkey money to buy knowledge but you know what you can use real world money how much does it cost a dollar per point and since it takes around 70 points to fill out your knowledge equates to about 70 if you paid real world money to fill it out not saying that this is necessary but it s absolutely overpriced and shouldn t be in a desktop release you can also buy monkey money with the base price being 2 for every thousand the highest tier of monkey money purchase costs around 50 at original time of writing which is five times the base price of the game there s also double cash which can now only be unlocked with 20 in the store did i mention this game has lootboxes yep the insta monkeys i mentioned earlier are also included in purchasable lootboxes while it s hardly necessary ninja kiwi dipping their toes into these awful business practices terrifies me powers can also be bought through a lootbox though thankfully you can purchase them with monkey money as well the same cannot be said for insta monkeys in typical lootbox fashion there are common uncommon rare and legendary insta monkeys rated by their upgrade tier thankfully these are not required to play the game but the business practices that ninja kiwi is attempting here are absolutely awful and i cannot in good conscience support the inclusion of lootboxes and iaps in a full price desktop game i would rather they increase the base price than have this awful mobile store if you re going to buy it get it on sale don t support this also stop telling me the iaps aren t necessary i know that read the f ing review
