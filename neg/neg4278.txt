2019 this game is not for everyone kley is an amazing developer and this game is really well made however it is just not fun for me and is overly complicated the look of the game give it a fun adventure vibe like dont starve or rimworld but the actual game is like factorio it is all about setting up complicated system to make your colony work and it can be really frustrating also the lack of external challenges such as invading monsters raiders whatever make it again not interesting to me you are only going up agaisnt yourself and if you can make things work and ofcourse there will be an optimal way to do things that you can just copy paste into every game it is not a bad game it will just not be fun for certain people and the negative review serves to highlight it
