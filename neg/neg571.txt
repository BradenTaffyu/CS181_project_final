2021 let me preface this by saying i have very mixed feelings about this game there is a lot to like about it and it s one of those games that makes me wish steam had a 3rd option between thumbs up down but the sad fact is that of my 150 hours spent with the game i enjoyed a minority of them i ll start with the good the story and characters are significantly more compelling than they were in dos1 the companion characters in particular are very strong and each have their own story arcs that are well written and satisfying the voice acting is fantastic the graphics are vibrant and sharp and the game features some very strong world building even if is a little too everything and everyone is terrible for my tastes at times the turn based combat which i loved in dos1 is still mostly intact albeit with some changes that i didn t love that i ll get into later my overarching issue with the game is that it is an immense timesink that treads into deeply un fun territory with great frequency for instance there is a tremendous amount of loot churn you will have a huge inventory full of stuff you ll never use i found near zero use for crafting and you ll spend a ton of time picking up equipment looking through it comparing it to old equipment selling it and buying new stuff there is so much junk to pick up in this game that by the end i had 100 000 gold nothing to spend it on and a massive inventory still full of unsold crud however all that inventory management pales in comparison to the timesink that is the combat the combat system has been modified from dos1 to add the concept of independent magic and physical armors that need to be worn down before status effects will take hold it becomes apparent after some time that the most effective tactic by far is to build a party of specialized dps monsters who can kill enemy armor as fast as possible and then start stealing turns via stun knockdown charm effects there are a ton of status effects and i had to spend significant time googling what they all meant and in what ways they combine i had other minor objections to the combat system like the fact that almost every character has an ability that allows them to leap huge distances which makes things feel less tactical but the real problem is the way larian uses the system to quote r p mcmurphy larian likes a rigged game there are frequent massive difficulty spikes often even ordinary battles are set up with the odds stacked against the player significantly most fights take a very long time to complete and take multiple attempts as you learn the surprises the battle has in store for you and pregame and optimize your approach accordingly now i assume some people enjoy this but i found it to be a time consuming slog furthermore this absolutely destroyed the game from a role playing perspective for me it didn t feel like good role playing to so frequently require foreknowledge of an encounter in order to best it eventually the fights became so all consuming that i was no longer making the character and story choices i wanted but simply googling which choices would give me the most exp the best loot or would make the fights easier the game can be extraordinarily player unfriendly at times there is no pause button so if you are on fire at the end of a fight the game will return to real time and your character will continue burning and taking damage you will be ambushed a ton click the wrong dialogue option ambush wander into the wrong section of the map ambush save scumming is practically a necessity it was a huge issue for me in act 2 which is the game s longest act you are given freedom to roam a large map and pick up several quests with no real indication of the correct order to do them in this leads to a massive time consuming trial and error fest wander to different parts of the map try to do a quest get slaughtered because you re underpowered for that area then try again somewhere else this once again necessitated more time on google and the steam forums to figure out what order to do things in dos2 is a well made game with a lot of positives and if you re a min maxer or git gudder it s probably a real treat but i can t help feel like only about a third of my time spent playing it was actually fun
