2019 for me there is just to many layers of rng involved in this game unlike an ftl or nuclear throne there isn t much you can do to overcome not having the correct cards in your deck even in situations where you have the correct cards there is always the chance they will be drawn in an incorrect manner from your deck to top it off there are certain relic s that are absolutely a must have to beat the final boss after you get an understanding of the classes and the different builds that are viable for an end game run you realize in the end you are playing slots
