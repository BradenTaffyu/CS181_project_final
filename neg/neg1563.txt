2022 early access review just play warband its better in every feasible way grand total of 10 years in development and all we got is a shallow mass of so called sandbox it might feel entertaining for 7 or so hours but after that there is nothing left except to paint the map with your colour of choice don t buy this game it doesn t worth your time let alone money
