2016 this hurts me i have been playing civ since an 11 year old me picked up civ iii complete and lost almost all of his free time to it but this must be said in its current state unless you are a die hard civ fan i would wait for a sale or stick to a modded civ v complete good districts at least from an imersion standpoint the mechanic makes the map feel a little more alive as everything isn t crammed into a single tile it helps paint a picture of large urban centers with smaller towns scattered around the map also since districts gain bonuses from each other natural wonders improvements and terrain features it can be a lot of fun to plot out your cities to ensure maximum effeciency tall play is encouraged with districts as well factories for example can boost the production for all cities within a certain radius not just the city they are attached to overall districts are a fun addition to the game art this is subjective some hate it some love it and i am in the latter category i like how the fog of war looks like an old map it s a nice upgrade from the old clouds of yesteryear i don t mind the leader animations and i think some are quite nice adorable victoria s denouncement animation it is adorable watch it barbarians actually a threat rather than a nuisance though perhaps they are too good for the civ ai to handle see the bad section music really good especially that intro menu theme don t know if it will win a grammy like baba yetu did but it is still really beautiful song bad the ai my gods the ai do not expect to have any meaningful relationships other than war at this point in the game i have had several games where i encounter a civ only for them to break the game s own diplomatic rules and declare wars on me for no conceivable reason it wasn t even surprise wars it was full blown formal wars and we had just met a turn ago good luck to you if the ai will even prosecute said war sometimes they don t produce a single unit other times they flood your lands with units but stand before your foritifed cities in wonder as you plink away at them sometimes the ai gets wiped by barbarians this mess will hopefully be improved with patches but this was not a good foot to set off on warmongering and causus belli an awesome idea courtesy of our friends over at paradox if you have a good reason to declare war religious reasons liberation ally needs help state that reason when you declare war and warmonger penalties are reduced right wrong even if you have every reason to declare war reclaim your original capitol and you are in the right expect to have the entire world turn their backs on you or declare war on you in turn while i haven t encountered it yet i am willing to bet that even if you enter a joint war with your ally they will denounce you as a warmonger even though they dragged you into the war diplomacy let s ignore the infinite warmongering ai for now while the agenda system works in theory there are several things that you need to do to win that will cause the ai to throw a hissy fit settle on a different continent than victoria angry england have one less unit than cleopatra pissed off egypt declare war on someone sharing theodore s continent american denouncement sumeria harassing city states and you want in on the fun gilgamesh obviously thinks that you are the true warmonger the fact that each leader also has a hidden agenda that you can t see without a rather large investment is a monkey wrench in the works that the diplomacy system can ill afford you might just be better off having the foreign policy of the dprk north korea in this game fortify your borders and lash out at anyone that gets close along with routing all the food aid to your dear leader happiness happiness has gone from an empire wide resource to a local one now called amenities you need a certain number per pop to keep the city happy this all but requires you to settle near luxuries to keep your cities content settle away from them and the city will be rabid within a few turns the empire wide system worked this system not so much ui the ui royally screws over several mechanics in this game the poor religious ui is far more confusing than civ v s pressure system ever was mis clicking and mis selecting cities units production tabs will occur frequently also you will experience your civ declaring war on itself at some point or a civ you haven t met yet declaring war on you religion speaking of that elephant in the room the theological combat between religious units was a neat idea but a poorly executed mechanic there are three religious units and only two of those can fight and if the religious victory is on or gandhi is in play expect to get swamped by religious units that the ai will spawn sometimes by cheating i swear that you can t stop without declaring war on the civ that sent them or lose your tailored religion to the ai s cult of madness turn the victory condition off and hope a mod comes out soon that will disable religion all together or reform it ugly districts they can t be moved once you chose the initial construction site so if you mis click and you will hope you have an autosave or quick save to go to otherwise your carefully laid plans will go flying out the window plunge a few hundred stories and splatter on the pavement below wonders this is more of a gripe about how they are placed while having wonders placed like districts helps to avoid the wonder spam of the older games it does lead to several problems in my view perhaps this only applies to me a guy who likes his immersion but why is the great library the structure that holds all of our culture s combined writings sitting out in the middle of nowhere next to some crazy mad max ian college town rather than in the heart of our capitol a city as old as time itself mods as of now there is no easy way to apply them without text and file editing and frankly not all of us can do that hopefully workshop or some other mod system gets implemented soon civ v lived and still lives on its mods heck mods keep even beyond earth somewhat alive without them this game is as good as dead disclaimer i will remove this section once mods are addressed windows defender yeah it doesn t like this game make sure you fix that before attempting to play this on a windows 10 system there are a few guides on how to do that in the steam forums overall i just can t recommend this game in its current state perhaps you will enjoy it more than i and if you do then more power to you i m going to wait for a few patches before i try this game again hopefully it will be better then and i can change the rating on this review to a more positive one otherwise its back to my heavily modded civ v game with me
