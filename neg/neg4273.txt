2017 so there s a lot i like about this game i absolutely love anything dwarf fortressy provided that it has a better ui the game is adorable very cute fun and i enjoy the planning and building of the small systems the biggest issue i see is the dev s view that you have to play this game the way i want you to play i really don t like the idea that all resources are limited and you re forced to constantly expand and hunt for resources because the ever dwindling supplies of algea and water with no way to make a self sustaining system dwarf fortress is fun because it s a sandbox you can play however you want want to make an untoppable invincible fortress sure want to limit your options and get slaughtered by goblins ok want to have giant dwarven construction projects and lava aqueducts in this there s one way to play starving for supplies that will ever dwindle the dev discovered people had basic food and decided to make the low level food stop developing seeds because you could you know feed your people with it now you have to constantly expand to find food that you farm it was fun for a few hours but i lost interest fairly quickly
