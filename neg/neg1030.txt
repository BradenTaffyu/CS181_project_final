2016 having played and liked all previous fallout games i was really looking forward to this installment being released bethesda have created a wonderfully ruined world for you to run around in but unfortunatley they have fallen short on the gameplay fallout 4 simply isn t a roleplay game its a sandbox shooter with quests being limited to killing enemies or fetching items with the exception of nick valentine the npc characters are just uninteresting loot carriers with guns and the main storyline was dull to the point of not worth bothering with such a shame play the witcher 3 if you want a truly absorbing modern roleplay experience fallout 4 is a pre millenial throwback a dated bullet fest masquerading as an rpg after this i dont hold out much hope for the next elder scrolls game
