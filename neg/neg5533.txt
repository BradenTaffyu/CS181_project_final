2019 naval battles are extremely bugged quite a few things such as the zeal cunning authority attributes system the senate system resources and even building hierarchy are hard to understand or have any information about the diplomacy is very clunky like if you want to trade with someone they won t counter offer you if it s possible you ll just have your offer refused units feel really weak in general there are a few positive improvements when i compare to the old rome like when you re moving your units on the field there is ui providing what s their destination now the diplomacy seems like it could be more interesting overall though i felt underwhelmed frustrated and very disappointed after spending my day and last night playing this game
