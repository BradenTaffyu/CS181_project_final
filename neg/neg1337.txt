2022 early access review slight improvement over warband but still lacking many of warband s features and quality of life features crashes often seemingly at random but especially when given war peace declarations still quite early access seemingly these features arent being worked on and the devs are preferring balance patches over new features no feasts or events no claimants usurpers no cutscenes randomly generated companions jeremus no promised gang brigand playstyle villages don t count as fiefs only useless castles and town do no upgradable villages no manhunters no naval combat rtr system from warband discarded a clown could become a faction leader overnight no books or trainers no hitmens targeting you random encounters like the belligerent drunk no lords consipiring on each others no duels 0 political intrigue no political quests and denouncement quests no deserters no deeper courtships just gamble rng no poems very little modding no camping lots of other content removed discarded meme ingame economy meme ingame diplomacy lots of exploit early game is a chore boring
