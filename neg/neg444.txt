2020 after update 22 this game is not rpg any more it is rather stright multiplayer cooperative fps there is no point of character building and leveling up in this game any more leveling up does not help to fight enemies it means only that your weapons and armor gets weaker and you have to build new ones for building new weapons and armor you need resources for resources you need bullets and weapons and armor you are constantly out of bullets because weapons are too weak to kill anything i suggest fallout 4 or red dead redemption 2 for open world rpg instead
