2016 this is for the unpatched game i m sure it will eveuntally get patched and a great game will get added to the great foundation but right now i can t recommend what it currently is things that need fixing 1 lists of habitable planets instead of scouring the actual map which can get very cluttered 2 map modes needs at least a diplo map mode so i know who i m at war with vassal status 3 centralized diplo options the empire list is not useful and murky want to move an embassy ugh 4 the system view is mostly useless but is the default view note how galaxy view has the close view button with a few context menus you wouldn t need it at all 5 automation of the system surveying and construction while the sectors can handle it you can t give them ships and having them build ships leads to odd results of ownership may be a bug 6 the help button is just a link to the wiki instead of a manual or in game info like the civpedia in civ it links to an external website that is already out of date and incomplete like all the other paradox wikis 7 in general weak feedback to the player to understand what is going on in terms of warfare8 can t see what pop is on a colony ship9 all the fun and interesting events stop mid game and things get boring things i d like to see 1 zooming into and out of system view with the scroll wheel game play problems 1 weak diplomacy and trading with other empires2 weak internal management i think i had 2 or 3 factions ever since i had maxed resources it was easy to just click a few buttons to make them go away forever planets never ask for anything 3 not sure what the ai does during a war but it doesn t seem to do anything useful unless warping between 2 sectors over and over is useful 4 got stuck in a war that last a few hundred years because the ai declared war on someone they couldn t actually reach
