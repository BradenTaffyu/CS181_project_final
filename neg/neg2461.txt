2022 from the moment i understood the meta of this game it disgusted me you will face players will build the board filled with 3000 atk monsters who negate everything you do on the first turn either that or they will inflict enough effect damage and beat you without giving you a single turn don t forget exodia decks who will keep drawing cards and basically keep you hostage for 15 minutes until they pull all cards they need for exodia kill if you lose coinflip and play second without handtraps you lose 90 of the time what s even worse it s that a single handtrap is often not enough to stop your opponent s combo you can not play this game casually if you played yu gi oh in the past and wanted to check how it s like today remember that we live in the era of internet where everyone has access to toxic decks that prevent your opponent from even placing a single card you can always look up an invincible deck yourself but then again where s the enjoyment in copying someone else you can only have fun by playing with friends but basically everything else is more fun when you do it with friends so just go and do anything else except playing this toxic bot ridden time waster ps raye sucks the most generic anime waifu i ve ever seen on a badly composed boring looking card
