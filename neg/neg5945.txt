2017 i loved this game when it first came out in fact it was the title that got me into grand strategy games however paradox s dlc practices are terrible for instance unless i spend 15 on the common sense dlc i can t develop provinces while the ai still can it makes games exhausting as you have no way of keeping up with the ai as they absolutely bury you in manpower bonuses so unless you want to dump the few hundred bucks required to make the game actually fun i don t recommend it really a shame because it was such a great game when it was first released edit i was corrected on the development issue the ai cannot in fact develop provinces when cs is disabled i still think there are myriad problems with the dlc practices not least the price of it all but the bit mentioned above is not one of them
