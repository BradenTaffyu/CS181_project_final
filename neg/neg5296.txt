i have thousands of hours on main client my recommendation is a negative one but it doesn t mean its not playable this game is perfectly fine for a stand alone modern client of mtg if you enjoy doing an extended standard format of constructed or drafting this client is very good for you the only reason i give this a negative review is because its ridiculous that in 2024 this is all we get for a modernization of digital mtg no two headed giant no way to do draft with multiple people or no custom mtg and other gamemodes like edh planechase or archenemy it s actually sickening to me that this is acceptable for a game that has existed for over 30 years i personally would even wish people to not even buy anything within this game until they get a clue and actually make an acceptable hub for mtg
