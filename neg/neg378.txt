2022 took me 111 hours of game time 50 hrs on ps4 and 26 difficult achievements to finally quit fall out 76 at first the experience is unreal if you re into open world survival as the game and quests progress you quickly learn that storage is the main issue along with bullets and materials to repair certain types of armor you re constantly world hopping to farm resource locations instead of just playing the game and progressing the content sure i can opt in for the additional paid subscription but that just feels wrong i should get the entire game on day 1 and not need to subscribe to get a basic perk like resource storage
