i have a lot of hours into this game for good reason the base game is a solid experience in of itself however the reason why i m not recommending this is on a very distinct principle subscription models i refuse to stand for them the excuse that no one is forcing you to buy it is a dishonest one that fails to see why so many people are absolutely exhausted from seeing it slapped onto every product we own i can tolerate it on streaming services but not a physical product i m not paying paradox to stream music or clean my house i m paying for a single product that price of said subscription is an insult to a customer s intelligence for starters for 6 months it is more expensive that a year of youtube premium netflix spotify playstation plus or gamepass by comparison a temporary expansion on a single video game is more expensive than similar services that just give me free games music series or remove ads all for dlc that s been of questionable quality especially as of late but the worst part is the excuse that the devs are giving us the consumer to make it easier for new players this subscription service is a band aid to a problem that they created an overabundance of expensive degrading quality dlc the company created this issue are hiding behind new players the better solution that would ve respected the customer would be to 1 drop the price of all of the dlc 10 for a single species pack or story pack is ridiculous 2 combine some of the dlcs into thematically appropriate packs to buy together because then the options aren t either give us money to temporarily own everything or give us money to actually own everything like you re doing now people are tired of subscription services plaguing the entertainment industry as a whole but especially video games these practices have slowly been getting implemented across all of your titles you know for a company that created city skylines to combat sim city as a city builder stellaris that is effectively spore s space stage but expanded you seem to have been taking notes from ea s playbook not for good reasons
