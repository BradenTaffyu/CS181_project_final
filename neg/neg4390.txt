2017 im a civ player from the first hour played civ1 on amiga 500 and even got the civ net edition for hotseat games and lan and i really have to say this civ is the worse civ i ever played i totaly wasted my money on this one the ai is super dumb another civ declared war on you and you conquere one of the enemys citys and make peace after that and every nation hates you for 2000 years for beeing a warmonger warmongering is such a idiotic feature in this game there is even a mod for that such things should not need a mod it should be possible to defend yourself without offending the whole world the end of turn takes so long you can read a book wile playing this game other games with much more stuff happening during the turns with more factions make a ai turn in secounds civ needs some minutes in late game with 24gb ram on ssd and i7 intel 7700k different speed levels are idiotic it would be cool to reduce the research time and building stay on the same speed as on normal so you can actually enjoy every aera like classic industrial a s o i really with i could build a classic kingdom with classic battles and after i enjoyed that aera for a wile it moves slowly towards medieval times and then i can enjoy this aera but no on marathon everythign is just slower so in the time you build a knight he is already obsolete because you researched gunpowder on normal speed you research a better unit type in the time you building 2 actual units but its the same on marathon the only difference is that it takes 20 turns insead of 10 game speed levels would make sense if they just slow down the development of the nations research and cluture but keep the building speed from standard speed why i didnt give the game back well its a civ game you need some hours to find out how it is maybe a ton of mods and spend alot money on several addons and civs could make this game fun but right now dont buy it please you will be frustrated for sure
