2018 so i have this game for quite some time playing it with my friend and it s fine but read more to see what s up with this game first of all it s for the all might usa mostly focused cars and tracks are in the usa ovals there are some road variants of ovals and most of major eu and world tracks also the most popular cars but the car variants and track variants there are not that many as in example ac pc2 which are also defined as sims so as mentioned usa is their primary market and most of players are from there that means that the server will fill with all sorts of players with high ping since i m not from usa and from eu i see people lagging like appearing and disappearing from the track disturbing second if you don t have money to go on with this game don t buy it never like i did after you purchase the game you get basic tracks and basic cars nothing fancy and don t expect any nurburing or spa and any porsche or ferrari cars it s just to get you started so the game starts with your montly subscription with is pretty expensive you pay the sum tax ok now you got the game you get a bit better and want to try better cars you want to purcase better tracks it costs a lot of money 1 car 15 1 track 15 but wait if you purchase 3 or more you get some discount fancy wouldn t you say now the game is a good sim graphics are a bit old but they do all right i have t tried vr so i can t say anything about that community is great because of the penalties and because u pay big bucks for it everyone is afraid of making carnage on the track but again it costs a lot for the money you spend for this one of the best sims around you have road oval f1 nascar dirt and cars and tracks dlcs etc you can get the newest f1 sim acc pc2 and probably some more games that have all of the content already in purchase so it s your decision if you play iracing buy it renew subrsciptions your not one of the best around because you have money it s just another sim i ll keep on playing it but will also play acc ac pc2 f1 again it s f expensive makes me kind a mad because there is no progress in graphic interface the standalone gui is in beta for lol i dont know how long liek they dont have money to complete it they give out a free car once in a while liek it s something so it s not paying back to the owners so my review is even there are many good things the money and greed of the developers si a big down for me now you wasted 5 mins of your life for some bliber jabber that makes no sense drugs are bad mkai
