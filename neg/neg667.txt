2018 early access review read my full review here sum up my thoughts since my review is about 7000 words long slay the spire is a deck building roguelite in which you climb procedurally generated levels facing off against enemies in turn based combat pros very well done and informative ui weekly updates interesting art style a large variety of cards and relics to ensure no run is the samecons slow easy and monotonous combat generally boring early game overly simplistic enemy design sometimes unfair enemies building a deck is frustrating due to design and rng although decks are often different the simplistic mechanics makes many decks play the sameslay the spire is well crafted but the core design decisions trivialize many parts of the game combat is simple and largely just a basic math puzzle enemies are too obvious and sometimes unfairly punishing designing a deck is a frustrating experience due to rng and the game s progression and even when it works out using it is still unsatisfying due to the simplistic combat overall the game is fairly mediocre to play if you enjoy card games a lot or you like to play games over and over to try and get things just right you might like slay the spire there is also some novelty to it and many players will likely spend 30 or more hours before coming bored i grew tired of it after about 10 15 so it wasn t worth the money to me however if you are looking for a game that allows you to draft cleverly constructed decks and play them against enemies that respond in kind you are much better off looking at standard tcg games as i discuss in my review the developers are unlikely to be able to make significant changes to make the game better without overhauling their card system they are planning to add more characters so that should extend the longevity of the game some for me the game wasn t really worth it but i can see why some people would like it especially if you haven t played a lot of similar card games i don t think the game is good from a design standpoint but as you can tell from the rest of the reviews people tend to like it if you do take the time to read my review please let me know what you thought
