i was perfectly content with hogwarts legacy as it is even after completing the main and side quests opening the game and taking silly screenshots was one of the best ways to pass the time for me but now after this ridiculous update i can t even do that all this fuss and for what a couple of clothes a mount and a side quest i can t even play no thanks to the constant crashes i endured trying to play again and again after waiting hours for the 50 gb either fix this kerfuffle or just completely scrap the update don t fix what was never broken
