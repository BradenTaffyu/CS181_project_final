early access review ark survival ascended does not have the developer support required for an always online pvp game every single day someone new attempts to use glitches exploits or hacks to win since the release of the first remastered dlc scorched earth the cheating has become part of the game even more every encounter will have someone using a client that gives them wall hacks auto aim speed hacks etc etc another issue is meshing this is a process where players will go under the map using various methods and destroy steal your stuff from behind or below the developers attempted to combat this issue that plagued the old game but they simply cannot solve it and this is not even the cheaters being too numerous or relentless although they are there are giant gaping holes in the world s mesh that go unfixed for months players without using client cheats or taking much effort in looking up how to cheat will find these holes everywhere to exploit there are just enough players left that almost weekly if not daily people will use exploits against you and do not care about being open about it why should they worst case their alternative account gets banned way too late they still get whatever they steal with no repercussions you can spend three months building up your team for it to be cheated or meshed in minutes or hours while you are sleeping on a monday night the developers will not compensate correct or do anything about it either you can submit a ticket and it will not go answered or corrected no matter how hard you try you cannot stop being cheated by a new group so often its a war of attrition they will eventually win this is a very grind heavy game you need to put in days or weeks of farming they just need to pay 9 99 for a client and stolen alternative account unfortunately because the cheating is so rampant it is often justified with they are doing it so we must do it you will be hard pressed to find a large enough group that does not have some kind of underground cheating going on if not obvious cheating developers do not hand out enough cheating association bans or wipes to combat this sometimes a large group will get developer wiped for cheating it does not happen enough ark requires a team of active in game moderators who can kick ban and rollback servers on short notice it doesn t have it nor will it ever have it since the game demands so much time it does not make sense to play official without the proper moderation and proper moderation is never coming tl drthe game is ok if you want to play single player but i would recommend waiting for all the old content to get remastered and see if the game s performance improves then 2 3 years if you are lucky it is also ok if you find a player run community server but they can be difficult to find without running into the usual issues of player admins and pay to win favoritism do not touch this game with a ten foot pole if you wanted to play the official online
