2017 wasn t worth buying in the end it s a glorified expansion masquerading as a sequel and priced as such there are only slight improvements and the new factions are implemented insultingly lazily for example playing skaven is like playing a generic faction with a tacked on summon clanrat squad spell which is a huge disappointment and dark elf high elf factions are only barely different enough to not be called outright reskins of each other maybe get it as an addon for the first one on a big sale
