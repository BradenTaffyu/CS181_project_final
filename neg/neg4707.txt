aimlabs was a decent customizable aim trainer with some of the best trainings and challenges that i saw in this genre until the devs decided to monetize it now it turned into this monstrosity with drumroll season passes why on earth would i spend extra money on an endless supply on psychodelic looking weapon skins for an aim trainer whats next lootboxes additionally i do not need to be reminded in every screen that there is an ai trainer that for a small montly fee will help me become a better human being i assume this happens when you accidently hire an oddly enthusiastic marketing firm that rather excels in promoting energydrinks
