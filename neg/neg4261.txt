2018 early access review i keep trying to like this game and keep getting railroaded by obscure aggressively underexplained game mechanics that prevent progress without offering any warnings suggestions or any way forward the game s primary challenge seems to lie in the player being unaware of the systems in play or how they interact with each other after a given random catastrophic cascade destroys your colony you ll be on guard for it next time only to get wrecked by a different random catastrophic cascade that you didn t even realize was possible add in a ridiculously overcomplicated double priority system and the inability to individually control duplicants a standard mechanic in colony sims to be fair and you have a gaming experience that is the exact opposite of fun i have spent more time restarting reading wikis and studying youtube videos than playing the game an infuriating exercise in frustration not recommended
