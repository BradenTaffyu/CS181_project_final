2021 these guys have had plenty of time to remove the restriction of getting a few of the items in game only with the cooperation of other real life players i have no interest in seeking help from strangers and the other gamers i do know do not play this type of game so they simply infer that i have to beg for a strangers help on the discussion board or buy another copy of the game and do it myself doesn t matter if these are inconsequential items they should be able to be gotten solo very annoying choice by the devs for an otherwise decent game
