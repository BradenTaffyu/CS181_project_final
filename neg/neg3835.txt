2023 early access review big disappointment tons of bugs no controls in other languages they don t work and keybindings don t save if you change graphics settings you can t press half the buttons anymore optimization is horrendous even on high instead of epic settings game looks like 60 worse what in the world is this studio thinking releasing the same game with no new content for more money in such a crappy state with all the old bugs present avoid this game
