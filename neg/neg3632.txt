2019 early access review i wanna love this game it has a lot to it that hasn t been seen before in zombie games but the optimization is god awful even with a core i5 and a gtx1080 i still get mass lag issues even with my settings lowered yet i can play massive games with almost max graphics and have a single lag spike after hours and hours of game play your sitting on a gold mine of a game if youd just listen to the players and make the game less lagged
