2021 stellaris is a great game with infinit replayability but i can t recommend it because the ai is probably the worst i have ever seen not only is it extremely bad at everything war resource management using resources when you give it to them building stuff it s also broken to the point game crysis won t do anything sometimes and to add to that paradox keeps creating portrait packs and other dlcs instead of fixing the game s biggest and worst problem
