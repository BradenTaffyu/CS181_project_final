i played madden 22 270 hours and skipped 23 and 24 since ea usually just releases the same game with updated rosters this time they updated the rosters and broke the game pass defense is impossible unless you seriously mess with the sliders franchise mode which is what i play i don t mess with mut will sub your defensive stars out for scrubs even when you set your depth chart and formation subs and in game subs are broken when this happens ea needs to lose the exclusive license so they have some incentive to improve this trash that said i ll put in a bunch of hours after this review because i play franchises with a friend and there is literally no alternative there is fun to be had here but i can t condone 70 for such a poor product
