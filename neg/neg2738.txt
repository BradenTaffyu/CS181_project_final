2016 stellaris launched as a skeleton for dlc and as a result has very little in the way of meaty content the game is an ostensible fusion of grand strategy and 4x featuring massive scale intragovernmental management pops strategic resources government types etc while it has the makings of the 4xs and a smattering of strategy it fails in both regards i cannot recommend it in its present state having played utopia this includes that present state as well the game utterly lacks any deep systems outside of population management there is no intergalactic economy to speak of no trade routes no logistical considerations for war no fuel or ammunition very limited options when declaring war you can only conquer liberate vassalize planets systems empires respectively you cannot enforce government types abduct citizens execute leaders or claim unsettled systems very little in the way of planetary management the sector system ensures that you ll rarely hold any more than 10 planets in a given game whereas the galaxy can contain several hundred on top of that it s basically a similar version of galciv2 s planet management screen with clunkier automation you develop tiles and place people on them that s it very little control over research and no espionage you do a lot of clicking to affect little direct change the leader system where you can recruit extraordinary citizens from available populations in your empire boils down to nothing more than a bunch of timed growable modifiers leaders have no personality whatsoever they do not trigger trait specific events and they have no effect on interactions with other empires unless they have traits that do there are no feuds between two god emperors no presidents detested by embittered rival empires no events dealing with leaders of other empires or anything of the sort contrast with ck2 where the characters of your leaders vastly affects the composition of your realm even in vanilla what depth there is remains inconsequential in most playthroughs it s not like ck2 where you have to learn the ins and outs of managing vassals to have a shot at governing a large empire the new faction system while a good source of flavor and short term objectives feels neutered i haven t even bothered with gene modifiation since i m doing just fine without that kind of expensive time consuming optimization everywhere you look it feels like something is missing interactions with other empires boils down to conquering them or allying with them and conqering them later pops management consists of spamming certain resources actions other pops when factions get unruly and colonizing certain planets with certain species war is a kinetics beat all spam off where cruisers dominate the meta dealing with primitives involves picking one of four options and waiting or just invading them like you would an ai except it s even easier research consists of crossing your fingers and waiting for the game to generate the techs you want managing planets stays the same all throughout the game since anything beyond your first few get relegated to self governing inefficient sectors there s just nothing worth engaging with mechanically even exploration the best executed feature in the game becomes worthless once you re either boxed in or you ve already gathered data on other systems via map exchanges in a buggy antiquated trading interface buy something like sins of a solar empire rebellion instead at least that game has compelling combat
