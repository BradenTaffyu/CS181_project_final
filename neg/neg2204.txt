i ve been playing this game for a year and put in a lot of time and effort a good mmo military game should make it easy for players to access new vehicles and crafts and enjoy the game however the developers of this game gaijin are not focused on making the game enjoyable for the players if you do not want to spend a dime on this game do not play it will take you only a few matches to get early vehicles but when you get to later vehicles which most players want to play it will take you months to get only one vehicle i can see why people comment on this game as a pay to win game i have spent nearly 2k dollars on this game just to experience top tier vehicles you can look at my hours to have an idea of how much time you have to spend to get to the top tier without putting money into this game not only that gaijin has been making secret changes to vehicle stats and research rates through minor updates this has been frustrating for many players including myself recently gaijin significantly reduced the research rate of vehicles making it even harder to progress in the game for example rocket missiles used to be the best way to research aviation after a summer sale with discounted rocket missile based planes gaijin made rocket missiles unusable for researching new crafts these changes are incredibly infuriating
