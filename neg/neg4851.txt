2018 first of all i have to say that the game itself isn t bad the concept art etc is great but while i have a lot of hours put into it partly with good faith that things will get better i still can t recommend the game with a peace of conscience most of my hours came from the time between release and around the middle of december but then i stopped because i couldn t endure the myriad of bugs anymore i m somewhat masochistic when it comes to stuff like that though after the reprisal update in early mid december they released the chaos invasion hotfix which was supposed to corrent a horribly implemented late game event the result was though that the changes didn t actually change anything and the whole thing got even more confusing since ca tied it solely to the hidden imperium level stat with no explanation whatsoever about how this stat gets calculated or stating the reason for the removal of the turn time trigger even months after the patch people were confused about how the late game event chaos invasion actually works when the rise of the tomb kings got released in january i bought it in good faith that the major bugs will get fixed sadly i was wrong on this not only did i ran into the same old bugs that already drove me away but also new ones which just reduced the game experience even further some attempted fixes also didn t work as good as the dlc is in itself i regret my purchase because of the circumstances of the patch that came alongside it then came the mwnl patch in february which only fixed a small amount of bugs though also some important ones but it didn t break anything and the fixed stuff was actually fixed so the patch brought new hope issue was that the game still suffered from major bugs after that we got 3 or 4 months without a patch despite the major bugs still being present because we had to wait for the content drop of norsca and the queen and the crone but even after a 3 or 4 month period they still managed to screw up other important parts of the game and the major bugs from before were still in admittingly some got lessened and other stuff was fixed but the game experience to me still feels worse after the patch than before partly thanks to newly introduced bugs i have to say that i m glad that i sticked to my rule only purchase q c if they fix the major bugs they didn t and therefor i did not purchase both dlcs rise of the tomb kings and the queen the crone also introduced bugs or maybe design choices which harmstring players who haven t bought the dlc now wh2 stands before a big problem in my eyes ca seems to be only willing to release patches with content drop for wh2 while their saga game receives its 2nd or 3rd patch without content drop or at least with a poor excuse for content drop that could easily be used to update wh2 too but the next content is announced for later this year as a campaign pack while the dlc after that a lord pack comes in 2019 so their big game which is riddled with bugs seems to receive only one more patch this year and that one seems to still be months away ca also holds radio silence for wh2 since the dlc release aside from one poor cop out about why we have to wait so long for the next dlc and therefor the next patch while the community is well let s say concerned even the subreddit which is usually more pro ca than letting criticism through now has threads about those problems on the frontpage regulary the next funny thing is that people in the reviews seem to have complained that there are too many dlcs and that they would apparently reduce amount of them which also means less patches overall because of that feedback while active supporters and the people who want and are willing to pay for more content are left in the dust if you want a glimpse of the amount of bugs just look through this thread here where we finally got somewhat of a respone albeit none that says much think 2 of the imho important ones that are missing are the siege gate bug the door will be open but no one is able to pass through aside from single entities of a unit from time to time and the gate also can t be damaged another one is the end turn bug where you can t end your turn and have to reload the save and hope that the same coincidence that caused it won t happen again so until ca changes their update and communication policy and fix the major bugs i just can t recommend the game or any of the dlcs
