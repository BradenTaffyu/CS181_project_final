2019 early access review this game used to be fun however when such a small development team decides to ignore broken content in favor of adding or more or changing what s there you get ever increasing pile of broken content now on top of that we have menus that hang lag between my input with my mouse and keyboard and the games response and for some reason a janky lag spike ridden performance even on the lowest of settings the game used to feel great you clicked and things happened in the time you raised your finger now you click raise your finger then get confused and click again before the character even starts their action this is unacceptable i can run the witcher 3 full stop but this game gives me trouble optimize and focus on fixing what is there please also stop taking away loot it was bad enough when you put crafting times on everything literally putting an arbitrary lull in a game for no reason but now you make it take even longer by reducing loot spawn this isn t rust and it never will be you shouldn t be aiming for that pile of crap anyways do you see 317 hours logged on rust in my account no then why are you trying to be rust or every other craptastic wait simulator on the market do you want 0 hours cause i can give you 0 hours in fact i ve uninstalled the game because i cannot justify the hard drive space it takes for a game that is unplayable stop trying to pad game time with arbitrary waiting periods fix what is there until it works 100 optimize so that this game has performance befitting it s graphical integrity these are what saves this game right now
