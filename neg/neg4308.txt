2017 edit while district costs scaling is slightly reduced now for a trade off in more expensive buildings was a nice start it s not enough cities settled after the first two eras are prohibitively expensive in the name of boosting tall play but the game still heavily favors infinite city spam ala never stop expanding the focus is on hardcore chopping of bonus resources forests to brute force these 100 turn districts on new cities and if the city doesn t have forests stone to harvest just hope your trade routes complete soon so you can barrage the settlement with caravans to boost production so it s entirely possible to ignore the arbitrary balance aspect here and just brute force past it combined with the eureka system and very powerful key techs to research every game really does feel homogenized as you really don t vary your playstyle much between civs you beeline the same specific techs to unlock a huge power boost while keeping district scaling low with few variations due to unique units and buildings this means building the same units and doing the same actions to trigger the same eurekas every game and spam spam spam the settlers and chop chop chop the woods so for the most part it s x victory beeline order y victory beeline order z victory beeline order with tweaks to take account for uu ub and again the same actions and build orders to trigger the same eurekas are near universal across these edit 2 the dlc civs are almost all op especially in the frontier pass but the trend started earlier all semblance of balance is thrown out as the newer civs almost always tend to be obscenely op like the babylonians they get 100 tech completely from a eureka you were already making a priority of these and it just makes tech progress stupidly fast especially since you can largely ignore your science yields and rely on brute force eurekas especially if you get a science alliance and really leverage spies they can steal eurekas that give you 100 tech progress as babylon you straight up steal tech babylon can ignore science yields and still be 100 turns ahead of everyone else in research simply put i cannot recommend the game right now it s getting patches every season but the game is in need of some serious and fundamental polishing that firaxis typically only adds in major expansions its no where near as bad as civ v was at launch but some things are pretty unbalanced still i won t touch on the terrible diplomacy as its been beaten to death ressurected then beaten right back down into red paste my main gripes revolve around research production and districts for one thing research happens far too quickly this is especially bad since the game is so stingy on giving you means to increase your production by the time you reserach build and field a unit its practically obsolete so how do you solve the production hassle by building a production district yet districts get more and more prohibitively expensive as the game progresses it doesn t take long at all for them to start rivavling and then surpassing wonders yet these are things we are supposed to be building 2 5 per city there are 12 districts you can build so you are supposed to choose wisely and specialize your districts this one is near the mountains and will make a great research district or perhaps your people will find inspiration within the sacred peaks as you build a temple nearby well the answer is actually neither the crux of hte issue is that these districts increase in cost for every technology you research so if you jump straight into the early research district you are just shooting yourself in the foot research is already too quick and districts already too expensive to build without making things worse by trying to get an early science lead so instead of giving us very cheap costs to build a city s first district and making each successive district more and more prohibitively expensive you know to meet their actual design goal of specialized cities you get punished for researching that mid game city you founded to secure a source of oil good luck doing anything with it when it takes 100 turns to build a single district the workaround is actually trade routes you get an extra one for every harbor or commerce district you build set up all your trade routes as internal and you gain a substantial production boost this is the second reason why the concept is broken instead of specializing cities and being choosey about your districts everyone just builds a commercial harbor district first to get that trade route so they can get some desperately needed production to build anything at all in any of their cities so instead of specializing your cities you are just building the same district over and over and over and over again every game its the same whatever victory condition you are actually going for will just have to be the second or third district built science is too fast which skyrockets district costs districts that are needed to build virtually anything worthwhile in the game thus my hope is that they will give a much needed reblance to these systems in a future major expansion then the game will get an ultimate edition that packages all the cash grab dlc together with the needed expansion s for a reasonable price if you really need a civ fix until them just replay v try some of the mods
