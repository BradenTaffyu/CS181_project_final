2022 amazing game at launch really brought the whole community together from old players to new it was great since then the game has stagnated with a drought of content and poor misguided changes that make the game worse over time and it s slowly moving into a state where i wouldn t recommend anyone play it what happened awful ranked4 rank seasons with 0 changes to reward structure improvements and where the best strategy became de ranking on purpose to get more gems to pull for cardsno new secret packs for new cardsafter 4 months we finally got new cards they re only available in selection packs and not from secret packs so your odds of getting them are terrible and are in a pack polluted with garbage you won t want ban list that changed nothing4th month in we get our first banlist the community has been screaming for they ban none of the problem cards and instead semi limit some commons rare cards which practically change nothing to any oppressive decks to the format and show that konami is unwilling to ban ur cards in order to incentive people spend more money to obtain op broken ban worthy cards they have no intention of touching or giving people refunds of free dust for oh also they nerfed heroes for fun in fear of a card we might not even get for another 3 4 months daily quests are worsedaily quests are one of the only ways to consistently earn gems to pull cards tl dr they made them harder and give less reward at launch there was 9 possible tasks and majority of them gave 10 20 gems 1 pack is 100 gems but 3 of these tasks gave a total of 130 gems 50 50 30 in order to complete that you would have to win 2 games and play a third and that was it so players would purposefully not do tasks for 3 days in order to get all 9 quests then only do the 3 best ones after hearing complaints about the system they made all dailies give 40 so that s 10 less per day then the old method and they made the tasks harder by adding quests such as deal life point damage or declare attacks on opponents monsters which your opponent can easily deny by simplying leaving the game when they see you have the winning board thus causing you to play several games hoping to find someone with some sportsmanship who will let you win properly or playing a sluggish stall tormenting your opponent to do your dailies
