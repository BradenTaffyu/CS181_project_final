good game but sucks that after i fully decked out my stock engine with all the highest parts i ended up buying the v 8 engine with the in game dollar currency for like 78 once u do that u have to re buy all your engine parts again which blows but worse is that i tired to switch back to my stock motor and u can t i had to re buy it and once i did i lost all the parts i grinded for that i put in the engine so now i m out an engine and a lot of in game and timeso long story short don t upgrade to new engine or transmission unless u wanna re buy all your again you should be able to keep your parts after u buy em or at least leave them on the old engine like u had it or at worse u get your money back when u switch engines
