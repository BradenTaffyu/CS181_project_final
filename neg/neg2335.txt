2016 ok so i ve played eurotruck sim 2 for several hundred hours and have been looking forward to this game coming out and for a number of reasons i highly recommend this game however for fewer but far more important reason i dont recommend this so here goes pro sit s good looking it s good valueit s slightly a different experience from euro trucksthe badsome of the roads are to tight to drive around properlythe scale of the map has basically ruined the game for example you can get from la to las vagas in around 5 minutes i know they cant do it to true scale but some resemelance of how big the usa actually is would of gone down well i know they are releasing other states in time but i cant see them rectifying such a massive issue with the game and for tha reason i wouldnt recommend it if you like truck sims i can guess you have already purchased most of the dlc s from the previous game and if its really american rigs you like i would save your money and just use mod s for euro trucks theres a far greater choice of american rigs for free and the mods are easy to install plus many other maps etc to keep the game fresh
