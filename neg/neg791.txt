2016 i really enjoyed playing this game so it is very difficult for me to advise people not to buy this game bethesda games have numbered among the most enjoyable games that i have played based mainly on the fact that there is such a prolific modding community as a player i can tailor my experience to my liking by using any of the thousands of mods available through numerous sources fallout 4 was no different i need to emphasize what i just said fallout 4 was no different i am not sure what scummy plans bethesda has but it seems like it has taken to punishing players who tailor their gaming experience with fallout 4 every patch that bethesda releases up to 1 5 has disabled mods completely patch 1 5 introduced bethesda s own modding center from which a player could download a very small assortment of mods which presumably work even though mods obtained through other sources do not without jumping through a significant amount of hoops furthermore activating mods through the bethesda site disable achievements this is a new low for bethesda it is because of these patently offensive and abusive actions against their paying customers that i cannot in clearconscience suggest that anyone buy this game
