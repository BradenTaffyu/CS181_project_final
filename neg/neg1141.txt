2016 pros beautiful world design lighting and a large variety of loot creatures and hidden storylines cons doesn t feel like a rpg more like a shooting gallery with rpg elements poor character and main storyline infested with bugs literally and figuratively personal experience on my second playthrough i got 20hrs into a character to find the automatron dlc s first mission bugged i made a test character and used commands to get to the required level and it worked i then made a proper new character and as soon as i aquired my first weapon i couldn t use mb1 mb2 the number keys or to try and fix it with commands i wish i could play this game as i like it a lot but it s so painful trying to avoid the painful main storyline as well as gamebreaking bugs not to mention the game engine fps tied to game speed etc if the developer can get their together i would 10 10 recommend this game but the state the game is in now from my personal experience i would wait for unofficial patches quests and enhancments made by modders
