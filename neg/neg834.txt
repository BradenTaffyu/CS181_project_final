2017 finished and up to some extent loved all fallout games up till now stuck at this one because of pure boredom lost interest in the story 160 hours easily accumulate when you go away on multiple occasions and leave the game running it s a pretty bad fps with some weak rpg elements and a boring story i tried hard to give it one more chance but i apologise if i offended someone with my review no need to be rude
