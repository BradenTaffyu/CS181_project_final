2018 i m quite dissapointed with this game i thought that despite the so so reviews this game will live up to fallout theme it s not i never played new vegas but i played rest of fallout games was enthraled with 1 and 2 very happy with 3 i played also fallout like arcanum loved all of them fallout 4 is nothing like previous games it feels more like japanese action rpgs and even bit below them when it comes to rpgness it s mostly go there kill bad guys monster whatever when in fallout 1 you were to save a girl from raiders you could negotiate join them kill them save the girl with stealth lots of options here nope second mission in this fallout go and kill all bandids sure whatever i see what they offer result they shoot not talk where the heck is rpg in this also there is little way to avoid story line in old fallouts you could just do whatever you wanted and walk around no constrains you could be good guy bad guy evil incarnated not quite here you are either good guy or have nothing to do beside wandering around graphics is great world is open to walk around but rpg it is not if you want an wester post apocalyptic rpg and fallout experience this is not the game you are looking for if you want a post apocalyptic shooter then it is a game for you
