2021 this would be a thumbs up if 2k hadnt put their absolutely abysmal app between steam and the game the startup time for civ vi went from 30 seconds to 15 minutes with their useless trash stuck in the middle i will retain a thumbs down review on this game and all other 2k games until this app is removed
