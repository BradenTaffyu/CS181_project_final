2017 note this review is for the base game without any paid dlc what s good realtime turns are split up in days and flows at a constant rate making it feel like realtime battles happen seamlessly while the time flows no tech tree random choices of techs even though some are pre reqs for others nice graphics keeps some of the late game micromanagement at bay by restricting number of core systems forcing the player to let the ai control sectors of planetswhat s bad too few victory conditions the game can only be won by fighting and bribing the core game is a bit barren several things doesn t feel like it is tested properly for example president mandage requires you to either build 5 mining stations or 5 research stations why in the end game there is no more places to build stations and you don t get anything from those mandates should have been a bit more varied hard to win by yourself if you haven t got the edge from the start clasic 4x fail fleets is just a stack of doom no tactical feel just spam ships and hope you get the upper hand losing your stack of doom means you have lost the war if losing vs npc means you get attacked warscore this slows down the game so much that it is more a pain than a neat mechanic instead of rolling over the opponents you have to take each of his systems one war at a time no score screen at end of game or anything that can be used to review your performance in the game no surrender your entire empire and end the game button but deleting the save is probably the closest i get since we don t have any logs or score screens anyway the ai is a pain to co operate with we were attacked by some strange race and it was impossible to get a joint strike vs them this game stands a bit out from the crowd but after the initial neat feeling is gone it s just another 4x and what s worse it lacks a lot what is considered mandatory in the genre i see a lot of interesting things in the dlc but i don t want to risk time and money if it is still as bad as the barren core game
