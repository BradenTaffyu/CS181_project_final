payday 3 could have been so much better and i will not be changing my review until these following and i feel common complaints are fixed pre planning in payday 2 with the release of the big bank heist they introduced the updated pre planning where you could choose what type of drill where it will be placed and how you will escape from the vault etc this kind of customization for each heist following was added and was one of the best changes imo in payday 3 however every teammate can bring in 1 favour be it armor bag health kits or a zipline all randomly spawning somewhere on the map with no control there are also favours that do change up the heist similar to heists from pd2 but they are locked behind rng at the end of a heist wether or not you get one skills in payday 2 the skills system was much more generic but also much better currently in pd3 there are skill lines and to get to any of the nodes in the lines you need to spend at max 2 points this makes it so no skills can truly be strong and or unique while payday 2 had unique skills like the famous get the up they were locked behind a 3rd of your total points allowed alongside my issues with the skill lines are the edge grit and rush keywords in 3 for each modifier you have to do something to trigger a very minute buff the worst offender of these is edge as the 10 damage it grants you doesn t do enough damage to change any breakpoints none of these keywords stack you can t make yourself feel stronger with your perks as in payday 2 where you could stack two different damage perks and just shred things and it hit a certain power fantasy that i felt defined payday while still talking about edge grit and rush they have their own mini perks for their own new mini games so on top of having to do x for edge you have to also do x to consume edge especially fun when you get the last shot perk so its get edge be on last shot of magazine and shoot for the buff armor and the health system armor just recently got a new adaptive armor which always regens unless it breaks making the gameplay closer to payday 2 and makes the whole experience ultimately more enjoyable however as it is now for every other armor every tick of damage is a mistake in payday 2 you atleast had armor acting as a shield and the health was the limited until perk decks but those i have my own hatred for that don t belong on this review in payday 2 you had more health then armor making it much more forgiving if you took tiny scrapes of damage while punishing if you made a dumb play in payday 3 you are punished for every single play you make as armor doesn t naturally regenerate meanwhile health is much lower and takes 25 more damage as all the armor has damage resist but also you have more armor then health so once you lose your armor you are set on a streak of going down over and over if you get into a suboptimal spot where you cant replace your armor mios last change before he left was fixing the armour system in way that will let people who liked pd3 original shield system still play with it while pd2 players could get what they enjoyed i guess armor is fixed now when the update releases lol we just have to give this game a few more years for a new skill system hordes moving from payday 2 the devs decided to go with stronger ai good and stronger hordes bad with lesser numbers bad to make up for the lesser numbers ai has much more health and damage when compared to a lone cop from 2 except for ds but that difficulty is the most artificial thing in gaming this ultimately makes them unsatisfying to shoot as they tank what feels like an unrealistic amount of bullets while also not having enough enemies to make it feel like a horde killing game like its previous game melee melee as it is right now is a joke all it does right now is stagger it does no damage at all if you have no ammo you are essentially softlocked in payday 2 there was a wide variety of options from utility stun gun tazer to straight up damage katana ice pick i understand 2 had alot of bloat with weapons in general but 3 not having any melee weapons feels straight up wrongtldr game reinvents already good things about 2 and made those things worse
