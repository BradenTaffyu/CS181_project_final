2016 honestly meh on release i love the classic warhammer world and played the out of shadow of the horned rat and dark omen back in the day i may come back and thumbs up this later but i am recommending stay away from the initial release at a 78 price point for the base game what should be base dlc i think ca can make this game great in a couple expansions but there are some real irritating benny hill moments that make the overworld flawed and boring battles are great but not enough to save this game
