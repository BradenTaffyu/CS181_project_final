2022 early access review 13 years of work and they give us this i cannot believe it new patches and hotfixes take too long the game is full of bugs and whenever a new patch comes old bugs still haunt your game modders work better than taleworlds but the latest patches prevent modders from modding this is why some mods that make your game stable are unavailable right now the game has no depth no roleplay and no economy quests if you can call them as are repetitive tedious tasks most of the dialogues are absent the in game economy does not work and enemy lords have no shortage of manpower or money all you can do is fight battles and sieges settlements with a bad ai i definitely don t recommend this game taleworlds disappointed me i will never ever buy another early access game from them
