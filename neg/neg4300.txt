2017 there is so much to love about civ vi the new multi hex city development is fantastic a vast improvement on the old single hex city you now have to plan and think ahead as to how you will develop your city the way builders now work while feeling odd at first now makes sense again a huge improvement but and i am afraid it is a big but diplomacy not only is it childish on occasions as to why a civ declares war on you it blatantly lies to you then you get the diplomacy spam politely refuse to allow a civ into your capitol and they will come back almost every three or four turns and keep asking you not annoying and doesn t break immersion try creating a custom single player game with the max allowed a i civs it s verging on unplayable the full screen displomacy uses adds to this frustration then we have that old chestnut religion it s just not worth the effort to create one your cities will get swamped relentlessly as a i civs constantly swamp your land in order to convert your cities civ vi has the potential to be the greatest civ game ever but right now it s a long way off and a missed opportunity as i have to either recommend it or not i cannot in all honesty fully recommend it in reality its somewhere in between the two editone thing i forgot to mention the initial civ starting positions it s ludicrous you can have a huge size map but the civs will all be right close in to you huge swathes of land will be completely empty there is no space edit 2religion has indeed improved that has to be said
