2022 at its current state and current price i can only say it s probably worth it with all the overhauls and mods out there as a vanilla experience though the fact that this game is on full release is absolutely bonkers because it s currently not a videogame videogames with a price tag have a beginning and an end and there is nothing past the beginning here there are zero not a hyperbole effective or engaging mechanics mid to late game once you re in the kingdom building stage in fact general game logic and ai behavior seems to break down more the larger your empire is as if you re venturing farther and farther from the part of the game that got any worthwhile attention or care i understand that it s supposed to be mainly a fighting game but that doesnt change the fact that you expect something anything else once you re a lord or king and all you get is feeling like some qa game tester who s out of bounds when they re not playing siege and field battles with an early game full of fun and engaging features a late game that genuinely does not exist and the in between that has a steady dropoff in quality engagement and purpose this is the most comprehensive example of an unfinished game
