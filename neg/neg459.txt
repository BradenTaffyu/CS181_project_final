2020 this is an extremely divisive game when it comes to reviewing though even after wastelanders update i wouldn t say it is worth it the game has multiple issues though mine is mainly with the lack of end game content at the end of the game the best way to make xp or legendaries is to simply farm areas like west tek not fight endgame bosses like the scorchbeast queen or wendigo colossus it devolves into a cycle of doing daily quests to hit max caps scrip gold bullion one can acquire from the daily limit and farming to acquire bloodied explosive two shot legendaries praying that you get blessed by an extremely lucky drop for what you actually need don t forget the glitches as of today 4 18 2020 vendors and display cases are fully disabled because bethesda finally realized people found a way to circumvent their unreliable code and duplicate items all in all i want to love this game i really do i ve played through all of the fallout games i thoroughly enjoy the worldbuilding and atmosphere presented in west virginia but in the state currently it is a slough to play i have owned this game since initial launch
