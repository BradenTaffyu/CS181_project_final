2023 a fantastic presentation and fancy main cast marred in the worst mobile trash the gacha genre has to offer gameplay has taken a deep dive since ruina with far less control over battles than its predecessor a very limited set of abilities per character and not even the ability to redirect attacks for the regular stages grinding becomes a necessity at certain roadblocks of the story unless you have the patience and energy ressource to slam your head repeatedly at a rng wall or you can pay to maybe get high rank identities no pity system by the way you ll then have to grind levels for unless of course you pay because of stagger accumulation and lack of redirections damage can accumulate very high very fast and with fewer party members on your side you will be hit hardest by successive poor rolls human encounters making most of the chapters and half ish of the dungeons they will make most encounters feel like the result of pure luck rather than careful planning abnormality encounters are far better however with a redirection system similar to what ruina had instead of the awful auto assignment system while the lack of available skills is still annoying you get far more options to play around resistances when managing who attacks who abno bosses push it even further with their behaviour changing depending on their available parts and mid battle checks sadly these represent a minor fraction of the content you ll have to go through in a chapter regarding the plot while the main cast is likable poor forgettable self insert protagonist aside the side cast is again a far cry from its predecessor while ruina used each fight to tell a self contained story that would usually expand on the setting here each encounter obstructs the plot more than it helps it with random forgettable mooks popping up every 5 minutes in the middle of a more interesting dialog or character beat it is really a shame for the series to fall to this after the step up ruina was to lobotomy corporation while visually the series has gotten even better this is in service of a messy luck reliant gameplay and terrible pull rates a lot of effort was put into this but it s sadly muddled in a terrible business system and i wish it wouldn t have been wasted on this
