2019 let me start by saying that i do in fact like hearts of iron iv i really do however the game in its current state is almost entirely broken each update and dlc brings more not fewer bugs glitches and incompetency in the ai the game shines however in multiplayer with friends the modding scene and alternate history experiences but i think it says a lot for the current state of the game when mods make a significantly better more rounded polished and complete experience than the base game
