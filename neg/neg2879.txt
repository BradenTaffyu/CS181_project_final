2018 preface i first bought this game back in oct 2016 patch 1 3 and enjoyed the game it was patch 2 0 jan 2018 that left a bad taste in my mouth i figured i might as well give patch 2 2 dec 2018 a shot here is an updated review after my initial 2 0 review what is stellaris trying to be for potential customers the stellaris you see today can change dramatically in the future here are a list of things changed that i remember ship movement 3 ftl types before only 1 now travel through stations territory distance based from planets outposts now must capture every star system individuallywar capturing territory was only based on war score now war is based on claims exceptions depending on empire type and war exhaustion war score is still there but largely irrelevant population quite a number of changes to factions ethics unrest etc resources minerals energy influence research now add in research food unity alloys goods motes gas crystalseconomy tile based system before now caste system hierarchy workers and specialist pretty much the entire core of stellaris 1 0 initial release has been changed for better or worse is in the eye of the beholder i am reluctant now to buy unfinished games from paradox if you want to gauge how dramatic a change that can be done i compare the state of stellaris pre 2 0 and post 2 0 to that of civ 4 and civ 5 restriction to hyperlanes only for space travel has large scale effects on the gameplay similarly to how civ 5 s change to 1upt changed the way civilization worked can you play old versions yes i personally enjoy 1 9 the best but its not without downsides 1 playing pre 2 0 means that bugs will no longer be fixed developer support for the old game is gone 2 playing pre 2 0 means that you will be locked out of all new dlc no hype for new content 3 given that the whole paradox shtick is continually pumping out dlcs continual support it leaves a sour taste because a part of my enjoyment stemmed from the potential of the game and what it could be you can overlook problems because you have hope they will be fixed complex game i have to discuss the old stellaris per 2 0 for this pre 2 0 was a very simple and chaotic border protrusion fast ship traveling and 3 ftl methods game there wasn t much diplomacy and economy was easy this allowed you to focus more on war and space exploration despite its lack of depth it was incredibly fun indeed simplicity can be fun and with simplicity it is easier to have better ai opponents as the ai doesn t have much to screw up unfortunately for me paradox wanted to make a more deep game but is it really deep at all for me a game is complex deep if it allows for different strategies to achieve a goal take for instance a game like xcom your goal is to kill an enemy that is hunkered down what can you do 1 throw a grenade to expose him 2 run up and melee 3 shoot at him anyways 4 overwatch and kill him on his turn etc thus you can tailor a strategy to your liking and create fun ways to play the game i e different strategies in a strategy game does stellaris allow for multiple play styles that feel different not really expansion the map in stellaris has a defined geography in space with chokepoints given the prominent strength of static defenses you can easily fortify a chokepoint and then just sit on it with a respectable fleet and be safe for practically the entire game this means that taking things offensively is difficult and turtling is easy even if you try to rush early expansion through war the cost to make and maintain fleets are huge meaning you have to turtle up your economy anyways so multiple games i tried eventually boil down to me playing roughly the same each time economy this is more of an exercise of bloat more than anything instead of the simplicity of the old stellaris minerals to make upkeep is energy minerals now you have to convert your minerals to x resource for various tasks so instead of a b a is minerals b is ship you do a b c a is minerals b is alloys c is ships sounds interesting think you can have tailor your empire the way you want i e focus on alloys early for war think again you pretty much need everything and i mean everything you get alloys for ships but you just tanked your energy for upkeep and because of opportunity cost you make alloys instead of energy so now you go back to building your economy you pretty much have to build the same things every single game guess i need food build a farm consumer goods are getting low convert minerals to goods i need to upgrade my building but require motes as maintenance proceeds to build a refinery nothing you do really feels like your own creative playstyle is there a point where you can build what you want yes but that s when you are swimming in energy and minerals i e you won the game basically well i suppose you can build what you want if you just buy sell everything you need in the market given its infinite resources need goods just purchase all you need but doesn t that make the whole supply chain system moot rng this more so is directed at the research tree which gives you random techs you can research at a given time thus you cannot create build orders and are at the mercy of rng i feel that rng research coupled with the new economy system is terrible why because upgraded buildings need intermediate materials for upkeep i e techs are intertwined but are on separate techs got the tech for upgrading your alloy factories hope you already have the tech for making motes no well you can t upgrade your alloy factories rng is good if you can strategize around it here rng just detracts from strategy can you adapt your empire based on the random techs no you build your empire defensively the game pace is too slow to be reactionary to the techs you are given exploration this pertains more so to the early game but exploration is also heavily affected by the defined geography of the galaxy its pretty much linear because you are given a specific path to explore with 1 or 2 branches the game does provide some fun with uncovering anomalies small spice of life stories that can be a good read this coupled with a main questline makes early game exploration satisfying unfortunately the novelty wears thin after multiple playthroughs that you tend to just not bother reading them anymore game pace the game pace and the overall game length are painstakingly slow first game pace is how fast things can change within the galaxy well things do not change fast at all and you need to be waiting around most of the time for ships to move for pops to grow etc the only time when you aren t waiting around is when you have too many planets to manage in which you wonder if frustration from managing or boredom from waiting is the better option overall game length is 10 20 hours no i m not kidding a single game will last that long this is too long requiring multiple playthroughs over weeks months depending on how much you play to finish a game if you have lots of time it still is 1 2 days worth sometimes you just want the victory screen satisfaction but you won t get that here you re more likely to just restart another game conclusion all in all i believe stellaris is just trying too hard to become strategic but fails in my opinion making the whole experience unfun strategy is about forming different solutions to a problem unique playstyles but i feel like the game already has a playstyle set by the developers i personally enjoyed the old stellaris because it didn t really masquerade around as a complex deep game it was what it was and it was fun
