2015 long review ahead although not necessarily a bad game bethesda chose to deviate from the mechanics that made fallout amazing what you get is an action first person shooter with a few rpg elements something like call of duty with quests as a fan of the fallout and the elder scrolls series i am strongly dissapointed with what fallout 4 came out to be before saying what s right and what s wrong though let s just get out of the way the usual bethesda problem bugs they are everywhere they block you from completing quests and progressing in the game literally making it unplayable now the 40 hours i have played involve me discovering the bug or unavoidable ctd and literally going the other way the biggest one is a huge area in the middle of the map that is glitched and you ctd by setting foot in there blocking all quests in that area and making you unable to progress i e when riding the vertibird with paladin danse right above the glitched area the game just closes pros 1 it actually runs on day one unlike other games cough batman arkham knight cough however unfortunately nowadays our standards and this is what most positive reviews of f4 are based on are that low we think it is a positive think that the game actually launched 2 character is voiced especially the female one is pretty decent 3 crafting though you need skills to hit the right pixel to place your object cons 1 no longer an rpg sadly enough this is evident during the very first 5 minutes that you launch into the game you can no longer be the person you want to be forget being the evil chemist who melees everyone or the stealthy recluse with the silenced sniper for some reason bethesda decided to force a backstory to you and give you a preset character not talking appearance wise this isn t your story any more you are forced to be the kind little husband wife whose spouse was killed and who has a son who he she must find this is who you are this is what every dialogue must revolve around 2 character creation frankly it s wax museum at its best and the barely on par graphics definitely add to that although the creation itself may sound exciting being able to sculpt your character s face with your mouse npcs around the world for some reason share very similar face bases for example diamond city s major is basically your old husband or given the same clothes the only reason you can distinct between pipper and cait is the awesome accent of hers everyone looks like they were based on the same preset face and just had a few things changed something that makes the people you meet mostly unmemorable in addition bethesda didn t even bother changing your character s hand textures so whether you play male or female the hands have the exact same male texture funny i played around 10 minutes on my female character accidentally this morning and i realized it when i went 3rd person that i play a female although a minor aesthetic thing to some though due to the guns nature of the game you are basically playing more in 1st person than 3rd person meaning that you see your characters hands around 80 of your play time it points out that bethesda didn t f king bother something that highlights what i always said this game needed at least an extra year of development 3 what everybody talks about graphics to be clear they are not bad but they are not good either and from a company that brought skyrim a game that had me spend my play time watching a river flowing calmly due to it s amazing textures this is unacceptable it is unacceptable to be using an engine from the 2000 s that requires a modern pc to run at this point at least for me the graphics between f nv and f4 don t differ that much there are parts in the landscape that may make you go wow but mostly it s just outdated graphics that are so bad that almost look cartoon ish like they imported them from telltale s walking dead or wolf among us 4 dialogues plain bad this copy paste they did from bioware s 4 answers wheel is something that i will never understand forget choosing an actual dialogue to reply to npc s like in f3 or f nv your options are always sarcasm maybe yes no sure no means no and yes means yes however choosing sarcasm or maybe is really a gamble your character will either say something funny that means yes or something funny that means no there is literally no way to tell if it s sarcasm i agree or sarcasm i disagree moreover most dialogues are at best taken out of b movies they are unimaginative and something that a child would come up with no offense there is no soul behind what you say no smart 5 the map is literally small i had around 4 hours played when i decided to see my map as a whole by zooming out in my surprise i had explored almost 70 of it by simply following the minutemen quests and 1 2 miscellanous i picked up then i also discovered that the right part of the map is actually a huge sea now since i didn t bother going there it s sea afterall if every bit of this part is playable and i mean if there is content not just swim around taking rads then the map is decent but again nothing compared to skyrim if it s not well then the map is literally small i can go back to skyrim right now with 900hrs played on steam and another 700 off steam and still discover places what was the name of the f ker who said that this will be larger than skyrim todd something 5a cities are small diamond city for example the jewel of commonswealth the main shelter of the game in the middle of the map that houses shops and stores and people around the area is like dawnstar skyrim at best in size it s basically almost as small as the shelter megaton you bomb at fallout 3 it literally has 10 buildings including shops houses and around 20 residents who most of them just sleep outside no real city to see and explore just a small district market area as you enter and a few ruined houses around no back alleys no wealthy or criminal based areas it s just small and unintresting 6 the story other than being forced on you it really is boring for the most part by forced i mean the whole find your son thing they chose to give you and on that you are in a way compelled to complete it since it s an urgent matter isn t it would you be doing misc quests and building a shelter while you know your child s gone you d want to fix that first before bothering doing anything else in game which throws people off at least those interested in an rpg experience moreover there are several things that add to the story being boring a the bad textures character models add on that i am not talking about the non synced lip movements for a second you are smiling while discussing what happened to you in the vault then suddenly you choose the yes option and your character goes crazy mad that omg my son was kidnapped it s kinda creepy b there is just no soul behind the story just another cliche you d expect from an indie game i expected the outcome since the start cons minor a really weird decision on development includes the fact that you are given the power armor fallout s iconic piece of armor literally during the first 15 minutes no real talents system no survival theme just a shoot em all fps holstered weapons dissapear from existence companions are a pita since they always get stuck bug many more there is no space left for conclusions so all i say is wait for the game to be on a sale and hope that the modding community will fix this mess hope i ve been helpful to you
