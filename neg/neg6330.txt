2023 for someone who is a large harry potter fan from childhood and a gamer this game is fairly disappointing for the following reasons 1 terrible and uninteresting story line2 lack of reputation for your actions no consequences 3 very few companions4 repetitive game play5 my favorite spell patronus charm is not in it6 enemy types are extremely limited7 main character has no personality8 most of the classes you only go twice9 cannot get any of the deathly hallows permanently 10 game is entirely fetch questingi could go on a lot more about this game and it has some great qualities but is overall quite disappointing
