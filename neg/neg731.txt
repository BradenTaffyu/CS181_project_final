2016 the great adam kovic once described far cry 3 as skyrim with guns unintentionally spawning a series of mock comparisons that became its own meme now it has come full circle because fallout 4 can be described as far cry 3 with nukes this game is no longer an rpg it s an open world action game with rpg elements you don t hold exciting well written conversations you shoot people in the head you don t solve intriguing quests you shoot everyone in the area in the head you don t make morally ambiguous choices and join sides you shoot everyone the game throws at you in the head that s because shooting slashing and blowing up hordes of interchangeable enemies is the only kind of game progression bethesda knows and that would be fine if they weren t making a long awaited sequel to one of the greatest richest and most imaginative rpg franchises of all time instead of role playing possibilities and freedom of choice that new vegas nailed so well we got a dumbed down action game that limits your options at every chance you can t really play as a bad guy you can t toy with the special points to create wildly different character builds and each playthrough will be more or less the same core rpg elements deep mechanics and good writing were put aside and replaced by crafting and base building which at least from the 2 3 of dlc seem to be bethesda s main focus unfortunatelly neither the building nor the combat mechanics are deep enough to support the game on their own despite improving upon previous bethesda games it s a pity because the beautifully designed colorful environments and great weather effects give the world a unique eerie atmosphere unlike any game in recent memory and the improved gameplay aspects present a functional structure for a potentially great game if only that shell was filled with worthwile content
