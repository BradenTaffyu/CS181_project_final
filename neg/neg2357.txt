2023 this is the last game i will ever purchase from ubisoft it requires two separate launchers the steam game client and the ubisoft game client called ubisoft connect when you click play on the steam client it passes an evoke command to the ubisoft connect which launches the game for you and not steam the game will not even start if the ubisoft connect isn t running to play anno 1800 ubisoft runs ubisoft connect 5 separate web connect processes denuvo anti tamper and vm protect drm software in the background and requires both a third party eula and a 3rd party ubisoft account ubisoft connect is like steam with regards to its functionality and appears to collect similar game data as steam does tracking your game progress etc however after you close the game down and shut down the steam client the ubisoft connect and its 5 web connect processes still run in the background collecting data on who knows what and the only way to shut them down is to manually terminate them one at a time within the windows task manager steam is just an intermediary here in addition to this when i played the game in offline mode it only permitted me to be offline for about 10 days maximum until it demanded me to go online for no other reason other but for sync my data with the ubisoft connect game servers if you do not go online the game won t start at all but is as dead as a brick only after you connect online again will ubisoft connect permit you to play the game this is not written anywhere that could see before i bought the game i ve played other games offline that i bought on steam for 10 months in the past but it appears that anno 1800 has no 100 offline mode at all this makes me believe that it s ubisoft s brute force way of forcing us to share our data with them i submitted a support ticket to ubisoft asking them why the ubisoft client and its processes were running in the background after the game was terminated and the steam client shut down and after the 3rd week on the 22nd day they still have not responded i then received a generic message from them stating that ubisoft had not heard back from me and asked if i wanted to close the ticket i replied on the ticket that i still needed their response to my initial inquiry and later that day i received the same response again stating that they did not hear from me and asked if i wanted to close the ticket again their customer service system appears to be designed to delay defer and deny helping customers and it appears to be 100 bot driven because the ticket had no customer service rep name assigned to it sorry folks there are no live human beings overseeing customer support needs but there sure are real people available and ready to help you hand over your hard earned money for another game purchase ubisoft customer support service is horrendous at best and by far it is one of the worst experiences i have ever had from a game developer hands down i will never buy another game from them period as for anno 1800 it was very fun and enjoyable most of the time however after a while i noticed that the game uses various mechanics to divert your attention from managing citizens in an increasing manner through using constant distractions and incident interruptions which evolve into very large time sinks like 90 minutes or greater of side tracking from in game events of the ai captain captain we need your immediate attention now then a fire has erupted in your city then a bit later an explosion has occurred in one of your factories then several messages of your ships are being attacked by pirates then several ai characters in game asked me to help them on time sensitive missions and i declined because i was already fixing 5 problems and managing things on the fianc screen such as supply chains at the current time then i get another your citizens are rioting in the streets then one of the artisans chimes with an aggravated snarky tone of voice stating that he s moving out i then checked why he was moving out and it was because he wanted more rum supplied even though he was well supplied at about 70 of rum on his lifestyle need meter then on and on the craziness went the game continually harasses you by generating increasing and repetitive problems even though i had more than enough countermeasures like firehouses police stations harbor defenses etc so now you get the picture of what the devs designed in the game as being fun after i resolved the plethora of problems i completely forgot what i was originally working on 90 minutes beforehand after another 4 hours went by the game told me that i needed to take a break and stretch my legs etc so i decided to take a permanent break instead lol i don t mind a few interruptions however the increasingly repetitive occurrences of these and other events combined developed in me higher degrees of diminished enjoyment and it ultimately caused me to believe that the game is designed with tedium in mind instead of enjoyment this caused me to feel burnout and i lost both zeal and desire to play it because my time invested felt unrewarded i tried to like anno 1800 and get as much out of it as possible however as i racked more playing hours i realized that the game is designed to restrict you from having the ability to take a minute to think at all because there is no active pause mode in the game at all anno 1800 is extremely repetitious it forces you to rebuild the same settlements on different islands but they look different and have different needs however if you build one house of each citizen tier in the game you have seen them all i like the blueprint methodology however it doesn t work well because islands are shaped differently and many do not have appropriate land space to accommodate your blueprint designs the reason why i finally put the game down besides what i stated above is that there is a problem within the finance data where i discovered that citizen lifestyle needs demand aren t included in the overall population demand calculation even after 6 hours of playing later in the day this causes overall demand consumption to be understated when looking at the specific citizen tier and also overstates the supply thus they aren t in true equilibrium per the fianc screen data this caused me to make manual notes outside of the game to keep track of specific production rates for specific goods with the affected citizen classes with notes of my rationale for each this game was released in 2019 and it s still not fixed the devs should ve corrected it in the first place what this game comes down to is how well you manage your cities to generate the highest rate of coins per minute at the lowest total maintenance cost if you do not have 100 accurate finance data you re automatically exposed to have weaknesses in fiduciary management which the game a i takes advantage of very well the finance screen is not perfect and i get it however it annoyed me that it hasn t been fixed since the game was released i had well over 7 500 people at various levels under my management therefore i needed accurate data period that isn t a lot to ask for tl dr beware of ubisoft s practices towards its customers i rate ubisoft with trash can quality customer service think twice before deciding on ubisoft games you have been officially warned
