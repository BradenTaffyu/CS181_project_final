2017 early access review a16 killed this game for me go into an empty room do a 360 bam 3 zombies magically appear minibikes which i thought were fixed are a glitchy nightmare and not worth the hassle to make the grind to get steel is just a roadblock that serves to only keep you playing longer but for me doesn t increase the fun animals yeah i saw one once do underground candles attract zombies mine apparently do i don t run a server but apparently corruption is a thing that made the server i played on have to do a 2nd full wipe about a week after a16 launched that was the final straw for me this game has been in alpha long enough fix it or hire some devs who know more than the current set
