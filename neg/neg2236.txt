2014 this game started out as a very fun exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing but now that they ve patched and updated several more times it has lost its fun factor due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed levels etc without paying money i started playing while they still had levelled planes and such and that was when you could buy the planes without research points which now you have to buy with real money and so you re stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy one plane one you d think that you could buy two or maybe three but when you play a battle your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles so if you get this game and think you re going to coast through to the top level be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there
