2016 pros warhammer universe easy to pickup if you re a newcomer to the total war series small variety of new units and mechanics to total war expanded general and hero systems modding community fixes most of the basic shortcommings conquer anywhere mod cons lacks a ton of depth lots of mechanics from classic total war are now gone only two true religions chaos and vampirism both of which can just be mitigated and don t massivley affect your gameplay unit management is very dumbed down from other titles dlc is stupidly expensive 15 for a single faction really and it s just another horde faction too the only real work went into modling them i d reccomend the base game if you truly love the warhammer universe otherwise you re not missing much skipping out on this total war title
