2019 alright i ve had enough i do not see myself finishing the game at this point i don t know why i don t enjoy this one as much as the first despite calling that game a flawed masterpiece but there s just something unappealing about almost forcing yourself to min max to make progress through the campaign quest line on paper there s a lot to like the graphics are improved the writing is improved the pre generated characters have interesting side stories there are more classes and abilities and the story is much longer if you re looking for a strict value oriented game you will get your mileage and then some out of this title however the experience has so many peaks and valleys that it is hard to settle on a given impression it seems like they looked at the first game and instead of asking themselves what about the game had worked and what could use work they just decided to add more of everything while yes this does mean that there are more good things there are just as many if not more bad things case in point the unique environment effects spell system from the first game they somehow managed to overload and trivialize the entire system you have all of these new and interesting spells introduced some of which requiring source to use yet in order for any of these spells to take effect at all the magic defense on an enemy must be reduced to zero or have a spell that can remove the armor and then apply an effect what this means is you can t enfeeble or improvise as easily as you could have in the first game unless you are fighting enemies with no magic defense this is soul crushing especially if you re the type of rpg player that likes to assess the environment or your inventory for spells and situations that can turn the tide of a one sided fight despite all this almost every encounter is drenched with spell affected surfaces that friendly fire becomes a guarantee also whoever thought that blood should augment air shock based spells should really get their head examined yes i understand that it is a kind of liquid but in game this means if your party is standing in a pool of blood from a human enemy they are all going to get shocked if not stunned outright why not just use two spell casters to take down enemies by defense type instead of collectively fair point but that is not how the balance in this game works some enemies have tons of armor or tons of magic defense some have tons of both while i m sure i could look up an ideal party build and copy it for maximum success that is not how i want to play an rpg i never felt like i had to do that with the first game why should i conform to a widely accepted build to ensure consistent success and that too is the biggest frustration with this game battles can feel worthwhile and interesting it is a thrill to overcome staggering odds and find a viable strategy that works the reality is that there is no organic pathfinding you must complete the vast majority of side content to be at the appropriate level to complete the main quest this means that you have to talk to almost every npc try out every quest you go to one fight oh everyone is two levels higher than you guess you need to come back you try another location still everyone is higher than you so you try again until you find the right location only to find that if you continue in that general direction you ll be ok to back track in the next few levels i am fine with doing this from time to time and was pretty common in the first game as well the primary difference between the two is that they designed the first world more line a linear pathway where the second one feels like a star pattern head north then east then teleport then try west then teleport south it s just scattered you ll be using quick save and quick load out of necessity it s not due to your own personal skill but because this game has no way of telegraphing you may not be ready for this encounter quest other than a cheap kill or stun locked fight for full disclosure there is a friendly reminder if you ve accidentally stumbled into an encounter that you are not leveled for but this is usually after the boss harder enemy has 1st turn melted you and some of your party members into ash yes in game tip i ll be sure to run from this fight once i run away from the 8 enemies who all have to take their turns first this is not challenge this is just poor design i have no problems being punished for something i messed up on but getting hit with a frying pan as i make a discovery in your game world is not punishment it is looney toons i genuinely wanted to enjoy my time with this game and was prepared to give it a lot of slack but thinking critically this game is more an exercise in patience and less an enjoyable experience a huge time sink with minimal reward edit i am giving this game another shot after roughly a year between the last attempt knowing what to expect i ve optimized my party to be more synergistic and less wacky freeform i may change this review depending on my experiences edit2 sorry sticking to my guns on this one what ends up happening just before you hit endgame at least with my composition is that your stats gear become so powerful trading is practically redundant and newly dropped gear is a minor improvement at best this would be acceptable if it were at endgame but i still had quite a few hours of gameplay to go the initial challenge wears off and its just a matter of seeing the story to its conclusion and i wasn t all that invested to begin with still a great game to try if you find it on a sale just be prepared for a hefty time investment
