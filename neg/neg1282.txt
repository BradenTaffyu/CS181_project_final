2016 to me this game is good but its not a good fallout game this game has lot of new interesting features like the new looting system and the settelment building but the mostly this game was a disappointment at least to me the lack of interesting side quests and the role playing in this game is like not even there i hope in the future bethesda will not make the same mistakes i hope they will remember what makes fallout a good game
