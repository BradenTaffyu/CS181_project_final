2018 early access review i like this game it s fun it has good idea good over world but development is soooooo sloooooooow it has soon been 4 5 years since this game came available in steam and it s still in alpha with no optimizations majority of things is handled by a single core of the cpu and even it not fully the framerate is playable if you have hardware for it and the performance degrades the longer you play and run around i run ryzen 5 1600 with gtx 1080 and when i first open the game i get a nice 70 80fps but after awhile of playing the game is freezing and dropping frames with average fps often under 40 the gpu is utilized only by about 30 40 and 1 cpu core is running only at roughly 70 with no other cores being used by the game with the price tag of 23 and over 4 years in alpha i cannot recommend this
