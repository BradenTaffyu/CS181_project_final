2015 don t get me wrong it s totally fun but they just took the authentic fallout experience and made it into something it s not there are lots of essential characters only sometimes 4 dialog options hardly any choices whatsoever 3 factions who basically want you to do the same exact thing and very grindish and repetitive settlement building another thing that bugs me is this look at fallout new vegas they had loads of unique weapons that had different attachments and a custom look to them which made them unique and desirable 4 has uniquely named weapons but they have the same exact look as every other weapon and the same attachments they just get a little boost such as faster firing or does more crit damage etc theres a serious lack of content in 4 due to the crafting system it seems they really scrapped a lot of the different weapons and armor that they could have used in 4 it s worth buying but you start to notice how poor the experience is compared to the previous titles
