i don t recommend it right this minute it s actually a really good game other than the camera logic which needs improvement it never zooms the camera in or out in a straight line i get dizzy because it never quite looks where it ought to and that s the least bad thing worse is when i m trying to zoom in for a view of a battle and it suddenly dips and swirls because it randomly decided to focus on a fighter and no there s no setting to tell it not to do that crap but the real kicker is sometimes it just goes absolutely bananas and whizzes away from everything they even know this can happen because when it does a focus on homeworld button appears at the bottom so they know and decided not to fix it which is a kick in the teeth so yeah camera logic needs improvement really bad and i won t recommend the game until it gets it but once it does this ll be a real winner ending on a positive note this is one of the best performing games i ve seen for its level of sheer beauty i just really hope they fix the cameras update it looks like the not going in a straight line problem was caused by the game being in zoom to cursor mode instead of zooming straight in and out to or from the cursor first it zooms in or out from the center of the screen then adjusts sideways to center on the cursor which causes a very weird feeling when i look at it zoom to cursor mode also seems to automatically focus on the nearest ship to the cursor which is bad if it says zoom to cursor i want it to zoom to the cursor not to something else nearby this also causes the randomly focusing on a fighter problem as when you re zooming in towards a battle there s usually going to be a fighter somewhere near the cursor so zoom in to focus on a battle and whoosh your point of view is flying off into the sunset not sure if the pov whizzes off into nowhere and i can t find anything problem is also related i ll have to test it more
