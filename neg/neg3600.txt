2023 early access review the devs completely ruined the immersion in this latest update i guess they wanted new players to die of dehydration so they removed the ability to collect and purify ground water the jars have been replaced with an idiotic dew collecting station that attracts zombie hordes for some reason now when you consume a beverage the jar it was in that was reusable until now complete vanishes from your inventory this makes hydration even more tedious than it used to be in previous patches you will have to actively spend many hours collecting dew from these new stations rather than just throwing a couple jars of dirty water in the campfire and purifying it passively until the devs correct this i would not recommend this to new players
