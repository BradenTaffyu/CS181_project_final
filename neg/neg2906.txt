2018 i used to like this game before 2 0 but now i can honestly say i ll never buy anything from paradox ever again while the mechanics are ok paradox has been stripping features and putting in way too much dlc they took away what i considered a core feature multiple types of ftl engine and at this point i fully expect them to roll it into future dlc and make that dlc quasi mandatory to play if anyone reading this wants to know why i turned sour at this game it s because stellaris isn t the same game i bought originally it keeps getting its core features stripped and unnecessarily made more complicated or simple both in the worse places i can think of on top of that paradox recently demanded that anyone who wants to play 1 9 1 before 2 0 or any earlier version has to register a paradox account i don t want to get a paradox account and i resent that i can t easily control the program i already have downloaded on my pc for this i consider my experience with paradox so bad that i will forever warn anyone i know away from games or products by paradox in addition i shall never purchase anything from them again on a final note i have multiple friends who feel quite strongly like i do when one of them decided to take this to the steam forums he was banned not for profanity or anything like that but rather the moderator a paradox employee banned him for saying mean things my friend did not insult anyone he only outlined his problems with the game and ways he thought it could be improved upon as a result of his experience i honestly have no hope that this review will remain posted but i wanted to act out how i could against what i consider to be a horrible company edit while all my opinions remain valid i will say that it is an enjoyable game i can t recommend it financially so expensive to play or say you should support paradox but it is a game i return to i paid for it so i might as well the things above were said in righteous anger and i don t think i m wrong about any of it but i also figured i should add in this bit all this time later it s been almost 2 years since i posted it as of this edit that being said it s because of how paradox treated this game that i have yet to and will likely never buy any other paradox game like europa universalis or hearts of iron despite those games looking fantastic and right up my alley
