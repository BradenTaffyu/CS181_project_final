2021 i would recommend it on its own if it fit the price and if it hadn t just become dlc the actions of creative assembly are vile predatory and incredibly scummy i am going to have to recommend against buying any ca product if only out of principle but this series in particular as it requires you to pay incredible amounts of money to experience any single game s intended factions and maps i highly recommend avoiding all creative assembly products at this time or at the very least waiting for them to go on steep sales
