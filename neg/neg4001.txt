2015 this is not technically a negative review it lies on the middle ground between recommending the game and not recommending it trouble is steam doesn t have a button for that so i had to click the no button when choosing whether or not to recommend this game this game may seem cheap 5 99 at the time of writing this review but that s because it isn t much of a game on its own there s only so much you can do in sandbox by yourself and trouble in terrorist town ttt is completely useless with less than 3 players mulitiplayer isn t much better in the vanilla game since joining most servers will require you to wait for ages as the server s custom content is downloaded this game owes most if not all its popularity to the huge number of mods available on the workshop it is slightly worrying therefore that the game s creator supports the idea of paying for mods another big problem is that most of the mods available make use of assets from games like counter strike source team fortess 2 and the half life 2 episodes meaning you have to buy them if you want to use those mods this makes gmod much more expensive than it looks and why not just include these assets in gmod itself rather than make people spend an extra 25 on games they will probalby never play just to be able to use mods that will almost certainly be uninstalled somewhere down the line that being said there are some decent mods on the workshop all you have to do to find them is make it past page upon page of unintersting and poorly made dupes saves and general crap however issues aside this game can be quite fun if you re playing on a local server with only your friends because at least then your fun won t be ruined by the abusive immature and annoying community this statement refers only to the majority of the community some people are alright if i was rating gmod on just its content mods maps lan multiplayer etc i would definitely recommend it because i ve had hours of fun with it sadly i have to consider the community and the online severs when reviewing the game and those factors prevent me from recommending it because they suck overall this game isn t much fun to play by yourself but throw in a couple of friends on a local server and you ve got yourself enough fun to last an hour or two or 700 in my case just stay away from the online servers if you can and if you can t then i strongly advise you to mute the voice chat
