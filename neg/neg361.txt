if you like the idea of artificial restrictions i e how much scrap you can keep that you use to build with this game is for you it definitely gives you the illusion of fallout but really it s a gimmicky cash shop with a handful of different currencies like 4 5 where you re basically forced into annoyance by being encumbered which then leads you to buying a subscription or quitting like me bethesdas future doesn t look too bright and i fear that es6 is going the same route just look at their latest release starfield and tell me you are confident
