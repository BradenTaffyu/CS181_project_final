2023 damn this review really hurts to write but it must be written as someone who has seen every stage of the payday franchise and has been with them since the beginning i can only concur with the negative reviews i remember the golden days of payday the heist and even more the golden era of payday 2 2014 2015 overkill was on top of the world they created an addicting product that i spent countless hours with the same three people it felt like we were truly a crew i even joined cash net a group of amazing 1 ers dedicated to the best of the best that the payday franchise offered at the highest difficulty i had become an overqualified fan sinking countless hours into their game after all that then came the loot safes which turned payday on its head overkill slowly recovered and made a decent comeback after the announcement came of payday 3 surely after learning from their mistakes they were going to honor their roots with a hybrid of both titles like they promised nope now after seeing what they were can be and this steaming pile of bad decision making i can only say that a game about greed and robbery is what paydays legacy has become i mean in 2023 how the f ck can you force people into a connection based game with poor stability and no reconnect option the matchmaking is non existent so most of your game time is finding a match i can get past the challenge based progression but seriously no xp on completing a heist on overkill forcing people to play other things they really could care less about to get levels is medieval at best however the best part is when the server no russians you mid heist and you lose all your work which happens frequently even after their stability update speaking of updates this game has had the longest period without patches i have ever seen with a newly released aaa game the very few patches they did after about two months of silence have been ridiculously light and skating around the big elephants of stability qol and common sense today they released two legacy heists from payday 2 with the revolutionary addition of a pre game lobby chat yes two months for a pre game lobby chat ignoring of course the major issues that have dried up the player base for this game i mean you can not keep pulling a todd howard redoing old content to buy time with your angry fan base this is not f cking skyrim long story short they really put on the clown masks during game production will they pull a rabbit out of their ass that has yet to be seen do not buy until if they fix their damn game you will only be a disappointed fan like me
