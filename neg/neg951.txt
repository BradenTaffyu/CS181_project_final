2022 it s a decent game but a bad fallout game if you play fallout for it s story and world building then you will dislike this game if you want to waste time building settlements and shooting things then it s worth a play though there are a lot of great mods that will make this game more playable without mods this game is nothing but a boring shooter with a lackluster story
