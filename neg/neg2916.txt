2017 i wanted to give the game a fair shot as it s a very slow burn especially for a 4x the fleet battles are frankly a joke technological advancement just makes ships exponentially more expensive with a power level that doesn t scale the same this is a well documented issue it s purely a death stack game there are certainly missed opportunities for tactics using formations planetary cover and techs that would make fleet battles more interesting like stealth subsystem targeting etc for the first few encounters the little story missions are interesting that ends fairly quickly as you repeatedly encounter the same ones over and over the rng of universe generation seems to be a total crapshoot with massive distances between any systems with planets not to mention whether they are even habitable this can make the early game really slow especially if you have a close neighbor breathing down your neck the game lacks real depth that is not to say that it isn t complex but i ve yet to see how the political and social systems really impact the game in a meaningful way everything is eventually overcome by tech or traditions making the evolution of your empire feel artificial the complexity therefore is smoothed over into a bland mid to late game experience that relies on crises to give you a reason to continue playing edit 08 12 17 i wanted to see if there was something about this game that i was missing so i kept playing because i want to like this game here s what i learned the only means of victory is war that s it there is no political scientific or social means to win there might be the appearance of such means but they do not really exist federations are a joke if you re in one expect to be the only person contributing because the pace of the game is so terribly slow expect to devote days to a single game only to have a surprise fallen empire show up declare war and wipe you out of existence
