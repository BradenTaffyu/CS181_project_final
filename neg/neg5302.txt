2023 i ve easily spent hundreds of hours in this game prior to steam release it s a fantastic mtg adaptation with a bit of planning and light grind perfectly playable as f2p but the monetisation is an ass fomo baiting season pass and predatory pricing gem amounts incentivising to purchase more than you need also wotc are not really the friendliest company out there and it does crash from time to time forcing you to restart asap to not lose the match
