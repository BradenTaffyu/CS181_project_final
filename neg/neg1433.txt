2020 early access review taleworlds i honestly love you and your games but after 60 hours of looking i just couldn t find a single one of the things i really hoped for in bannerlord it looks good it has some interesting features but no it s no game changing step in the m b series in many situations it just feels like warband with better graphics and i hoped for so much more what bothers me the most daggers and throwing knives they are still useless why would you allow two handed swords as civilian grade items but mark daggers as military you gave us a pretty useless rogue skilltree with a pretty late option of using any one handed weapon but why bother my 68cutdmg bidenhander counts as civilian and the thugs limbs go brrrrr most of the quests still feel so depthless i played mods for warband with better scripted quests why didn t you develop in this instance sieges are still a late game only experience why are these bandit camps still long and scattered over the whole forest it s the perfect opportunity to give the player a mini siege of a scraply build bandit fort but nooooooo smithing in this game is so broken it the no one moneymaking machine the trading mechanics are a joke against leveling yous smithing with cheap materials until you unlock a decent chopping blade and then mass produce it for 10 000 gp each even 110000 pp before the latest nerf and be the richest fricking smithing apprentice in all of calradia these are just some of my impressions i hope modders will soon save the fun in bannerlord
