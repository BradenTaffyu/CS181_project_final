2019 we still like the idea of chapter packs that explore other chapters of the romance of the three kingdoms though the next one will be more recognisable to the majority of players creative assembly continued we re also working on dlc that adds significantly to the main campaign and are continuing to look at how that might develop and grow into some much bigger dlcs over time i m so glad you like this mini campaign crap since you seem to enjoy it so very much i am sure you as developers wont mind buying the rest of us though hard pass push out some more stuff like eight princes and i ll happily not buy the next dlc too
