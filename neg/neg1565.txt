2020 early access review an absolutely terrible successor to warband every facet of multiplayer is markedly worse and the experience overall is far less enjoyable people will make noise about this game being in early access but taleworlds has consistently demonstrated that multiplayer is not their priority and they couldn t care less about the feedback and suggestions they receive from their players i m not sure how you spend 8 years developing a game and miss the mark so spectacularly but taleworlds should be supremely embarrassed by bannerlord s multiplayer experience 6k hours in warband leader of west knights wk the best competitive clan in warband
