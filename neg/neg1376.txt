2022 i couldn t tell you how long the fans of mount blade had to wait for the release of bannerlord but it was a long time so i think it s safe to say that we were all excited when the game was finally released in early access naturally an early access game is going to have frequent updates this while annoying is to be expected as the game is still in development yet after full release what we are still left is a game full of bugs exploits unbalanced gameplay and an underwhelming ui that leaves players unsatisfied and wanting more the game is incomplete and vanilla bannerlord is unplayable the solution to this is to allow the same modding community that kept warband alive for years while taleworlds sat and twiddled their thumbs to do the same for bannerlord instead what we continue to get is mod breaking updates and a useless digital companion dlc don t buy this game for at least 5 years after release this gives taleworlds time to off and the modding community a stable version where they can add and fix what taleworlds is incapable of doing
