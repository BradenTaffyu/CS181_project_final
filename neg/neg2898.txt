2019 as someone that created what were two highly popular mods 200k subs for this title i find this review hard to write i feel like the dev process has become a combination of they don t know what they want stellaris to be coupled with absolute confusion as to the games current and future status they re increasingly making changes to the core game its features and its systems that stellaris now feels and plays like an empty shell of random convolution and streamlining in favor of ease of use while at the same time introducing components that make absolutely no sense seldom work and at times are completely convoluted almost every major update brings a host of changes no one asked for these range from travel propulsion systems colonization and system expansion to policies and governmental decisions actions and the outright removal of previous features why would any developer remove a feature beloved or hated without compensating for it perhaps what s most dismaying about stellaris in its current form is that it doesn t seem salvageable its problems are as much conceptual as they are pragmatic
