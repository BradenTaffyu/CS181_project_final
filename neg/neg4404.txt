2021 i loved civ 5 so i had high hopes for this game but it just feels unfinished i struggle to believe that anybody play tested almost anything it introduced several interesting new mechanics and there s some really good ideas there but in the state that it s in i just can t recommend this game to anyone the pros the map art looks amazing natural disasters are fun the tech tree ui combat and general gameplay mechanics are all on par with civ 5 although this certainly wasn t the case when the game was released the cons eternal forest fires that make some maps unplayable the secret societies doesn t really work you basically just get a bunch of free governor titles in the ancient age if they re turned on some civs are so broken it s not even funny babylon can enter the modern era while everybody else is still in the classical age mali can purchase unlimited units for free on certain game modes etc etc the loading times oh dear god the loading times this game crashes a lot the character art is fugly and disgusting are you playing on a team with a human player there s an emergency that will occur occasionally that requires other players to give you as much gold as possible to win just pass the gold between yourselves for the next dozen turns it s a guaranteed win no seriously it will crash it s not your fault it s literally broken code good luck finding out which of the 9 723 reasons is responsible for you not being able to finish this game you ve spent 12 hours on half of those 12 hours were spent looking at a loading screen usually because the game crashed there s a global warming system which causes sea levels to rise this will break certain maps and cause the game to crash it s still loading just buy all of the ai s cities because you can still loading i think maybe something s gone wrong again buy all of the ai s great works as well because you can also do that at almost no cost oh look it s finally loaded aaaand it crashed and started re loading again i m pretty sure the devs are done with this game now so i m fairly certain this game won t be getting finished which is a pity because there was so much potential here
