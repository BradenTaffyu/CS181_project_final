2016 i ve loved paradox games since hoi2 putting god knows how many hours into them even when the launch product is kinda bad ie every game except ck2 paradox patches expands them up to a great state hell victoria 2 just got a new patch a few months ago and that game is 6 years old problem is starting with ck2 success went to paradox s head first they moved their new games to steam exclusivity then johann and frederik saw how much money they were making then looked at how much money clash of clans was making and realized just how dumb their prior business model was and how dumb supercell was at the same time why should people buy a game once or be given it for free when they can be made to buy it forever and ever and ever welcome to dlc hell guys where the dlc never stops coming
