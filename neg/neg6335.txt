2023 i would love to recommend this game cause witches and wizards but the story is very bland and boring especially towards the end the facial expressions and animations go well with the story boring and bland as well my biggest problem is the side puzzles and collectibles they are all the exact same in some games you can get lost in the world exploring example skyrim but in this one the collectibles and puzzles that are all the same make exploring lose its fun hogwarts really makes it feel like a chore you do not want to do i finally finished the game but i had to take a loong break cause trying to get everything collected crushed me once i did come back to it i just decided to finish the story companion stories which also were meh on a side you get to be a witch or a wizard and do spells pew pew if you find this game on sale go for it i wouldn t pay the full price
