2023 i ve played civ 6 for 110 hours i have 1000 hours in civ 5 in my old steam account and i ve played civ 4 as well civ 6 seems the best among all others but it is the worse it has brilliant mechanics and quite fun game play if you don t fight with others ai is sucks at war except the early eras after classical era ai is nothing you can just go and conquer eveyone on the map i ve tested in many games and it is just like that ai makes just a small army once you kill them you can have the rest of the country without any problem if you want to play a city building game culture science religion victory civ 6 is the best of all the best but if you like conquering cities losing cities struggling to survive play civ 4 or 5
