2022 good there aren t many this kinds of 4x games and stellaris is very tempting as it does some things right it can sometimes have very good mood and when everything works it can be really cool especially the first game is quite good also i like the star system starbase mechanics and the battle mechanics they ve also improved the economy system a lot over the years for roleplayers the game is ok as you can create many different kinds of democracies or other forms of governments many kinds of species or planets can be found terraformed etc this is something paradox has been concentrating for a long time to bring more stuff but for a long time they haven t been really making the game deeper or work better bad in short looks great first but is empty from the inside many different events but in the end all they give you is 500 minerals or 500 physics science they are not that interesting or well made that i would really want to read them anymore the game keeps having interesting things you want to try and do a dyson sphere a ringworld end game crisis or an robotic intelligence faction but then in the end they doesn t matter because it all feels the same and doesn t really have any interesting mechanics and i don t want to even go to ai it s so horrible that it shatters the mood it also needs to cheat a lot so that it would keep up even a bit technology is mostly just boring and as the possible technologies appear randomly each time there s no tactic or strategy that you could choose from usually also something stupid happens with some mechanic that ruins the game for example great khan end crisis launched right next to my borders which is actually relatively cool i like the end crises and i finally felt the end game started to be more interesting khan was able to get few star systems from me until i gathered all my ships that were currently at war with some other state right when i started to push back the khan leader died and the country was separated to two different however the war didn t continue and i didn t have any claims to systems the khan just conquered while each claim would cost lots of influence this is just so stupid replayability looks good at first but you end up doing same things similar expansion similar economy and boring technology start is always the same and gets boring really fast midgame is the best part but gets boring at the late midgame end game is always the same while there can sometimes be something interesting happening from the late midgame to endgame the game has way too much stupid micro no button for builder ships to autobuild all resource spots or lots of small sectors that can be automized but is quite clumsy while simultaneously it s very clumsy to change for example economy balances bought the game before it was published and i ve been following since until few dlcs ago this game is very pretty from outside but has no heart or soul same goes for all paradox games nowadays especially hoi4 it didn t use to be so as some of the best games for me ever have been hoi3 ck2 victoria 2 and eu3 please don t give paradox anymore money they don t deserve it they already got mine now uninstalling the stellaris for the final time
