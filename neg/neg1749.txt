2018 update in 2023 after ruining the game even more with seasons and limited time vehicles that can even give advantages to the players gaijin keep attempting to milk what is at the core an awesome game by increasing even more the costs update after 3 years 2018 the game got worse now on top of the already existing unparalleled anti consumer practices they added battle passes and drove the prices in the player market to extremes the game requires now all your free time or a large part of your wallet even in that case you will never be able to get all the vehicles so if you have a completionist urge and are not interested in spending 2000 for a vehicle stay away original review 2015 i am playing war thunder since the beta when unlocking planes was actually enjoyable and there were no stock useless vehicles many new simpleminded fans that defend gaijin don t know that this game didn t have a research system back then while now it even has the same spotting mechanics of world of tanks although they re more refined like pretty much every aspect of the game this one can be considered as a semi sim with also an arcade mode i own a premium account since release and most premium vehicles please read it trough the end because this review is not about the quality of its gameplay it goes beyond that i hope gaijin will notice the reviews and understand why the population has dropped trough the years with an average of 80 100k players online before the 1 37 when there was no research system to an average of 30 40k with tanks too triple the content less than half population after all the miscommunications bugs being fixed a year after the community notified it disliked events introduction of loot boxes to get old limited events vehicles and more and the continuous mocking and hostility of the moderator stona towards members of the community even when they only ask for changes to the balancement or japanese prototype tanks they have a poor tree and are unplayable i thought that i had to write a new review for the game what can i say the war thunder has gone a long way since then new nations an entire new tank based game ground forces and the announcement of the both ships and helicopters in the near future it s sad to see the player base dropping costantly every year since the 100k that were when we had only planes to 20 30k unfortunately while the content has slowly got better the progression has not i also made the horrible choice to grind japan while the first two tiers are enjoyable by free2players too the higher we go on the research tree the worst it get to a point where dying may even give you a negative amount of money to me with a premium account and 50 premium tanks with extra rewards it may not be a problem but it is to anyone else the grinding for research points gets tedious since mid game for tanks and late game for planes and you have to consider also the amount of money needed to do everything do you want to buy an unlocked vehicle buy it do you want to equip it to a crew pay even 290k for top tiers do you want to shoot buy the ammo is it broken buy the repair service what about events pay for the ticket sure it is immersive to pay for some features but all of this balance create a lot of issues to other players and what about the modifications when you research and buy a vehicle it doesn t come at his max potential it s a stock vehicle with basic ammo a worst engine and whatsoever if you re interested in planes you should be good your plane will be usually worse than the others but you ll be able to play and slowly spade it i e max it oh you re interested in tanks then welcome to hell to make a tank playable you usually need at least two upgrades parts and fpe parts is an upgrade that let you repair your vehicle fpe is an extinguisher to put off the fire to get the fpe you first need to unlock another upgrade so a total of 3 upgrades are necessary many tanks are also useless at their battle rating another issue which i ll describe later and to make them playable you ll need advanced ammo which may request up to 4 5 upgrades first hey but i just unlocked the parts with one match heh sure it s good to play at rank i ii when you only 2 5k research points each at rank v vi it becomes 16 24k even 40k in some cases imagine having to grind 16k average f2p gets 2 3k i think when it actually get kills a premium player with a premium vehicle usually get 10k without penetrating ammo without being able to repair as soon as something hit you and with the survivability of a dodo what if i matchmake your tank to an higher battle rating owww damn your tank exploded right away it was expectable indeed pay me 8k please to repair it repeat that for every new vehicle you ll unlock welcome to ground forces fortunately you can pay to buy a rank iv v premium vehicle and enjoy the bonus rewards and a fully spaded tank 49 99 over your sanity and don t forget to buy the experience for your crew or they will suck always even after 200hr you will not have enough experience to max a single crew and you ll pay real money to do that last about that battle rating i mentioned it basically represent the strenght of a tank on a fictional tier list it influence the matchmaking whenever you queue the game uses your highest rated vehicle in your formation and searches for other players with the same battle rating or a fluctuation of 1 1 if you use a 6 7 tank you may end up with other tanks from 5 7 to 7 7 obviously the chance you will end up in a 7 7 match are 80 and guess what most tanks will become extremely hard to play and if lacking fpe parts ammo the may become completely useless mix all of that and do your math it s a well made game fun varied and with both arcade and simulative modes but this is really infuriating and has to stop get back on track gaijin will never read this but by making these two small changes they would make it surely more fun and bring back the community the reduced matchmaking would be compensated by bigger numbers i d also remove the parts from the game but i guess that s too much to ask to gaijin 50 rewards to all vehicles they use visible under every vehicle to balance the rewards reduce the matchmaking from 1 1 to 0 7 0 7 there are more than 1000 vehicles right now at least 3 more than when it started it s time to reduce the grinding to these new standards even more if we include the upcoming ships the italian army and the mentioned two new nations in the next years how is a new player supposed to reach rank iii iv in three different modes and multiple nations most new players stop after third fourth rank of a single nation i am sure that letting them focus on more nations wouldn t reduce the income they will probably end up buying more premium vehicles
