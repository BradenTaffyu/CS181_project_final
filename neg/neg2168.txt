2015 the game seems so good at first glance almost revolutionary but it is everything but good it is really a pain you play great flight sims like cliffs of dover battle of stalingrad or rise of flight just to find out that the multiplayer servers are ghost towns then you try out war thunder you are amazed by the graphics the amount of content and the huge playerbase and it is even free to play but your amazement doesn t last for long 1 the matchmaking first you start to realize the matchmaking is more than a little off espacially playing the german tech tree is a pain in the arse if you pay attention and have a little knowledge about these ww2 vehicles you will notice that there is a huge time rift between the planes you are flying as germany and the planes the allied forces fly in the same match but it doesn t stop there it isn t just the germans who suffer the entire game consists of sealclubbing and getting sealclubbed the gamemechanics themselves support this by controlling everything for you by mouseaiming and target markers so that seemingly the only thing that matters is the vehicles performance at this point you might think yes sure matchmaking is bad but the game is still in beta so it will eventually get better after the next patch no it won t i m playing this game for three years now and have invested houndreds of hours into it didn t play it from steam and i can tell you it gets worse and worse after each patch 2 flight models realistic battles and simulator battles if you are like me and you aren t interested in arcade games you will probably go straight into realistic or simulator battles the problem is that most of war thunders player base is concentrated around arcade battles so the other two game modes get less and less attention by the devellopers each patch they are basically removing content from these gamemodes instead of improoving them for exemple since one patch that has been released this year realistic battles now have mixed factions you will fly in an american plane side by side with a japanese one to shoot down germans and brits that is what they call realistic now same goes on with the flight models almost all flight models in the game are placeholders some of them seriously broken just to name two simple examples with the japanese biplanes you where able to fly up straight into the air without stalling and reaching heights in which the pilot would probably freeze and suffocate the bf 109 on the other hand gets its combat flaps ripped off when reaching speeds over 300kph but what does gaijin do about it nothing since three years we get in every new patch new vehicles to attract new players and the old flight models remain untouched 3 the root of all evil gaijin itself the problem with this game is not its engine or its game concept its the company behind it gaijins aim is to make quick money with this game moneymaking is nothing bad and every company needs to make money to survive but gaijin has taken a rout which pisses on its playerbase in the worst possible fashion how does gaijin make money do you need to pay money to play the game no is it pay to win kind of but thats not the main problem what is the main problem then the main problem is that gaijin doesn t aim to earn money with long time players but with players that jump in get a first glance of the game are amazed and pay money to get quickly to their favourite vehicles gaijin doesn t care that these players will soon realize that they have sunk money into a game that is horrible gaijin doesn t care that these players will leave with anger as long as there are new players comming in and paying money to get quicker to their desired vehicles this is why the game is so bad because the game doesn t need to be good to earn money it just needs to look good 4 gaijin and the playerbaseafter all the problems i have listed here i think this is the worst of all i ve allready said that gaijin just uses new players to milk money out of them but i think the worst thing is how they are treated afterwards when people realize the problems with the game they go on the forum and complain about them the most natural thing to do you would suggest espacially when you have paid money for game content wrong even when people reaveal problems in the game in the most modest and friendly way they are are verbally attacked by gaijins moderators in the worst and most childish manner posts and entire threads get deleted players blocked or banned for simply pointing out problems and youtubers get threatened for uploading videos criticising the game thats gaijins propaganda machine at work they don t want the game to look bad for potential players because the potential players are their money base and not the players allready playing the game for a few months 5 summarythere is no game in the world that provokes as much fellings to me as this one the reason being is that this game had so much potential to be an entry for a complete new generation of players into flight sims it had so much potential to become something really big and revolutionary but in the end this dream has been destroyed by the greed of its company gaijin do not play this game i ve sunk 20 and probably well over 300 hours into it for nothing but pain anger and frustration
