2017 i don t know what kind of drug were they using in the studio but this clearly either affected by substances decision or just plain and simple idiocy at it s finest dumbdown dialouge choices less weapon to use almost two dimensional npcs that we couldn t care less about broken gameplay and season pass and we thought bethesda already run out of stupid decision to make and move on to make new and better games people clearly point out we don t want shady business decision like paid mod and now they just toppled that with microtransaction paid mod you guys really trying out the limit of consumers tolerance toward aaa business these day aren t you edit i won t change the review even after creation club got removed people need to know this kind of stupid decision was taken twice and for the fact that bethesda doesn t understand their fanbaseand make thier story driven rpg a dumb down unpolished shooter
