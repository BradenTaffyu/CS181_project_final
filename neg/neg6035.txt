2017 well after spending many many hours into this game it s time to detail what i ve learned eu4 is pay to win now i suppose some background is in order when i bought the game it was around the time that conquest of paradise was released but i told myself that no i wouldn t buy the dlc or any dlc for that matter i saw the achievements in this game as interesting attempts and dedicated myself to conquering the list showing everyone that they can in fact be obtained without any dlc minus stars and moons i ve obtained a lot of dlc and have had a lot of fun in this game at this point in time i know not whether it s my lack of skill or lack of dlc that s failed me ever since institutions when i got back into the game i have had no luck with any of the harder achievements such as the african power where you conquer africa as kongo or the third way where you unite islam as an ibadi nation suffice to say i can t win without the ability to develop provinces my income is always shot and worse than that i can t get institutions considering the fact african nations don t get feudalism that s a near eternal 50 higher cost for technology putting me behind everyone now i hear you say that s fair after all they re supposed to be less developed and you d be right if not for the simple fact that if you have the dlc you can get around this by just spending monarch points to get the institutions now i hear you say that can t be too bad right i mean sure it sucks but that doesn t seem too too bad just higher tech cost you can get around that and you re right i am able to get around that but what i can t get around is money nearly ever single african province that you can conuqer early on as kongo is tropical if not some other negative effect like coast or mountain or steppes this means that your tax income for that province is 1 5 ducats a year meaning unless you ve got good production you ain t gonna be getting money from those but i hear you say every other nation has to deal with that what s so bad and the simple answer is europe doesn t the only way for the kongo to get ahead is for them to literally conquer so rapidly and save up enough money that the moment they can they embrace feduelism really early on but if you think that s all i will be complaining about please sit back down as the kongo you have two vassals ndongo and loango it s a common strategy to conquer land and sell it to your vassals so you don t waste admin points now if i have dlc i can give them land in a war and basically spread and conquer another dlc mechanic is being able to go to war for your vassal such as if they have a piece of land they have a claim on you can declare war for them and grow them that way since you requrie a casus belli without the dlc you can do neither instead you must take the land for yourself and sell it back to your vassals at a 10 prestige hit per province meaning if i conquer my neighbors and sell the land to loango it ll cost me 100 prestige lowering my legitimacy and hurting me in the long run and since i don t have dlc i can t declare wars on behalf of my vassal meaning if i misclicked or forgot to get a claim before selling the land i m out of luck and will need to wait 10 years to gain anything more now this might not be so bad you think as there is a feature in the game that would allow you to give land to vassals and you re right but what about being a vassal there s an achievement for butua where you overthrow your overlord and conquer them since your a vassal you can t have allies you can t be independant you give up some money etc etc since i don t have dlc i basically save scum reload and reload a bunch and pray to god that i get lucky if i had the dlc i could befriend a big neighbor like kilwa and have them support my independence giving me their strength when i inevitably declare an independence war and overtake my overlord but because i don t it s a big f u and let us not forget about treasure fleets and privateers as those abilities mock me the sunni nations of north africa all get bonuses to privateer fleets but because i lack the dlc i can t even make privateering fleets meaning they are weaker by comparison don t even get me started on your heir with dlc if i have a horrible god awful heir i could disown and pick a new one name then what i want and have a good ruler most of the time without the dlc have fun playing rngesus patented ruler roulette where france and ottomans get 6 5 6 rulers and you get 1 2 1 and this isn t even mentioning the quality of life improvements or the storyline because i don t have the dlc the french revolution doesn t send europe into a frenzy the major religious war doesn t kick off to my knowledge and this is probably the worst part everything is less convenient do i want to have my diplomats maintain my relationships without the dlc i gotta do it manually i need an army of 10 000 and want them all to build automatically and meet up here nope can t do that do it yourself it s infuriating that these quality of life features are just non existant in the base game as it does nothing but add enjoyability so i must conclude that there are simply some achievements that require dlc to be even remotely possible it is sad but i will continue trying in futility to take these achievements and overcome the game s stupidity i can only pray paradox learns something soon
