2016 first off i hope that i can change this review later on they hopefully will patch many of the problems the game currently has and yes there are gamebreaking bugs right now 1 you want a military victory fine take it there will be no real defence from the ai why not well even worse than in civ5 they just stumble around with their units have no plan what to do if you have one archer and one warrior out in the field not even near a city you can beat up to 5 or 6 enemy troops easy why well their archers often don t even attack you but just stand there while their warriors attack your one warrior like suicide squads it is funny to see but in the end you win every war because the ai just doesn t use what they have 2 you want to talk with the ai forget it 2 1 yes they all have agendas but that is more slapstick queen victoria loves rich people because she loves money okay so in turn 288 she tells me that she loves my good income well then she suffers a stroke and while i still have the same income in turn 289 she tells me that i am a poor bastard interesting 2 2 roosevelt loves his taoism i am catholic he is my ally i see his 2 apostles and 1 missionary and ask him to not use them o my cities he says yes and uses them in the same turn against my cities i get informed that he broke his promise and that is it i ask him again he says yes again breaks it next round again there is no consequence the ai will always say yes to everything no spies yes of couse but let me send you this spy no religion yeah just ignore my 4 other missionaries going to you right now in the end there is no dimplomcy there are no promises it is just a feature without any meaning or consequence whatsoever 2 3 so yeah the ai is not able to win any battle and not able to remember what they promised you 30 seconds ago but when it comes to trading wow they are hardcore one for one hell no the ai will only accept trades that are very one sided and maybe because of that they will not really trade with each other when you meet a new civ after round 300 they will suddenly make you big offers to trade goods they could do that with all the other civs too but since they all want 1 for 2 nobody trades in the end bravo 3 the politics in the game are pretty meaningless they simply are the boosts may be great for pro players in tournaments but for a casual player they are just a big part of the game with little to no consequence for the gameplay 4 the civilizations are not balanced at all if you start 5 games you will always see the same civilisations weak england hello germany hello always the same civilizations strong hi mister roosevelt hi tomyris this point is not yet a problem for me because i don t played enough to see if it is really always the case or just a coincident but i suspect major balancing issues so in the end the game needs work most of the work is needed for the ai diplomacy is dead right now promises are meaningless when fighting the big and mighty leaders are just toddlers without a clue i hope this will get fixed soon because after just a short ammount of in game time it gets old and the bigs are too much too bear ps sorry for mistakes english is not my naitive language
