2016 this game is thought for simulation racers not forza gt f1 201x etc due to the complexity of setups and racing rules note i drove mostly road classes in iracing but i also did race in oval classes not recommended due to physics overall good but some key elements are unrealistic example there are many cars you cant catch anymore if you get little sideways also many people pros think that in some of the lower classes rookie d the devs have reduced the grip for some cars on purpose to make it more difficult for rookies what is imo unnessecary and annoying example d class ford spec racer within sim racing known to be quite unrealistic and outdated game engine is from 1997 it has still some bugs from grand prix legends 1998 ridiculous tires only 1 compound per car unrealistic pressurespro s say all cars should always have between 180 190 kpa thats so unrealistic as temperature doesnt matter at allseriously for that price no rain simulation or day night transition to be fast you need to be racing pretty much every day you cant just jump in and expect that you drive in the top 20 of the race even if you have already 100h in iracing or 1000s of hours in other proper simulations ie rfactor 2 and you have talent even with fixed setup fixed means everyone gets a preset setup and so is equal that is also partially due to the problem with the force feedback and complicated setup system with unrealistic setup rules ie tire pressures general racing rules again this review is mostly for the road racing part of iracing the flag system used in this game is the american one this makes sense for oval but not for many road series classes ie blancpain sprint series i would understand if some european stuff would be cut ie blue flags but totally leave it out is nonsense generally you can overtake under yellow flag wtf generally the track boundary rules are inconsistent and unrealistic community if you say something negative about iracing people gonna flame you etc sry but one of the worst communities when it comes to state critic about the game typically fanboys reminds me alot about when apple was extremely popular or about the political scene in my country when you say something against the left wing politics and you instantly get brandmarked as a nazi force feedback in general not bad you need to tweak it a bit in the beginning and you need to set the strenght force every time again if you sit in another car annoying as hell the 2 biggest problem i have are that you cant tweak the forces properly except with an extremely painful and long way which i wont go into by default you cant feel the fronts at all pros say you have to listen to the sound which imo is ridiculous for a proper self called motorsport simulation every sim does it way better you also cant turn off rumble effects ie abs rumble or even tweak them to a lower value no thats not possible and a real problem for some wheels ie g27 safety rating i saw a license people that would be banned in normal leagues they simply farm their safety rating in time trial andor lower classes you can also report people for their driving the big problem there is that they only penalize if its clear that it was intentional normal stupid crashes wont be penalized both get some incident points even the guy clearly not at fault as the game doesnt judge and thats one of the big problems in this game also falling from ie a b license is extremely difficult but its way too easy to get up from b a license all in all those are big flaws and mostly the reason why you even see in upper series and races ie 24h of spa b license blancpain sprint spa so many unnessecary stupid ridiculous crashes one of the most important features is flawed and thats another reason why i wont drive any longer in iracing i have more fun in a controlled admin environment league clan etc in project cars even it has little more bugs price to get to a license you have to invest at least 100 but racing in an a class series for the whole season will cost you around 200 300 depending how many free tracks are in but more likely its 300 bucks the prices for tracks once each 15 and cars once each 12 are ridiculously high the same you get in raceroom project cars assetto corsa for 5 tracks resp 2 4 cars okay is the monthly fee of 12 month or 179 2 years i understand they have to cover server costs and for multiplayer race organisation its a fair price there are coupons though which help a bit p s with other races ie 24h lemans you get fast up to 600 updates above complaints most of them are agreed on by the iracing community since years but why havent they been fixed or properly improved is the key question they must easily make enough money to have a dev team still working on it my thought its all about money instead of quality ironically i believe more people would race and existing people would invest more time in iracing if even 50 of the complaints from above would be fixed and profits would probably be more not positive nor negative netcode good server run most time very stable sometimes laggy cars they jump around alot and imo they should be ghosted or removed as theyre a big problem this is a client side problem their internet connection netcode collisions even on your screen both replays you didnt hit him sometimes up to 20cm difference and thats crazy especially because close racing is a key element of motorsports sometimes people also warp inside each other at medium bigger collisions what causes in the end way too much damage and breaks immersion and fun hud not modern but working as intended and intuitivepositive things car suit helmet paints everything customizable with an external program tradingpaints you can use even completely selfpainted liveries only people with wheels can drive in iracing thats great as gamepad keyboard drivers are known to cause more collisions and to be slower graphics nice has good framerates dynamic tracks localized track temperatures cool feature tracks good variety very accurate some of the best you can find in sim racing car variety not physics or similiar good spectrum of cars available damage has imo the best damage model of all simulations even sometimes suspension bouncing buggy inconsistent over cars tank mercedes amg gt3 vs balloon audi r8 lms gt3 driver swap i love it only rfactor 2 has that properly too in sim racing awesome organisation of races race series special events thats the primary reason why iracing makes a lot of fun but the problems with safety rating ability to drive clean of other drivers reduce that to having only sometimes fun most of the time when you wanna really race and that i mean proper on track position fights it ends in tears because most drivers dont know the rules or just dont really care and ram you conclusion i cant recommend this gamethis multiplayer concept is great but has some flaws which reduce overall fun a lot especially when you try to race other people if this would cost less i would still recommend it but the prices are ridiculously high i cant remember any game that cost that much aswell and you can have for less money equal or much more fun other racing simulations with leagues there are also other problems that need to be fixed before i call it a good racing simulation and some people in the community are way too toxic i recommend rather buy project cars assetto corsa rfactor 2 and join a good league with events rules you will have more fun than in iracing
