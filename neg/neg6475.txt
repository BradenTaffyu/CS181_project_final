2021 one of the greatest games ever made following the footsteps of the first dark souls with improved animations netcoding and general mechanics this game feels very smooth and fights are absolutely amazing dark souls 3 adds more challenge to the game by making the mobs more aggressive a lot like in bloodborn i absolutely want to recommend this game as a big fan of dark souls series and for the gameplay quality but due to it s state i can not do so i feel like i have the responsibility to inform you about the situation that s going on in the game cheaters have taken over the game in large numbers dark souls has it s own brutal anti cheat system but it is very ineffective when cheaters can create alt steam accounts to bypass bans and strike again the cheating scene has been going on for years and years now but it has evolved to the point where cheaters can actually cause permanent damage to your pc or even pish information you d not want to share online these cheats are evolving constantly due to the big playerbase and lack of action from bandai namco so who knows maybe in future dark souls 3 on steam could work as a backdoor access to your pc in a way very high security risk here i talked to bandai namco s support about the issue and they are aware of what is going on and i was told that they are working on the issue but in truth nothing has been done in 3 years or so when all this started to boom if you play this game in offline mode you will not have any problems also there are mods such as blue sentinel which is telling you when you are being invaded by a cheater and it tries to block you connecting to them in future use of this mod is bannable reason but bandai namco s anti cheat can t track it as the mod does not affect the game itself that much i recommend using this mod if you plan to play the game
