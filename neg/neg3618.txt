2018 early access review when is it enough i ve been playing since the mid 11 releases and have seen a lot of iterations of this game for the longest time the game didn t know what it wanted to be we went from a skill based survivor to a rpg stat based game there were and still are growing pains from this crafting used to progress when you used the skill item directly and you had direct gains from your use and practice of said skills now you merely earn points and put them where you want you re progress is gated at every turn in an attempt to give the illusion of a challenge or difficulty us old timers can and will attest to this a17 raises these requirements for recipes like corn seeds 5 corn equals 1 seed progressively this game has stepped up busy work for the player to increase the perceived level of challenge but it only serves to lengthen the game single and multiplayer the lighting animations textures and new art assets are a wonderful and a welcome addition but this act of busy work from the devs is lazy and uninspiring why does the game have to cheat for the sake of difficulty the truth is players are smart and ingenious and the devs have failed to understand this creativity and hard work is marginalized for stat points and busy work quests
