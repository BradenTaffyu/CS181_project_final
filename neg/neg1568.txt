still an early access game in all but name you d think the mods would save it but it s apparently so poorly coded that modding is very hard not to mention patches every 3 6 months that break everything i waited 5 years for this game and was disappointed then waited 4 more for something to change but it s still as shallow as a pond the economy isn t real prices are randomly generated and there is no real supply demand system lack of mid to endgame content village and town management is shallow battles are the best part but become repetitive tournaments are the same thing every time just play warband
