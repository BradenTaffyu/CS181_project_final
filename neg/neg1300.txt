2020 early access review okay game horrible community the devs are so caught up with being politically correct it completely destroys their community and it honestly makes me quite sad if you say something they don t agree with anything then you re automatically a troll and your opinion doesn t matter i just want to play the game and keep political views and opinions out of it a game and politics are two very different things but the devs seem to think they go hand in hand i was banned from the community for saying that i was banned from the subreddit for asking for an alternative discord its such i don t want to support developers who are like this and if you don t either don t buy the game they don t deserve it
