2014 there were times when i was just lyrical about this game somehow i fitted right in getting a lot of kills unlocking plane after plane the game was extremely friendly to it s players i never had the feeling that i was underpowered or anything it was just awesome especially cooping with friends the game breathed the love for military aviation it was a dream come true for me the gameplay was just heartpounding fun as you twisted and turned to get behind your opponents the historical battles were fun too moreover you had an easy custom single player mode to brush up on your flying skills offline which was very useful since i wanted to make the jump to simulator difficulty you just had so much content in this game had then along came patch 1 37 the sky is now filled with nearly invincible me 109 s and la 7 s stuffed with cannons arcade dogfights have lost all appeal to me now it is just fly at each other with all guns blazing no tactics no teamplay no interesting dogfights any one on one dogfights are a thing of the past the battlefield is just a frantic swirl of flying cannonballs without logic it has nothing to do with flying or dogfighting anymore in fact the more i learned about fighter tactics the worse i became on this game unlocking planes is a thing of the past as well researching any plane takes ridicilously much time the only way to speed up the process is of course by paying lots of money oh and should you eventually manage to research and buy a game it will have reduced speed agility armor everything just to make sure you have to pay again to unf your brand new plane moreover this upgrade system makes all historical accuracy obsolete since a plane that historically is lower in turn rate for example can now outturn a not upgraded airplane that should have superior turning abilities the easy customizable missions from the single player have dissappeared altogether now you get to chose between flying missions with a scenario fully controlled by the game and not the player or flying practice missions against biplanes and real life players the latter are usually beginners or dudes who want to test their brand new jet on easy prey not much practice there and you need it to overcome the immensely steep learning curve to simulator battles because of this almost no one plays this mode anymore gaijin scared away their first fans the flight sim boys luckily the historial battles remain together with the events mode this is an oasis of relief in an ever deteriorating game matchmaking is seemingly more fair here teamplay is more important and historical accuracy is restored a little however there are not much players on this mode the learning curve is very steep the waiting time for a match is quite high and the absence of room for mistakes makes this game mode very difficult for new players in sum a charm of a game has turned into a mean money making machine discarding it s fans of the first hour in favor of the arcade shooter public with big wallets the player friendly environment has turned into a frustrating grind and totally uninteresting gameplay in arcade mode focused only on making money my sad conclusion if you like planes and dogfighting look somewhere else it may seem cool if this is your first time on this game but believe me it is nothing compared to what it once was
