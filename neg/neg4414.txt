2018 just say no to spyware you have to pay for i ve been a loyal fan of the civ franchise as well as sid and firaxis for years i ve suffered through numerous issues with civ 6 and to find out they are now adding spyware to the game without clearly disclosing it is the straw that broke the camel s back it s frankly insulting that i paid full retail price for a game plus expansion and i m thanked by the publisher secretly installing spyware on my machine no thanks my only choice is to vote with my wallet and refuse to do business with them again perhaps someone new will come along and refresh the civ franchise like poe did to diablo
