2017 so as a big fan of thehunter i figured i would pick this up when it came out and as many have said the environment and audio and world design are goregous as a hiking and occasional shooting game its nice however about a month before the atv dlc release i had reformated my system and everytime i think to reinstall it i remember that the devs completely lied to the gaming community by telling everyone that the game would be a one time purchase with eventual new hunting region dlc to come eventual this would be acceptable but as with all greedy gaming companies they make every improvement to the game that should have been there from the beginning a new micro dlc purchase its nothing more than a polished money grab and as a result i wont be reinstalling anytime soon if ever again and would honestly ask for a refund if i could if you are comfortable with the micro dlc structure of the game i would recommend just playing thehunter classic it at least has content to support the transactions
