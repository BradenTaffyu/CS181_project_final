2022 fun game but is just another over priced dlc bloated game buy the base game and ignore the 100 of dlc i support devs who offer dlc but not when a small dlc costs 2 3 the price of the main game edit while i applaud the dev for commenting on my review adding a couple houses and 1 new mechanic per dlc you are not getting an update that is 2 3 the size of the base game i will try one when they are on sale for more than 10 off as it is not worth it at this time a new review edit will happen then
