2023 another great game ruined by ao drm i played roughly about 30 hours during the 3 day early access overall gameplay is good some rather obvious nitpicks that others have spoke about in other reviews but yeah probably would be a high 8 or 9 10 if it just didn t take so long to load into heists and god forbid the server dies mid heist cause back to the menu you go if you have bad connection to the server you can also kiss goodbye any stealth run even on solo it even takes 15 20 seconds minimum to load into a heist lobby solo which is laughable at best game server has 3 platforms and 2 different pc launchers to play the game from the server can only take so much upon making this since the full game is out server is completely dead i suspect that free gamepass trials may be causing it but its hard to tell no issues during early access from server related stuff guess they really werent ready for this reception and it shows needs an offline mode desperately to play while the server is down or the game is basically doa game is a 6 5 10 right now with the ao problems wouldnt recommend buying until they fix that and if ovk sb double down and not add offline support then dont even give any time and effort into a purchase
