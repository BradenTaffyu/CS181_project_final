2022 i might be in the minority here as a single player who avoids multiplayer like the plague my problem is that this game s campaign pales in comparison to the original campaigns launched with aoe2 in that it plays nothing more than a cheap tutorial on how to play the game to put it another way the campaign only exist to serve the multiplayer by being one big multiplayer tutorial that has no replayability value like aoe2 campaigns while i would be wrong to compare the single player experience of this game 1 year into release with aoe2 that has received multiple updates and new campaigns over many years it s obvious by now that this game s focus is multiplayer and not single player especially with the launching of new civs without any new campaigns to accompany them unlike in aoe2 as a history fan myself like many aoe players i couldnt hear the end of how everyone was loving the mini documentaries included in the campaigns but it is a double edged sword because while these mini documentaries are well made they are likely very expensive to produce which means that if they do think about adding in new campaigns they will have to consider the huge production cost it would take to also make the mini documentaries that would go with them and the cynic in me tells me they will use this as an excuse to not make any new single player campaigns therefore the mini docs serve as nothing more than marketing material to sell the game in exchange for its long term growth and potential and how can i end this without complaining about the ui and this is someone who can tolerate paradox interactive uis gone are the different ui themes for different civs in with the cheap and the uninspired with every button being the same gold color on a blue background and the symbols on each button might as well be hieroglyphs in terms of their readability it s kinda important whenever playing an rts to not have buttons on your ui where you are constantly asking yourself just what the hell is this button supposed to do at a glance because of how poorly they are designed while this review does sound overwhelmingly negative it would be narrow minded of me to say that this is a bad game it is a good game and still has that gold aoe standard that you can expect from almost all the games in this franchise but like many other game franchises with many sequels at some point you realise when a game in that franchise is no longer being made for you and that s ok
