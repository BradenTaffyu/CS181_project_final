2016 the game is fun to play and a good total war game it focuses more on roleplaying hero characters than previous games but stripes away some of the management complexity a trade i don t mind at all though ymmv it is fun to build awesome heroes and cool armies and conquer the world each race of the 4 races are a bit different and the modding community is solid as always with tw with that said tw games have had issues with dlc pricing for a while now but warhammer is taking those issues to another level day 1 dlc for a race is stupid enough then we get paid dlc for a marginal graphics change then 19 for a race and a mini campaign that is nearly 90 for a game that came out 2 months ago i almost bought the beastman pack i want it but i just can t do it it s not that i don t have 19 i just can t justify it to myself and i know this is not the end a month from now there will be elves or skaven for another 19 or marginally less because people are complaining see guys look how nice we are this race pac is only 12 we ain t greedy and then so on and so forth untill they ve bleed people of all the money they can i don t care to go through it i d wait till a sale or ftstts it s just a google away
