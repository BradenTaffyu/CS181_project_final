2014 maybe it s just me and that s totally possible but unless you want to die incredibly often and often with no warning probably don t buy this game the problem is that death come so ludicrisly often that you rarely make it far enough to explore the more interesting parts of the game i bought this game when it was in beta and at first it wasn t so bad however surviving in this game has essentially become trying to hike up mt everest in nothing but underwear made of sandpaper with each and every unpdate the game becomes more and more of a masochists dream world like you need silk but if you try to farm a nest then it will grow and send out tons of warrior spiders that are extremely hard to kill and eventually will spawn the spider queen who is an unimaginable horror the additions of seasons was interesting but brings the need to stockpile food that wouldn t be too bad if food didn t spoil and winter lasted for a long time and you could almost never leave to scavange very far because you freeze to death if you leave a fire for too long i imagine actually being in this game is a fairly high circle of hell just constantly dying from horrifying monsters while trying to survive and once you actually get a decent camp going hounds come from everywhere and eat you alive or the deer clopse comes and destroys literally everything you build in the middle of winter then you either die and start over or somehow beat storymode which starts you over it s a textbook definition of sisyphusian nightmare i don t even want to know what playing on reign of giants is like it took an impossible game and added way more ways to die and way more horrifying invincible monsters basically what i m saying is only buy this game if you like dying and seeing all your hard work be destroyed by a single mistake or stoke of bad luck or be prepared to visit the workshop and download a lot of mods
