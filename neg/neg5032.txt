2019 for someone who has over 3 000 hours combined on the previous total war games warhammer 2 atilla rome 2 empires i can say say with all experience that this game sucks as a total war game go play total war empires which is ten years old btw and tell me that this game compares to the uniqueness of each factions and there units this tittle got too famous and now its ruined the company barely even tried on this one and i honestly don t need to explain why if you played it oh but the graphics people say yeah there alright but with the funky animations they don t impress total war games are meant to be realistic but they are heading in the more kiddish style to me but hey that s where the money is right
