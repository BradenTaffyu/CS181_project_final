2017 i d like to start by saying that this is an amazing game and by far my favorite game to have come out so far this year however the pc port appears to have some problems which prevent me from enjoying this game specifically the crashing during the 30 minute intro which prevents me from making any progress i m sad to say i ve wasted 3 hours on the intro because it keeps locking up and crashing and there is no save points for the first 30 40 mins of the game so having to redo this intro about 7 times because of crashes when my pc exceeds the minimum requirements is a tad unacceptable i really want to retract this review as soon as possible as that will mean they have fixed and optimized the game but until then i can t recommend a game that will crash before it even allows you to make progress i bought this on pc because after beating the ps4 version a couple times i was aching to play this on pc with less framerate issues and better performance although there were few to begin with unfortunately what i ve got is a game that is currently not playable for me which is a shame because this is definately my favorite game so far to have come out this year specs windows 10 64bitgpu nvidia 780gtxprocessor i5 3 4ghz quad coreram 16gb
