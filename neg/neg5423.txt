2023 relic entertainment and sega ought to be ashamed they clearly spent more on advertisements and bribing 3rd rate critics to say that the game is good rather than developing the game and making it good wtf even is pocket lint com anyway the game feels like a pre alpha build only for testers it s heavily lacking in features is full of bugs sound is and the graphics are disappointing and to top it all off it incorporates denuvo anti tamper which is notorious for fps rape i get 30 fps average in 1440p with an rtx 3080 on the highest settings because of denuvo no doubt in addition to this the pricing is outrageous because the game is regionally priced i currently live in norway and here the game costs almost 10 of my monthly salary relic clearly thinks we re communists that share the oil money equally between our 5 5 million people and from what i ve heard it costs more than the average monthly salary in turkey heard it in conversation but it wouldn t surprise me if it was true tldr sega should have stuck to sonic and relic entertainment should go themselves
