2022 i ve played this game significantly more off of steam and i cannot stress how much i don t recommend this game this game does not respect your time with egregious research trees and it certainly doesn t respect your money with predatory loot boxes and rigged gambling the worst part is at its core the gameplay is good but plagued by developers who don t understand their own game if you play long enough to reach endgame being tier 8 10 you ll see how horribly unbalanced the game actually is with maybe only half of the ships playable being viable in a competitive setting on top of that there are two classes of ships that ruin the strategy of the game with very little counterplay making most games frustrating do yourself a favor and stay far away
