2014 to be honest this game is a hell of fun making epic armies with custom a sortof interesting campaign but the thing that ruins this game so much is that you have to pay for the things that should already be in the game that you paid 79 95 usd for like blood gore etc i can honestly see why so many total war fans are disappointed so if you wanna be safe and keep your money don t buy this game but if you re a rich mofo well then feel free to see your riches wasted on 10 dlcs which should be in the game but what can i say i m a poor bastard
