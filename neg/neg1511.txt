2023 i always uninstall this game when i m being crowned as a ruler it is that bad no matter how much money soldiers lords you have on your kingdom the others kingdom will just like that take more settlement than you can and here s why 1 i ve wipped out sturgia and yet those guys are stil roaming on the map then they came back with like an army of almost a 1000 mens because some clans just appeared out of nowhere and joined sturgia for whatever reasons they are f cking homeless for christ sake to besiege a castle while i was far away in the previous mount and blade warband when a kingdom doesnt have any settlements they just f ck off but here unless you behead all of them wich will f ck up big time your reputation they will still find a way to mess with you edit apparently this is no longer the case anymore they do f ck off when they dont have any settlement left this alone doesnt change my take on this game but this is a reaaaally good start i m honestly just waiting for a diplomacy update to have a second take on the game 2 so while i was at war with the aserai a the very south of this big world map three other kingdom decided it was the right time to declare war so they start to siege everything and then 3 per 3 and even 6 per 6 all those kingdoms with a total of half of my mens just f ck up hours and hours of never ending siege 3 yeah because you are constantly at war i f cking swear the longest time of peace i ve ever had was like a week if you rule a kingdom this is the only thing you will ever do siege protect your settlements from being sieged take prisonners and sometime bribe ennemy lords to join you so yeah after the every remaining kingdom decided to go to war against you i just lost severals hours of siege that i have done by myself because the lords in my kingdoms just can t do sh t when they do take a castle they just get destroyed by some fresh army that appeared with a thousand mens out of nowhere so what now well there is no alternative there is no real diplomacy that can avoid the constant endless sieges and wars you cannot give armies specific orders like asking an army to just go somewhere for exemple or anything like that constent endless battle and here they are proudly annoucning that this game is out of early acess yeah sure mate but hey for all i know maybe this game will be enjoyable in a few years until then i ll uninstall this game one more time
