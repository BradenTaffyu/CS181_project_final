2023 early access review i expected it to be bad but this blew past all of those expectations the entire point of this was to release a more optimized version of the game on ue5 this really was just a cash grab we should have all believed them when they told us thats what this was it s really unfortunate because the visual updates are actually really nice the new building system and visual update for building pieces is great it s just all overshadowed by how trash the rest of it is
