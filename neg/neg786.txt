2017 take everythig you know and love about the fallout games and reduce them to something like a fine novel translated into emoji the game is vapid and very repetitive after a ton of hours playing i simply realized it was never going to get to the good part save your money and pray for obsidian to make a new fallout game edit 1 16 2018 i said obsidian in my earlier review but i should clarify that i would like someone to develop a game that has the spirit of the isometric fallouts fo3 or fo nv the later having been developed by obsidian i dont particularly care who develops the game anyway thanks for the engagement on my review and happy gaming
