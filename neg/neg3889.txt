2016 early access review i ve enjoyed this game for so long and actually i am changing my positive review to a negative i ve enjoyed this game for so long and put many hours like most of the negative reviews here to have it get worse over time this game was brilliant and by far one of my favorite games on my steam library i m writing this review because i bought this game as soon as it came out on steam and i have waited years for a full release however we the community have gotten nothing but bad updates and round about bug fixes that usually don t do much when they revamped the game in 13 14 i played a little more and enjoyed the game then i saw they wanted to make this game a console game when this game is deep into alpha and they don t want to finisht the game until they finish their console game ya know this isn t a bad game this is one of the best zombie survival crafting games i have ever played but because they don t wanna finish this i feel like i have been abandoned by the devlopers wow guys 6 years ago this game was in alpha guess what it still is 6 more years later and it s finally released wack
