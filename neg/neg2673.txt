2019 okay today i have finally had enough i have been playing stellaris for years and i absolutely love it but today s bug was the final straw currently stellaris is unplayable past mid late game due to the amount of in game pop checks that are performed constantly which rapidly overloads your hardware this is an issue that has been known about by paradox for roughly a year now yet nothing has been done although they have managed to release one species pack one expansion and are currently getting ready to release another expansion the only way to alleviate this is to play as a race which can conquer other races as quickly as possible in order to purge those pops set your map size to the lowest you think you can get away with and set habitable worlds to as low as possible as you can imagine this limits the scope of this grand strategy quite significantly then there is the a i which is absolutely terrible at managing its empire and will only be a threat at the beginning due to cheating with its starting fleet the way that it fights wars with its fleets is all or nothing i have seen wars between a i s drag on for years with no gains made by either side as they clearly aren t attacking each other but other times one will get completely steam rolled by the other and finally we have the bugs which crop up in every play through some of which are just annoying such as patrolling fleets which refuse to pass through a system events which don t work or the to go button deciding to take you to open space and not the event that you want to view but others are game breakers such as the one which caused me to come here this one happened after loading up a save only to find that none of my fleets could upgrade no matter what i tried i ve had enough of this now and will not buy any more content for stellaris until paradox take some of the money they have been making off of all the dlc s they have been churning out and fix this game until this happens this review stays up as well i m waiting paradox
