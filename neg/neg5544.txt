2018 picture the scene the carthagians are attacking my recently captured town with 4 fleets stacked full with 20 ships each autoresolving would be normal answer to this challenge that i might say i have no desire to play a battle i will inevitably lose this time however i choose to play the heroic roman general and i dive in head first instantly i rush out the town toward the hill that strikes me as an easy position to defend and i dig in the first wave comes and i put my strategy head on using cavalry to flank the ginormous number of missile units dealing deadly blows to them at an admittedly large cost there is an ebb and flow to the battle and when my general dies in one last charge i think nay i am done for no victory can come of this i send my troops in valiantly one last push for lucius calpurnius or whatever his name was and the carthaginian troops crack before my very eyes it is a miracle a thermopylae of my very own five thousand vanquished carthaginians lie dead or dying at the feet of the fifteen hundred remaining roman soldiers i form my troops up in one last battle line it occurs to me that after forty five minutes of fighting there are still three thousand carthaginian sea men waiting to do battle or there would be if there was a place to land there isn t instead i m confronted by a tricked out bireme doing donuts in the ocean and nearly three thousand carthaginians jerking each other off on their boats with absolutely nowhere to go i am forced to concede defeat and rage quit this game
