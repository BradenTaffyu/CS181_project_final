2013 total war rome 2 is a game with serious flaws it was released with severe bugs three months not to mention seven patches later i still experience occasional unexplainable crashes gameplay wise the interface is poor the ai makes mind boggling decisions during battles and in the campaign and the graphics leave something to be desired even with all settings on extreme i can t seem to get near the quality of those damnable screenshots oh and the blood gore setting a standard option in most games is sold as dlc as if a 60 dollar game shouldn t have that option by default on the flip side the game is eminently moddable so if you re open to experimentation you could search for mods that make the game entertaining for you or create those mods yourself and hey despite all its rough edges i still find rome 2 sometimes engrossing and you might too if you re a fan of large scale strategy yet i can t help but feel that i m forcing myself to play just so i can say i got my money s worth
