2017 this was a tough review to write because there are many admirable things about this game and it has the potential to be a truly great genre defining classic but in its current guise 1 9x i can t honestly recommend it as a sound purchase the good tries something different whether it s the prevalence of meaningful event chains the randomised alien races or the strong focus on exploration stellaris avoids the stale seen it all before tropes of the glut of moo2 clones which dominate the space 4x landscape great music espeically all the synthy vangelis influenced stuff with the expansions bringing a variety of cool voicepacks too to create an authentic classic sci fi feel good writing obvious influence from people like clarke adams etc shines through in the story sections and exploration phase which make up the strongest parts of the game such a shame that by midgame these have largely disappeared and the problems begin the bad lack of interesting ways to interact with other races and empires hell lack of interesting systems in general you meet someone you will be at war or peace with them this is fairly deterministic based on initial race setup this is the limit of your intergalactic diplomacy there is no meaningful trade with other empires no espionage or way to influence other empires beyond invading them there is no model for cultural influence or religious influence or really anything at all compare this to something like the civ games which provide plenty of non military routes to interact with your world makes things very dull very quickly appalling combat doomstack vs doomstack the winner spends the next few hours slowly mopping up helpless systems the loser of that initial confrontation has already lost the game ground combat is even worse at least space combat looks prettty the ground combat is just two rows of circles bobbing at each other with a few meaningless numbers attached and the ui for loading up transports is some of the most ill thought out i ve ever encountered supposedly the 2 0 patch is going to fix this i hope it can but the system is so tedious right now it will require an awful lot of work a mass of insignificant incremental choices instead of fewer important ones research a technology that provides 5 research research another one that changes your red lasers to blue lasers and adds 2 damage or something set up your empire at the start of the game will you be a fascist robotic mollusc or a capitalist mushroom doesn t matter the only difference is 10 minerals or some such endless busywork increasing your level 2 mines to level 3 is how you ll be spending the majority of your time lack of grand strategy elements stellaris is in truth less a 4x grand strategy hybrid than a 4x with a veneer of grand strategy over the top it has all the busywork and endless expansion of a 4x but few of the features of a grand strategy no interesting character interactions political maneouvering or internal pressure it does borrow the grand strategy lack of victory conditions however overall i really wanted to like this game it has wonderful ideas is trying to be original and is well supported by the developers it s just not fun though and through a focus on incremental busywork and lack of any goal really beyond expand and conquer a big problem when the military is the weakest part of the game i d currently suggest holding on until the 2 0 patch some time next year and then check out reviews and feedback for how if these issues have been addressed
