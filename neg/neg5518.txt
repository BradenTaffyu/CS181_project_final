2018 i fell in love with the total war series with the original rome total war if you were expecting the studio that built its empire off of this game to improve upon it you would unfortunately be mistaken despite updates and mods this game pales in comparison to its predecessor and namesake the only improvement is 1 graphics and 1a real naval combat copy pasted from shogun as a longtime fan of the series and a devoted customer i am very disappointed only because i ve literally played a better version of the same game they re game rome classic
