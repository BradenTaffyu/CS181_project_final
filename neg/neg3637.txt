2014 early access review this game is great for lan or private play as pve with friends positive review from me here this is my first review on steam for a game and is because i am very angry at the whole way they are dealing with the cheating issues with the basic attitude of the developers who basically are saying theres no way to stop it so stop asking us to fix it if you play on any server your base will get hacked basical the server is open to client map files allowing modification and checking map to see where player bases are where players are while not on your friends list they can change the damage given the damage they recieve where they spawn without a bed even tunnel through bedrock to escape easily after they have filled in your base basically raids on bases are legal in pvp where your base is protected by landclaim blocks in a hack land claim blocks do nothing to stop hackers because they change their damage to a rediculous amounts my friends and i on our third server we have lost everything decided to make a base hidden in a mountain no forges would ever be running and all our stuff was at bedrock with a small tunnel as only means of entering and about 10 minutes run from the main starting area took the guy 5 minutes to completely fill in our base and tunnel out the bedrock leaving a hole into nothing where you fall then log out and come back in to be on the surface we have taken screen shots of this usually you can spot a hacker when their ping is over 250 and they have the ability to set all pings to 0 there by disquising themselves the steam ban does nothing for hacks as players can simply use family library sharing to get back on the servers they are banned from and keep playing the game if you want this game to play with a friend and pve its a really good game if you want to play with other people dont bother save your money cause all the work you do will be lost within minutes by hackers if you buy the game to play with others on an open server enjoy 7 ways to be hacked
