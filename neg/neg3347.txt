2016 well i gave this game chance but enough is enough pros beatiful graphics armies creation ground planning unit design upgrades optionsconsi will leave aside skins and other stuff presented in future dlcs it is company policy and our choice to support or deny it no minimap overall tragic hud and ui good for games like eu or ck or even stellaris right now but not for strategy where you manage multiple fronts in few years conflict simplified research especially in units variety stupid ai unable to assess its options and power and accordingly react to historical events national focus research leading to situations like germany stuck for 2 years in denmark and unable to invade norway while declaring new and new wars on sweden republican spain which beats nationalists in 99 etc i didn t even get to german invasion to cccp to see that disaster playing to end of 1940 was enough units not use any resources while active just production costs for new units and replacements so trade enough oil build enough planes and armor and do what you want your armored divisions won t consume any fuel on movement hooraah for germany russia awaits stupid simplified diplomacy based completely on 3 factions is ruining everything and assisting previous point in messing the game japan joins axis in 1939 joining war against allies while completely unprepared for this italy invades southern france from 1939 great britain invades italy while italians fight in africa and other stupid unrealistic and completely crazy plans units numbers and losses likely more from ww1 ground ops we can t see because someone decided to commit statistic suicide and remove all stats books present in previous games and simplify it to overall manpower losses when you check war status oh common paradox what is this game for kids number of air units is again unrealistic and stupid i played as germany after declaring war on poland it allied with france gb etc few days after allies had more than 3000 fighters over 1000 bombers ruling the skies amount of losses coming from this is funny too 500 planes lost in single day lol keep it real paradox keep it real i will not go on i don t have nerves on it hearts of iron was always presented as historical game which gave you chance to change that history well there is no history in hoi iv just bunch of focus research that try to simulate it and it does it really wrong which just completely messes whole game if you want to play stupid historically inaccurate unrealistic simple so called deep strategy go on and buy otherwise get older games like hoi2 darkest hour you will get more history more realism more fun sadly paradox didn t take the best from old hoi games adding new features but they created completely new concept which at least for me is boring and not working
