2020 i wish there were a neutral option i ve basically written a whole in depth essay so if you re not interested in that just read the tldr but if this seems like the kind of game you would enjoy or someone you know highly recommended it you as one of my friends did just wait till it s on sale its not worth the 40 asking price tldr this game advertises itself as a grand strategy game and it kinda is but also not really there s so much dlc it feels like whether intended or not that we got robbed from base game content the game is extremely micromanage y and with all the different things there are to keep track of it is almost convoluted in its difficulty i mean the game isn t bad it s just not great those 9 10 s on the cover are just like new york times bestseller awards they mean basically nothing the essay part first the lack of strategy the game takes place in space you know the place with three dimensions with plenty of room to maneuver flank lay artillery fire etc but then the game doesn t really utilize it it almost does sometime down the tech tree you can get cpu components to change how certain ship models go about combat but it doesn t really matter because if the magic fleet power number isn t bigger than the enemies then you re just kinda gonna loose there s no real benefit to taking a long time constructing the best ship model deciding the best strategy for it to take because there s no real way to work constructively with other fleets other than give them the same order as each other there s not even a reliable way or frankly even a reason to go about doing a basic pincer tactic in my humble opinion in order to make a good strategy game there needs to be a way to order your resources around in a way that you can win even when your down in terms of raw military strength but stellaris doesn t do that if a player wanted to jam all of their military power into one area and order everyone about as if they were one unit that s more powerful than any other strategy i can think of stellaris has all the basic building blocks of a good strategy game but it fails to put them together correctly beyond the basic definition of strategy the planning or directing of military operations in a war or battle while it does fit the basic definition of a strategy game it doesn t give the ability to win via a cunning and clever strategy which is a big problem in a strategy game on top of arguably nit pick problems with all the dlc it s kind of annoying this game has nearly two hundred dollars of dlc that just feels insulting since at full price you have to pay roughly 230 on top of that at the rate that some things go on sale it s clear that everything isn t worth what it s listed as i feel like this might be a corprate problem instead of a dev team problem but who knows either way the game can be really bland without that dlc and it just feels like i m playing an ea game thank you paradox very cool my last bit of complaints could be hate on the style of the game but there is sooo much stuff to keep track of if you dont turn the setting on that automates the development of planets you have constantly check back in on every last planet that you own so often it eats up so much time there s also so many different types of resources to collect theres only enough room on the ui to display half of them so you have to constantly worry about your various stockpiles of various resource your ships also require extremely precise directions if you want them to do something that isn t move to a new star system and then they take their sweet sweet time when you need them to be quick i ve spent way too much time on this review and probably haven t gotten enough playtime to make a review that is 100 justified but whatever the game is still fun but i don t know if it s because i enjoy the game or i ve been tricked into liking it somehow but hey i ll probably sink alot more hours into this game i don t really recommend this game unless you like the management genre of games but it s still good definitely not worth 40 though
