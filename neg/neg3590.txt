2018 early access review this is a game with amazing potential being held back by questionable development choices i can t recommend anyone buy it in its current state if you look at the reviews you will see most negative reviewers played this game for hundreds of hours how could someone play this game for so long if they hate it well the answer is that at first it is actually quite fun a voxel minecraft style open world zombie survival game what a great idea sadly a great idea doesn t equal a great product the game seems to be permanently in an alpha early access state the game is riddled with terrible ai horrible game breaking bugs and horrible multiplayer desync making pvp and pve gameplay nearly impossible for anyone but the host the developers seem to be on a yearly or longer patch cycle and have terrible communication with their customers they contradict themselves constantly and can come across as very arrogant and condescending any dissent or constructive criticism on their forums is met with bans and post removals early access or being a new developer is no excuse for leaving their game in such a poor state there are tons of great developers out there that do early access right i would strongly recommend buying this game only if it was deeply discounted and only with the intention of playing a bit till you get frustrated and quit as it stands the bugs and issues will eventually frustrate you and turn you away maybe keep it on your wishlist and see what state it is in when it finally goes live my guess sometime in 2022 their development choices are easily reflect in the reviews going from mostly positive to mixed if they keep this up i wouldn t be suprised if it starts dipping into mostly negative
