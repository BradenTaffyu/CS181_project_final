2016 as a huge fan of hoi3 this is a huge step in the wrong direction it can no longer be called a grand strategy game it has been simplified way too much most people play a grand strategy game for the immersion and attention to details take that all away and give control of the forces to the ai and you might as well be playing an arcade game now i m not saying it not a bad game people who want a simpler war strategy game will probably enjoy it but it isn t as advertised a grand strategy game other issues are the ai it s soo bad it s comical playing as the uk i witnessed the entire italian submarine fleet suicide itself up in the north sea i saw the italian army in north africa retreat from a favorable position back to a naval base and then lauch themselves into transports for a naval attack on alexandria through the british fleet the definition of insanity is trying the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results well the japanese are beyond insane they spent their entire navy trying to land a single japanese infantry unit near singapore whilst my 60 strong naval planes took out the pride of the japanese navy one ship at a time after 6 months they had no navy and i still hadn t bother to send any naval forces to the far east another issue the ui it s beyond infuriating pause on event hmmm only if your lucky manual pause yeah we ll override that once you look at the screen in the wrong way organising forces hah sorting fleets is soo painful its not funny and does anyone else have a wierd double click effect when adding ships to a new fleet adding an aa gun to a garrison unit hmmm nope sorry no xp to do that wtf is it fixable yes but will require lots of patches and even more mods to make it what it should be
