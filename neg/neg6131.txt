2021 originally posted by me so innovative streamlined and simplified worse than its predecessors it s great for your baby i have played 1000s of hours of age 1 2 and 3 over the past 20 years this game is a polished turd it is currently 60 for some very well made videos about history that come with a very poorly made rts game on the side i am truly shocked that this latest and greatest in the series was released in this state it honestly feels like whoever was in charge of quality management knew nothing at all about the quality of the previous 3 games so they thought that releasing it like this was good enough this is only a good game as long as you can believe it s better than its decades old predecessors the graphics and video content was done excellently and that sells but they painfully sacrificed quality all across the game and did not include 99 of legacy game features and options i m playing it because it s pretty and i paid for it but i m extremely disappointed
