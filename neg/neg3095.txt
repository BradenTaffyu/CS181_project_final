i do not reccomend assetto corsa competizione if you are a racerlobbiesthere is very little track variety and the skill difference between players is appalling if you are looking to race on different tracks and have fun with other racers while learning this is not the place to go usually the full lobbies consist of only monza spa and n rburgring and that s basically it regarding the players expect 60 to be completely reckless drivers who ram into others from the first turn until they leave while the remaining 40 consists of either alien drivers who lap you almost every race or wannabes who crash because they lack car control and then leave player base acc 4000 vs iracing 100 000 per month a iif you decide to avoid all this terrible multiplayer experience which i promise to you you will never get out of even by driving off track because the f s will ram you even there and decide to grind your sa up by single player so you can go to the competetive server or join an online league then you will have to face one of the most terrible driving ai i ve seen in a racing simulator there is just no brain behind the wheels and it shows especially on bathurst where you have to be mindful of taking chances the worst thing is that even if you move the aggressivity slider even to 0 the behavior is the same basically but the drivers will just not follow through when driving out as in for overtake and this causes incredibly stupid moments where someone has a blue flag and you have like 6 cars behind him scared to take him over at 60kmph on a straight you are very able to compete with the ai even with 100 aggressivity but only on some tracks and even if you manage to go through with the madness another issue arises and it is that the cars just simply break rules and because they really have no f g brain even crash into you and continue to throttle up even if they are in contact with you and spinning you out and they don t care if the crash goes on for 10 seconds or more no they just keep going full throttle rating systemthe rating system is a really nice idea and i would say that has a great way of managing all the aspects to be a pretty good sign of a driver s skill yet they haven t for some reason finished it it s just like there but has no real effect and for some reason uses only few past races to give your rating and not a wider range lifestealif you really enjoy racing and want to be good it s gonna steal your life because you see how amazingly perfect the simulation physics set ups and tracks are and it just calls you and you will tell yourself that if you grind and be safe that you can get out of it but then you make two races where everyone crashes and doesn t even learn the basics of overtaking and rules of blancpain for which this game shows no info nor does enforce the rules and you get mad so you go to free practice where you calm down and tell yourself that you can grind it up and then join a race even a league one and experience the same unjoyful cl ck of raming and gigantic skill gaps again without end if you are a gamerskill demandif you are looking to grab the game and just have fun on some races like in forza or need for speed i must disappoint you this is not a game anymore but a full on pledged simulation of a real motorsport with no help thus if you do not know anything about tyre temperatures brake temperatures racing lines oversteer understeer and racing rules then you will have a terrible experience until you learn all this for which you d have to commit yourself which is not an easy task if you are just looking to race because this can be considered rather a hobby than a game lobbiessame way if you expect to just race on some tracks while having fun and not looking to lose all your life learning how to race just to keep up with the aliens then you won t find a single server you are expected to be a fully pledged driver who knows how to set up his car and the track so you will just be somewhere back thus crashing almost every lap until the rammers leave no walkthrough or tipsthere is just very limited info about the set ups and no real info on how to safely pass or what are the rules of overtaking in order to lower the ridiculous amount of disgusting crashes so you will have to go and learn all about the cars the rules of the race and behavior all by yourself not that it is a bad thing but many people won t do it or can find false info i do reccomend assetto corsa competizione if you are a racerrealismoh my god the f g realism is so freaking damn good man it s almost unreal how real they made the cars tracks feedback weather graphics simulation and everything you just can imagine realistic i just am so much in love and cannot comprehend how it s possible to have it this realistic even the sound that you get is just incredible you hear how your chase and suspension work you hear every bump on the curb and know exactly when your tires have cleaned themselves off of the last sand bits simulationthe simulation is just superb in all the aspects it offers be it tire temps or grip you just cannot stop appreciating all the aspects that affect each other so perfectly to create this unique experience you really are driving a car that reacts to even a degree change of air temperature and behaves differently on a track that has been driven on for a few laps or 50 laps if you consider that all tracks are laser scanned and the official cars have been used for the engine and have all the values affecting a race car it s just a steal to have a fully pledged gt car garage at home for this very little price drivingyou will just feel every bump nook water puddle or rubber patch the mind blowingly good tracks with these incredibly enjoyable cars will keep you wanting more even after being completely destroyed by not sleeping for three days wishing you wouldn t have to sleep so you can get more laps in if you are a gamerdrivingif you are just looking for a real experience of a racing car and don t care about multiplayer then you will be in awe like in dcs regarding planes hobbysimilarly if you want a new hobby or skill to learn then this is the perfect thing for you since you can really indulge your full life into it and even then won t know everything about it pros cons pros realism incredible unpaired simulation official gt world game with tracks and cars still being updated by gigantic chunks new categories gt4 gt3 lmx compatibility and controlls graphics and sound settings and configurability motec support is built in ftw best racing simulation game made so far and maybe for a long time if not evercons lobbies and multiplayer experience ai of the cars no real penalties for being a bad driver ramming people all the time no initiative to get players to match up nor help with racing similar skills verry basic career with a complete lack of teaching the drivers how to race or drivetakeawaythis is the best game ever made concerning simulation of real racing and the physics and simulation are just from another dimension but the complete lack of care for the sportsmanship and rules of this prestigious sport makes it an unbearable single player game at best it s sad considering you could have this the next e sport but it s used only like a simulator of driving around an empty track where multiplayer is an option but it s not
