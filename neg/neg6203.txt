2023 the game is veeery buggy there is a massive amount of minor and major bugs as well as weird dev decisionsminor bugs that i ve encountered and remembered so far inconcistent battle logs some abilities do not work as described some tallents don t work at all buggy lines of sight awful animations for some actions sometimes they get stuck and you have to wait for 5 10 seconds for them to unstuck one time it actually stuck forever so i had to end my turn prematurely the option of turning off the camera centering on your character on every action doesn t always works i put all combat speed to 3x cause its too slow but sadly that doesn t work on certain enemies who still walk in 1x speed none of it also works in space combat and each fight starts with you staring at the enemy ships arriving to the battlefield for good 7 8 seconds the achievements are broken i haven t really noticed it was too focues on the game but at a random space combat about 25 hours in i suddenly got like 25 different achievements considering that i am among the 0 8 of people who completed chapter one i suspect that its quite the videspread problemmajor bugs sometimes the numbers are just wrong the sword has 16 21 base damage i attack the damage is less then i expected and what the game showed me on the tooltip when i aimed at the enemy but you should refer to the point 1 of minor bugs part check the logs the game rolled between 12 and 17 damage instead all the bonuses and malluses are listed separately bellow the rolled damage so that is not the issue who ate my 5 damage why do i have to lose a characater in a battle because the mini boss did not die i pretty much ignore what chance to hit the game shows me for burst attackes it never is true the game gives you a neat breakdown of where will your shots go in a burst fire mode like 18 to hit one enemy 23 the other 45 for the cover of the first guy 15 for the explosive barrel yet all i do is either hit the enemy or miss completely meaning no cover destruction or barrel explosion ship combat just doesn t function properly i honestly struggle to understand what is a bug and what is a feature at this point i ve been in this madness for so long that i started to apologize to my dry wall for punching it and it replied 1 sometimes shields will get penetrated even if they are full the game mentioned that when your shields get lower they can be but at the very first shot randomly 2 movement system is broken it shows you the position of your ship after a maneuver which is very crucial as you have different weapons sticking out from different sides of your ship yet very often the game just ignores that and turns me extra 45 to the side completely screwing up my planing making me unable to use nose cannon for instance cause the ship turned too much on itself this bug actually alows me to turn 225 degrees to the left of right which after checking multiple videos on youtube and reading online is simply should not be possible the problem is so severe and crippling that it actually made me rage quit 33 hours in and now i m sitting here fuming and miserable writing this review it is impossible to have a normal space fight because of this3 both you and the enemy have sided shields that is you have 4 directional shields on every side of a ship theoretically the closest to the enemy part of the shield should receive damage and stop the shots but sometimes decides that this is not going to be the case 4 after certain actions you can t move to some cells anymore mostly happens with torpedos where if you send them diagonally to the side sometimes your ship will refuse to turn to that side at all even if you move far past torpedosso yeah space combat is a misery in land combat if one of my party members bugges out or the game scams me out of some damage i know i had the other can help in the space combat its my one ship vs 3 5 enemies i don t kill that one enemy and its a loss and of course the game braking bug for a dessert i ve read some people encountering issues like that but i though it was just a skill issue on their part they were doing something wrong but nope the game actually can completely break should ve known when i saw the option for critical bug in a bug report menu on one of the maps i had to find out the secret code to open a hiding space for tech bros and the code was in a room full of fanatics i walk up to the room the cutsene plays and after that the party has a conversation a genuies idea arises dress up as fanatics walk into the room and sabotage some stuff to kill them without a fight i make my preferred allegiance choice and then the bug happens and an enire map resets that respawns every enemy and loot on the map and launches the cutscene of us approaching the room again with conversation afterwards again except it broke something and the computer you need to interact with to open the tech dudes loft after you get the code is no longer activatable of course with the power of hindsight that would be only about 20 minutes replayed but i spent 1 5 hours trying to figure out what broke the script oh and by the way if you read previous point and thought wow dress up as fanatics and sabotage your way out of fight with like 40 dudes how cool yeah no that one broke for me too i ve checked online people could do it but however much i tried i would get immediately spotted and the fight would start the fight itself wasn t too hard despite the large numbers but my point still stands lastly i was continuing writing about poor choices by the devs not the bugs per say but just weird mechanics but i ve reached the character limit midway through this will have to be blitz round option hide helmets literary only hides helmets enjoy waring 5 chance to hit and to crit glasses you nerd can t hide them the buying power reputation system is very fragile and can get you softlocked out of some loot for a long time i had 25 buying power and after respecing all my characters i have 16 please send help or even forever there is very finite amount of medikits and grenades for sale i don t use them much but if i did i d be screwed you don t have the option to disable choices prompts like in previous games thank you game you don t need to tell me that the option of hahahaah i always wondered how it feels to wear heretic clothes is indeed and heretical choice and will give you appropriate heretical poins several classes are either very underpowered assasin or cluncky to use battle strategist entire injury trauma system which means that after my navigator gets bodied by some nark with a hammer i have to walk all the way to my ship and then all the way back cause she broke her ribs fast travel works half the time and there is none to your ship which is like the most useful thing the combat is heavily reliant on luck in the beginning rolling badly on initiative is the difference between winning with zero issues and loading a save and so much more i really wanna write more but the character limit is almost here i ve played both pathfinders before but years after they released if this is how owlcat release feel like that s just embarasing you cannot release the game in this state and then fix it later i am honestly surprised and apalled by the fact that the game is very positive on steam sure doesn t feel like that to me
