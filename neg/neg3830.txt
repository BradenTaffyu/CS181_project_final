2020 early access review dont get me wrong i love this game it was great but recent changes have made it so impossible to survive cause when sacks of flailing flesh manage to completely decimate cement blocks like its paper mache on only the second blood moon there is something very wrong underground bases are completely useless above ground bases are easily toppled since the zombies now just ignore walking through the now very few traps that are available dont get me wrong you can build a base but keeping it up and being able to actually keep it fortified is so hard because running around and looting and trying to balance getting supplies to reinforce and rebuild the decimated sections from the seventh day takes so much effort that it makes the game unfun if you dont have a whole horde of people playing with you to help gather and craft it has pretty much completely destroyed solo vanilla setting play or even small group play im sad to see the game take this direction because this was supposed to be a survival sandbox zombie game and they have taken away so many play styles and made it hard to have an enjoyable survival sandbox zombie experience
