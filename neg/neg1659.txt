2023 i want to like it seriously but ea or is it e pay now what does that mean look somehow ea managed to take a great game boil all of the fun out of it and lock it all behind an immense series of paywalls don t believe me go take a look at the dlc list it s over one thousand dollars each dlc is an amusing twist on the game adding fun elements but is it worth that kind of cost ffffff heck no and without the dlc s its just a matter of time until you get bored of watching your sims going through the same motions play long enough and you get to see the neighbourhoods literally empty out because the ai algorithms scripting they have in place doesn t handle their income jobs etcetera and having children so they all end up in immense debt and don t have kids so when your sims kids grow up they re surrounded by a gradually depleting list of oap s gee what a great game it s almost like they were too busy segregating all the content into bite sized chunks they could sell off piecemeal at the cost of a new game each instead of providing a great game experience don t get this don t put money into it do what they hate the most instead find a second hand copy of sims 3 from somewhere and play that scumbag dev s like this really hate the second hand games trade
