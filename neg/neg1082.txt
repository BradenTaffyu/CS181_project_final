2016 in short the game world is expansive and full of content but it suffers from some uninspired quests i think your impression of this game depends a lot on how you play if you like to goof around and blow things up fallout s wasteland offers plenty of things to do see and shoot you ll have a blast but if you re more into serious apocalypse survival with deep and meaningful quests you ll find fallout 4 to be lacking the survival mode dlc is essential for players seeking a genuine apocalypse challenge unfortunately there s no mod or dlc that can rectify the boring quests about half of the quests i ve undertaken fall along the lines of there s a gang of raiders at location x and they ve been harassing us go kill them that s it you don t even get to ask how much you ll get paid in dialogue this strikes me as lazy quest writing on behalf of the developers especially when compared to the brilliance of the witcher 3 s quests
