2017 i cannot recommend fallout 4 or any other bethesda game for that matter anymore for one i ve been a mod author for bethesda for about a year now and seeing this whole creation club is disheartening what s more are that the mod authors who have produced content for this scummy practice and directly supporting this platform meant to reduce the amount of work bethesda puts into their own games while milking users out of their money fallout 4 in itself was okay the rpg was severely lacking but i still enjoyed it as a devout fallout player but now i can no longer recommend anymore bethesda games as we now know which direction they are headed in their future titles reduced content quality in their games only for them to charge for better features that should ve been implemented in the base game i will no longer support bethesda or buy any of their games i was going to pre order their new wolfenstein game but not anymore
