2019 this game is almost good but it just doesn t quite get there not worth 30 dollars 1 there isn t really any strategy in this game you just spam rooms and training courses 2 there aren t really any challenges in this game there s no fail conditions and no penalty for charging maximum prices charging a lot of money is the only way to limit inflow of patients although this is never explained 3 there is no endgame content every level plays pretty much the same with little reason to continue a level once it s completed 4 some basic things are buggy like placing items sometimes you ll just be unable to place items and sometimes you can sort it out sometimes not it happens a lot and it s very annoying on one occasion i was unable to fix it and had to restart losing hours of playtime 5 speaking of annoying some gameplay elements are just annoying janitors are never able to do their jobs properly unless you employ just an absurd number of them some game challenges require you to manually search the hospital for sick patients or bugs or fires or whatever and it s just annoying and pointless overall the basic frame of a good game is here the hospital building training staff obviously you can do a good managment game in this genre but this one is just not doing it for me
