2023 this game has a major bug that won t allow you to play offline that s a problem for me as i live in a rural area and download my steam purchases at the starbucks in town all was fine until half way through the game and it wouldn t allow me to continue i discovered later that this is a known problem and redbeets solution is to play it online and all is fine i can t do that unless i have internet somewhere that s there their solution and their too lazy to fix it so that you can play offline if i see another game by red beet i m staying clear of it
