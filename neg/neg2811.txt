2022 updated to death game was great early on but each major update reduced or removed something interesting this is one of the weirdest things i ve seen a company do this included removing 2 or the 3 base ftl methods and switching the planet management to something like their awful province system from eu4 plus some irritating jobs system the dlc spamming people on here have already mentioned is part of the company s culture and isn t worth beating them over again
