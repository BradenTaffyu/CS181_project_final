2018 early access review this is a game with massive potential and a fantastic concept but with terrible execution and no support updates are few and far between when the game is updated often new glaring errors are introduced such as water containers being destroyed when used as part of food recipies that seems like it should be a super easy fix another issue is zombies spawning inside the base you built you d think that land claim blocks would include a property to keep zombies from spawning in the local area so yeah when i first got this game i loved it minecraft but defensive emplacements have legitimate purpose unfortunately it was only made progressively harder with each update alongside numerous glitches now it s really grindy can t really set up a base and enjoy it without one heck of a time investment
