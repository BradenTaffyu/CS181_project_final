2022 when i first heard of rimworld i loved the premise as a colony sim junkie and massive fan of video games that give me the opportunity to be creative and larp it sounded perfect for me based on the description and the reviews especially the average number of hours players had it seemed like it delivered on its promises to be a highly varied fresh creative and randomized experience every time my first 50 hours were great i was totally captivated by my first game once i got a hang of the mechanics i liked it so much in fact that i literally bought a second copy the same week i got bored of my first colony felt like i could do something better on a randy random commitment mode higher difficulty world so i tried it worked out great so i then made a third colony with the naked brutality start what i started to realize at this point was that as much as the game likes to pretend to be highly variable fresh fun and random characters constantly at the mercy of the storytelling ai as well as their own humanity disasters peculiar events basically all those promises were pretty superficial every time i made a colony i felt like it was the same story all over again rimworld claims to be a story generator but it really only generates the same story over and over after three colonies there s no more fun to be had with vanilla rimworld without expansions though the characters have their silly little traits and partake in their own quirky behaviors and maybe i ll be attacked by something that the rng makes a little funny by complete chance it s just so superficial and repetitive no matter how many variables i try to play with in the settings or whatever start i go with whatever map i go with i always end up with the same story revolving around even more lackluster and disappointing tower defense many of you might not relate to what i ve said at all and i bet that s because the vast majority of rimworld players use mods sure if the content gets stale i should just mod right here s where i have my major issue with rimworld it s a 34 99 story generator that runs out of ideas after three playthroughs and from then on relies on mods to have any replayable value i have absolutely no issue with small studios and independent game developers earning their fair share for their hard work on the contrary this is actually super important to me but i start to have a bit of a problem with this when the team behind rimworld doesn t deliver the game has some issues that people have been complaining about for a while now the wealth system being irritatingly illogical certain quality of life features being completely nonexistent colonist priorities being misevaluated a lack of content diversity etc have any of these been fixed on vanilla rimworld i don t think so but feel free to correct me if i m wrong there are mods to fix that yeah i m fully aware but people are paying ludeon 34 99 for rimworld and receiving absolutely no updates to the base game not even quality of life fixes that are so represented in the most downloaded mods no instead we get offered dlc that costs half the price of the entire game again i respect artists and game developers but charging literally half the price of an already pricey base game that never goes on sale for content that makes the base game more likely to fulfill the promise it made players isn t cool honestly biotech was my breaking point babies have absolutely nothing to do with anything in the rest of the dlc but instead of adding them as an update to the base game they were still lumped into the paid package because ludeon is so opposed to improving and updating the base game without being paid take a look at terraria for instance it s a third of the price of rimworld and the developers not only continuously make minor improvements to the game but in the past two or three years have released not one but two huge updates that were literally game changing and added so much extra content to the game not only this but these updates were done with the community in mind with the developers reaching out to players to ask them what they wanted to see in the game concerned ape the guy who made stardew valley released a huge completely free update with long time players in mind all while he was working on his newer game he could ve easily charged for this content as dlc and that would ve been totally fine but it was added as an update with older players in mind in order to reward them for playing the game so long and give them a chance to achieve perfection i m not saying that all small developers need to add huge updates for free but what i m trying to point out is the difference between these developers and ludeon which follows a model similar to paradox have a boring base game and charge for dlc to make it a little less boring with ludeon s business model it s against their interest to add to the base game as that takes away from paid content they could add as dlc i don t feel like i can continue to support a studio that operates on this model i feel so out of place seeing everyone s reactions to the new dlc i m sure many people find it completely acceptable to charge this much for dlc and to even charge 35 for the base game despite the fact that it never gets updated and has many flaws that could easily be fixed but i don t find it acceptable anymore and i don t find it acceptable to charge so much for a game that needs so many mods to be interesting after a certain point i feel as though this will only get worse as time goes on and that it isn t a productive strategy for ludeon in the long run unless you troglodytes keep buying 25 dlc
