2023 i hate ceramic balloons they literally make no sense balloons made of ceramic would not float i could kick a ceramic pot and it would explode into a million pieces this game is completely ridiculous to think that fortifying them would make it so i cant pop them anymore unless i throw literal missiles at them this aspect of the game would not be as major if it didn t literally wall me from playing past round 23 i tried everything i could and could nt do anything about them to a point where i just gave up i would rather play goose goose duck than this horrible piece of garbage
