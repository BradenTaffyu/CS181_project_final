2013 the ai is abysmal i can defend a city with only 300 against 4000 all because the ai decides it wants to use a gate all the way across the city instead of climbing the walls or storming the gate in front of it the current political intrigue seems useless and i try to ignore it now lastly the auto resolve feature common to all total war games is incorrect in almost all regards you can have such a superior army and it still have you in the red fight it out and you only lose a fraction of your units 10 out of 10 times this occurs
