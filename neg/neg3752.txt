after all these years of 7d2d in alpha this is it s what the 1 0 release brings might well call this alpha 2 0 at this point this just awful and the price increase imo was a really bad move this game is not worth to what the update brings and would lower the actual price to around 14 99 15 99 because what the game in it s current state no wouldn t pay the now 38 they asking for yeah love customisation but honestly that s only thing i ll give it for this update the devs need to balance out the xp for this game more because you seem to get rewarded much more for killing zombies than you do from new challenge system and quests yeah sure the game is about surviving from zombie and maybe to kill them but they could make the system much more unique and make better changes for this game but i have a feeling this gonna fall off in opt for them now focus on there newer game 7 days blood moons just smh if i could refund this game to unsupport the devs for this game i totally would i just feel this not been thought out or just rushed out the door i m not sure but this game still needs alot work and i don t think it ll get the attention it needs any more since it s now released and like i said this feels still like alpha and this not a full release to me
