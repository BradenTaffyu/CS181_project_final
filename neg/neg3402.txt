i loved cities 1 so i instantly pre ordered deluxe edition of cities 2 and i was scammed there is no proper simulation economics in the game there is nothing to do actually your late game is looking at these messages no customers high rentsbut why there are not proper stats information nothing to fix it there are zero challenges with the traffic oh there is finally a dlc beach properties like extra assets but you don t have beaches in the game i was defending colossal order for a long time but releasing the empty dlc counting on modders to fix the game shame on you
