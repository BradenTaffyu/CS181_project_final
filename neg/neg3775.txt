2023 early access review this game remains early access with constant reworks with no end in sight it is poorly managed by a team which stone walls criticism and tosses it aside early access in this game will probably remain until the true apocalypse simply because there is no end goal the team in charge has lost their passion and when confronted about the state of the game being in alpha state for over a decade with no end in sight they have no answers but instead go off on tangents to purposely argue with you the game is ran by childish game developers that can t seem to get the game out of the basement but what can you expect with a name like the fun pimps
