2023 be better then me it happens again and again and again now a days and this time i am too partially responsible for it i am a fool for buying in to the believe this is only my second time though that well the first game was awesome so i can savely pre order the second one don t buy this game please 1st ofcourse the performance since gpus are the main bottleneck here this time i will say i have an 2060 and the game on medium low settings runs terribly the game looks so bad on the settings i m on but even with a small popultaion the framerate drops to slightly above 10fps it s outrageous oh but it s a next gen game yeahhhhh a poor excuse for mainly poor optimization the game runs terribly on almost all systems that an ordinary person can affordt 2nd mod support who the thought taking the steam workshop away was a good idea that person it s terrible cs1 lived breathed ran entirely on the modding community with out them the game wouldn t have been even half as good why would you force everyone to use the terrible paradox mod launcher taking away a huge ammount of accessibility to modding seriously 3rd the content i mean expectatly they left out content from cs1 and they will reintroduce it through dlc but come on no custom parks only one type of footpath focus on car centric city planning colllege campuses have been scaled down the specialised industry looks like utter garbage etc and personaly i don t realllllly like any of the maps that much after some play time 4ththe improved traffic ai is horrbile at merging lanes and seemingly stopps at random the garbage collection is bugged and unbalanced the economy feels random and your hourly income changes of don t make sense the content realy does feel lackluster and the game feels empty tram depots don t deploy enough trams even with upgrades the zoning demand forces you to build for the most part sprawling suburbs like the us and canada the game doesn t allow you to implenment elements of modern city planning with a too high reliance on car traffic the step in size between mid density row housing and regular mid density buildings is too big even with the latest patch the simulation starts to run significantly slower at around 60000k population for me you can t determin which road lanes are made bus lanes you can only ban vehichles from turning left right or going straight on all road lanes not only on specific ones honestly i feel so disappointed i wanted to love this game but i will propably have to wait atleast another year before the game becomes playable do not buy this game i m begging you be better then me edit some ppl misunderstood my 3rd poin i feel like i know that it s stupid to expect every dlc from cs1 in this game it shouldn t be though i do want to add but i still feel like that the game just feels well hollow the base for a good game is there but the included content feels lacking idk maybe that s just me
