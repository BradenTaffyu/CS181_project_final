2018 i really love this game series the first rome tw was my all time fav game and when rome ii came out i pre ordered with months in advance and took a week off work just to play it now this debacle happened total war games are historically authentic not historically accurate if having female units upsets you that much you can either mod them out or just not play ca ellafrom a historically authentic perspective there are no reasons for which to implement female generals in the mediterranean world in that period even if there were a handful of female leaders like cleopatra or boadicea but these were incredibly few and far between putting unnecessary and unwarranted features like this into the game takes away a huge portion of immersion and brings the game down to a point where i most likely won t touch it in the future and regarding community content editor ella mcconnell she must be one of the worst at her job for replying like that to a few people in a thread
