2021 my 6 year old loves to play jwe in sandbox mode all he does is build hatcheries and release dinosaurs how happy is he going to be tomorrow when i tell him that he can t really play jwe2 until i ve unlocked everything for him in campaign mode or whatever it is well done frontier i haven t touched any of the features other than sandbox in the first game and now i have to work my way through the whole game so my son has more than a triceratops to look at in canada i don t care for your half arsed story line or the celebrity voice overs here s looking forward to prehistoric kingdom what a waste of money this is considering all the content that should be available at the start will be provided down the line as paid content
