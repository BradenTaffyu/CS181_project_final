2021 game is on sale and would buy it again and to all the people that think micro transactions being in this game makes it bad 1 it doesn t make the game impossible to beat its all quality of life upgrades 2 the hardest game mode in the game restricts anything that can be bought with micro transactions and there are people that have beaten that game mode on all levels 3 the difficulty of this game ranges from very easy you can play and win with minimal strategy and effort to trial and error restarts pauses micromanagement and a planned out strategy 4 the developers communicate with the community they aren t ea activision or rockstar 5 the only people that could have valid complaints are those complaining about bugs which this game barely has in my experience new features which are being improved upon and replayability which isn t even an issue until you finish the game this game is not pay to win the features you can pay for make the game easier but it blocks 0 content and is even banned in the hardest game modes also this game is cheap more so on sale which is when i bought it and if i had the money i d buy ingame money just to support them as the previous versions of this game were free to play as a browser game if you want a better explanation on why this game is not pay to win sources nk website account can t be used to log in to your mobile or steam btd6 version of the game unless it has the same login details email and password which they can have also don t forget login details and read support faq long versioni ve had some issues with the login process with my nk account after deleting and reinstalling i forget my details and went to the nk website made an account and tried to log in with that account it didn t work then linked the game to my steam but it was a new profile and i didn t get back my progress left the game alone for a few weeks and tried again today i typed in the same account details for the website didn t work again then clicked the password recovery option changed it and tried again it worked then i went on the website and read the support faq found one that said the accounts for the game is seperate from the account on the website i have the same email for both so you can use the same email for the website and the game not sure if the name can be the same but you can t log in on the website with your game s account and vise versa unless both login details are the same which is possible since my email used is the same article that states accounts are seperate put this in the not recommended review section so the crap some people say can be disproved
