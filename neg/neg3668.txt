2023 early access review why can t i grab water from a river and boil it why does a dew collector something you should be able to make with just some tarps and a bucket cost 1500 why do i need to i need to read a bunch of magazines to figure out how to boil meat why did you make stamina take forever to increase and the most nonsensical part why does a dew collector spawn screamers its not like its making any noise using fuel or even making light so why should it spawn a horde all you guys had to do was update the graphics sounds and maybe a few locations and alpha 21 would have been much better but by removing already fine features you ve made the game more tedious
