2019 early access review long time i was thinking about that review i spend in this game nearly 700 hours then i think that i have some knowledge to share with you why negative theres many reasons i played this game since a11 and from update to update game its worse now game is unplayable it looks like devs takes their money for that game and now just put some visual worthless update one per year theres big problem with cheaters who dupping glitching items easy anticheat not work at all there is neverending story with optimalization my comp specs is i74790k gtx1070oc 32gbram ssd and raid disks but it dont help for a long time game takes all the ram what you had after one hour of playing all 32gb was full and you needed to restart a game now its 13 15gb and still game freeze from time to time how they improved that ram usage they deleted loads of crafting items now theres only few items to build craft in all categories before that there was variety of options to create personalize a look of your base many times you had to travel a long way to find something when i started at a11 it was a real survival game you had to put a huge efford to get find create something for example to have a shooting weapon first of all you had to learn how to build it find instruction then you needed parts better quality better damage there was 1 600 lvls of quality now its only 1 6 then ammo what you could make by yourself after you learn it and to that you needed shooting skill what you improoving by using that weapon higher skill better damage sometimes it takes few real days to get it or few hours when you steal it from someones base now you find totaly ready weapon with ammo in 10 20min of playing to that i can add that system of hitboxes are also downgraded before there was normal critical headshoots one shot one kill now you have to hit head 3 times to kill guy devs saying that now you can finish game in 30 hours before it takes few hundreds hours to maxout your character and there was many things left to do there is more things to mention but other players writes about it one positive thing is that now you have weight limitation in your bagpack that forced you to play with someone else to carry large amout of loot rob enemy base and bring loot back to your base sum up before it was the best survival game on market now its a random zombie shooter like many other rust etc
