2023 i want to recommend the game so bad but i cant even play it i paid 70 for a game i cant play obviously i bought the silver edition in order to play the game 3 days early and the game worked great during this time and i fell in love with the game a bit but once the general launch released i ve been unable to hop into a lobby with people or play solo due to the online nature of the game i ve spent 5 of my 16 hour playtime at the time of writing waiting in que for a match and during this time i asked myself if a game is online only and the servers aren t up do i even own the game the conclusion i came to was no i don t even if they fix the servers i plan to never buy an online only game again
