2022 early access review so mostly got this game to play with a friend i ll say this the game can be fun very very fun however it has a very large emphasis on having mechanics which you re going to need to spend a lot of arduous trial and error to figure out the combat system is very very clunky and for me more often than not made me feel dealing with a situation was more up to rng than my ability to manage it the isometric cursor is nice but your depth perception will betray you there will be many moments when fighting where you feel as if you ll hit something only for your swing to be wildly off when playing your biggest downfall is thinking because you got used to killing zombies a certain way that that method will always work in every situation and it absolutely will not zombies have a grab animation which your character is locked into until it ends during this animation you can be bit by other zombies and the animation is quite long in terms of combat whether they ll grab you is pretty much rng your only option is to stay back or be constantly shoving them so they can t initiate the animation the strength stat helps but is a massive slog to get to a level where it s really helping you significantly neither my friend nor i really enjoyed the concept of the hardcore experience and modded out the guaranteed death on bite as well as losing all stats on death by using a journal mod for us this increased our enjoyment and decreased the potential slog ragequit material which is spending countless hours on default xp rate to grind your stats back up to be useful again all of this is mere preference and the game is very customizable the game s atmosphere is fantastic the game will absolutely suck you in with excellent sound design for the environment as well as weather being stuck out in fog is a very scary experience with the low visibility and zombies potentially anywhere the music isn t half bad either bit of a folksy type of soundtrack fitting to the kentucky setting another point which i enjoyed was the sims like stat management system with hunger boredom depression stamina etc etc managing these stats gives you an immersive grounding in the games world as well as a ticking clock e g your stomach pushing you forward to scavenge for food and supplies to keep yourself alive there really isn t much of an endgame at the time of this review other than hoarding supplies and building yourself a base the game has one core principal which is to survive in a place you cannot leave and you are expected to die despite the good the game s core mechanics just feel too clunky for me to recommend it an update later redesigning combat might bring me back that isn t to say you the reader won t enjoy the game give it a shot see if you like it it s some people s bread and butter just not mine personally
