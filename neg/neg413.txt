2023 fallout has always been great and the inner working fusion core of this game is no different love the story outdated graphics and even the included game breaking bethesda bugs there are too many limitations and or extensions which keep this game from living up to it s maximum potential to name some but not all 1 small stash limit it s impossible to play this game while taking loot after level 50 that is with deleting half of your inventory time and time again it is not fun walking while overweight so no more picking things up for me 2 too many building restrictions camp budget exceeded no plans for this door does not fit in corresponding structure for no reason can t even create power armor stands without buying them as a micro transaction and things are not replaceable after removing them are notable inclusions amongst others 3 the designed grind around main quests half of the missions consist of nothing more than pick this up oh this too it doesn t work find a new one and finally sorry i lied it wasn t needed kinda non telling one liners it really isn t enjoyable but has to be done if you actually want to progress to the end of said story all of the hours that i played could be condensed in a good compact story of around 20 30 hours there is no reason for these artificial limitations which wreck havoc on your ability and freedom to explore the wasteland it is straight up ridiculous to buy the base game the pittsburgh deal while you secretly need to buy half of all described from that highly should be illegal dodgy corner shop of an atom and have to have a very much unappreciated so incredibly too much expensive fallout 1st subscription to even store things normally bethesda please have my ideas for actually free 15 a month fallout 1st too cheap for most people disregard 30 a month fallout 1st unlock a special event nuke the wallet event reward gives a two hour a month elite experience to our best and most upmost finest players with the two hour buff activated on your pip boy you will never feel alone in the wasteland again this buff plays the best 30 second loop of todd howard laughing use comes with the side effect sound inability which prevents the user from turning off the holotape 100 a month fallout 2st get 40 special edition i robbed you nuka cola caps plans to build the caps for 200 metal scrap with an inclusion of free free unlocking requires 50 special edition caps pink naked ghoul skins
