2023 early access review this was a big game for me and my stepdad but it s honestly such a huge disappointment visually the game is stunning and that s majorly due to the transition to ue5 but the game performs like ass even on some higher end hardware which is a real shame considering this was supposed to be a step up in terms of performance and stability i understand the game is in early access and i hope they do continue to optimize the game i still feel greatly disappointed that after almost a year worth of delays we got a different version of ark that looks better has the same bugs worse performance and only one map at a 35 price tag this is not a love letter this is a disappointment i hope some day i will have to come back to this review to put the game in a brighter light but until then i wouldn t recommend this game to anyone unless you have a lot of money to waste or love games that release half baked
