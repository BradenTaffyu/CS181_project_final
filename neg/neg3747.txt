early access review there are few games in the history of the industry in which the developer has been so overtly hostile to their own creation i don t know if there was a change of hands but it wouldn t surprise me this game used to be awesome with bethesda esque level progression base building farming pvp etc it felt natural and was one of the better games on steam over the course of time the devs have knowingly removed items and retooled content in an effort of funneling everyone into the same game play at this point the game is a bastardized version of what it once was with about two thirds the content of the time i spent playing it half of it was before they started down this horrible path the other half is playing a mod called darkness falls which is mostly adding back what they ve taken out you are better than this devs
