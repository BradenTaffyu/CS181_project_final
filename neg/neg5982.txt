2017 can t say i can recommend this game anymore it used to be very fun and is still a great game but not if you don t buy all of the dlc the functional one not the cosmetic ones luckily the game updates on its own and adds in the optional features fully for the ai and you get some kind of watered down version which makes it almost impossible to play well so there is no option to play without the dlc features even if you don t have the dlc and want none of the features from the dlc this is just terrible pollicy
