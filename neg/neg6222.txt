this game is a very nice game if it would not crash so much i ve been through this game once and tried to start over again but even with the recommended community patches it still keeps crashing at random times all the crash tutorials do not give a definite solution maybe it works a few rounds but mostly it does not i use the nmm and the 4gb patch and some others but i do not get this working and really this should be solved by bethesda or obsidian they released a buggy game and never did anything to solve the issues
