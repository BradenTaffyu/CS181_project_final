2023 the fan base for coh is drawn to the game for the historical accuracy and the gritty real feel that the games bring the 3rd installment is a massive step back from its predecessor that came out a decade before they would ve been better off releasing coh2 again with a new campaign and additional units and factions the graphics look worse the animation art style is toy like compared to the previous 2 games this gleans the same issues that aoe fans encountered with relic on aoe4 less content than its predecessors and virtually no graphics or gameplay improvement rts games are not a new concept relic needs to improve on the examples of good games that have come before it no need to reinvent the wheel especially if your new version of the wheel is a square edit modders have made this playable the base game is still worthless the lack of factions and content is a common theme with relic lowering the bar for future projects they are going the way of ea make the most money for the least amount of work it would be awesome if they would take some pride in the products they churn out but those days are long gone
