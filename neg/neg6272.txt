2023 early access review this game started off so great fun quick some strategic depth and interesting choices to make in deck building and during game play coming from many years of hearthstone it was a breath of fresh air however the monetization scheme of the game once you understand it and suffer through it is dauntingly bad if you are a f2p player or even paying for the season pass 10 usd month you will not earn enough currency for even one meta deck that could be competitive at higher levels with hearthstone a f2p player could earn enough currency for one or two good meta decks per expansion this was enough to climb to high ranks or even legend and the game never felt truly pay to win or super greedy it turns out the dust system and being able to craft the exact cards you want was actually really good marvel snap is the opposite there is no way to target a specific card you want and even if you did the brand new cards are insanely expensive after playing marvel snap casually for a couple of months the card acquisition felt increasingly oppressive and expensive how much do you need to spend to get galactus or one of the good new cards it is probably in the thousands of dollars and on top of that it is 100 reliant on luck it really is too bad second dinner missed a huge opportunity here by mixing a great game with such a greedy monetization scheme
