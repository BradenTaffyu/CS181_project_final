2017 look the game itself is good i prefer this to warhammer 1 in terms of ui map mechanics its fine it really is but the fact none of the problems from the first game have been addressed is disgracful and further fuels the arguement that this isnt a sequel just an expansion no proper sieges no settlement battles even more restricted and broken diplomacy the vortex campaign that we were promised would not interfer with your progress and expansion does just that elite stacks spawning in your weakest areas and sieging the same turn is not strategy you are unable to expand if you choose the vortex path simply unable you have to turtle up in your lands and ride the rubberbanding ai progression out there are quest battles that have time limits now that again is anti strategy the battle at the end of the vortex campaign will game over screen you if you lose it seems impossible since the battle is easy but that is not total war a whole camapign hours of work hundreds of turns gone its just not an improvement these games are frustrating because its all there in some areas but woefully short in others battles in warhammer 1 and 2 are the worst part about the games i hate fighting them closing notes of things that will probably be patched ive had some seriously frustrating crashes after long soul sucking suicide inducing battles ai armies comp is broken right now a dark elf army shouldnt have 14 war hydra in it its impossible to autoresolve because the computer favors them so hard even if you bring in 2 3 armies garrisons have not chance high elves need a little nerf imo yeah i get theyre meant to be good but theres frequently battles where i have my best troops i outnumber many times over their force is tiny yet the auto resolve is in their favor forcing me to fight a pointless battle in a game where battles are painful to play also im sick of seeing high elf stacks of 2 or 3 units of pheonix guard and then the rest moon dragons and frost pheonixs heres to warhammer 3 maybe itll be different
