i want to recommend this game but i can t the gameplay is great graphics are good we can finally play eras the reason can t recommend thus game i had 43 hours of play then out of nowhere i and many others have received an error code from denuvo saying sorry something went wrong which basically locks us out a game we paid for 2k support has been of zero help code fusion doesn t even respond to you at all the insane building of shaders and the constant building of shaders every time you start the game is annoying this is highly unacceptable we waited 5 years for mess that some of us can t even play this is ridiculous they should have never used denuvo in the first place knowing this trash anti cheat causes all kinds of issues but 2k doesn t care because those who can play are giving them money and for the rest of us oh well unless they remove denuvo like so many other developers have done which they won t do not waste your money on this game not even on sale
