2019 early access review i used to love this game during alpha 16 but now when a17 is live i dont see a point in playing it they remove all the fun aspect of the game e g zombie looting skill books crafting system was logic and fair bigger map its a realistic zombie survival game where u can do anything back then now with alpha 17 the game just feels so small and little to the developers if you really dont care for the hardcore gamers opinions that they support you from day 1 till now then theres no point in continue making the game period if you do really care for your consumers bring back what alpha 16 have forward to the next update peace
