don t know what s more insulting that this was in ea for 11 years with nothing but minimal bug fixes for the last 5 or that they think the minimal bug fixes they have performed for the last 5 years somehow makes this game worth 45 nearly overnight don t get me wrong it s a decently fun game when played with friends but it s barely worth 15 it used to be priced at i would just wait for the eventual sale it ll go on
