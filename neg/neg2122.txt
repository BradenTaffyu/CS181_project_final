2023 i have played war thunder for a long time but currently with the way the economics are it s unplayable i don t necessarily hate repair costs i understand that it s a free game and that it has to make money somehow but i regularly get 6 kills a match on realistic and still can t afford to repair and rearm my tanks some of the vehicles are in no way balanced for some of them you need a specific type of shell just to stand a chance and even then it s almost not even worth it since you spend those silver lions on rearming your tank i also don t think that it s fair to jack up the repair cost of the vehicle after every single upgrade it s already difficult enough to break even without them making it more expensive with damn near every action that you take at rate that which thing are going it s only a matter of time until they increase the repair cost per second that you look at the tank the grind is also a major issue i enjoy a bit of a challenge i can get behind having to earn something by your own merit but having played 490 hours and still haven t been able to finish a tech tree is down right idiotic now the reason why i haven t finished a single tech tree is because a have refused to spend a single cent on this game but that makes it almost impossible to progress since you have to play more and more matches to get a new vehicle but without spending money you can t afford the repair cost and you have to spread between multiple tech trees instead of focusing on one so until gaijin finally listens to its player base and fix their game i can t recommend it
