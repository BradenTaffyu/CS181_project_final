2023 early access review friends and i have been playing this game on sundays for a fun game night we were hyped when a21 came and dove in to find better visuals the deer wobble is now adorable but then magazines losing water bottles status effects in one or two hits from enemies and dying so constantly that it became frustrating magazines seemed great until we wanted to cook basic food and barely had recipes wasn t this supposed to grant more freedom if you split loot you just lock everyone out of necessary crafts and have to dedicate people to certain things just an arbitrary change water is the big divider lately with people riding the devs so hard to claim well gosh josh just drink the bad water and eat all these meals and get a net positive goodness do you think you d really have 500 water irl lmao just do quests and get 12k dukes it s not hard playing with friends is harder now with this change with status effects i feel this update has taken an even bigger hit what once was a seldom abrasion has become getting a bleed dot a concussion infected and possibly more all at once i went to discussions to see what s up with that and that s where i saw the devs locking and moving threads berating people and more the devs are cowards they will not engage in discussion you re simply wrong if you don t like the update
