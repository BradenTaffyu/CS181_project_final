2021 one step forward two steps backsetting aside their dlc practices it just feels like for every step forward they take two steps back i actually like the option to micromanage every aspect of my empire should i choose however i do think there should be good automated options for those who wish to delegate and play their way unfortunately for every one item they fix or address they make others worse or add new ones just some of my complaints rants trade and piracy yes it makes sense that a wide empire would have a hard time with pirates i can even understand diverting military resources to combat piracy but what is the point of of having sectors and governors if i still have to manage everything add to the fact the ui is horrible and you end up with a fleet list made up of mostly patrol fleets not to mention since everything funnels back to the capital late game i have patrol fleets stronger then most empire navies sectors speaking of sectors i like that it s now optional as i didn t entirely like the old system but why am i not able to choose what systems planets belong to which sectors i doesn t make sense and the automated system frankly sucks planets having sectors on planets dedicated to specific purposes makes sense having buildings that provide the same resource but less and take up a building slot does not make sense i m not referring to buildings which boost resource collection talking about hydroponics farms is there a reason for their existence unless you are truly short on food because you keep settling bad planets they just waste a building slot speaking of building slots if i have the resources why do i need to wait until there is enough people to unlock a slot if i don t have enough people to work there it should just be inactive like in prior iterations also building slots don t make any sense sorry you guys don t get a theater because we ran out of the 10 slots to build it in on this whole planet yeah yeah um it s actually an entire entertainment sector not just one building you have an entire sector for monuments artificial limits ah i see you own hundreds of systems and planets i will allow you 100 ships 10 starbases and 1 envoy yes i understand if you have the resources you can exceed your fleet or starbase limits with heavy penalties and it s meant to represent how much your empire can logistically manage but it really meant to control snowballing with limited effect honestly it make it harder for smaller empires to oppose larger ones however you re telling me my empire literally only has one person qualified to be a diplomat also i see you have an overwhelming fleet but since you don t have enough influence you can only take 5 systems at a time even in space you can t get away from influencers there s more i could complain about but that s enough of my ranting i do like the game given the hundreds of hours i ve put in and hundreds more i probably will but i can t recommend it except to those really want a europa universalis in space especially because of the hidden cost it would be like an addict recommending drugs to a friend and i can t do that to all you nice people
