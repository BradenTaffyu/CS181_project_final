early access review remember when blizzard gave up on overwatch to release overwatch 2 a game with few differences besides the fact that it was far more monetized and greedy less content and devs that don t really care that s what happened to ark survival ascended it s the same game don t let the made in unreal engine 5 sway you it s ark survival evolved but with far far less content requires much higher specs to run even then it crashes a lot admittedly i was having fun i put in about 170 hours into this game and was prepared to buy the cool cosmetics coming out on scorched earth because they said all there would be is paid cosmetics they lied in ase you were only paywalled by having to buy new maps but now the current state is that you ll be on a map unable to use core features of said map and tame new dinos snail games has lost me and most everyone in my server with 40 active players a day and hundreds who have already beat the island i wish i could get a refund on the money i spent on this game because i never want to touch it if they go through with paywalled dinos and features on a map you already own i couldn t reccomend this game to anyone wildcard and snailgames are greedy and don t actually care about their game do not buy 4 10 only got 3 10 becuase it was kind of fun playing on a pve server with boosted rates and friends
