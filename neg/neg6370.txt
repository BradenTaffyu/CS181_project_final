2017 i hate to say no to such a fun game slime rancher is very well developed and there s a lot of potential tt rewards those who explore and experiment and visually is one of the nicest games i ve played in a long time however like most sandbox games it suffers like most do after you have unlocked all the areas there is very little incentive to keep playing the narrative just leaves you hanging the slime science is a nice tool to be sure but it takes far too long to progress for be truly useful
