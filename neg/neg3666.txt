its fine i guess its a good game on its own but it was really only ever worth the 20 in the last 10 years of development there has been practically no actual changes that matter slight visual improvement change in material pacing rebalancing rebalancing and 574 total reworks of the skill and tool systems all of which boils down to mechanic revision with no actual added gameplay the game never actually moves forward its just keeps moving sideways if you go back and download one of the old alphas its a slightly different game its not a better game or even a worse game its just a slightly different game the most frustrating part of this game is knowing how amazing and successful it could have been or heck could still be if the developers actually cared about it at all but they don t raising the price is just an insult
