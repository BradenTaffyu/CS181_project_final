taleworlds clearly does not give a about this game once you bought it stuck in early access for years the amount of features added to singleplayer is laughable feedback of the community was ignored they tried to make multiplayer into a competitive arena fighter and ended up killing it instead only saving grace are a large variety of detail rich mods for multiplayer and singleplayer released by dedicated unpaid modders which easily eclipse the base game and also get broken by every minor update multiplayer login servers why exactly are those mandatory have been broken for over a week now with no communication from taleworlds making multiplayer impossible to play as everyone gets kicked back to the lobby disrupting both regular gameplay on the modded self hosted servers as well as killing organised modded events its still a unique experience you wont get in any other game but thinking about what couldve been is depressing
