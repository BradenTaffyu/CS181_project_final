2021 you cannot play with friends unless you rent a server for 0 50 per hour and server closes at the end of the race in a rented server you will be playing 1v1 because no one joins the hosted servers ways to play with your friends hosted sessions are all paid dlc unless you rent a server at 50 cents an hour and server closes after one race league races are once a week you have to buy a car and track which are different every week team races happen once a weekend you have to buy a car and track which are different every week people defend this game i guess because they have so much invested already the subscription model 10 a month where you also have to buy a new car and track every weekend is disgusting 15 car plus 15 track every weekend the starting cars you get for your 10 a month never change and they are mostly boat like cars that float around or are really slow the ui could use a bit of work every single race i would get to the end and i couldn t tell if i was done the race it s also difficult to tell which place you are in and who is behind you and how far also at the end of the race it doesn t say how long your total race was but only your best lap and average lap we got into separate races 9 10 times and we couldn t even tell who finished faster because it didn t say total time only relative to people in your race the only redeeming point about this game is the physics engine it is really good but nowhere near good enough to pay 10 a month and also have to buy 2 000 worth of content the ranked matchmaking is also really good but not perfect if you dispute someone rear ending you at full speed the admins won t reverse it it is worth mentioning the elitist gatekeeping in the discords where if you complain in the slightest about the predatory pricing model they will flame you for being poor actually disgusting if you are looking for a general all around simulator check out assetto corsa racing department a mod website has 18 000 mods for the game so many cars and tracks the physics engine is 95 similar the only downside is the lack of ranked matchmaking i would also recommend f1 2021 as it has a great story mode but is restricted to f1 style cars if you have no friends and are alright paying 130 a month then this game might be right for you so much missed potential with this one because of greedy developers
