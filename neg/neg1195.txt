2015 fallout 4 was to me a major disappointment but before i go there i want you all to know that i m a giant fan of the fallout series i played fallout 1 for the first time when it came out in 97 and i ve been a die hard fan ever since with nearly 800 hours in f1 over 2000 hours in f2 and about 400 hours in tactics i was on a all time high when i heard of fallout 3 i finished this game in about a year and praised bethesda for their work then out of the four states commonwealth new vegas arose made by obsidian on bethesdas command this game was an excellent filler and addition to the fallout series after years of modding and hours of fun the whispers of fallout 4 began to infest the internet like cancer and it started a giant hype among gamers that only one of the titan companies in the gaming community could make i ve never been so hyped for a game my entire life about 12 03 a m on november 10th i hit the play button now the good things about fallout 4 amazing post apocalyptic world design incredible creature design awesome power armor mechanics very few bugs i encountered about 5 minor bugs in about 180 hour game time good game mechanicsthe bad things about fallout 4 30 or so places to visit is purely for building settlements there is no point in doing this unless you like sim games there are very few quests except the never ending grinding quests conversations have no different outcome with few exceptions there are 5 different enemies you can expect to encounter on all points of visit raiders ghouls gunners super mutants robots with close to no diversity the main story is about a 2 to 3 hour quest the main story includes more than a few retrieval of ordinary game items quests with no special events at all there are more than 20 power armors in the game easily collected the type and level power armors you find is random which means you can end up with only one type of power armor except for the one you can buy i ve never ran out of fusion cores power armor fuel despite using laser gatling all the time at level 20 you can be next to immortal on the hardest difficulty this renders sneaking useless after level 10 there is no random encounter perk there is next to zero special or diverse places to find there is no garys in a vault no talking deathclaws no creepy cannibal town no mysterious inaccessible bunker no bethesda building that sort of things and where is the enclave which has been a major factor in earlier gamessummary to me it feels like they put all their effort in graphics and scenery and forgot that itis supposed to be a story and exploring driven rpg they made a awesome map but then spray painted random enemies all over it to make a dull and repetitive world after exploring for 10 hours istarted to feel alone in a mmorpg i am pissed
