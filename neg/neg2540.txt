2022 04 22 22 the team has suddenly announced that they will be reworking the red dot and reflex sights and the poi icon settings while i m cautiously happy to see these issues addressed i must remind you that these were originally deliberate development decisions that found themselves into the game anyways you can find more information in the official community update the dev team introducing new patches is like watching mr bean bumbling around in a glassware store every attempt at fixing things only makes the situation worse for every bug they fix they introduce 2 new ones most of the dlc they release will probably break something important like certain animals or sound effects completely disappearing from the game the pr team has a history of downplaying reported bugs every patch they release requires you to re download huge 20 70 gb parts of the game i ve even ran into a 60 gb large update which had to be downloaded in one go and couldn t be paused or it would restart from the beginning they ve just released an in game menu dlc store for the game s steam version this means you re forced to download a 24 gb large update in order to even continue playing the game who asked for this no one they called this feature a free standalone addition to the game and a small quality of life element well hope you have enough disk space and internet data for this absolutely necessary quality of life element oh and don t forget to buy our dlcs here s the link to the announcement the game s current state is mirrored by the commenters see for yourself please don t tell me this the free content update you ve hyped to us for this year for the game itself i m really torn the base gameplay loop is entertaining and the gorgeous graphics and the huge maps will keep you immersed in the game for a while sadly after ten hours or so you ll start to see the seams quickly pull apart revealing simple and buggy animal ai ridiculously bad reload animations needlessly ejecting or removing unused ammo bolts being operated unnecessarily undented primers etc base features like tents atvs blinds tripods and animal callers walled behind paid dlc plus the general devoid of attention to detail the red dot sight is useless blurry mess without mods many sights are just straight up zeroed incorrectly and the iron sights on rifles are laughably bad i ve already spent a combined time of 200 hours into this game 80 of that is just sneaking slowly towards animals and i can t say how much of it was quality time and how much it was pure hedonic threadmill running from one animal to another i still love the simulator esque aspect of the game but unfortunately the devs are slowly making it harder and harder to for players to get immersed in the game recently they ve added oversized point of interest icons to float around your hud and if you disable them you also lose the icons huts feed and rest zones spotted animals and observation towers on your map which are absolutely necessary for enjoyable play ridiculous design decisions like these are slowly ruining the game for a large quantity of players you know maybe there s something very wrong when players slowly start to get more and more nervous of seeing a new update pop up in its current state the game is not worth the time it requires and thus i can t recommend this game
