2016 i hate you gaijin you greedy b imgaine this game for 40 80 dollars and the grind is much much less i like this game a lot not because its good but because there is no other game like this its a monopoly honestly i want a ww2 tank game that looks and runs well there is no other games like it so you have to deal with gaijin its sad that the gaming library is turning into a bunch of greedy money only companies i would pay 100 dollars for this game to just make the game a game and not f2p garrbage now if you want to pay your way through and pass the grind by the way the grind will take months to go through you will be paying hundred and hundred of dollars were talking 1000 dollars worth of f2p microtransactions but some people like the grind and others don t i bet if you made two war thunders one just like this one a free to play heavy grinding game and then you made another that was like battlefield 3 grinding but cost 60 dollars i bet you people would like the battfield 3 grinding and 60 dollar version better listen if your a game dev and you wanna make some money make a ww2 tank game if you make it good people will come right now gaijin rules this game market for this type of genre i promise you if you just clone this game and make the grind less and fix a few things and put a 40 60 price tag on it no one would play war thunder for the tanks at least
