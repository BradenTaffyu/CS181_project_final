barrier to entrythe game is fun and i have enjoyed my time with it if this game seems appealing to you it will probably be quite fun but the barrier tldr the devs have expressed concern about the high financial barrier to entry they are not working on lowering the financial barrier and instead create it to prey upon new players take your money somewhere where you and your worth are respected i live in canada and will be talking about canadian prices and price trends at the time of writing the devs have recently released a subscription model for the dlc in the game this is not inherently a bad thing despite what you may see in discussions the subscription is made for new players as stated by the dev diary 334 if you will allow me to be hyperbolic financial barriers are made up as this digital game could be given away for free and it would not bankrupt paradox games obviously that is not an effective way to continue to develop games but the core concept is there if the game is too expensive to play are the devs working on ways to make it cheaper to enjoy after a while trawling through steam databases i can see two pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that they are not working to make the game easier to buy and one pointing to some small efforts to help you the new player the part helping new players over time the stellaris dlc s have taken longer and longer to begin to go on sale and take even longer to reach a sale of 50 this has changed in the last few dlc i will use the toxoids dlc as my benchmark because that is when i feel as though the sentiment towards the dlc started to shift the average time to go on sale for 20 for toxoids and the two dlc that came out before it was 379 days for the astral planes dlc and the two dlcs before it took 209 days this is a major break in the pattern of sales for stellaris you can say i cherry picked but i can send you my spreadsheets and graphs this is a distinct break in the norm this allows players to enjoy content that may have attracted you to the game cheaper or quicker additionally the game is very balanced around the presense of the dlc and playing with all the dlc is assumed by all the stellaris media you will find having the recent dlc reach its maximum discount quicker allows for more people to play the primary stellaris experience but the two things that are hurting new players 1 the price of the most recent dlcs are far higher than equivalent dlc that came before the first contact story pack dlc is currently 19 99 cdn every other story pack is 13 99 cdn the new dlc costs more in a way completely incongruous with the entire history of the price trends of every piece of dlc in this game there is no reason for this cost and if it was to be more in line with long term pricing that the other dlc will catch up to when 2 there have been three price increases for stellaris dlc in canada in the last two years the game costs more because of more dlc but also every single one of those dlc has become harder to buy the necroid dlc is the prime example of this as it has increased from 8 99 cdn to 13 99 cdn necroids costs 55 more to buy right now compared to when it was released you can argue that they have added content to the dlc but you could buy it at it s original price with all the new content included for a time and even then they increased the price 1 after adding content the other 4 had no reason to occur the exact game and dlc i bought will cost you more to buy let alone the dlc released since then the financial barrier of entry to this game is growing the logical reason is that it is always gaining new dlc and so there is more to buy but the cost of the same game is increasing and the new dlc costs more then equivalent dlc while also having the same price increases the price changes are far beyond inflation in canada there is no reason for this gouging of our wallets and so paradox created the expansion subscription an easy solution to this mysterious problem of a financial barrier that has appeared from greed the slow growth of the library of dlc you should buy what if you didn t own the dlc but paid each month for a rental stellar idea case closed see you next month paradox does not care about the barrier to entry they made it and continue to make it today paradox is hiding behind caring for new players while bleeding their wallets dry you should not buy this game find a developer that is happy to provide joy and only asks for as much as they need to keep making the games they love
