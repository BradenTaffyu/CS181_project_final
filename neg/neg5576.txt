2013 review dates from weeks after release still have to give it a 2nd chance this is from a total war fan and very subjective quite a few reasons are personal tastethe biggest budget total war to me looks like many aaa games this year and got on the market in beta alpha stage this game would have been alright if they made it pre purchase with beta acces and in that stage it should still be instead of moneygrinding dlc s down to the facts why i do not like this game ca wants you to play very long campaigns so they made the battles in fields really fast paced for me its horrible each turn is a year no season s no strategy for winter no nice map transform ok there now is if you pay for the ceasar dlc improved diplomacy did not play long enough to tell the whole story but at the start of the game its pritty horrible the political system nobody knows what it is good for or when it makes any difference at all we have big plans for rome total war 2 multiplayer a poll by some guys who did not like the avatar system and another shortcut was found to shorten development time and strip all of the great improvements in shogun 2 making multiplayer almost boring instead of putting loads of time in fixing the leaderboards dropping etc campaign with capture points in open fields and multiplayer with none corner camping in mp and very limited tactical options in sp multiplayer campaign stop asking for 2vs2 in each new game the regular 1vs1 gets more desync s actually mailing eachothers save s like in the old day s should be supported bugs for landing bugs for moving bugs for clicking ah well this will get patched thats alright units have all the poly s in the world while the terrain on open ground to me is not what it should be for a game in 2013 at this price units automaticly convert to ships same as in civ 5 i hate this arcade thing with routing units going up sea raiding your port the next turn while you should have slaughtered them on the beach etc ai that beats you only with bonus cheating no brain at all ok that is just total war ui as if you play a future game nothing like a history game unit cards should be art or something but i have trouble recognising what unit it really is ca historical accuracy ca realism gray wolves in the desert in the end it never made me feel like hurr i take over the world thinking over all my moves rather go play rome 1 the strategy part is gone to me music in total war games has always been really nice but this is just mainstream to me not touching me just some fitting noice animations loads of them being a huge improvement over last games but rarely visual when all units are in a blob kinda ok tough that all men fight instead of going line by line for every unit in way to short battle s while other nice extra s like general speech scene s many cut scene s etc are yet again striped out for the ultimate budget game i was expecting afther shogun 2 they would make loads of these but no overal the game is still alright but the franchise to me is broken all the new options from shogun 2 multiplayer are gone instead of fixed the single player is not touching me like it did in the past strategy is gonelike many mainstream games now get it with a big discount
