2023 it s gta without the cars or toxicity it s fun to play overall but lots of pretty infuriating decisions from the devs on this one such as aggressive microtransactioning i ve only put in 80 hours and i m already finding myself limited in a lot of ways because i refuse to get pressured into paying a monthly for a game that i already bought personal storage space is way too low for how jacked the weight system is with a cap of 1200 units the fun weapons like the fat man broadsider and railway rifle are pretty much off the table in the mid game simply because the ammo takes up too much storage weight unless you just don t like to craft or enjoy being low on out of ammo all the time i could actually forgive the microtransactioning though if it wasn t for the doubly aggressive balance system they ve set up all vendors caps stashes are linked with a start at 1400 measly caps when you buy something from them only half of what you paid actually goes into their stash it resets 24 real life hours after your last in game transaction but it creates circumstances that pretty much force you to quit for the day because you can t fast travel or even buy resources for crafting the only way to get rich in the game would be to never buy anything in game or have a consistent real life schedule where you play the game for exactly x amount of hours for the sole purpose of hoarding caps you can argue that people shouldn t be able to get rich easily but it turns into a situation where you re either walking around overencumbered all the time or throwing away hundreds of pounds of perfectly good loot for no other reason than you don t need it right now or pretty much being forced to quit playing for 24 hours just so you can sell some of it off and then wait another 24 hours in order to loot more or you could just never buy anything except the bare necessities and probably be fine i just don t see any point to limiting this aspect of the game like that because there s no real potential for imbalance in the first place it just feels like a lazy way for them to extend the game so that players don t own all the schematics too quickly or something you re pretty much locked to one new good schematic every other day since most of them cost 1500 caps and the most you can make from entrepeneuring in a real life day is 1400 fast travelling costs caps i m not referring to caravans or some other creative way of incorporating this all normal fast travel using the map costs caps except for a few select locations it doesn t make sense except as another way to artificially extend the game by keeping you poor or making you manually walk everywhere also everything is level scaled which would be fine except that the loot seems to cap off at level 50 while the enemies keep getting physically stronger with you meaning your weapons start to do less and less damage to enemies as time goes on and there s really nothing you can do about it except only use heavy mag dumping weapons like the minigun or gatling laser and get power armor and lots of chems because the enemies still do more damage to you as time goes on again i fail to see the point the pvp system is already such that people aren t motivated to grief and the result is that higher level players seem to become exponentially more and more disadvantaged to regular npcs monsters as time goes on monsters keep getting stronger while your damage output stays the same i just don t see how bethesda landed on a lot of these decisions and still sleeps peacefully at night this is probably the worst good game i ve played since gta online what i mean by that is that yes it s still a fun game but there are constant reminders of poor decision making on bethesda s part and at some point i m definitely going to quit playing because of it it ll be long before i complete all the beautiful content they ve provided because the whole thing has turned into a chore with essentially no reward system unless you re willing to shell out another 13 mth on a game that you already bought the good it s a fallout game that you can play with your friends the community is really healthy and most people you meet are pretty darn nice griefing has been almost nonexistent in my experience you ll definitely meet some cool people and the quests are pretty fun for the most part there s a lot to do besides grind but anti grinding measures do put a huge strain on it at times unless you re willing to progress very slowly in terms of getting schematics for building crafting graphics are superb gameplay is very good aside from the issues i ve mentioned weapons aren t directly locked behind the pay wall if you manage your resources and rotate your loadout frequently enough you can still play for a good amount of time without getting stuck at total encumbrance though at some point you re still going to have to dump a bunch of stuff just to get rid of it i d say buy it on sale and play it until you get tired of hitting the pay walls but don t expect to be able to put thousands or even hundreds of hours into this game without feeling the pressure to pay for it and you already did that when you bought it it should be base price or subscription but definitely not both and definitely not both for this game in particular
