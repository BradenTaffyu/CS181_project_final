2019 i luckily bought the base game at a good sale but if you want to get the full game experience you have to buy a ton of dlc packages that some should have been included in the base game and to add to that each dlc is expensive for what you get in return moreover over three years after release the price not only hasn t gone down but it has gone up due to the developers greed while development is pretty much abandoned and there are still bugs and errors that were never solved i would not recommend buying it unless there was an at least 75 discount of both game and expansions
