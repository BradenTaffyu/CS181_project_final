2020 early access review edit nearly a year later and this game is still garbage the devs are still demonic hellspawn who hate everything good in the universe it seems like most of the modding community has already given up on it because there are only a handful of popular mods that are even still active as of today s steam usage stats mb2 stands at roughly 10 of its active user high thankfully the three mods that are necessary to play the game without gouging your eyes out are still alive bannerlord tweaks realistic battle and diplomacy fixes though 2 of the 3 were abandoned by the original modders and then picked up by others with that said i m not holding out hope that this game will ever be worth it there is a dedicated 10 of the fanbase that genuinely wants the game to suck and the devs are listening to them not normal humans they fixed the lack of a training mechanic for your troops by implementing an optional perk you have to choose which gives 2 xp per unit per day which will level a tier 1 naked peasant to a tier 2 basic soldier in eight years game time this game has mmo levels of grind built in because the fanboi legion love to suffer and love it even more when normal people try to play the game and hate their lives don t buy this for the love of humanity do not buy this game this isn t a game it s a meme it s a troll meme and by buying it you automatically fail at life it s too late for me but please don t make my mistake this is not a completed game with planned future features this is not an unfinished early access game with some balance issues and bugs this is an alpha state release of a something that will probably be a good game 2 months or 2 years or 20 years from now don t spend your money unless you re willing to do so as an act of charity think of it like a kickstarter with a buggy demo if all you care about is multiplayer combat then you re in luck it seems like the devs spent 8 years basically polishing that there are still some bugs and engine issues but from what i hear it generally is good and essentially release ready the sp campaign however has obviously not been playtested at all i m not exaggerating there s a bug where any development of personality traits like honor or valor automatically resets your traits from character creation to zero this bug affects every single player but it isn t even on the known issues list there s a design flaw where towns inevitably grow to the point of incredible unsustainability and then starve their garrisons to death within days of a minor interruption in food supply let alone a siege also noble lords are all escape artists who can be reliably expected to escape from dungeon cells within a couple days of capture on the battlefield then return to the fray within 10 minutes of real time at the head of a massive army of 800 half naked peasants wielding farm implements there s a bug i hope to god it s a bug not wai or the devs should be flogged where a training xp bonus that s supposed to be applied per unit actually applies per stack meaning that a stack of 2 soldiers earns the same amount of training per day as a stack of 80 soldiers giving the bizarre incentive to make your armies as non uniform as possible to maximize the number of stacks at any given time the main quest abruptly stalls with a mission to stop the conspiracy which is impossible to complete as it has no objectives but continually hits you with penalties forever because of your failure to stop the conspiracy there is no rewards for following the main quest line only punishments the game makes you suffer more the more you play it and there s really no other way i can put it every aspect of the campaign game is like this literally no playtester could have experienced the game as released and not noticed these issues so either the features designed with little to no forethought were tested piecemeal or not tested at all they re also apparently easy to fix because modders have turned around unofficial patches and fixes and tweaks to all of these issues in a matter of days but the devs aren t patching them because they re apparently focused on critical engine issues to make the combat stop cdting and lagging offline play to 1fps and the saddest thing is that it feels like it s getting worse with each patch i wish i was joking the instinctive reaction of the devs to any problem seems to be to ignore things driving the players insane and instead nerf the hell out of anything that actually helps players out let me give you the perfect example people complained that there s no training mechanic in this game so the only way to level recruits the aforementioned half naked farmers is through combat so even in late game people have to grind xp by farming roving bands of looters because watching 3 5 min battles of peasants vs looters is as boring as watching paint dry players used the autobattle option instead the devs heard this and decided the best way to fix this problem was to f players by nerfing the xp rewards for autobattle and buffing the lethality of looters so that they can kill the s out of your tier 6 units regardless of how lopsided the odds are in your favor if i decide to autobattle 20 looters armed with rocks and pitchforks faced against my army of 100 elite mounted troops i can easily expect 3 6 of my top tier troops to die maybe they died of boredom and the worst part of this game is the forums so chock full of bootlicking fanbois that anyone posting about having trouble with the game or a bug or whatever can expect reams of flame for having the temerity to besmirch their beloved devs maybe they re the ones putting ideas in the heads of devs that the best path forwards is to nerf everything and make the player experience even more miserable honestly they re the real reason i m writing this review there needs to be some karmic balance for the legions of drooling idiots constantly bleating muh early access game not having features implemented is early access not having implemented features working at all is not no the bottom line is you should not buy this game period not even as charity not until the devs actually release a roadmap did i mention they haven t released a roadmap yet that adequately demonstrates their plans to make the game into something other than a steaming pile of s when they demonstrate that they re listening to the hundreds of thousands of fans of the franchise instead of their slavishly simping white knight cash cows
