2023 i ve been playing this game for well over a decade and i was so excited when the de released the graphics enhancement was great i played it a lot and was able to play on extreme difficulty fairly easily unfortunately the recent updates are just so awful the pathing is absolutely terrible trying to get your units through gates is a nightmare when it used to be so easy when you invade an enemy town your units just endlessly chase enemy trade carts which is just stupid whenever you command your trebuchets to attack a castle they unpack and then just sit there and do not attack anything your boats will be getting attacked and instead of attacking back they prioritize killing an enemy house or something every update it seems like there is always a small change that just makes the game worse it s been like this for months and there are more problems that i did not mention i m so bummed because i love this game but it really feels like instead of fighting the enemy you are battling your own units i just played a game on hardest instead of extreme and it was so difficult due to all of the above mentioned problems it was so so frustrating i can t imagine playing this game again until they make necessary changes
