2023 it was really hard to recommend against this game i love stellaris but it suffers immensely from paradox syndrome 50 60 for the most barebones experience the game can be then in order to experience the full game you have o drop an extra 200 minimum for all the dlc that should already be in the game in fact even if you can t use a dlc the ai can i remember a playthrough years ago prior to owning the apocalypse dlc where i was fighting an uphill barely winnable battle with cruisers and battleships against an enemy fleet with a titan and several battleships a titan is capable of destroying a single battleship every hit this is entirely unfair and punishes you for not dropping around 200 extra for content that should be in the game by default
