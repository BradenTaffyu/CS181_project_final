2016 war thunder is a free to play game where you can either take it to the skies in a variety of different airplanes from different nations usa uk ger ussr and japan or you can jump in a rather well modeled and simulated tanks from light tanks to anti air usa uk ger ussr i have quite a lot of hours in to the game and there is a reason for that i have enjoyed this free to play game in the past and i would love to keep playing it but it seems that one of the patches that came out in the last few months or something else has changed the restock and repair fee amounts in the game back when i still played actively you were able to outfit your plane tank and play the game without worrying whether you had enough credits to pay for the restocking of ammo and repairing it after the match regardless of the outcome of the match itself today i noticed while playing with my rank iii german armor that even if i managed to kill 1 or 2 enemy tanks in arcade game and if our team won the match i lost credits when i came back to my hangar i had 96k silver lions credits used to pay for stuff ingame i lost 3 tanks and managed to destroy 2 and our team won the match in the after report i saw that i got slightly over 10k silver lion credits from the match but when i returned to the hangar it showed i had 94 5k left which means that unless you are super awesome at this game and manage to take all the points and destroy half of the enemy team without dying yourself even once you won t be getting much anything out of the arcade matches in terms of credits to buy new tanks this is essentially the same method world of tanks makes you buy premium and use real money at the end tier tanks without one you won t be able to afford the repair costs after the match etc etc etc this pretty much saddens me especially when we aren t even talking about end tier tanks here in war thunder we re talking about rank iii tanks because i have no intention of spending any more real money on this game i suppose i will just have to drop it and stop playing it s already almost impossible to get to is 2 tiger 2 and beyond without using real money and the grind fest from tiger h1 to tiger 2 will literally take you months without premium unless you are willing to spend every waking hour playing the tank portion of the game it was fun war thunder maybe i ll come back when you cut the repair rearm costs between matches and actually give players a change to get to the higher rank tanks without pulling out the old credit card
