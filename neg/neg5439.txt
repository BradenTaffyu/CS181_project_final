2020 wish i could rate this game once for vr and once for desktop in desktop mode this is fantastic there is nothing i can really add that has not already been said in the positive reviews overall great game now let s get to vr and the reason why i am down voting this game quite frankly this game is not playable in vr i play on oculus rift what it looks like the devs basically did was add a second camera for the hmd but they did not add any kind of controller support you can t even set the vr controls in the options menu this makes the game not playable in vr which was a huge disappointment since i really do love this game and was looking forward to what could have been a fantastic vr experience this game should not be advertised as vr so if you are planning to play in desktip mode go for it since this game is a real gem if you want to play in vr don t waste your money
