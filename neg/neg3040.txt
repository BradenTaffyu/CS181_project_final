2016 i wouldn t of believed it unless i experienced it and i did the ac forum i was attacked and called names simply because i was critical or asked questions and reported bugs that made the developers look bad they decided to attack using name calling tactics and the first thing that came to my mind was bell from pcars attacking name calling and banning those who didn t speak positive or were critical of them fanboy favorites would then act like a pack of dogs hunt for and surround their intended victim and attack which was fine and really was holding my own until one of the actual staff members started in started with insults but when i responded back with a rather fresh comeback they banned me so they attack call you inappropriate names but when you defend yourself they ac ban you sounds familiar i really hoped though i heard from others about similar gross behaviors of banning for not being a fanboy but didn t want to beleive it i report good when i see it report bad or problems when i see it hear about them so i am giving a thumbs down this is their official support forum and without it makes it hard to report bugs or get any support if you re banned from that entire site unless of course you make another account with different ip etc which i could do but a pain in the butt i guess what bothers me the most here is these guys are supposed to be and act like professionals and should be able to take a little critism questions without being triggered verbally attacking their customers and not ban them when they respond in kind for the record my response there was no profanity and i was merely in a defensive position with my reply that was clearly in tandem with the insults directed at me i had responses like don t like don t read get out of mom s basement for some fresh air stupid and referred to them using their postion of power acting like bullies as again this was after being attack and called names buy a staff member no less i am not saying my response was perfect but agian it was after being attacked these individuals should be acting in a professional manner and have a higher level of standard applied instead of taking the opportunity to address me privately that the ac staff were taking issues with of my comments or questions they publicly berated me so i responded for that there was no warning i was banned this in my opinion childish and controlling behavior of ac they desperately want to control the narrative and if it s negative then they will attack provoke to you respond then ban you as if giving them some sorta self accepting ok from their indecent acts maybe ac numbers are slipping support or fan base is slipping because of all their problems taking on console and are feeling pressured because the console market is failing i dont know but as a customer the way ac staff handled this matter was totally inappropriate publicly berating rather than private co conversation and banning someone one when they defend themselves to me is just bad business and shouldn t be the norm but the exception to the rule i give them a thumbs down a fail for the dictator stalin type of running of their forum the actual game itself is ok there are issues both pc and console however not able to address them as i am banned i would also add that with competition out their no day night or weather transition is unacceptable litterly no crash damage and the dlc is crazy over priced imho another reason why in was attacked as i said as much on their forum was quickly giving comparison to rocket league lmao by a staff member what a stupid comparison and shows you how far they were reaching for something intelligent to say fail and the most unforgiving of all to come into the console market and have no private servers for their console customers i have this game now unfortunately on two platforms with no official support
