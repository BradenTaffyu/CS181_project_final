2017 early access review good game needs more updates this is every much still in early access sorry but you better wait for the full game in about 15 years at this rate update 4 years later try again in 11 more years not much has changed another update 3 more years late go ahead and wait another 8 years current state of the game the graphics are becoming very outdated poor optimization causing it still to run badly even on good hardware every major update will out date your world making you have to restart arrows of any time will often fly directly through an enemy doing no damage there may be a lot of places to explore but good luck getting anything but the same repeating houses for quests they ve changed a lot in the last 7 years yet constantly redoing things they already worked on making half their updates pointless that includes updates that seemingly add do nothing causing you to have to start over completely conclusion at this point i ve given up hope that this game will ever be anything more than game forever stuck in alpha
