2016 the early game where you are slowly unveiling the galaxy for the first time is enjoyable you re discovering what the game has to offer and thinking ahead about space you want to control who will be your allies and enemies there are problems later in the game unfortunately for example the war system is nonsense when war begins you are restricted to choosing roughly 3 5 planets that you will take from the enemy there is a 100 point cost system for your war plan during the war you can destroy all their armies and land troops onto every one of their worlds but in the end you can only accept the 3 5 planets you declared initially this means that you have to declare war multiple times against an enemy to eliminate them when a war ends you enter a period of peace a long period which you must wait to expire before war can be declared again this is simply tedium because you ve already destroyed their army and scooped valuable planets out of their empire worse if you are in a federation which is how i chose to play then you can only declare war every 40 or 50 years or so which is probably a few hours of play though i have not run a stopwatch on it during the periods you cannot declare war you re twiddling your thumbs hoping the current federation president accidentally declares the war you want or that your enemies declare a war against you though the ai is not likely to declare a war against your superior empire the system is incompetent there are numerous bugbears throughout the game that suggest development ended prematurely for example you re forced to yield control of planets to the ai but this ai neglects your citizen s basic need of happiness giving rise to rebellions what this game calls factions the ui is sometimes obtuse and on occasion wildly misleading you will make several mistakes on this basis for example the game mislead me to colonise planets with the wrong species resulting in them being miserable and rebellious on top of this the game offers poor or no solutions to correct the problem these planets i made mistakes on are likely to be permanently doomed my only out is to become evil and purge kill them but this would be suicide due to the political ramifications i hope they can improve and polish these systems with further iterations of this game patches dlc expansions whatever in the meantime i think you re better off playing a 4x game that is more mature
