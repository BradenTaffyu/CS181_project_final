2023 i wouldn t recommend this game to the worst of my enemy as a new player the only time you will have fun is from tier 1 to 6 this is why you see so many positive reviews for the game 90 of these reviewers have below 100 hours they experiencing the fun part of the game while writing their reviews so called end game is one of the biggest frustration sessions you will experience in any game people say dota and league of legends are bad those people never played world of tanks they don t know what it is to play casino on every shot where game randomizer decides how much damage you rolled what penetration you rolled what shot dispersion dice you rolled that decides if you hit the tank or you killed ground 5 times in a row what its like to get balanced map where your randomized team spawn location decides if you lost game or no before game even started etc as a new player you witness 2 things that will leave scars in your soul for rest of your life 1 2 tier matchmaking this is the most brutal thing of them all when a new player is sitting in a completely stock tank with no upgrades and he is being thrown in a game with 2 tiers higher tanks you drive with your 800 1200hp little tank and suddenly getting hit from half of map for 400 enemy tank got better vision he got better penetration he got better alpha damage he got better accuracy you will witness countless games where you have absolutely no impact because you simply cannot penetrate anyone and if you load gold also known as premium ammunition that cost your half life savings you do wooping 50 100 dmg just wait for a moment when you load premium ammo on a stock tank and aiming at enemy 2 tier tank weak spot you get red marker game design by the gods 2 world of premium tanks premium tanks on the left premium tanks on the right premium tanks everywhere those are tanks that people pay 20 40 euros per tank so they could log in and show their dominance on players that are grinding regular tech tree tanks while on lower levels premium tanks doesn t feel completely broken but starting from tier 8 you will be fighting against premium tanks every single game that you play game doesn t care that you just researched your new tier tank and he has 0 upgrades game doesn t care that you have 75 crew which performance makes less sense than a feminists movement you will be tossed into blood bath from day 1 to be a cannon fodder for all the brave wallet warriors out there this game is not balanced there is nothing balanced about this game starting from matchmaking broken map layouts still cant believe that map like mines is not removed from the game etc flood of broken tanks that takes years for company to admit that ok maybe its a bit too good maybe we should nerf tanks like 279 chieftain after years of gameplay destruction instead as company that cares of our game integrity and future development path we will think of a new well balanced tanks like ebr s bz 176 skoda t56 lefh18b2 after all we are serious gaming company we care about our customers no kappa from the bottom of my heart this game
