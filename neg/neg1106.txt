2016 edited updated 1 21 2023 fo4 is a stellar example of why there needs to be a third option for recommendations steam needs to add a third option for maybe perhaps or kind of as a big time fan of fallout 3 preferring it over fallout new vegas fo nv i feel let down there are so many details of fo4 that appear feel half finished this game is a piece of redneck engineering at its finest this unnerving work of art makes you wonder how it manages to function with its sheer existence being the reason you don t question it bethesda should have focused their efforts on one thing at a time vs branching out into so many areas to be honest i m to blame for buying the game during the hype i was suckered in by the trailers and that is 100 my fault with the hype over the game has caused me to be thoroughly disenchanted with bethesda burned and burned out i ll be wary to trust any major game company bethesda being at the top of the list here is what irritates me about fo4 1 story fallout 3 had a wonderful almost cinematic style story fallout new vegas had a different but equally impressive story fallout 4 s story is butchered the length of the main quest line compounds the issue there s little if any redeeming qualities about it to boil it down i could go through the main quest line in a 3 to 6hr sitting there s so little that makes me want to stop and savor the moment 2 npc response choices as many have pointed out options are way way way too limited it s between yes and no variants any meaningful memorable interactions are few and far between this level of interaction is shameful and disgraceful it should never have happened first yes it s 100 unrealistic to expect 100 something dialogue options per npc in any game other side of the coin players deserve more than just yes no options much like certain recommendation options looks at steam 3 protagonist voicing this is a personal issue i understand this was a choice to move in a new direction it could have been done better or not at all the concept of a silent protagonist coupled with character creation helps immerse the player the voiced protagonist kinda breaks the concept imho 4 settlements i felt excited with the prospect of settlements you build it it s yours to help rebuild the wasteland and you want to defend it in game when things started attacking my settlements there was a good rush of excitement to defend them well that excitement wore off fast the memes don t do the annoyance justice when you hear another settlement needs your help come out of a certain npc s voice hole that phrase became the bane of my existence another issue the destruction feels lackluster if you fail to defend it just results in some crop destruction and a few issues with repairing defenses and fixing the generator to be honest i wanted my resources taken or permanently destroyed or that plot of land destroyed to the point it would be uninhabitable with settlements what seems good in theory does not mean it ll be good in practice also i know the ideas are ambitious but it feels like the task of fixing them was pawned off on players with the release of the creation kit software 5 leveling and perks this thing isn t balanced for crap when you level up get the perks etc things are way to easy even on the hardest settings by the end of the game nothing felt like a challenge i never felt in danger the same thing happened in skyrim for me one big difference between skyrim and fo4 is the fun of adventuring which fo4 is little if any fun in that aspect 6 map areas fo3 s capital wasteland felt awesome and massive in size akin to fo3 fo nv had a large expansive world to explore so where does that leave fo4 it s not good it s not good at all fallout 4 is so small that i m in the firm belief it could have been a 35 piece of dlc add on content bethesda s lack of commitment to a vast expansive world to explore disgusts me things that i liked well it is fallout in some form it gave me something to kill time with in this boring world of ours overall i wouldn t recommend this game if you re a fan of the fallout franchise i m not a true fallout fan since i started with fo3 and went to fo nv but i ll say this game leaves a lot to be desired what irritates me is how fo4 links itself to fo3 and the capital wasteland and i ve yet to see any hint the character might visit even a sliver of that area in a future add on expansion if the game goes on sale for 50 off and you re a curious individual get it otherwise don t buy it i d go with fallout 3 or fonv in terms of exploration and content there are tons of mods for both another bonus is how easy it is to make your own mods if you want to just mess around with stuff rating 4 10
