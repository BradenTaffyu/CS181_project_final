2017 allow me to start with that this game has a lot of potentional however very little is being used the primary reason i downvote this game is because of the ai in a lot of aspects the ai simply falls short for example during an endgame crises the unbidden can be easily bugged out by defeating the surrounding fleets once those are done there is just a 400k fleet chilling in one system for an endgame crisis this one is most easily stopped during a war with an ai the ai repeatedly makes poor decisions for example when fighting a fallen empire you can easily snoop off his most important planets with a mere 25k 35k fleet just send in corvettes that keep going through his other systems once the ai follows a fleet of 1 corvette it won t let him go you can utilise this time to conquer enough planets to force him to cede his primary planets including all the defenses another example when two fallen empires start attack each other due to rivalry chances that they get stuck and don t do anything at all is very high i just had a match where both fallen empires haven multiples of 150k 200k fleets camped their home systems meaning they barely participated in the war and did not help their subjects the losing fallen empire that had a 400k fleet and a 250k fleet didn t even come into action when his war score was 95 this is pretty much frustating the variation given at the beginning of the game have little impact on the game itself for example being charismatic only has any benefit when playing with ai s being xenophile for example also has little effect when playing with players instead of ai s playing with random people is pretty much a no go not only because they do not obey any kind of rules whatsoever but primary because the way the connection is setup if the host loses connection the entire game falls into pieces there s no host migration or anything similiar fleet size is what everything s about and once someone has a larger fleet than you there s very little you can do to put up any kind of resistance say he has 30k and you have 20k the ai s won t always follow your fleet assuming you have defense pacts or so meaning that you re pretty much on your own if you do engage the opponents fleet he may lose 4k 6k fleet size firepower while you lose your entire fleet of 20k aka the best action to take is to run away and let the opponent do what he wants being in a defensive position is a clear disadvantage there s practically no running away when you warp away from your opponent it means that he can warp directly into your fleet if the system you warped to is in range this means that running away is fairly difficult changes that he catches you are always present when you focus on research you are at a clear disadvantage when an empire choses to go to war with you simply because he has more ships having 1 or maybe 2 higher level weaponry only add for an 10 30 increase of damage and you cannot compete with his number of ships because you invested into research therefore investing into research is almost always a bad choice an actual battle is out of your control the battle is completely controlled by some ai this means that you have no control over what happens it s pretty much a guess i was going to mention some good things about this game however i kind of forgot them ow now i remember the modding community there are some good mods out there that try to fix some of the issues above that all being said this is not neccesarily a bad game it s just very unpolished if it d be improved it could be a gem a really good gem
