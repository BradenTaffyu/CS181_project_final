2023 rather than giving less informative info regarding the game such as game or recommend cause classified documents on forums il give you the most basic but in depth enough info on why i don t recommend this game i have over 340 games now under my belt in playing tanks mostly in ab arcade battles and some in rb realistic battle as well as some navy the core gameplay for tanks aircraft is solid but that doesn t mean the rest of the game that ties into that gameplay makes it a good game a mediocre gameplay can still be just as popular if other systems and mechanics in game are fair and rewarding but war thunder does not have this why does it not have this easy the core progression is meant to suck the ever living soul out of you it will test your patience s beyond any other game out there it does absolutely nothing to passively open new players into the game instead just throws you into your first 5 bot matches and after that you re out on your own being matched against players that have over 1k matches fully decked tanks superior map knowledge sometimes blatant cheaters knowing where everyone is at all times even without being scouted map balance team balance is non existent over 60 of the maps i ve played is always 1 sided in terms of objective layout and prime sniping locations there is 50 maps currently and each map can have anywhere from 3 mission layouts some have up to 5 others up to 8 you can also expect to have a semi competent team just about 50 of the time because from my experience and everyone s profiles ive checked that have upwards of 1k matches they re w l is always covering around 50 50 you sometimes might get 8 players that can efficiently coordinate with each other and pay attention to capture points and radio commands map pings but most of the time you will most likely be the only holding a flank getting 8 kills while still waiting for a friendly to assist you or in capturing the point while you hold the flank but instead the vast majority of your team will just yolo suicide over and over and over again with all 3 of their tanks into the same capture point same route and expect to win i have yet to experience any sort of push pull of intense competitive fighting premium whether anyone likes it or not is 100 required or at least is 100 required early game as an investment otherwise youl be spending more and more time trying to grind sl silver lions just to buy the next upgrade or tank in the research tree there is no premium ammo but repairing vehicles and restocking them does cost money which ties into the point above regarding team balance if you re an avid wow world of warships player its best you avoid navel combat in this game its still horrendously bad gaijin release of new content to milk ge golden eagles premium currency only to have it nerfed by the time people manage to grind to unlock the new vehicle absurdly overpriced content every content creator says to always wait for a sale if you really want it but even still 25 up to 40 even on a 50 sale is stupid af for a in game premium vehicle gameplay 8 10balance 4 10monetisation 4 10progression 3 10new player drop off 2 3 weekstl dr save your sanity and dont play the game even tho the game does look cool it wont feel that way when youre constantly grinding just to inch in progress every day then weeks then months only to have the enjoyment ruined by the amount of brain dead af players that are on your team not caring in the world about team objectives
