2020 it s been said before but the ai in this game really is embarrassingly bad to an extent that makes the singleplayer largely pointless as anything more than a sandbox this isn t just the usual ai can t be as smart as a human problem either civilization 6 s ai design is downright lazy having seemingly not been programmed with any of the game s mechanics in mind nor to even consider information that should be readily available to it when building moving conducting diplomacy and so on place cities near resources nope move units to tiles with defense bonuses never consider technology wealth or industrial output before going to war of course not the dlc only makes things worse as the ai clearly hasn t been updated to deal with the new mechanics any more than the old ones expect to see lots of cities founded right next to your own only to become yours 5 turns later thanks to the new loyalty mechanic of course there are mods to fix some of this but developers relying on mods to fix their games is scummy at best and if you needed a more principled reason to avoid this hot mess fireaxis apparently sees nothing wrong with pushing out new eulas that you either have to agree too or else lose access to a game you already paid for honestly stick to civilization ii if you can set up a vm to run it in they won t update it to sell on modern platforms then they d have to actually make something better
