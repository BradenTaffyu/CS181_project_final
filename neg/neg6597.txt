2017 i keep playing this game and really want to like it but i leave it annoyed every time i m sick of hounds the game sends them in at regular intervals a larger number each time they re nothing more than an annoyance that come at inopportune times while you re trying to get other stuff done and if you screw up that s it hours of time down the drain and you get to start over with the same now tedious tasks to survive there are things you can do to survive death but it s still a pain to get right so you don t die again as soon as you respawn i don t see a way to thrive in this game everything you do just comes with new tasks to keep up every day lots of rabbit traps wait until they degrade and disappear lots of farms they ll need seeds and eventually re fertilized everything breaks or spoils quickly each day you survive is just a day closer to more hounds or deerclops trying to kill you or break your stuff i guess the game isn t about learning to thrive it seems to be about surviving long enough to get out one way or another it s just not what i want it to be
