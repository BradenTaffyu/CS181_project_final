2019 this is a hard one to decide between recommending or not ultimately i choose not to but it s a taste thing let s start with the good stuff the foundation is absolutely great i was never a fan of turn based rpgs but this series is an exception its environmental mechanics are a lot of fun and not just a gimmick but perhaps poorly optimized when literally the whole map is on fire the art direction is pretty decent and the ui is fine the music is merely serviceable it s sample based and transparently low budget but the compositions are overall fine with both inspired and uninspired points there is only one bad to this game but for me it s the most important thing in an rpg which is why i ultimately chose to not recommend it the world it can t decide if it wants to be low or high fantasy and the vast expanses of non urban content really grinds my gears i need a city every now and then to feel like i m in a living world there s a village in act 2 which has the best quest content in the game but after that the game drags on through wilderness after wilderness this is the reason i m writing this review in the first place i saw this great game sitting unfinished in my library 2 years after i bought it because i got so fed up with the world i want to play it but then i remember the part of the story i m on and i just lose the willpower great game but hopefully if there s another game in the series they can mix it up and make the world feel as immersive as the foundation allows it to be
