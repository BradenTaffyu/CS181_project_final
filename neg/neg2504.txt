2021 i really really want to recommend frostpunk i ve had this game in my inventory for two years i was amazingly impressed with it back then when scouting was a scarce and dangerous benefit and you never saw past t2 tech before the great storm in the main story and we struggled and some even survived two years later the game still has one major core flaw it s strongly unfair fairness in a game is how well a game gives you all the neccessary information to make critical decisions which then makes you the player accountable for those decisions a player is not accountable for the outcome of a choice that they lack the information required to make a good choice unfair games artificially increase their difficulty and thus encourage replayability though gotcha mechanics mechanics that a player cannot intentional surmount without experiencantial based knowledge in other words until the player experiences the mechanic s outcome they can not understand what it does the law trees are great examples of this you as a player cannot preview the future laws until that law is considered as avaliable for next unlock so unless a player has played previously stumbling through the tree they cannot reasonably know what they are working towards if they removed the artificial difficulty by providing all the critical information to the player i d happily recommend this game
