2022 get this only if it is on sale doesn t worth more than 40 euros there are pros but they are carried over straight from fh4 along with some bugs that they didn t even bother fixing before releasing fh5 regarding cons oh boy brainless ai which isn t even competitive in the highest difficulty even with all the assists disabled there is no game progression since you are starting with 10 cars including some exotic hyper cars without doing anything it s 2022 and yet the taa is considered an experimental feature in a aaa game ghosting is clearly visible visual bugs like flying cars pixelated red smoke in the street races checkpoints ridiculously short draw distance sometimes shadows are all over the place with no consistency half of the wheels sometimes are displayed under the ground etc there are bugs in season missions where you are pretty much stuck progress wise considering how well performance optimized the fh4 was the fh5 doesn t come near that why on earth do i need more than 8gb vram in 1080p with maxed out settings keep in mind that sometimes there is memory leak and you will have to restart the game in order to play with stable fpsthe game is almost 1 year old and devs still haven t resolved any of the above issues
