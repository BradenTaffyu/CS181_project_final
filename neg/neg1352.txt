2021 early access review so warband is probably my all time favorite game and so it is with a pretty heavy heart i write this review ultimately bannerlord has the basis for a good game but not only is the game unfinished and unbalanced it s chopped full of cool features executed so horribly it d be better off without them it s also worth noting part of what prompted me not reccomending is the rate at which patches come out currently they seem to be focusing on fixing crashes which with as much in the game doesn t work and hasn t for years seems kind of ridiculous to focus on below are a list of major issues within the game i ll do my best to remove them if they get fixed siege ai so i ll start with the battlefield ai it s been almost 2 years and we don t have a ai that climbs ladders something necessary to win siege assaults i m not kidding i defended a castle with 400 against over 2000 and won without losing more than 100 soldiers simply because the ai can t climb ladders even worse if you bust the gate your soldiers will actively ignore the breached gate for siege towers ladders they blatantly don t know how to use so 2 years after release sieges are essentially broken unless controlled by the player ya know something absolutely integral to the game siege extended also on the strategic map instead of being a resonable human being building your equipment en masse and sending it up the second a ranged engine is built it engages the castle meaning you will pretty much never have 4 onagers as the offence in fact the only purpose of ranged engines is to either get 1 to assist you in an assault or to spam trebuchets to breach the wall so you can just tell your soldiers to charge and them actually do it competentlystrategic ai the strategic ai is at least workable but actively uses a us vs player mentality which once again sucks the fun out of the game lets start with there s no non aggressions pacts alliances ext which the game desparately needs the ai will actively gang up on the player in 3 vs 1 scenarios and if the player declares war on someone who is already at war they will instantly get peace and both declare war on player if the ai ganging up one you is not bad enough your own lords will attempt to start wars while you are in multiple conflicts as is this is a major problem because is means you either throw away massive amounts of influence to keep peace or let your lords drive your nation into the ground with suicidal diplomacy furthermore if all this wasn t enough what is peace really worth it s not uncommon for factions to declare war less than a week after peace is achieved making the whole tribute system pointless on a side note the ai is absolutely tunnel visioned it will do whatever it takes to achieve whatever petty objective it sets it mind to i had the ai forming multiple 1000 man armies to raid a singular village i ended up killing over 5 000 soldiers before they ultimately raided the village there was a point where i was waiting in it and there were at least a half dozen lords just circling around the village waiting for me to leave this is just 1 small example of how the ai s tunnel vision breaks immersion where it becomes blatantly obvious the ai is more interested in harassing the player than acting like a actual lord mercenaries mercenaries are another should be cool feature that is executed so poorly it ruins the game there are 14 mercenary clans in the game each with 4 lords each meaning 56 lords in total during wars nations can recruit these clans for a sum of money based on performance during the conflict the problem is as a player you must hunt down the mercenary leader and he can t be hired by another nation at that time to recruit them which you almost never have time to do during a war even worse he is on a timer you don t know about and will auto defect to another nation and be unretrievable at that point and usually find his way to working for your opponents rather quickly in contrast the ai auto recruits mercs based on how the war is going and realistically doesn t have to worry about paying them because if you re winning they aren t really getting paid it s so bad before i started genociding them it wouldn t be uncommon for any nation i warred with to have 10 12 merc clans thats 40 merc lords more than i have in total in all honestly the only way to play the game because of this is to capture all of each merc group and execute them which makes you dishonorable and hated by literally everyone but its better than every nation in the game essentially have 40 extra lords to fight you which is what occurs there desparately needs to be a streamlined way to hire lords as the player and limit on the number a faction can hire like 2 bandits simply put as the game goes on bandits become too abundant and the player is the only 1 who will target hideouts meaning eventually they simply respawn faster than you can stomp them out finances so finances are weird in bannerlord you will lose money supporting garrisons for your fiefs but forging a 2h sword is worth like 50k and you can forge more multiple of these in a day meaning being a blacksmith is more lucrative than a lord tournament betting is limited and rarely offers a good item but they are happening is almost every city 24 7 so you have constant access raiding offers very little money which makes it stupid for the ai to be so obssessed with doing it but beating armies offers a trove of loot and gold overall i feel like being a lord should be more rewarding i also don t like that your fiefs auto recruit garrison which you pay for and the game should be less about beating up enemy lords so you can make rent each day which is just nonsensical quests this leads me to my next one that quests are so limited this is largely due to most quests having a requirement that results in notables spamming quests to you for instance if a village is under 200 prosperity it will request tools which results in that village requesting tools like 5 times in a row before their prosperity gets somewhere decent also it results in some fun quests being virtually non existent i have only gotten help raise a noble s son one time in 340 hours i have seen capture enemy lord maybe twice even worse once you are tier 6 most people will say oh this quest is beneath you even though it could be negatively affecting for fief each day it goes unfinished even worse several warband quests such as bounty hunting are just absent game pacing recruitment finally the last reason i can t reccomend bannerlord is the pacing the problem is that notables replenish too quickly combined with the fact the enemy always respawns with 30 soldiers and will escape from any prison in 1 week means that you never really feel like you re making a impact against the enemy yes their 1st wave is always the toughest but after that they never lose the ability to launch 1k army assaults back to back to back it degrades a otherwise interesting combat system to being utterly meaningless it also means that ransoming releasing or holding onto a lord has very little effect with the only noticable decision being to kill them but once again everyone hates your for it
