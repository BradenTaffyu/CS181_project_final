2020 rome 2 dlc paradox tier game like crusader kings 2 or sims i think rome 2 as all dlc expreince is amazing that to be said as a collective blood and gore should already be in the game this been complaint for ages just another way for you spend extra you for more content that was removed or striped from the game vinalla game is pretty moderate but a skeleton for content its great but your locked out of 80 of content honestly there should be gold edition or complete edition empror edition only gives few of the dlc instead they just charge you extra i dont blame anyone for torrenting or pirating this game locked out of too much content dont get me wrong its pretty damn good alot the dlc add alot more and follow the story on graphics and way units act citys looks great and rise of replubic is pretty intresting early rise of rome campaign wrath of sparta pretty cool ancient warfare expreince lack luster limited units hisstorically accurate ceasar and gaul campaign was a blast too but this is all the dlc thats making it better rome 2 was rather undwhelming and world domination on 40 hr campaign with rome was just legion stacks steamrolling against braindead ai would offer me 500 gold for peace every turn its a shame this will never be as good as rome 1 remaster i think in future if they did a complete edition of the game this will be worth playing but it was heavily monetised game unless you torrent all dlc version or willing to spend extra it can be a disapointing expreince alot the dlc is optinal but limited other factions like greek dlc effects what siege engines are available so not getting said greek faction or said pirate faction effects the roster of romans even if you may never play the pirate factions same story with beasts of war even though 2 extra units in your roster of recuirtment for most factions its standalone dlc dont play if you dont want open your wallet for more and more dlc for the limited content that base game is
