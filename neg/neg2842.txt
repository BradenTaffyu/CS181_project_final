2017 sigh lovely visuals lovely story but the underlying mechanics are lacking sort of flat combat and diplomacy suffer from a distinct lack of depth and for a game about managing vast space empires macromangment abilities are all but absent i d like to see this game improved and succeed but i m worried some of these problems are ingrained too deeply in the core of this game this cake looks lovely but it tastes terrible edit for those asking how i could possibly give a negative review to something i ve put so much time into please research sunk cost fallacy the idea that i ve invested time money into this thing therefore it must be worth it is extreamly dangerous backwards logic
