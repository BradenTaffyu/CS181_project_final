2018 some rome ii owners started to notice large number of female generals appearing 5 years after the game has shipped concern to creative assembly they pointed out that this really wasn t that historically accurate for the time period creative assembly then told their fans in response total war games are historically authentic not historically accurate if having female units upsets you that much you can either mod them out or just not play after there were some bannings in the forums threads being locked and an army ca marketing shills chiming in defense feel free to perouse the comments of this review as an example as some of the drama spilled over here all i ask is if you genuinely find this review helpful vote it up in any case ca s quote above really speaks for itself the official response basically tells fans to not play the game which is pretty rich considering these changes were made 5 years after the game released and you can t opt out of them no matter which side of the fence you might be on for the inclusion of female generals i personally don t care this official response to customers cannot be accepted by anyone that cares about the franchise as well as the stupid argument of authentic vs acurate it means if some other problem comes up with total war you do care about you know what ca is going to do about it tell you to just suck it up and there are so many problems with rome ii already i d love like to go over them but instead i m going to spend the rest of this reveiw explaining in more detail what s really going on between ca and it s fanbase and why this official response just cannot be accepted take 100 hard core total war armchair generals named bill if creative assembly finds they can remove naval battles but add flying dragons and loose all 100 gamers named bill but gain 101 dragon fantasy fans named jack well that s a major win in ca s book because they just gained 1 customers overall in the next game bill and jack are both set aside because ca removed naval battles and the dragons but added a general doing wushu kicks that 102 guys named wei love well then again that s a win in ca s book because they just got 1 more customers overall ca nets 2 more customers across 3 total wars but totally blows off all the jacks bills and anyone else that didn t like how the franchise is making a big kowtow to a newer audience at the cost of what they wanted to see in a total war this anology plays itself out in the cosntant streamling dumbing down of total war iteration after iteration in a desperate attempt to make the franchise appeal to wider casual audience at the cost of the needs and desires of the franchise s core fans that want a more complex historical and deeper game like older total wars so in repsonse to this ever mounting frinction comes the most tone deaf official response to date to a group of fans that want a greater level of historical accuracy and it s no wonder the fanbase totally loses my recomendation to you is if you can get rome ii on sale do buy it don t buy the over priced dlc and cut out content just rome ii then immediately install the massive overhaul mod series from the workshop divide et impera one of the best overhaul mods for any total war that signfignatly improves rome ii experience in nearly every way and pushes the game into being much much more historically accurate rome ii plus divide et impera is praticlaly a seperatre game in it s own right a good game you still will find many missing features that were present in shogun ii and previous total wars even with the mod too bad just expect to be disappointed update if you re interested in following the ca quote debacle in more detail here are some other perspectives youtube video total war rome ii gets woke doubles down blames men update views 146 210 total war rome ii is a beloved series by creative assembly has decided totalwar getwokegobroke youtube video views 0 youtube video views 0 is why i suggest divide et impera if you buy rome ii
