2020 i had to stop playing this game because there s so much dlc i couldn t keep up with each dlc was basically pushed with a patch that added in all the dlc s new content and mechanics regular plebs got maybe 25 of the content for free with the patch but the remaining 75 remains locked behind the absurdly priced dlc they do this every few months and now the base game is essentially a demo for the remaining 250 of dlc it s absolutely unforgivable
