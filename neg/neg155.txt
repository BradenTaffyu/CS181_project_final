early access review it s times like this that i wish i could give a neutral review but unfortunately i can t so here we are project zomboid isn t a bad game and i have had a lot of fun playing it however as i play it i ve been running into more and more issues the first and most apparent one is the grind the game has a good amount of skills that you can increase over time several of them being combat related which is nice that you can find a weapon type that suits you and can focus on increasing that however these skills take an incredibly long time to level up and some of these skills even get nerfed xp gains after a certain level which only makes the grind even more brutal you can read books to gain an xp multiplier but this also takes a long time to read and by the time you finish reading your character is hungry thirsty bored and severely depressed this grind is especially bad when you die which is a guarantee and you have to read the books again and start grinding your skills again certain skills require you to dismantle things as the primary source of xp and as you die and start grinding again you have to go further and further from your home to find the relevant items to dismantle the game is also incredibly tedious and you are required to micromanage many stats for your character the one that i had the biggest issue with was weight gain i had noticed i gained the trait underweight as my weight dropped and figuring out how to increase this was a pain in the ass by default the game has a hidden calorie stat which will constantly drop as you play the game until you hit 2200 i was only able to manage it because of a mod that made the calorie bar visible which brings me to my next point mods the default game can be so tedious that it almost forces you into modding the game to deal with the grind i have been playing the game with a group and even with other people to share the burden of this games grind with we use a mod list that is packed full of gameplay tweaks and qol mods to ease that burden and our mod list is constantly growing as more and more of us begin to feel the weight of the grind it feel like a requirement to use them and i can t imagine playing this game without mods lastly the gameplay loop itself feels somewhat shallow it essentially boils down to spawn in a house loot it for supplies kill zombies go to the next house and repeat i wish the game had more long term objectives and general interactions that could occur in the world to break up this loop a bit more the devs are actively working on the next build and while i appreciate that they do very regularly communicate about what is being worked on it has been over a year since even a hotfix was released i am hopeful for the future of the game but with no eta on build 42 the game can feel very stagnant i will keep playing as long as i have a group to play with and i can recommend this game if you do have a group that is interested especially if you are willing to play with mods but as the vanilla game is in its current state or if you re a solo player that doesn t enjoy torture then i suggest you wait and see what future builds looks like
