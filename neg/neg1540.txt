2020 early access review after sinking 40 hours into the game i personally wouldn t recommend it i ll detail why performance game engine the game has been in development for 8 years most of that seemed to be into the game engine to be an improvement over warband currently this is not the case the engine seems to chug quite often leading to crashes over interactions in the game it can t process it appears to have a mind of it s own as to whether it will work or not it s still got a long ways to go regarding optimization for example there is still quite a few hideouts or towns that chug or crash the game entirely the error report sender doesn t even work combat the combat system is semi in place there is a good variety of weapons within the game but regarding that bows are currently useless as the arrows tend to drop after about 15 meters leading to having to aim at a point you can t see the enemies just to even get a shot close to them quite alot of units within the game have skewed stats for example some of the tier 5 units have the same stats as tier 1 units despite the ui saying differently even crossbow men have more bow skill than a bowmen unit of the same tier which makes no sense from a unit choice standpoint one on one combat is fairly pointless if the enemy has a shield as you will do little damage whether they block or not as well as you will most likely not get a hit in as their is little to no leeway when they attack or block your character is insignificant evidence of this is that if you have 100 in stats a peasant will still do more damage to you and more damage than you regardless sieges are currently a disaster the video shown by the devs does not represent what is currently in game warbands sieges are more consistant and that s saying something units will just run into walls or not use equipment if you lead a siege you re best off delegating command as your units will do nothing otherwise skills attributes perks skills attributes currently in the game your skills are capped unless attributes are increased or you invest whats known as focus points in that skill to raise the learning cap increase the xp multiplier for that skill the issue is that even with a 12xp multiplier it doesn t matter the skills regardless of the multiplier increase at a snail s pace the benefits you get from skills even at 250 300 are minute at best or flat out have negative consequences tested with 250 in two handed and the axe still only does around 70 damage to an unarmored peasant there is also hidden stats such as honor calculating valor which seem to not affect anything or be seen currently some skills are pointless such as charm it can only be increased by releasing lords doesn t affect the chance when talking to people leadership only gives morale bonuses even though the perks are about party size steward is about managing settlements but increases party size by far the worst offender is smithing with a stamina bar that barely recovers over time and most of the weapons you can make are pointless as by the time you can it s not as good as something you d have the money to buy perks there is a nice variety of perks but currently it s just a place holder as 95 of them don t work there is a few perks that are exactly the same such as bow horse both have a perk that allows you to use any bow on horseback which makes some perk choices redundant some of the choices seem to have a major impact on the game so if you make the wrong choice you ve made the game significantly harder or locked yourself out of certain units general gameplay clans companions diplomacy main questline as of now creating your own faction is tied to the main questline which is done fairly quickly as opposed to warband s right to rule mechanic comparing to warband you can make your own faction in about 1 tenth of time it took the questline is so bland and mundane it s not at all interesting you talk to 10 nobles which give you history on past events you then collect 2 pieces of a banner once you ve done that you either support a faction or make your own once you have clan tier 3 100 units clans once you begin the game you make your clan this is your faction name you can level it up by increasing your renown it gives you extra party companion size once you re part of or have made it a faction you can gather influence from helping an allied army or by certain policies but most of the tier 5 clans seem to have absurd amounts allowing policies faction changes happen without you having a way to oppose them also most of the time the ruler just goes for what they want regardless of other peoples votes companions gathering companions is the same as warband you go to a tavern and pay them they can do a mission or quest for you the only issue is that they are mostly combat orientated with only one or two being skilled in medicine diplomacy conquering as of now you cannot declare war on any factions the only way around this is to raid a village getting lords to join your faction is taxing and costly some of which want upwards of 500 000 cash or everything you possess there is little to no diplomacy implemented currently within around 300 500 days once faction will have most likely conquered the map this is due to lords constantly going to war without any sort of break they just roam the map gather troops fighting being defeated once defeated they either gather troops and do the same until stopped or they are captured by bandits constantly there is no feasts festivals or the likes in the game so that s all they re programmed to do if you manage to capture a lord put them in your dungeon they re automatically sold within a few days overall opinion my overall opinion on this game is that it s not worth it especially at the price it s selling for it was a desperate cash grab due to the lockdown of the virus the game is mainly a skeleton structure with little implemented or to do other than battle early access or not most early access games have more solid working foundation mechanics or content where you can see what they re focused on next this lacks all of that it s clearly all gone into an engine that is mediocre at best i wouldn t recommend a purchase as even with the patches some are fixes and some are exploit fixes which were the only way to use a mechanic or raise a certain skill most of the positive reviews are fanboys with nostalgia or people who have played around 4 hours you d be best off saving your money unless you re life is going to well and you need some massive disappointment in it
