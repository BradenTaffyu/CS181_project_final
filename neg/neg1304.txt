2021 early access review do not buy this game i bought it over a year ago and watched what was once a promising if not slightly awkward rogue like turn into a confused mess with each successive update the devs constantly water down the challenge without adding anything of value and seem to have no real plan or direction updates often render older saves unplayable furthermore there are many far better rogue likes like nethack angband cataclysm and dungeon crawl stone soup that offer a similar experience while being free if you re looking for something with more polish or that s more of a rogue lite get hades or dead cells if steam would refund my money for this mess i d ask them to do so without hesitation
