2019 as someone who deeply cares for this game i have to say i m incredibly disappointed in the way square enix have treated this release and particulary the pc port it has been 2 years and there has been no support whatsoever for the pc version to make it worse they released a complete package with all dlc called game of the yorha edition but as someone who already owns the game and dlc there is no option to acquire the missing dlc items that come with the latest version
