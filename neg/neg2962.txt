2018 i have the say that since stellaris hit 2 0 i could not have been more dissapointed with the developers the game is now drasticly different from when i bought it and i no longer desire to play the game i did get alot of hours of fun from the game prior to this but i m sure alot of other people might not have either way this is not the game i bought and many other people feel the same way since these changes were implemented long after launch and also changed alot of the core mechanics of the game i m giving this a very negative review this used to be one of my favourite games now it could not be further from the truth a new customer wont have the same problem since they are buying a new game if you are thinking about buying this game make sure to check for information about how the game works after version 2 0 and not before so you know what you are buying
