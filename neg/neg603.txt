2021 i m torn i m trying to like this game but this game wants so badly to not be likeable a lot of game design seems unintuitive and ultimately led to a few encounters where it quickly became apparent that the devs had thought of one very specific solution and just thought everyone else would think of that as well this game also has the illusion of choice in a lot of dialogue but savescumming reveals very similar if not identical dialogue regardless of your choice ala fallout 4 i pushed through act 1 as i was told it gets better but halfway through act 2 the aspects of the game that seemed to bother me seemed to stay there s a lot of promise i can see maybe i m just bad this game does seem made for min maxersmultiplayer is fun but a could get invested but frequent crashes late into act 1 vault of braccus rex took any steam for this game out of me once again
