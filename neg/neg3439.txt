this game was great fun until they released the new economy 2 0 patch with this annoying tile upkeep rubbish you have to play with it on to get achievements otherwise it s disabled if you turn off tile upkeep my city went from making 6m to 22m in a space of an update any existing casual player will now have to rebuild their city or start from scratch learn the game all over again all of this because some pro players complained of no late game challenges not everyone has time to commit to playing a game 24 7 and not everyone understands how a patch changes the game play the devs should allow players to choose between tile upkeep being on or off without affecting achievements
