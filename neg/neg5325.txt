this game is fun only in the sense that you re playing magic the gathering in every other way arena is a pile of flaming that s tolerable at best and downright unplayable at worst and is a perfect testament to the greed of the repulsive ghouls at wizards of the coast this game has one of the most abusive ptw systems i ve ever come across mythic rarity cards which are so often part of the meta game or any card really can now be unlocked by simply putting in the 3 numbers on the back of your moms credit card leaving free to play or casual players locked in an endless slog of grinding for scraps making your own decks with the cards you have is barely an option since the obese grease stains who play this game religiously are willing to shell out their entire net worth to make the exact same meta deck that everyone else is using you can genuinely go into the ranked queue and play for 12 hours and only see the same 3 4 decks with no variation whatsoever even historic brawl which is based on commander a casual format that s supposed to be fun and take the sweat out of magic is infested with netdeckers who don t have an ounce of imagination or independent thought and probably require their mothers to change their soiled underwear for them
