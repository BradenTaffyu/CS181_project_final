2022 okay despite this game being one of the only ways i can relax and unwind it is possibly one of the worst base games i know even with it going f2p its still complete yes ea we know you only care about money but that doesn t mean you give people who paid the original price a pack thats worth 5 quidget your together wouldn t recommend buying any of the dlc at current price wait until a sale
