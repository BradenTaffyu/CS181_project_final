2021 early access review very fun in concept but 1 constant changes to gameplay2 the least optimised game ive ever played i have a 2020 gaming pc that exceeds all the recommended specs yet still have to run this on medium whilst still getting regular frame drops 3 clear abuse of the early access as this game came out almost a 10 years agoi remember playing this for the first time 6 7 years ago night after night and its come a long way since then but until the devs stop reskinning zombies or changing the skill trees and actually optimise this mess you should avoid
