2019 it s overall a good game but unless you have a lot of time and patience on your handy i d stay away from it for several reasons extremely high learning curve after the first 2 3 tiers while the first tiers are easy to master the mid and lategame tiers will hit you like a solid brick wall and the shift in combat dynamics makes some vehicles outright obsolete in most situations in addition the engagements get considerably faster more lethal and complicated as you climb in the ranks leaving almost no room for error especially in the more realistic game modes most battles are decided by only a few hits unless you know what you re doing you ll feel like fast food to the enemy team the brutal mm doesn t help to alleviate that extremely brutal mm the mm in this game is straight up mean and predicatable if you do good you ll get progressively uptiered battles meaning you ll encounter more powerful vehicles whereas if you do bad you ll eventually get tiered back in your original tier this mm makes a lot of battles feel extremely one sided because it s usually one team that get s a better chance due to the presence of more powerful vehicles while this was probably intended to curb good players from racking up in beginner teams it actively punishes beginners that get a few kills by immediately throwing them to the wolves sometimes pitting them against plain unfair compositions if you leave a game because you feel like you have no chance to put up with the enemy team you get a timeout penalty so being food is the only option if you wanna keep playing it doesn t make the game unplayable but expect to get pummeled for a while after 2 3 good matches and switch vehicles around to compensate for that a little toxic community first of all don t ever expect a notion of teamwork in arcade it s literally everybody wanting to be mvp with the most kills regardless of the actual objective beyond that the wt community is one of the most toxic vitriol filled communitys out there there s a ton of realistic sim players that outright discourage new players from getting to know the game mode new players are frequently blamed for just about everything if you re looking for people to play with do it outside the official forums chat hit up a discord or look on plebbit for people to play with that aren t complete jackasses lots and lots of biasno not russian bias bias against certain types of playing playing the objective is usually not the way to go if you wanna earn currency or research it s pumping hits into enemy planes and getting as many steals assists as possible high altitude fighters perform extremely bad simply because there are no engagements at their altitude bombers get completely useless beyond the midgame since everything can pretty much instagib them without much effort arcade is a messsadly it s also the mode that new players will play the most ground battles are spawncamping partys and unless you follow one of usually three very distinct routes you ll just get eventually picked off by something camping it takes a lot of spatial awreness knowledge of the map and borderline savant knowledge of most vehicles to get reliable kills and most nations tanks are unforgiving unless you play them exactly right it s a messy combination of unbalanced vehicles little to no information about how everything works and players generally aiming for kills rather than victory air battlea are somewhat more forgiving but a good player can easily bring you to tears by feeling untouchable some maps are just dull and plain brokennothing much to say here the layout of the maps gives one team a certain advantage in air battles it s usually one team having more better airfield placements or targets in ground battles it s mostly one team having a distinct advantage around their spawn elevation cover or the like leading to one team getting slaughtered you can t do much except be fast food and hope for the occasional kill if you got the bad spawn also as above leaving because you don t wanna lose all your vehicles gives you a penalty timeout nice huh a gaijillion unfixed bugs and unbalanced things everywhere gaijin in it s infinite wisdom keeps expanding the game regularly but a lot of things still need extensive reworking the mm has been utterly broken for years balancing issues from day 1 partially still exist the penetration system rework is extremely clandestine and the economy is deadlining naval is in open beta right now and it s too much of a stalled in dev mess right now to writeanything conclusive about it it can be quite funny but the br is utterly broken atm and the lack of gamemodes makes naval battles rather boring it s either capture or king of the hill that about it unless you have a lot of time and or money on your hands play something else for the time being it s not a bad game per se but it s actual state will really negatively impact your experience right now its 30 frustration 50 monotony and 20 fun premium accounts let you get by a lot easier research and economy wise but they won t let you escape the rest of the troubles
