2023 i play wt on the standalone client there i have an unknowable huge amount of hours i have been playing war thunder since long before there were tanks in the game because i like to switch around nations i do not have a single vehicle above 7 5 br the grind has become slower and slower and slower over the years it s to the point that when they release a new nation i don t bother trying to get anything above about 4 0 because progress literally comes to a halt i have not spent much money on the game in that time somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 mostly on the principal that i view the progress rate as unacceptable but also because the matchmaker is blatantly rigged in a way that tries to make you want to pay more money scummy
