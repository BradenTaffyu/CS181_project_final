2018 the game was disgustingly broken on release back in 2013 i built a pc for this game after being the biggest fan of rome 1 alive i was shocked by the awful gameplay glitches and terrible soundtrack compared to that of the original all of which added up to an awful experience even modding what little bare bones scraps creative assembly gave the community could not fix such a fundamentally broken game dlc after dlc was tossed at us but no apology for the awful sequel now the final blow a complete rewrite of history in a series that while it took liberties for the sake of hollywood style dramatisation was never so horrendous and blatant in its revisionism i should have made a review 5 years ago quite honestly
