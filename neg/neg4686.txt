2021 it s really hard for me to recommend this game i really want to but i can t for me personally it has a lot of good things about it but it has a some downsides that is too severe to be enjoyable i d give it 2 5 stars out of 5 i ll go over the positives first the graphics is a quite decent improval from the previous game there s a good amount of cars in the base game and many of them fairly modern cars with a decent mix between asian european and american cars including some popular tuner classics multiple car parts is now paintable including but not limited to engine blocks brake calipers engine covers and many more the new auction system is wonderful no more having to go through every single car on auction to get to the one you want and also lots more cars on auction every time simply chose the car s you want and start bidding fluids very basic and minor electronics no wiring has been added to the game which is nice but this will also be taken up in the negative list the shopping list is now a lot more useful you can simply open the shop click an item in the shopping list and it will do the search for you some features that was added as dlc in previous games is now part of the core game such as tuning and garage customization wheel and headlight adjustment has been implemented and is a lovely adition to the game all in all there s some great additions and changes to the game compared to previous games but unfortunately not all of them are positive the negatives the minigames a few minigames has been added to the game but instead of being fun they just feel like a chore the repair minigame makes repairing or attempting to repair items take forever each individual item need to be repaired with a minigame which depending on your skill and the state of the item can result in up to 5 rounds if you don t fail at all per item which is not fun when you have an entire car you stripped down to parts and need to repair it the scrapping minigame is basically the same exact game as the repairing except the bonus targets is limited quite a lot i did one car as a fully upgraded 3 star car with every item on it upgraded the amount of scrap needed goes in 5 figures and since you only get between 1 and 3 scrap per item this means that you have to salvage literally thousands of items to fully upgrade a car this is absolutely ridiculous and whoever had the idea to implement this should really reconsider their career in the videogame industry the wheel balancing minigame this was nice the first 10 times after that you realise how much you miss being able to just slap the wheel in the machine and let it spin while you work on the car it s just dumb enough with the minigames on to the other negatives the crates has been revamped now we get the same loot box feel but with 60 less enjoyability it will give you 5 cards and you get to chose 2 the barn find maps has been limited to almost non existent it was part of the charm to be able to go out in these dark musky barns and see what cars you might be able to get speed test track same exact flaw as in cms 18 if you don t have slick tires on your car it s gonna be like driving in soap where s my damn parkinglot i wanna go there not just store my cars in the empty void adding paid dlc literally on release day is really just a big middle finger to the customers this should have been implemented in the game or at least kept it away for the first month or 2 lots of tuning parts missing again developers promised to add them again 5 updates so far not one single tuning item has been added based on cms18 where they also promised to add the items and never did i would expect never seeing the missing items some cars have tire sizes as standard that can t be bought which is kinda irritating cause unrealistic wheel sizes has to be turned on and can easily result in clipping issues the xp rate seem severely nerfed compared to previous titles income from selling flipped cars is a lot lower than previously the fluids is a nice addition but when almost every job that comes in need all fluids replaced and or topped off then it becomes a pain also the system is so basic that it may as well have been left out in conclusion the game does have it s positives but there s just so many negatives
