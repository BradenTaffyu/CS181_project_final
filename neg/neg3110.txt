i love azur lane and really enjoy driving warships in this game but do y all have zero respect for players to sell reskinned tech tree ships for 150 premium ship prices are already absurd but to essentially make a fancy skin and sell it for the same price is really indicative of what wargaming thinks of their playerbase
