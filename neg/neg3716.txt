2023 early access review fun game but do not play without an uninterruptible power supply why oh because the game writes to your savefile with literally every action and makes zero backups the result is that if you lose power at all while playing your entire save is gone completely right now i am pissed because my savefile just vanished in a power outage it s just gone no last time you exited backup no autosave every 20 minutes not one feature needs to be added before such a critical problem is addressed this is base building game with character advancement over dozens of hours losing all of that because i didn t manually back up my saves is the worst feeling and makes me hate a game i love
