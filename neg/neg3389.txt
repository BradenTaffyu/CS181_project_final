2016 if you are going to play this game solo it has a very broken ai right now it does not work and is non competitive it is prone to doing really stupid things i captured all of africa with 4 divisions as an allied player i saw france hold the german advance for 8 months then promptly remove almost all units from the country over a 4 day period i saw japan drive 90 through china and then remove all units to just give it back including their own region to the north i saw the british take half of mainland italy in 1941 then left to go make a new landing in northern belgium i saw the german advance in poland halted for two months as they seemed to have moved all frontline units somewhere else leaving holes through which poland took back some regions as the netherlands i took most germany after they declared war on me but attacked france through the maginot line which was going very slowly the ai will rotate low organization units a very long way back from the front too far so i kept surrounding and killing those units like africa above it has no ability to react to a threat so as long as you go where it is not concentrated you can do whatever as the us i declared war on the axis in early 1941 promptly took all of mainland japan since almost all of its units were still in china i tried tinkering with the available modding parameters that effect the ai but there do not appear to be parameters to change many of these behaviors research is completely unnecessary since the starting units work fine against an enemy that is ignoring you earlier post sadly entirely disappointed with hoi 4 what a mess i have thousands of hours in hoi 1 3 with the bulk of that in hoi 3 i play entirely solo since my schedule and blocks of time are irregular solo play in hoi 4 is a joke the ai is entirely non competitive i have played through as two different majors and have started short games with the others for a comparison ai does not appear to have any unit upgrade plan or worse maybe it does the research but never builds the units ai ground units run in endless circles around the map tying up convoy units in the process allied country units will show up and move through any of the player fronts as single units mostly they stop and sit somewhere for short while then move again sometimes they attack badly paying no attention to what you may be doing they cannot hold any ground playing as the us joined the allies and they very quickly filled up all my airbases in the united states i had uk naval bombers sitting kansas allied air unit deployment was everywhere on the map except where the ground units are actually fighting so as far as i can tell they are useless under ai control never once were my ground units bombed or fighters challenged ground support shows animations of planes but again no indication of the effect or even if there is one fighters are very much the same it appears they kill enemy planes but you have no idea how many or even if they are this also means you have no way understand how many or where they should be deployed for planes it appears your biggest enemy is attrition which seems to destroy a lot you can build deploy and assign bombing missions to strategic bombers but there is no indication that they do anything without feedback how can you every understand the effect based on numbers so 10 or 1000 all the same naval bombers do attack ships from time to time and appear somewhat effective ai navies only sometimes make anything close to a real fleet fighting against japan i frequently faced isolated battleships bc or 2 3 cruisers together none of these had any screens so they easily fall to a well built fleet or a submarine squadron ai aircraft carriers after a while will be empty but still cruising around the army and orders concept seemed like a good idea the only time it has even a remote chance of working correctly is when it has one objective from one army you are forced to use this for any naval beach landing or para drop operation once you have done one of these you have quickly remove all units from the army and create a new army to get rid of any orders otherwise the ai starts doing something stupid it does do a good job of rotating units in and out of the front line although the low organization units sometimes wonder off a long ways and sit way too long the ai can make a beach landing then it plugs in a bunch of units and randomly attacks it may attack left for a while then change its focus to the right it never appears to reinforce this zone except for the wondering units it never has a plan which works in a stalemate sense if the defender is ai the defending ai will counter attack after a successful attack but it is not reinforced and only generally with the units on hand if even it is 1 on 10 otherwise a defending ai does no attacking and shuffles its units around to keep the line somewhat balanced and loses jets are not on the unit upgrade path so you end up build entirely new squadrons bad modern tanks are also not on the upgrade path so there is no flow to use those into existing units you have multiple levels of radar but no idea what they add or when balanced non historical tech tree sucks and should be entirely tossed total lack of unit variation between counties also entirely wrong this is one big keys to making this a enjoyable military period balanced factories and resources suck any long term life out the game since all countries play the same i see no hope of this ever being fixed because right now there is nothing the ai does correctly good thing i still have hoi 3
