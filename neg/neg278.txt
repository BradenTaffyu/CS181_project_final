2023 what a rouge diamond there s potential here but there are also just so many bad ideas the good weapons are fun to shoot heists we have are fun some are reminiscent of heists of the first 2 games voice acting is good new wolf is great though i still miss ulf in the role new drip the heisters got is epicthe bad the leveling system beating a dead horse i know but srsly give us xp just for completing heists weapon customization i miss the days when weapon attachments gave you straight upsides and not one upside and a crap zillion downsides your better off just taking weapons unmodified no pre game chat it s 2023 and there is no pre game text or voice chat i know people are like people mainly just use discord these days whats the point of an in game chat lol there are people out that don t use discord ie console players the soundtrack while not bad it sounds like copyright royalty free music 14 year olds download to use for a stupid and cringy codooty trick shot montage unlocks are way too spaced out between levels customization is lacking all the suits are just re colors of like 4 or 5 outfits c stacks are worthless ui is bland weapon presets apart from old faithful for the car 4 are crap even cs go loot box goblins wouldn t touch the only deploy able that matters is the armor bag sentries are gimmicky and ammo bags and medic bags are pointless since you can get ammo can be found in security rooms and from ammo drops from defeated enemies and you can get a crap ton of first aid kits from trading hostages and picking hostage skills also first aid kits can be on the map already joy just joy why did they bring her back nobody likes her but she s a cool character and has a cool backstory people who say that are too much of a wuss to say she s a gamer girl and she s hot no offline play again beating a dead horse but they need to add an offline mode it would take strain of the servers and we wouldn t need to worry about not being able to play when our internet goes down cause believe it or not some people can t afford or even get a decent internet package conclusion there is potential here but there are some things that need addressed from the leveling system being overhauled weapon attachments need some work and we need an offline mode also need to address the ui give c stacks more importance and giving the game the same level of replay value the first 2 games hadshort version wait like 1 or 2 years for the game to be more complete if the game is still getting support by then cause this game could be the final nail in the coffin that seals overkill s starbreeze s fate and going back to payday 2 again to add more paid dlc won t save them this time
