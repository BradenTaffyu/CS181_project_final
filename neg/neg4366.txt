2017 i am not too sure how i feel about civ vi i ve played this game since i could remember well the series and i absolutely loved it i remember everytime i played every civ game i would literally play an entire game and spend hours at one sitting i also remember how i wished they made some changes because it was like we were just playing a different skin of the same game then civ 6 came out i was so excited i heard the game play was totally different this is the only civ game i have never finished one game true i ve only played 17 hours or so right now but for me 17 hours was 17 hours on one game for the other civ games this game is in dire need of fixing case in point diplomacy a nation will be your best friend on one turn and then declare war on you the next turn at first i thought this was clever espionage but nope i wined and dined nations gave them diamonds i mean showered them with things that would make the other civ games your best friend forever not in this game diplomacy is an utterable sh tstorm i cannot count how many times my declared friends sneaked attacked me and i even tried it on all difficulties and even all different levels of army strengths and government alignments nothing helped diplomacy is truly broken i didn t buy this game in late 2016 just because of this issue when i saw all the thumbs down however i figured they would have patched this by now housing dear god is this irritating they scream for housing your city stalls and yet no matter the districts policy improvements it s never enough you think you ve got a handle on things and 20 turns later your city is screaming at you for more housing you can t add more districts because there is a population threshold and you can t reach that population threshold because you cannot add more districts i do love the challenges on the other things like you simply cannot fill your city with wonders anymore that s realistic the graphics are nice but yeah this game was a complete let down for me
