2022 game breaking bug in the middle of campaign don t buy the expansions after reading threads i ve found problems appear after mandate of heaven this bug has apparently been in the game for at least two years the dev team is moving on to other games so i don t expect any updates for this game absolute garbage come on ca what are you doing with your money get your act together a terribly shameful display i mean my god this product simply doesn t work it s broken don t buy it disgusting and not in a good way shame edit steam recommended i revise my review after playing another 9 hours and since 3k had just crashed i thought it was fitting that i do so if you buy this game i both want to congratulate you and mourn the inevitable loss of your sanity this game is fun but it is sadly irreparably still broken sometimes don t expect any fixes for this game as the developers i believe are hard at work on their next title a follow up to this game rather than repairing the sorry state of this promising addicting exciting yet ultimately disappointing game
