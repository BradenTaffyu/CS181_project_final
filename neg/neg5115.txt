2021 in response to gw s current stance on fanworks the atrocious dlc purchase to unlock the full game practices looking at easily over 300 usd for the true experience the downfall and degeneration of the order of battle in favor of blob or full archer spam armies i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone even people who are fans of warhammer go buy medieval 2 it s a better game it s got better mods and you ll get far more for what you pay for i say this with a heavy heart in regards to two series whom i have loved for years and can no longer support the direction they ve chosen to take both as a company and as games
