2023 product received for free first things first this review should be mixed not because i have a mixed opinion of the game but because i have two completely opposite perspectives on how good or bad the game is background information limbus company is the newest game by project moon expanding the world that was setup with lobotomy corp and library of ruina it s also a gacha game which while relatively f2p friendly is still employing the same predatory tactics gacha games use to get players to spend anywhere from 15 300 limbillion dollarsgameplay overview limbus company s gameplay can be split into three fragments human combat consisting of chaining tokens together to allow auto attacks to happen and waiting for the right moment to activate special resource moves called e g o abnormality combat which consists of watered down runia combat where you drag a token to an enemy to dictate an attack and must decide where best to focus your efforts while choosing opportune moments to use your special e g o moves and a visual novel because telling a story without turning into a momentary visual novel is some form of illegal for most gacha gamesgameplay specifics honestly the gameplay has almost no real substance outside of selecting the right characters with the right attack types to quickly defeat enemies and matching up moves to win clashes and while there are nuances to the combat system like sanity which effects coin flip results or passives skill chains which can provide benefits for meeting certain criterion you re mostly just looking for what says dominating and selecting that and saving your e g o for when you can t find any of those matchesstory overview the story of limbus sets out to expand on the city from ruina you follow dante or in simpler terms manager clockface whom is stuck with his merry band of endlessly reviving sinners as you go from place to place gathering golden macguffins delving into the past of a member of your group along the way well when you re not hosting a cookoff for an evil raging chicken fighting oversized crabs to build a boat or killing factory of gnomes to fight santa but overall you re just on a murderhobo roadtrip to collect magical feathers have fun yes i m being as specifically vauge as possible on purpose here story specifics so far each chapter of the story has zero d in on a specific character an explored their themes and identity further in depth this seems to be the goal for at least the first 13 chapters after the tutorial and genuinely speaking the story is the only reason anyone would be invested in this game long term but that s all i m willing to say on that frontgacha don t just don t you ll thank me latergacha analysis ok the gacha in limbus is surprisingly f2p friendly and while you re still heavily encouraged to spend money as much as possible it s not entirely necessary if you want to experience the game in full as from what i m aware of the base ids are enough to get through the entire story as of right now and the season limited items are capable of being earned through the in game shard shop which can be farmed for free and an excruciatingly low pace furthermore if you miss a season you can opt to wait an additional season ex miss season 1 wait till season 3 miss season 2 wait till season 4 ect ect quality i m sorry i m afraid we don t know what this is in the limbus community ok joke aside this is pm s first gacha game first always online game and first attempt at a majority of these features as such some particularly hard to notice or easy to make beginner mistakes slip through the cracks and by some i mean a majority of them from duplicate mail issues to softlocks there have been a lot of bugs glitches or oversights that have slipped through which depending on who you ask could be the true mark of a pm gameoverall limbus is a game it s only real hook is the story and while yes the story is great the gameplay is highly repetitive and easily causes burnout this is made worse as the game encourages farming mirror dungeons the most tedious in game content to make progress and the gacha system is certainly a gacha system although one that s much better than others you can find in similar games furthermore with the amount of bugs glitches or just general oversights that make it into releases which at this point can t even be excused with rushing to meet a deadline how do you un translate previously translated text the game is lacking some core elements that should keep people playing as such i don t recommend this game to other players i recommend this game to specifically project moon fans if this is your first dive in a pm game you re approaching things in the worst way possible instead go back and play lob corp and ruina or just watch a playthrough as that way you re more likely to get invested in the story and have an actual reason to come back short review summary game is flawed but game is good therefore this review is mixed but overall game is fun
