2016 my first impression of this game was very good it has some very interesting concepts and is a mixture of europa universalis 4 and traditional 4x space strategy games however after playing for 15 hours i now have the feeling that i am playing an unfinished version of europa universalis 4 for example in eu4 you are told by the game why an ally is refusing to go to war with you i e because he has good relations with your enemy or because he currently cannot afford another war because he is still recovering from a previous war in stellaris however you simply are told that your ally is saying no without providing any hint on the reasons why he is doing so i have also encountered several serious bugs in the game i assume that paradox the publisher and developer will continue to develop the game and improve it significantly as it has done with eu4 quite a few of these improvements for eu4 were free however many were very expensive currently if you buy all dlc for eu4 it will cost you over 220 euros which is equivalent to 250 us dollars i m afraid that stellaris will suffer the same fate if paradox improves the game as it has done with eu4 and if it changes its dlc policy to a more reasonable one i will gladly change my rating to a positive one
