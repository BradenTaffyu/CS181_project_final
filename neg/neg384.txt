2021 ok so since fallout 76 is pretty cheap at the moment i caved in and bought the game i m a long time fallout fan but mostly love the originals fallout 1 2 tactics and new vegas the bethesda games are playable just nowhere near those games this combined with the bad reviews is why i never touched fallout 76 i m just a few hours in so perhaps my opinion will change in the future if you have played fallout 4 you know what to expect in fallout 76 aside from the fact that there are a few other players walking around personally i don t care about the online aspect not really looking to team up with random players because i don t really see what s fun about that unless you team up with some good friends in fallout 4 the whole game was pretty much based around building your settlements which should be a fine addition to the game but it should not be the main thing fallout 76 turns it up a notch so basically all you are doing is collect junk all the time to build more stuff for your camp if you choose to collect junk your inventory will be full rather quickly which means you can t run anymore and your actions points deplete fast until now i can t say there are any interesting quests and like other bethesda games are mostly childishly written quests usually are just fetch quests enter a building retrieve or kill something this can be fun for a while until you get bored doing the same thing over and over again i understand this is what most mmo s do but still graphically the game looks pretty awful i m not one to bash graphics but it does seem like fallout 4 looks better than fallout 76 until now i haven t really seen any beautiful surroundings or buildings just plain old rehashed stuff often times buildings load very slowly sometimes even appear a few meters before you i have my settings all the way up so that should not be the problem there are also some lag issues it could take up to 2 seconds for a creature to die after i ve shot it for a lot of people fallout 76 may contain everything they need there s crafting settlement building weapon upgrades shooting quests loot multiplayer a huge map etc but for some reason the game just feels like it s made without a soul i will still play in hopes my opinion will change but i doubt it
