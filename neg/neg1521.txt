2020 early access review the anticipation for this game was huge and what a let down almost a decade in development and this is what they come up with as a diehard fan of m b this game is a disaster never thought i would be writing a negative review for this no new game concepts poor diplomacy and relations sub par graphics for 2020 endless balancing issues tons of bugs empty world completely devoid of worthwhile dialogue companions have all the same stats skills take more than 20 hrs to level up oncei know it is early development but they are still charging 45 for such a low quality game all the features we were excited about are no where to be seen not even in beginning stages they reached for the stars and didn t make it off the launch pad
