really unfortunate to see the developers current stance on this broken and buggy mess of a game from blaming the community to working on paid dlc before fixing fundamental game breaking problems it s clear they have completely given up on their player base in favor of squeezing out every last penny from them the recent patch release statements are out of touch with reality and have solidified the future of this game i feel really bad for any content developer modder or map creator that was counting on this release
