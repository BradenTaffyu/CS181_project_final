2019 early access review edit 2021 review its been 10 years a literal decade build 41 looks good still lacks content looks better but still progress is so incredibly so slow in terms of development i say this because i want this game to reach its full potential and it keeps falling short there isnt much more to say i hope the devs best of luck with there game and i hope they start listening to community feedback and not want modders to fill out fix there game every year i missed major points of my hasty reviewed this probaly the best realism based zombie survival sim out there but probaly just as complete as compareable game like 7dtd if you can look past that there alot fun to be had i want praise the devs for what they have done so far but complain about long stretched development progress for me survive scavenge realism zombies novelty wore off always midgame sooner or later this feels like budget dead rising hacking away at mobs in a zombie themed playground not even tougher difficulties were a challenge once you adjusted to the learning curve new maps did add bit content but 4 hrs content within 6 months they are mods originally fyi that the authors modified 2019 original review 8 years in development guys its great dont get me wrong i like the new update with new clothes and character customisation beffore it felt like a game pre 2008 for a long time janky there fixing it slowly but it still feels no older than 1 2 years old have far the devs have come honestly this wont be a great game for long while i give at least another year or two i suspect longer at the moment its somewhat empty zombie survival sim gameall to often i get a base get food weapons and ammo stashed raided the supermarket police station gun stores i know the map and locations so well but i end up thinking whats next really could benefit with some missions or objectives some people like farming aspect of fortifying downtown with friends creating a community there have been 3 interations of project zombiod pre steam release when graphically looked more pixel art and current variation and 3d modified variation that is build 41 game feels like it could be so much more but devs work at snail pace i want it to be so much more late 2021 dec notes build 41 iwbums beta came out october 16th 2019 that was last update before the beta mutliplayer update of december the 16th that gives you idea how often the game is updated ask yourself this why does it take 2 years and 3 months to implement multiplayer after a decade of development frustrating slow development period i am fully convinced this nothing more than side prokject they work on when they want to but is passive income
