2019 kinda recommend depends on what you want and what business practices you want to support an extreme amount of shallow content have put nearly 200 hours in one playthrough i play these sorts of game for freeform exploring and kleptomania hoarding like all bethesda rpgs fallout 4 does the latter fine the former is well fallout 4 is the best in it s class over the past few years doesn t mean its great but is good also like other bethesda games lately most of the quests are crap a few are really good showing they have the talent to do a better job and simply chose not to for whatever reason really highlights the attitude which i will come back to making settlements is nice as is power armor that s actually really fun i usually play the sneaky type but the power armor in this game feels more like a forklift a small powerful vehicle you get in and can customize pretty fun now that attitude this game felt by the numbers how to make as much money as possible while fulfilling basic expectations not art not a profitable passion project not skyrim certainly it felt like it was made by people working for a faceless corporation trying to get through their mandatory hours to go home and do whatever they really want other games bethesda makes do not always have this gross feeling to it an amplification effect happens due to the obvious absence of the steam workshop and the presence of bethesda s paid version it s disgusting intentional manipulation obfuscation and the immoral milking of a part of gaming which has made bethesda the giant it now is you don t need to read yet another rant on that i ll leave the review with that
