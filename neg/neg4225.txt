2018 unless you re prepared to spend over 100 for the base game plus dlc don t bother picking it up multiplayer is fractured between the haves and the have nots your immersion will be broken by in game links to store pages to purchase dlc before you re able to pilot a vehicle sitting right in front of you really frustrating especially for someone who backed this game in early access the way bohemia have handled both the dlc in arma 3 and the mess that is dayz standalone have left me with regret i will not be supporting this company at all in the future
