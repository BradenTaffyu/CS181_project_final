2022 i love the game but the devs have been cocky lately they release overpriced dlc at a sims like pace and censor people discussing that while a lot of people will defend them no matter what to the later i say this it s fine to love the game and to be critical of something you can do both i do you don t have to defend a company never if you defend them they don t have to justify anything and can get away with anti consummer behaviour to ludeon i say this i backed your game on kickstarter loved it liked the previous dlcs even though i thought they were already overpriced for what they added i was okay with paying for them because i enjoyed rimworld for a long time before it s not the case anymore i won t be paying a 25 yearly fee to play a working game because you draw inspiration from some mods and the competition causes the mod authors to stop updating their mod so your paid dlc is the only way to enjoy these gameplay additions i m also 100 against censorship of any kind and i find it disgusting that you would do that and think nobody would notice don t become yet another trash company
