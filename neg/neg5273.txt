i am making my review after 672 hours played unfortunately as excited as i am for this game but i find that it still lacks majorly in the area of functionality a lot of features don t operate smoothly troops don t respond to orders archers won t fire when the should troops stop following their orders when they don t feel like following them anymore pathfinding is a major issue in battles deploying stances is horrible and needs to be reworked etc on the campaign map bonuses for example don t always apply and don t always work some bonuses which should not apply to my faction are randomly applied there are also many features that could facilitate game play and control better but they haven t been thought of although some of them were in previous titles in short this game needs a lot of work in order to feel complete in its current state it feels like more of a beta
