this game is fantastic well as long as you don t play past chapter iii that s when the game crippling bugs start broken context interactions dialogue choices from characters that have been killed and shouldn t be there broken cutscenes that prevent progress from occurring sudden fps drops that slows a 10 minute combat encounter to a 40 minute slog it was actually probably more like an hour but i m trying to be generous i could go on but you get the idea the first three chapters also have their own share of bugs but nothing on the scale of chapter iv they re so bad it s completely killed my interest in continuing my journey in the game hell there was a dialogue bug that i m pretty sure was a page or two worth of text missing because a choice i made that had an outcome that i did not expect nor was it even hinted at what the consequences may be it s pretty clear that this game needed a lot more time to cook it s impossible for me to recommend this game in its current state as much as i want to sing the praises of this game i cannot do so knowing your gameplay experience will suck a lot until the bugs are fixed
