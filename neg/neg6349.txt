i would have recommended this game a while ago but recently it just keeps crashing i upgraded my computer and since then its just randomly been crashing i turned down the graphics turned off the ray settings i shouldnt have to though this should run on ultra with all the settings i looked around and it looks like the devs are saying its the computers but it seems to be the game
