2023 ps time has passed and things changed so i adjusted my steam review original review is below new review still not a good game limbus tells the player that its a very complex game with hard learning curve and yet i have defeated dozen of daily mirror dungeons short roguelike mode without reading any of my abilities only using auto battle and never once using ego skills so why do i have to spend half an hour every day in order to get daily reward if i play the game on autopilot same for daily bosses they are not difficult you just have to alt tab to click auto fight every turn for a while or you can click skip battle and get 50 of the reward instead previously special events were even more grindy view old review i have not played this game for a while and do not know if this changed or not other project moon games were experimental and doing things noone else dared limbus is wasting players time like a grindy mmo from early 2000s the art is great music slaps the story is amazing and the characters are neat unfortunately i cannot bear to actually play this game for what its worth this could be easily fixed let us skip the daily grind dont make us do mirror dungeon every day to get the real in game currency let us play this gamemode when we feel like it instead of giving us fomo for missing daily rewards make events that are fun to play not nightmare to grind put the difficulty where it matters original review im a casual so my team consists of nice characters not minmaxed spreadsheet it takes me on average 19 minutes to clear dungeon of new event i am casual and cannot beat the hardest most efficient difficulty of dungeon i have to beat the suboptimal dungeon 240x in order to get all the event rewards that is 76 hours for two week event with me staring at screen not alt tabbing every 3 minutes other gacha games are noob friendly you get the rewards by having fun and you can choose to challenge yourself this game expects you to become pro even if you just want to have fun even the generosity of devs is not worth me clocking more hours in this game than in my actual job
