2013 if you ve ever enjoyed a total war game this title isn t for you it s garbage released as beyond garbage and now that it s almost playable though not in a single player campaign which is infact the primary point of the game they ve tried to con you with a 50 off sticker the launch bugs are everywhere just do a google while they glossed over a few of the glaring flaws they forgot to entirely redo the campaign mechanics to even a standard of any of the last games perhaps they were looking to introduce groundbreaking new alternative mechanics nope just stripped it down and sold it under the tag line more money than we ve ever thrown at a total war title playing small tactical skirmish battles with friends is an option not the ai as even 6 months after release it still just runs into a river and dances in circles but will only entertain you for as long as throwing a ball against a wall day 0 dlc that chopped out one of the top 3 nations while they pretend it s utilising the art devs which actually just boils down to bad time management where the art devs should have been working on cloneable mechanic units such as they were but pretending it was a different project during the closing phases and dealing with balance parses as they needed to under the waving day 0 dlc badge it s worth noting a few of the mods may save the single player experience for some players but i can t agree fjust yet given their current state of development
