2023 this game is just a very good repeat of all the other forza games 90 same cars same short boring stories no offense lol and above average graphics i liked forza horizon 4 alot as the seasons where so beautiful and the online experience racing on the highway or meeting friends was way easier alot of people would disagree with me on this but i wish forza horizon 5 had a smaller map its harder to meet players on the open world experience than previous games and the online mini games are the same they promised more customization with cars but i didn t see a difference from fh4 for the most part in that category but the cars do sound better like way better you know im a big fan of realism and to be honest i really don t enjoy the map the developers did a awesome job of highlighting the forest and desert areas offroad but the city and street life in nonexistent in forza horizon 4 there was more variety you could fit in perfectly with a lambo in a upper class area of the city or drive a old beater in a rural road now its like im driving a 2 million dollar lambo through little village dirt roads to go to my little beach loft lmao like doesnt feel realistic the developers only focused on the off road aspect of the game taking 80 of the map with mostly rural roads then leave a little village for the streetlife and street races if your a big fan of offroading and offroad races then you would probably like this but if your like me and like some need for speed action or some nice city to rip up in a lambo then this game isnt for you theres alot of politics in this game too people getting banned for livery or the wrong stickers on their car but cheaters not getting banned the developers are slow to addressing issues with online cheating but quick to ban anyone using hate speech and doing grey area petty things i dont really care about these issues personally but these issues seem to be getting worse with each game get this game on a sale and try it out or theres always forza horizon 4
