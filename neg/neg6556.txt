2020 i actually very much enjoy this game and wish for many others to play it even now the only reason i give it a thumbs down is because from software neglects the pc players tremendously there s hackers still in pvp that not only can use normal cheats but crash your game through animation spamming that overloads your framerate and even worse than that they can put items that are bannable into your inventory such as 20 storm rulers no weapon goes beyond 10 so when you log in the game detects unusual data and automatically bans you from being able to play from software has nothing to combat this and will take quite a while to unban you assuming you even have proof aside from that pvp in this game while fun is kinda past its prime everyone s been playing this game for years already the community agreed level cap of 120 goes overrated because people will new game plus and setup areas that are invaded frequently to become these fight clubs it gets really annoying being an aldritch faithful covenant member wanting to pvp when someone s in the territory only to find out they cleared every mob and have 3 friends with them that were pre summoned level 900 s just looking for an easy gank it kinda exploits the system and makes any genuine fun you d get out of intentional designs a bit hit and miss i love invading and being invaded but the system is very easily exploitable and not well designed the story won t make sense at all even if you ve played the other 2 dark souls since every npc s dialogue is cryptic and written with assumed context of you knowing what s even happening you will spend mountains of time googling everything from story to content you missed because it s very poorly explained which is a good thing and bad thing imo it creates a more genuine rpg feel but neglects the player s ability to understand or displays rather bad conveyance how are you supposed to know its your responsibility to do even half the things the npc s say when half of them are just rambling about what you should do but are not actually capable of right it s still a really fun game and i ll still be playing it but from software needs to take this down vote and realize they need to add anti cheat software when it comes to pc games not only that but the balance in this game is very questionable as the meta ruins a lot of pvp encounters you may have and even some of the pve something to add the playerbase is mostly toxic and meme based every name you come across is a meme no one plays this game like an actual rpg they just read it like a math exam and name themselves one of the following bruh dude something racist word praise the insert meme here dddddddddd 12345678 cosplay as anime or character in game i m not much against the last one but damn after a while this just gives you an actual headache when you realize everyone treats this game like it s made specifically for memes i miss when rpg s actually enveloped players and they were immersed in the environment they were in over being able to wave their shield button 90 times and throw dung to imply ur bad
