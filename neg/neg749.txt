2017 to start i must say that i am a long time fan of the bethesda series fallout and tes especially fallout i would say that despite it s faults falllout 4 is worth the money when it is on sale i do enjoy survival mode but i will not recommend it because i highly disapprove of the direction the devs took when designing this game first some good stuff it s a fallout game has all the usual merits detailed world good base concept had the modern fps elements lacking in fallouts 3 and new vegas smooth ads sprinting etc was still missing some things though e g weapon wheel quicklootnow what i disliked the storyline was in my opinion just awful as it had zero interesting plot points and or twists no good chracters and as per usual in fallout apart from new vegas you pretty much constantly do what others tell you no breaking free from that my greatest dissapointment with this game was that fallout new vegas introduced intensity into the wasteland to elaborate the mojave was one of the first game worlds where i felt genuinely unsure and somewhat afraid of what was around each corner no mention of dark souls here when it told you not to go to an area with deathclaws it would kill you if you disobeyed it fallout 4 hands you power armour and a minigun to kill one in the first 20 minutes that does not send the right message you could literally own the wasteland by the end of the game with the escelating legendaries and modifications i found myself so overpowered very quickly and after reaching about level 45 almost nothing could kill me new vegas saw someone in a genuinely brutal position courier 6 claw his was to the top the way the player wants to and still there are threats at high levels i believe that the wasteland should push the player around especially in the story it should be a harsh environment that creates an emotional journey for the player good gameplay will arise from this as the player would constantly find themselve in difficult but interesting situations a thourough dissapointment even so long after release with the introduction of the dlcs
