2020 ok so i might have over 400 hours in this game but its not due to the merit of the game itself if you re looking for a game with an amazing modding community that can fix all the issues bethesda out and called a game this is it if you want to buy it as a fallout game and play it as is don t waste your time or money most of those 400 hours were spent modding and building houses because sometimes the minecraft like urge to built bases is overwhelming
