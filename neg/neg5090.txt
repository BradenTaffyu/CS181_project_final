2016 overall just meh they know they have a loyal fanbase that they can milk i was fine paying the 60 up front for the game with 4 playable race plus the chaos dlc included then i played the game and the replay valuse really isn t there they can t make a make with random spawn points really thats all it needs then they want to charge me 3 to put blood in the game so they can make this game t instead of m that should be an optional free dlc then they want to charge me 19 for 1 race sorry i refuse to pay 33 of the intial cost to play another race on the same old map this is why people pirate things i understand it cost money to continuelly devolp a game but come on i am now up to 81 for a game that is 1 4 complete do yourselfa favor and don t get trapped in this money pit
