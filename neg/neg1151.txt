2019 a decent shooter but ultimately fails as a fallout game a lot of rpg elements from the previous games are dumbed down or removed completely like the karma system and new mechanics are introduced that are downright awful like the settlement building which you are forced to do in a point in the main part of the quest whether you want to or not if you are new to series or can pick it up for cheap then get it otherwise stay away
