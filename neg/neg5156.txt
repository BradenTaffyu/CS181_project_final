total war warhammer is a rts that i probably don t even have to explain to you because of how popular this series is but i will anyway essentially you get real time combat mixed with turn based army and city management on a map this is a very long running series that s very popular and very well liked with the exception of total war rome 2 total war warhammer is certainly something a lot of work went into but is it worth the 60 they re asking of you the gameplay is just as any other total war is let s start with the battles in the battles you micromanage up to like 40 different units which is not the easiest task and try to use terrain unit type and attack direction to gain the advantage and defeat your enemies total war warhammer changed how this works a bit though it opted for a simpler version of the combat with a lot less strategy and a lot more rock paper scissors for the first time in a total war game you can win with sheer numbers alone and any attempts at strategy are basically nonexistent because they re not necessary that makes this game much easier to play and more accessible to a casual audience but it also kind of ruins the fun that battles used to give sieges don t work anything like they used to now if you attack a town you fight outside of it unless some sort of defense building gets set up and when a defense is set up then you just fight auto firing turret towers and break through the walls to actually fight the enemy army inside all the tactics of defending the walls and fighting for them and defending certain parts of your city no longer really exist every single aspect of the gameplay has been simplified and after you get your fill of it you ll find the auto resolve button becomes your best friend the second part of the gameplay and where most of your time will be spent will be on the world map here you get to do a lot of things you can manage your cities and towns which in this game are linked to an extent you need to control a city to effectively control a region which is made up of a city and some smaller towns cities can get more and better upgrade whereas towns are more limited and need to be specialized to fulfilling a certain role it s decent customization it s about the same as any other total war game which i suppose is a good thing seeing as this is something that did not entirely get simplified there are of course certain buildings linked to regions and resources and acquiring resources also plays a big part in the game they did expand how movement in the world map works a little by adding things like the ability to travel underground for the dwarves it doesn t actually show you the underground unless you get into a battle while in the travel underground mode but it does add some well needed variance to the turns of the game that i don t recall being in any of the older ones that i have played the reason you will spend so much time on this mode however is because of how often you re going to end up relying on auto resolve if you even have a slight advantage it seems to resolve more in your favor than actually fighting the battle would do the only reason to actually fight a battle is if it s exactly even or you have a slight disadvantage the game plays out very differently then the diplomacy in this game is interesting it s as nonsensical as it has ever been in a total war game random offers come in all the time factions don t do things you d expect them to do for example someone far away from you will declare war even if they can t reach you they ll also then immediately surrender and give you gold to make peace with them don t rely on diplomacy with any ai that are not the same race as you there are modifiers that make it to that essentially for the most part only your own race will like you almost every other race will naturally be your enemy or occasionally be neutral it means diplomacy doesn t really play as big of a part in this game is that a good thing well i personally don t like that but it admittedly fit in with the warhammer theme so i can t really fault this system for not being diplomatically friendly but let me tell you i never thought i d see vampires start 3 wars with me and pay to close all of them when we could never reach each other that was quite the experience every faction or at least almost every faction has something unique about it too that helps diversify the gameplay and make playing every faction a different experience for example dwarves get the great book of grudges where whenever someone wrongs you you have to get revenge success will result in a reward but leaving it up there will result in a penalty for as long as you don t do it and it will never go away until the grudge is settled vampires and chaos can corrupt the lands around them and give themselves bonuses and everyone else penalties pretty much every playable faction has some unique feature which i find really important and am glad they added as it certainly wasn t in the last few total wars i played and of course you have options you can play the world campaign i ve spoken about so much or you can play skirmish battles or even multiplayer the campaign has coop mode as well though including someone in there usually results in a lot of auto resolving or sharing your own troops unless you constantly move your own armies around together that can kind of defeat the purpose at some point but there s no other logical way they could implement coop that i can think of due to how the game modes work this game s campaign mode does however get hurt from what i call a bit of a total war syndrome the turns as you go on get longer and longer and longer looking over some of my gameplay videos i see that i only got in one actual battle within an hour and a half and only several turns actually went by now that s not to say it s bad that they give you so much to do but it really makes the mid to late game start to get extremely boring the more cities you get the more you have to manage every turn the more armies you get the more you have to move and recruit for and use in battles every turn and this game has a huge map which i like but it makes the monotonous gameplay of the world map stretch out so long that you ll start manually doing every single battle even ones you re better off auto resolving just because you ll barely ever get any in comparison to how much time you spend on the world map it becomes so boring and when played cooperatively that problem doubles the production of the game goes like this the voice acting is fantastic while there s no story to speak of simply the sounds of your troops charging and yelling in battle are just amazing to listen to and add the gritty feeling to the audio that any real warhammer game needs the graphics aren t the best but they ll age well as they picked a more cartoony look to the game than striving for any realistic feeling they re certainly nice to look at but that s only if you can run them the optimization isn t very good while my pc can chug out 60 frames per second and it s nearly top of the line most other pcs won t have any luck text review between here and the final rating is cut out due to space limitations so i give total war warhammer a 6 10 it was certainly above average and it was fun for a while but i got nowhere close to finishing one of the three campaigns i started not even on a short victory and when the battles themselves are so simplistic then what fun can really be found in different scenarios of those i m going to have to say you should avoid buying this or at least wait for an extreme sale like 75 off at least you re not getting enough fun given how much money they want for the game it s not a bad game but it s not as good as any other total war game that has defined the franchise
