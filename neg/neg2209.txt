2016 the russian bias is real in this game so unless you intend to play anyone but russian planes or tanks expect allot of frustration when they seem to be the only ones that they want to be allowed to 1 hit people when they spend so much time talking about increasing the battle duration and nerfing down anyone elses ammo that comes close to the lethal destructive potential of non historical russian aphe if only it weren t so much better than world of tanks so much more realistic other than when gaijin arbitrarily swings the nerf bat at something like british apds turning it into a needle gun where you virtually have to kill every individual crew member whats that high tier british tanks only get apds other than their hesh rounds its ok top tier russians still using non historically performing aphe rounds and killing people just fine lolololol planes can be just as bad just wait until your running into the hordes of yak 9 s often put up against planes that where historically flying 3 years before them with a flight model thats an absolute joke and seemingly made from bullet proof stalinium
