2017 4 years down the road 40 dollars for 40 of the content you should get and the other 60 is over priced dlc that is mostly overpowered also yes you get 40 frames most of the time with a heavy build pc you spend a good amount of time tweaking the game for performance outside of settings and in files and all that horse crap for what you hope 10 more frames in a city fight one of the worst engines around and just plan awful for the normal gaming consumer but you get past all of that it becomes a super fun game i wont lie i enjoy it but i can not walk around and talk this game up it s still so poorly optimized even for a beast of a machine that s overclocked i will say though and again if you get past that and you get into all the beautiful mods made by the community and you get friends it s terrific your choice but its a gamble still way to expensive for being 3 years old edit in response to comments making a good point my system windows 10 64 bitgtx 1070 strix oc from factory i am running this even harder as well boosted memory speed and clock i7 6700k oc to 4 5 ghz from 4 016 gb of evga 3600 mhz ddr4arma is also installed on my 1tb m2 sata drive with windows and is 400 gbs from full z170 g1 gaming 7 motherboard i don t consider my build that amazing but i do not think once to myself it s underpowered for a game in 2013 with graphics that are not shocking to the point of melting in my seat i have no heat problems in anyway or do i encounter any other weirdness with other games that have recently launched and even old ones again please dont read this review and think i hate this game i m saying this game is not for your average normie i would never tell someone you d enjoy this and it would be easy to pick up it s just a bad engine with to much maintenance from times my frame rates range from 30 85 depending on location players and just as of whats going on cities seem to be a major toll in single player or local hosted stuff i would say the top frame rate will maybe go to 90 but not often but the bottom frame rate will on a good day be up to 50 or 40 i hope this helped out
