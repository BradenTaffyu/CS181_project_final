2018 the current update for stellaris version 2 2 le guin transforms the game from a slightly rough around the edges but very playable space 4x grand strategy game into an unintuitive mess that conceals the removal of everything that made the game fun and full of sci fi flavour 2 2 was supposed to remove the tile system of managing planets fix sectors segments of your empire handed off to little ai managers and introduce the galactic economy a major overhaul the aim of all this as i understood was to reduce the amount of micromanaging the game required of the player instead what happened micromanaging increased but made more opaque tile system retained called something else shuffled off to another sub screen and handed off to an even worse ai distinction between species no longer matter all those fun modifiers to your little aliens unimportant robots droids synths completely broken as they didn t work with the new economic system you wanna play a robot empire too bad new immigration system combined with new pop growth system ignores sensible planetary preferences hope you like that one random tomb world pop you rescued now taking up every growth slot you have for the next 200 years of game time new economic system introduces a series of bottlenecks which discourage limit the ability to tech up or otherwise specialize toward particular goals playstyles flattening playstyles to pretty much all end up the same long story short game isn t fun anymore it ll be fun for the first 5 6 hours while you learn all the systems and how they fit together and try to exploit them but then you realise it s all very poorly planned seriously they kept tiles in hid them and took them outside direct player control who are you kidding paradox edit update at the urging of other fans of the game i put a few more hours into 2 2 to see if anything could be salvaged from this mess and more playtime has only revealed the depth of the issues micromanagement really is a nightmare now it s 100 possible to understand the new economy and get it humming along but it requires you pause every couple of minutes to check resource flows and move pops around and double check that if you build something it won t tank production etc as a player you re going to spend much less time on the galaxy map and much more time clicking buttons in tiny little boxes this gets worse and worse as the game goes on especially if you re playing wide because planets are never done they re always going to require micro of increasing complexity once you get into needing to replace buildings and such the new ui is awful who designed this an ant there s already better ui mods up on steam massive negative penalties for mistakes if you build the wrong thing at the wrong moment move a pop at the wrong moment or adjust a value at the wrong moment it can destroy your economy changes are also harder impossible to reverse this might be a stylistic choice i guess opaque income output info prior to 2 2 if you made a change then it would be reflected instantly in energy minerals food income on the readout at the top of the screen so you could easily see what effects your changes will have in 2 2 these values don t update until after the end of month resource tick making it very difficult to trace which changes are having which effects and making it easier to break your economy via unforeseen interactions no middle game because of the heavy micro and alloys as bottleneck for shipbuilding there s no longer any pivot to galactic scale warfare in the mid game fleets are much smaller and difficult to build and perhaps this could be a good thing if the rest of the game was balanced differently but if you manage to get a good war rolling it s just an irritation because you still gotta pause every minute to go make sure your economy isn t going to implode the ai still can t play the game modders had managed to get the ai in 2 1 into a state where it could finally offer real challenge but the 2 2 ai seems bamboozled by the economy from not building stuff to building only police stations to selling all their alloys on the market dozens of awful little ui oversights which add to frustration too many to list a linear increase economy which never really allows serious resource surplus is boring it s boring in a 4x and it s boring in grand strategy 2 2 is boring edit april 2022 came back to the game with a serious desire to try to enjoy it as i ve seen so many people doing so and i so desperately crave a good space grand strategy nope stellaris is still trash and i will never forgive paradox for ruining what could have been as of the most recent patch i think it s 3 3 everything bad about the game since the 2 2 patch has only gotten worse it s a mess of micromanagement mostly concerned with playing constant economic whack a mole rather than the actual fun things about a science fiction setting paradox have decided to lean into the audience who play this for the spreadsheet simulation and great i m glad they re enjoying it but stellaris is not what it claims to be
