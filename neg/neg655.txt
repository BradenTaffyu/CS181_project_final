2022 i still intend to play some more and may update this if feelings change due to either updates or more experience but i want to get my initial thoughts down because i d ve definitely appreciated such a warning from someone else the things i expected to love the squad system i did but almost everything else managed to disappoint if you have a 1440 or 4k monitor please consider this the game is basically only available in 720p everything is clunky upscales that look jagged and all around awful someone on the discord was kind enough to offer me a way to make it look only sorta bad via a third party download and messing around with a ini i appreciate that i could at least play the game without my eyes bleeding but i consider needing to take such a measure to be completely unacceptable with a full release in 2022 and would pretty much negatively recommend for that alone that said it s far from my only issue with the game the ui is not good doubly so if you re using mouse and keyboard which many grid based tactical rpg have ranged from fantastic accomodation of disgaea to pretty decent at least of fell seal this is not that no tooltips extremely hard to parse buttons in some submenues lots of unnecessary extra clicks and un clicks and re clicks to get around menues you ll spend a chunk longer buried in troop micromangement than you d ever need to just because of a lack of a myriad of possible conveniences and shortcuts the visuals are weak setting aside the absolutely awful art quality due to upscaling a game that s entirely function at a resolution a lot of people s phones have improved past units just look fine the art style isn t super distinct your hero characters don t even get a unique color pallette seriously the first healer lady you get has vivid red hair in the portrait and her model is just a soft blonde the game isn t a few weeks of tweaks underbaked this should ve been an early access release and it should ve been in early access for 6 months while all of the iteration and feedback processing necessary to make the game run and play comfortably on various devices was done i don t know whether the game has come out as it does due to project mismanagement financial pressure publisher fiat or what but either way this would be kind of not in a great place come back later is it was early access since they re calling this a full release i m judging it as one i ran into a lot of day one issues that i expect to be fixed quickly but there s a lot of deep flaws that certainly won t be for a while if ever the story is nothing remarkable i haven t seen any characters i grew remotely attached to oh good a paladin lady with boob armor yay i love having those in every fantasy setting or any of that big empire sinister dude making power grab yada yada ancient evil conspiracy chosen ones so why did i say i d still play it the gameplay does have some deep promise in it i m not a fan of a lot of the fire emblem y cruft around character conversations or stat growths or whatnot but the core choices how you set up your squads with leaders and followers do you want generalist squads with some healers and archers thrown around have an all archer squad and an all melee squad these are genuinely all valid choices with different merits on different maps and a lot of subtle mechanics that help make it feel like you have a lot of options maps alternate between being a bit more open or a bit more closed to encourage both generalist squads swarm enemies in the open to specialist ones have your all melee squad in a hallway followed by an all ranged one for instance sadly the enemy ai is kind of ultradumb so often it ll be more plan around them doing the simple stupid thing of rushing striaght at you with ranged units into melee combat but it still manages to be rewarding when you planned out your in combat healing out of combat healing and all that to line up so you deny your enemy kills on their turn only to have achain of actions open up spots in the enemy line to take out a bunch all in a row there s a truly good core of a tactical rpg with a powerful gimmick in its squad construction that shifts a lot of paradigms just a bit of a shame about literally everything else but i still hope that i can get some fun out of that core becaue it really is promising i d love to see this game become its best self someday or failing that for some devs with more time to work to take on a similar project and bring it to fruition where the grand scale of how many soldiers amidst squads you put together isn t bogged down by having to control all of them with a very clunky ui
