2018 product received for free doesnt deserve to have the title total war or even be described as a stragety game so many things to list really the amount of core problems with this game and whtw 1 as well make you wonder if ca cared about anything other than shoving some pretty looking half baked and barely functional game out the door to milk you with dlc after dlc is astounding really is a new low for even modern games any appeal is surface deep the more you play and understand the mechanics behind the shiny veneer the more of a chore the game becomes until its undeniable that it is just a grindfest against an ai that at its core is not playing the same game you are in even the slightest fashion the difficulty setting should simply be renamed exactly how much more grind would you like and should never be mistaken for would you like the enemy to play smarter and if so how much smarter fundamentally after some time you begin to understand that ca s decisions like making seiges simple head on assaults or using smaller battle maps or making the ai practically immune to all public order problems rebellions player controlled agents never ever will build even 1 public order or economic building unless it lets them recuit a unit the reason the ai is immune to these mechanics and even gets advanteges real time in battles its units get boosts to all stats and sometimes will fight to the very last man with a peasent mob is because ca simply could not be bothered to spend any money on making a fun and engaging computer opponent could or would not take the time to even plan out or consider what would make a fun and engaging opponent the computer cannot dispand units to recuit better or higher tier units on easier settings it runs away from you constantly only seeking to burn your towns down because it was never equiped to even begin and try to fight you head on on higher skill settings the ai will attack you quite often but it sucks all the reward out of victory when you realize that if you were the ai s army that unit of peasont mob or expendable spearman would have routed ages ago is fighting to the last man whats worse is its beating your greatswords 1v1 with no assistance because of aformentioned buffs which dont end in battle many battles it straight up seems like the opponents army will not die or route until it has inflicted what it deems sufficient damage to your army even if your charging them from the back with calvary got them on the flanks and the front with better units and your archers and artillery are raining hell on anything and everything you can see it plain as day the computer will refuse to let its soldiers die until they have inflicted mass casualties to your armies this is not rewarding its not fun and its not challenging its insulting and grindy beyond words litterally this game doesnt deserve to have the title total war in its name in every aspect of the game the ai gets bonuses so it never has to build an economy because it cant never has to build public order buildings or deal with your agents trying to start a rebellion because it cant deal with rebels again and again and again you see that instead of taking the time to make a computer opponent that can deal with the multiple layers of decisions that the player has to consider prioritize and work with are simply disabled for the ai outright because it cant deal with them fundimentially there is no ai just scripts that determine how much more bonus s the computer will get and how many more armies it will randomly spawn near your undefended towns and enemy factions that are going to randomly declare war on you even ones that you have high relations and are allied with will turn on you and burn your towns down in an instant if the computer determains it needs someone to attack you and no other faction can do it at that moment and dont even get me started on the great power diplomacy penalty at every level the game punish s you for succeeding and playing smart and never once does the ai do anything logical or tactical all it knows how to do is spawn more armies than you and send them at you in suicidal death charges hoping that eventually it can grind you down with sheer numbers there is no real substance beneath the pretty models and shiny textures
