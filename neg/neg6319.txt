the game itself is fine but for some reason it does not seem to like running on any nvidia 4000 series card i played through it just fine on a 3060ti i recently got a 4070 and thought i d try out this game to see how it runs the answer is that is crashes to desktop within about a minute of play and a quick look on the steamforums shows that i am not alone with this issue since i have not found anything from the devs regarding a fix and these issues have seemingly persisted for quite a few months now i cannot recommend getting the game as you might not be able to play it depending on your hardware
