2021 i genuinely cannot recommend three kingdoms to anyone despite my enjoyment of it i m a long time total war fan and have thousands of hours in all the total wars combined i m sad to say that aside from warhammer the quality in games has seen a decline over the years ca s premateur abandonment of three kingdoms was the final nail in the coffin for me it seems like the majority of ca s efforts go into warhammer and as such that is the only total war game i will take any interest in for the future thrones of britannia troy and the rome 1 remaster have all been mediocre games with the first two lacking in post launch support three kingdoms was the only modern total war game i enjoyed other than warhammer and it makes me sad to see its lifespan cut short the game is still buggy the game is still missing key characters and events in the three kingdoms chronicles the actual three kingdoms period isn t even represented in the game and what we got were some mediocre dlcs that always seemed to indicate oh maybe the next one will be good looking at the meagre dlcs for this game compared to other main line total wars it is disappointing to see that of the scant few we got most were underwhelming the base game of three kingdoms always showed promise and i enjoyed my time with it but i always felt like i was hoping the next patch would finally bring it up to the quality of warhammer with support ending that possibility no longer exists
