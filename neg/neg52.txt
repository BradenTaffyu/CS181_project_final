2016 early access review 2022 edit zomboid still hasn t really come any further then when i posted this update in 2016 yeah it looks different but it s still clunky with the same ui with the same issues and still no npc s not much else to say other than that this game has been in early access for years and it will never leave it the developers are perhaps the worst aspect of this game they have proven time and time again that they refuse to listen to feedback or criticism instead opting to ban those who don t agree with them ever since the stolen laptop incident the big reason for saying the devs are generally just bad people is the fact that they don t update their game in any meaningful way and instead constantly speak about all the work they do which forces the customer to interact with them only based on their words and not actions the game itself is only solid not outstanding however still has issues that have persisted for many years from lighting to even simple performance problems on rigs that should be more than capable of running pz no meaningful content other than multiplayer which has its own long list of issues have been added in nearly two and a half years you re buying the game as it is now with direct quotes from the devs being with future prospects of possible updates to the game don t ever expect this game to be finished the game is acceptable sometimes with overhaul mods i was also banned as of 11 29 2016 from all pz discussions due to saying that the developers have poor public relations keep in mind this was while one of their officers was arguing with someone about their development practices in their second most recent update news
