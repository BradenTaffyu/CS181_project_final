2016 the game has potential 1 problem is poor ai you will see germany moving armies back and forth for no reason refusing to push in to an empty soviet capital and not pulling troops off the russian border while at peace with them and the allies are taking the back side of their country i actually really like the production system in this game instead of industrial capacity like in previous games you actually build factories and set up production lines then use those products to produce your units research is extremely simplified plus side to this even minor nations can keep up on tech easily preventing their units from being completely useless down side is it almost feels like you don t really have a choice in what to research get industry electronics infantry and tanks research what you can in planes and water i wouldnt recommend buying this game until the ai is fixed no point in playing until then
