2023 so i ve been playing this game for about half a year in that half a year i ve put in almost 150 hours in that time i ve maybe put 1 hour into the tanks and the rest of that time into the planes never touched the boats and i ve made my conclusion if you like tanks play world of tanks if you like ships play world of warships the only thing that i find enjoyable about war thunder is that it s a great arcade ww2 fighter plane game that s it i haven t even touched the jets in this game except for when a jet touched me with it s bullets cause my br was just high enough to get a jet in my lobby i caps arcade because that s all i ve played while on war thunder purely the arcade experience i did dip into the realistic battles just to try it out and it seemed cool but really slow paced and just had a skill floor that i was stuck licking because i just sucked i started playing this game because i watched the movie midway i was craving a fighter game where i flew a naval dive bomber and that s exactly what happened the game then hooked me and that s how i ended up with 150 hours and barely getting past battle rating 5 0 in one country i did pay for the premium account at one point getting about a month of double research points to unlock vehicle modifications and new vehicles and 1 5x silver lions the main currency you earn in game which made the grind less intense at the cost of but this feels dirty and about 20 in golden eagles the premium trade irl money for this currency i recently had an issue where i wasn t making enough silver lions to pay for new vehicles after i unlocked them making me have to not only save up research points but also save up silver lions to play new and exciting vehicles plus training a crew respawn to use a new vehicle costs about 30 of a vehicle s cost not including modifications ammunition or bombs that cost silver lions for each thing you use of them a reload literally costs you currency there has been a huge problem recently as gaijin the developers of this game have cut down the earning rate of the silver lions and the community is pissed basically in i think realistic battles if your vehicle is destroyed you will pay a set cost to repair the vehicle which scales up with bigger aircraft so if you like to be a big bomber in the sky or an modern tank you now have the pleasure of paying 10 20 of the cost of the vehicle to be able to use it again so my bomber that i just unlocked cost me 150 000 silver if i die in a very vulnerable and large target i have to pay 15 000 silver to use the bomber again because i had the audacity to die keep in mind on my best ever game i had played with a 200 boost to silver lions earnings and the premium account i made about 60 000 silver lions so i could play as my bomber again 3 times and i know the math is off but i have to bomb something and bombs ain t free tl dr this game is a fun ww2 dog fighting arcade game but only if you do the arcade air battles on any battle rating below 6 0 realistic battles scare me cause there are maintenance costs for playing the game tank battles are for no lives and uhh gaijin is trying to make the grind even harsher l
