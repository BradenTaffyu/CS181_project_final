2020 the game is fine not the best tw game but fine the thing that got me to write this was the amount of dlc you could make a whole other game with the dlc this would be fine if it did not lock popular races behind a 20 pay wall 4 years after the game came out and 3 years after the sequel came out this game is a big reason why i wont buy anymore tw games
