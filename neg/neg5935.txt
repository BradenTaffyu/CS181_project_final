2020 you are probably wondering why i would give this game a negative review in essence i am not this is one of the most satisfying gaming experiences of my entire life the depth at which this game takes you into grand strategy gaming is incredible there isn t much more to say to that point which hasn t already been said above and below where is the problem then the answer is easy and i am guessing you already know it dlc and price gouging dlc among all games is an annoying issue we will probably never rid ourselves of that ship has sailed however this game specifically is by far one of the most obvious offenders we can argue over supply and demand we can argue over worth and value we can also say that you don t have to buy the dlc to enjoy the game in many ways i can see both sides of the argument i do not own a game development studio and i do not know how to make a video game yet i find it hard to believe that some of this dlc can t be more affordable if you are one of those players who bought this game at its inception and bought every dlc as it came out the burden is less of an impact now imagine you are buying the game for the first time who in their right mind would want to pay 263 93 for a game and that isn t including all the other things that are available for this game i am one of those players who just doesn t like playing an incomplete game i feel like most gamers who would be interested in this game are of a like mind to that sentiment we wanted detail and a very immersive experience that is why we love this game is it possible that the developers are aware of our fixation and are maliciously taking advantage of us i would also gamble that the players of this game have a higher average income to those players of other games is that something they also are exploiting i can get real conspiratorial when you are asking me to spend close to 300 for a complete game this game is unique in that some dlc might not even have an impact on your game based on your starting position government culture etc etc would you then argue to me that i should not have purchased the dlc i would argue the butterfly effect it might not be obvious on its face but a change has been made and this argument hasn t even started on the quality of some dlc which also might not be seen on its face i am just a small voice here i am not very confident that my chirping will get much traction or be seen by anyone influential enough to make a difference i do like this game you should buy it just be warned that this is like a cocaine habit not as bad as magic the gathering but a top contender for money sucks women cocaine mtg oreo s eu4
