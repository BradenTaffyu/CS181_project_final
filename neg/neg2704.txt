2018 this game is perfect example of greed ruining another developer i picked up stellaris right when it was released and had ton of fun with it empire custiomization all the events that was new to me at the time the sense of exploration different empire you d meet when expanding all that was very enticing and gave would pull me back to this game for solid 2 years there was bugs obviously but as a casual player i never cared about some min max strats that lots of the people complained in the old versions of the game the only thing that irked me was the late game performance going down every major patch the soundtrack is fantastic and the writing quality of events is quite good so why the negative review paradox was working on the 2 2 patch for quite some time during this year which was supposed to revamp the economy system of the planets making it more interesting to play with during peacetime the le guin patch was in the works like since june or july and as the months passed by they were convicing people that removing of the tile system would boost the performance quite a bit and make it easier for the ai to build their empires the stellaris fb page admins would happily tell people that the performance increase would be huge especially since they annouced that they gonna release the megacorp dlc it was all nice and dandy until someone posted his impressions of an pre release build on reddit stating that the ai is brain dead and does nothing and the performance is absymal he got shut down pretty quickly based on some embargo but eventually all the megacorp customers would enjoy the mess pdx bestow upon everyone and just before christmas while the dev diaries were vague about the release date they released it with a short announcement a week before so it looked like they really tried to squeeze the dlc before christmas as of right now past 2 2 patch the game is playable for the first 200 years 300 if you are very patient due to horrid slowdowns and daily tick lag the game is locking up almost constantly for a small amounts of time and the late game is unplayable unless you enjoy sitting for 15 minutes waiting for your stuttering fleet to go to the other end of your empire to deal with some petty pirates it should be a priority to the devs to resolve these issues but on the pdx forums there are a lot of fanbois stating that they play stutter free on 10k galaxies and when people call them out on their bs with evidence and videos they are getting banned i have quite high end rig many people playing on the i9 9900k are getting the same terrible performance yet they refuse to acknowledge it and keep putting minor beta patches to fix some min maxers strats and exploits they borked the ai as well which usually doesn t do much at all and is easyily stomped so the game became sluggish borefest the beta branch patches doesn t help at all you have to resort to mods glavius ai great work that man does to have playable ai and in the broad side of things after a while the game gets repetitive with the non funct ai atm and tragic performance once you see all the events you just click through them giving you some tech points there and some minerals there the empires you meet despite different ethics and looks feels the same with no unique traits or behaviour well maybe the devouring swarm and fanatic purifiers are little different they just can t do diplomacy and are able only to purge conquered planets but you do that a lot anyway since diplomacy is barebones in this game and the only thing they really pulled out well lately was the new economic system in 2 2 which is actually fun to balance it s not a bad game you will get quite a few hours of fun but the pdx behaviour regarding this game is sort of ea ish rushing broken and unfinished products just to hit the shelves before christmas they did the same thing with 2 0 patch last year and promised to not pull this bs again and after a while you find yourself waiting for another patch for months to fix the ai performance glaring bug only to find it do the opposite
