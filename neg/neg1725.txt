2022 first brought this on the ps4 spent 2 years and more money then i would like to admit on the dlc now that i m on pc do you think that i can access any of it if you answered no you re correct i understand why but there should still be a way to access dlc you ve already paid for across platforms the fact there isn t seems really money hungry especially considering the price seriously though the base game is dry just play the sims 3 and when ea finally thinks of way to improve it they slap a 40 60 aud price tag on it and provide the smallest amount of content and maybe a fully functioning gameplay feature they expect you to praise them for the grace of news skills and you re more likely to get more bugs then quality of life updates the base game is basically a trap to get you to buy the dlc it doesn t completely suck it has just enough to drip you potential every now and then to keep you playing long enough to want more and then you grab a dlc on sale only get them on sale if you re buying any of them and the process starts again until the sunk cost fallacy kicks in and keeps you around and in my opinion this is so much worse then it just being a terrible game straight up edit there s now a cart button in the game s core ui that you can not disable and that ea is doubling down on not removing don t get this game
