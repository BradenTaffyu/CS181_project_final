2023 i am frustrated by every design decision however the story is too good to pass up so here we are from day 1 to purgatory i originally removed the first part of this review as i saw it was unneeded however an immense amount of people have reacted to this review now so i feel the need to add it back i believe that project moon as always is phenomenal in presentation direction storytelling and all other aspects however they are not good at designing games lobcorp is tedious ruina is painfully difficult at times and limbus is both of those and a gacha even as someone who has all the ids currently available and is extremely invested in the game nothing can clean the wound for me of having to farm lux save resources and need to treat the game as a part time job it infuriates me to no end and it disappoints me the gameplay is frustrating doesn t innovate and backtracks from what ruina achieved i m only here for the story
