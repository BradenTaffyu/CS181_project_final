2015 let me start off by saying war thunder is a wonderful game unlike wot which i have played an estimated 2000 hours of war thunder s tanks and airplanes actually fight like airplanes hit the engine the tank might burst into flames but probably won t hit the commander s hatch the tank isn t going to magically burst into flames like in wot i love war thunder and i am so glad it exists the developers are nice and like to involve the community and the gameplay is significantly more interesting overall however they have some of the very worst business practices of any f2p i ve ever known if you buy premium time the game will ask if you want to buy more incessantly the moment it expires they ve doubled their prices on packs before the summer sale for the second year in a row which is completely illegal they even made non steam packs on their website to get around giving steam a portion of the proceeds when the business side of war thunder becomes this cash grab no matter how much money i want to give them for making a solid game i just can t justify it i can t justify giving them more money just so they can program more ways to take it away while this is the best tank game on the market save your wallet despite the developers wanting to make a quality game gaijin entertainment has shown time and time again that their sole interest is taking as much money as possible from the consumer by any means necessary
