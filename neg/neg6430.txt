after playing 2h i have 5 legendary cars houses and a lot of money it feels like its the end game since u begin the game the map is boring no close corners streets so the races feels boring if u want to go at another point of the map u can drive at the road with 400 km h with ez no close corners streets and a few cars or u can go strait trough the desert with no problems sometimes u hit a rock and stop but 90 of the times u can go with ez this game is for kids low difficulty no progress in the game in my opinion not worth the money
