2022 friendly review from an old yugioh fan for other old yugioh fans this game is not for you and when i say this game i actually don t mean master duel i mean yugioh in general if i was reviewing this game as a modern yugioh fan with all the knowledge of current cards and meta then yes this game is a big thumbs up instead im reviewing this in the eyes of someone who misses the old days of yugioh where the card game had an emphasis on fun and not 10 minute rounds to set up a win in one or two turns i literally was watching youtube as the person i was competing against finished their turn i was very excited for this game when i first saw it announced i followed any news and watched the videos so i knew it was going to be tailored around modern yugioh rules however i was hoping for more classic cards and maybe a bunch of classic decks at launch that way people like me could set up private lobbies for old casual yugioh fun but that doesn t exist yet speaking of the private lobbies or deck rooms more flexible customizing needs to be added that way players can have full control of how the lobby is set up and people browsing those lobbies have more info on what who the lobby is for somehow mtg has become more casual than yugioh which is mind blowing to me also a simple fix for all the competitive deck building games is to have matchmaking be based on the cards rather then the player i could be the number one ranked player in the game but if i was queued with a starter deck then i should only play other players with starter decks and vice versa tl dr this game is great for new yugioh players and very competitive players but if you are returning to yugioh hoping for those classic times dueling for fun then you must look elsewhere until more control to the deck rooms is added as well as classic decks or better matchmaking edit after playing an additional 20 hours of the game to clear the solo missions haven t 100 it yet and use the generous beginning gems they give you to open some packs and build some decks i am having fun with the game however i still stand by my original review above regarding the solo mode it is okay they added fun stories or scenarios that explain the lore of certain archetypes then have you do a practice duel with said archetype that teach you the very basic ideas of the archetype and then after completing that you go on to some duels that you can complete using your own deck or a loaner of the scenario archetype speaking of story mode and the scenarios these are very cool and kind of fun and i d like to see more added but unfortunately the practice you do before the duels literally has you complete a guided combo one combo from the archetype and then sends you to figure out the rest on your own i think this could have been improved by having a couple guided practices explaining a few of the different combos that an archetype can pull off again i stand by my original review and add that solo mode while improvable is pretty fun also add a bot mode like seriously every card game has one
