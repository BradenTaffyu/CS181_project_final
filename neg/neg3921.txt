2020 i love the game but hate the balancing this is a single player rogue like game not a competitive moba stop balancing it like one items that once used to be fun are now a valueless and obsolete addition to the game because the developers thought it was too strong in a single player game constant nerfs and absolute destruction to my favourite items and mutations over the years this game has been out really just killed it for me i find it impossible to enjoy the game because of these constant changes to the meta in a game where the meta does not need to be changed or balanced the art and actual gameplay though are really good this game could have been one of my all time favourites if it wasn t for the constant and major changes to the items and mutations
