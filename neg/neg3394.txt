2019 i decided to write a negative review yes after 300 hours in game because paradox is in fact a monopolist in ww ii strategies and therefore they dare to offer us an incompleted product with hundreds of dlcs my most essential criticism concerns diplomacy because there is only war and absolutely no diplomatic system you hardly can come to peace terms with an enemy only unconditional surrender there is no system for diplomatic actions with the subjects and much much more because strategy is not always about the war it is about creating a world a parallel history and was it possible to give the game a diplomatic system yes because there is an example of europa universalis which has a lot more developed diplomatic system i simply cannot understand why paradox has decided to ignore it for hears of iron i recommend not to buy this game and wait for another part or a better alternative where you can not only wage war but also make peace and reform the world
