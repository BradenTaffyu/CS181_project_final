early access review developers do not know how to communicate with the community after falsely banning unknown ammount of people and leaving them without answers on their appeals for the whole weekends prime gamming time for many and later for nearly the whole work week my appeal took 6 days before i got unbanned dms in discord were ignored there was no cooperation from developer side as far as we know people were just sitting and waiting for nearly a week with abnormaldetection ban when they enter the game all this while facing toxic community what is brewing around the game where many people are sure that false positives do not exist mail with an answer came 3 days after my appeal was upheld as an answer on my 2nd appeal what was sent 1 week ago there were rummors what turned out to be true that some users were asked for a remote acces for the pc to review the appeal there still is no statement about false bans and they try to sweep it under the rug there is no information about it in new announcement and no information in a patchnote being left without acces to the game hanging there in uncertainty about future of the account going to bed with 3 days ban just to wake up and see permanent one is sure not something what i wish anyone to exprience i do enjoy the game but it s not how you treat the customers and people over all the game is very fun if you re not forced to communicate with the devs
