2023 early access review 10 years not even beta builds yet it s both come a long way and gotten nowhere at all i really want to love this game because it s got alot of potential but i ve lost hope tbh skill books and perk system is cool but gettting water early game now as of a21 is just too difficult they changed a perfectly functioning water system and made it more of a chore zombie ai is exploitably too smart which tends to make meta bases but then the devs will see these metas form and go i don t like that and fundamentally change things to destroy that meta this then makes new metas if i was to change the ai i d say break it up into 3rds 1 3 is really smart and targets the weakest path as it is now for every zombie another 1 3 just tries to go for a direct path to the player ignoring whatever might be between the 2 and another 1 3 is just pure dumb zombie mindlessly punching everything it can find i ve just spent the last few days really trying this version and both times i only survived the very first raid because i had managed to obtain a bicycle and used it to ride around until the night was over when the base failed
