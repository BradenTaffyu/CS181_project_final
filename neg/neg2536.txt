2021 tldr the developer expansive worlds doesn t care about fixing game breaking bugs i ve been playing thehunter since 2017 it s now 2021 so here s my review the scenery is beautiful the atmosphere of the game is great there s a good variety of animals and weapons and they also look great but the experience is ruined because bugs bugs bugs and more bugs bugs present since 2017 have not been fixed yet they keep pumping out dlc which always leads to more bugs the bugs ruin what would otherwise be a very enjoyable experience here are some bugs i ve encountered and the devs are aware of them graphical bugs too many to list honestly these are somewhat tolerable most of the time some examples floating guns lures and decoys particularly bad in multiplayer leaderboard is broken it worked briefly in 2017 despite numerous complaints the devs have not fixed it fast travel is broken spent all that time finding the outposts so you can easily traverse the map doesn t matter because the fast travel is bugged maps are broken maps that i have fully explored will suddenly show that they are now unexplored all the hours spent finding outposts areas of interest etc gone trophy lounge is broken why even have dlc for trophy lounges when they don t work after meticulously placing and designing my lounge all of my saved harvests are now gone years worth of trophy animals suddenly disappeared diamonds golds and even albino animals are gone no way to get them back ai issues animals sometimes run in circles or freeze in place random game play issues too many to list some examples i ve walked up a steep hill and suddenly flew 5 miles to my death i ve reloaded a gun and tried to look down my scope which resulted in looking down an invisible scope while reloading the bloodhound dlc is broken it s just broken cute pet but it doesn t really do anything helpful mission objectives that cannot be completed fps drops audio bugs and morealso bugs aside the game needs to be redesigned in some areas maybe a nit pick but the store and storage menus are a mess once you have a lot of items each item is a big rectangular block and you have to scroll through a bunch of them to find the one you want i think it should be redesigned to be more concise and easily navigable implement a call scent timer example a scent lasts 10 minutes why do i have to take out my stop watch in order to know when i have to reapply a scent just a quick little timer above the compass or something would be great ultimately what really grinds my gears is that the devs are unwilling to fix these issues they instead want to make a quick buck no pun intended by throwing out broken dlc everyone reading this should flood their social media and support desk with bug complaints
