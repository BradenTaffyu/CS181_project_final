2018 i used to support gaijin and i did love thier game but they dont listen to us anymore or really at all they ve gotten as scumy as some of the other companies have been they put 0 effort into changing this as everyone is upset at them i ve wasted money on yet another game that changed for the worse and doesnt care to fix it the breaking promisses and practically lie to us shoving paying our way through the game is annoying af at this point as much as i enjoy my tanks and planes i dont feel like putting in any effort anymore im not going to give effort to a company that doesnt give any either gaijin i hope you do end up failing in order see what you are doing is retarded
