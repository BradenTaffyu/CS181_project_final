2023 hogwarts legacy is a meh game you want to play a brave gryffindor or like me a slytherin prick sure but it doesn t matter choices don t matter in this game no matter your decisions the story will unfold the very same way i guess it would cost too much money to make a story with differents scenario paths based on the house and the choices so this game has zero replay value yet the devs made one achievement per house for reaching a certain point in the game the toast of the townthe auror s apprenticethe gryffindor in the graveyardthe wise owlthose are 4 pointless achievements devs should have made 1 achievement instead period the alohomora spell is the most tedious thing i have to deal with why do i have to deal with this boring mini game for each lock the tutorial is poorly made streamers and i struggled to get the gist of it it s just an infinite repeat of a big sigh i wish you could just disable the mini game and not waste 1mn each time you have to unlock one of the innumerable locked doors in this game do i recommend this game meh game is good fighting is great flying is awesome but it feels unfinished karma feature multiple ending based on choices would have made hogwarts legacy game of the year 2023 but you will get the same story no matter your house no matter your choice so i guess you could say you decide if i recommend this game or not
