2023 early access review fun with friends pretty good zombie game the newest update a21 has taken the game in a strange direction i wouldn t call it good the extreme scarcity of water is actually rather annoyingly implemented the game s resource economy still seems to expect that you have access to as much water as you could want which was previously the case for established bases but no can t have nice things can we why is my bucket of water from a nearby lake useless why can t i boil it on a fire just like i do with every jar of poo water i find in the toilets to get clean water the dew collector is simultaneously too slow and expensive somehow draws zombies a completely silent and inanimate object draws zombies constantly and it takes up a ton of space it also doesn t seem to collect water from rainfall what more importantly there is now only one way to play the game you have to find crafting magazines literally every single piece of equipment every weapon all armor and each tool that you need to survive are locked behind finding an arbitrary number of books how do you find the books two options you either loot or buy them buying is incredibly limited in selection and prohibitively expensive so that leaves us with looting easy right that s the game already isn t it no it wasn t like that before and it really shouldn t be this way now to build the things you want and need you have to find x crafting magazines to unlock them to find the books you are forced to put skill points into skills relevant to the item you want to build no big deal except if you happen to have 2 levels in skill a and only 1 level in skill b can you guess which flavor the crafting magazines you find will be that s right no way to know you just gotta hope rng is on your side today even once you max out a particular crafting magazine you continue to find them everywhere useless and worthless instead of the ones you still need because you have points in that skill i put 1 point in cooking and 3 points into archery for instance among other skill choices i have 100 100 in the cooking skill at this point and the game seems to think i may have missed a recipe somewhere because it keeps shoveling cookbooks at me instead of anything else trying to figure out how to build a workbench well did you put points into lockpicking no well of course you can t figure out how to build a workbench one of the most important items in the game without putting points into lockpicking you silly goose why would you think otherwise they didn t just drop the ball on this one they catapulted it into a spike wall
