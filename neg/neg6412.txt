2023 the developers are completely full of adding dlc and boring filler content update after update not to mention that the new dlc car packs are not included with premium edition what the how do you have the balls to charge 100 for a premium edition that was supposed to include every single future dlc like all the previous games and completely ignore that promise less than 2 years after release the expansion packs were completely copied off of previous horizon games with 0 effort put in to them and seasonal events are there just to keep the last few players playing all new content thus far has been mostly recycled cars from previous games new features which literally nobody uses for example only 0 2 of players have tuned 5 cars at the new test track and lastly boring driving stories in some of which have exactly the same events twice the game was really enjoyable for the duration of the story but after that it becomes a mind numbing grindfest with nothing interesting to do
