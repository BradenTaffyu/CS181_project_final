2021 although one of the best racing games in the market forza horizon 5 on steam lacks the bug free gameplay most xbox users experience there are various graphical and gameplay glitches that make the game extremely less immersive some glitches i have experienced anti aliasing sometimes will devolve into an early 2000 s pixel platformer black polygons will show up from time to time on the surface of dirt areas in online mode the car will suddenly stop after being disconnected from the server resulting in the loss of a skill chain landing in some areas of towns in the game from either danger zones or ramps will result in being trapped by unbreakable walls buildings or other objects in online mode some player s cars will freeze mid air after being launched from danger zones ssao will sometimes lower in resolution mid game showing bars across the screen from the horizon making it harder to see distant objects when driving ironic really lod will sometimes turn into the 1st generation source engine crashes long load times even with a nvme ssd level ups will sometimes not register resulting in the game showing you as a level higher than you actually are even when the rewards have been given on a good note the northern mexico map is vast with great detail and realism although a lack of potholes from my few times visiting mexico myself the selection of vehicles in the game is also a great improvement from fh4 and the details are extremely photorealistic in addition the gameplay and races are highly varied and the substantial amount of online interactivity makes this game one of the best online racing games on pc though these bugs can be ignored from time to time i have ran into issues involving a multitude of crashes due to lack of memory optimizations consequently i have lost numerous amount of hours of progress on extensive wraps and decal group creations i cannot recommend the current state of horizon 5 s pc port as of right now and with later fixes i ll be enthusiastically inclined to change this review
