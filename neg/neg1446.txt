2022 early access review bannerlord has a mod friendly engine good visuals a good economic simulation and decent combat simulation and it has elements of gameplay from a lot of different genres and tries to do a lot of things however sadly it is not a fun game after 2 years of early access problems that have been around since launch still cause the game to be frustrating repetitive and shallow it fails to be fun at any of the genres it covers it s not a fun strategy game because the ai makes bad war peace decisions you can t send messengers to people and have to chase them down yourself you can t tell your allies where to attack or defend the ai gets cheats like free mercenaries and you cannot change the outcome of most votes it s not a fun rpg because the quests are mostly boring it s too grindy and the world feels lifeless it s not a fun melee combat game because armour gives basically no protection from arrows so allies and enemies die too easily among other issues it s not a fun tactical game because you just need to spam ranged units which do insane damage to armour to win easily if you buy this game you might get some fun out of the early game but the mid late game is a constant repetitive loop of enemy kingdoms mindlessly spamming stacks of 1000 men at you in battles with no tactical skill needed and nothing to really break up the experience despite the many different features this game has most of them are incomplete bugged or so imbalanced they aren t worth using it s also missing features from the game which came before it warband taleworlds has been updating and working on it but they work way too slowly when a new patch is released each month i come back to do a playthrough and realize they ve made little progress on the long term issues with the game it might be worth buying in a year or two at this rate right now warband is a more fun game and that came out in 2010
