2014 this game once was a very nice and good developed game but slowly patch after patch it gets worse and worse almost reaching wowp level worse is even that you get banned for speaking out on the forum guess russians didnt forget the cccp that quickly free opinion not allowed its a nice enough game if you start and know a bit about flying if you dont leave it be low tiers which dont count as battle rating dictates match making are hopelessly outclassed by professianal sealclubbers up to high tiers which are a grindfest which make world of tanks look like a breeze in the park see for yourself and you probably quit after a couple of weeks
