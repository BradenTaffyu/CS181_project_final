2023 the only good format you can play on this game draft is way too expensive to play consistently without being crazy good or spending 20 on a battlepass you read that right the battlepass for this game is 20 when most games are 10 explorer is a half baked port of an already inherently uninteractive and unbalanced format and alchemy is a total mockery of everything that makes magic unique and engaging in the first place but hey for 10 you can get a little fblthp pet to laugh at you while you lose to greasefang decks again that s the only deck you can play with the cards ported to explorer also the game crashes whenever you search for a card in the deckbuilder so that s pretty neat save yourself the time and money and buy a commander precon or build a pauper deck and go make friends with real people in the community instead of playing this game as much as i did and turning into a bitter mtg hater with no hope for the future of wizards of the coast i have to end this review now the pinkertons are at my door
