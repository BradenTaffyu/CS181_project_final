2018 i hate giving fallout 4 a negative review as it is a major installment in one of my favorite series of all time my first experience with fallout was 3 i fell in love with the atmosphere the characters and most of all the weight of my in game choices many of which induced an entire spectrum of emotions and gave the game immense replayability i then found 1 2 and tactics once again experiencing the magic of choices consequences and npc s with genuine personalities besides tactics not sure what happened there new vegas was released in 2010 and it absolutely blew my mind factions an incredibly dense world and once again choices that matter fast forward to fallout 4 i purhcased f4 a year or so after it was released so i could put enough cash aside to build a gaming pc and intentionally went into it without reading a single review or watching any gameplay when avoidable i sort of expected f3 brought into the next gen after almost 90 hours of game time all i can say is this is not a fallout game role playing has been scrapped in favor of a linear plot with a fully developed character witty and extremely well written dialogue has been scrapped in favor of a dialogue wheel with a voiced protagonist and there are literally no meaningful choices you re essentially the good guy no matter what you do the only choices are pushover goodguy or goodguy i found 90 of the quests boring as hell and stretched over the commonwealth like a teaspoon of butter over a loaf of bread if bethesda ever decides to add another fallout to the series i sincerely hope they take the role of publisher and hand the engine over to obsidian if you want a good modern fallout game just buy new vegas and mod the out of it you wont regret it
