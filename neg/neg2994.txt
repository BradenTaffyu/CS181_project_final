2018 i bought this game shortly before the 2 0 patch and didn t have much of a chance to play 1 9 so my love of 1 9 is likely coloured by everything being shiny and new for me back then what i do know is that i m finding 2 0 an awful grind i don t mind hyperlanes especially if it means the ai has a better chance but i do strenously object to making you traverse the system to use them rather than jumping in recharging jumping out even that might be acceptable if i could move the speed slider to even faster but faster is as high as it goes that s not the biggest problem for me though i find the way you re forced to manually construct every single one of the multiple per sytem resource gathering structures quite literally mind numbing there s no justification for this continuing out of the early game it s like the developers haven t played imperium galactica which is an old example of how to handle the scaling of the game through the various phases early mid late actually they do get it because there s an ability to automate scouts after the early game sure constructors are harder because there s a balance to strike between what s needed what s nearby and what you can afford to spend on mining research bases but it s still do able i also have minor issue with how they ve done leaders it s a boring leveling system with no real scope for a natural alien alexander or alien napoleon to appear not unless you grind said alien through the ranks then they die and the next cookie cutter candidate is put in place far better if the leaders were more organic perhaps also with the opportunity to hire truly exception leaders and i m not a fan of the limited number of leaders either all in all lots of complaining there i did enjoy my first 100 hours or so but stellaris hasn t for me performed i ll revert my patch and give 1 9 another shot but i suspect it ll be the same there still not having to construct a starbase in every system might make it bearable edit i was playing the star trek total conversion prior to reverting and am still playing it on 1 9 1 wow what a difference the game is fun again obviously it s sad that i m landed with a product that will never improve but at least the game is playable again just right click on the game in steam and choose properties betas then select 1 9 1
