2018 stop beating the old dog they fixed the game with emperor edition and it was good the game was great with mods like dei in late 2017 they decide to add some major dlc to a four year old game this is not enough and they decide to add some crappy culture pack in 2018 just in case if someone had mods that still worked so that they will all be incompatible and have to be updated with dei i had more than all the dlc offered combined and now you have to ruin it for an old game with lackluster dlc why not just make dlc for attila instead of a game that was only kept alive by few great mods i do not mind good dlc for relevant games but shoving some cookie cutter crap in a four year old game is just unbelievable attila is cheaper than this and so are all the older tw games tw w1 2 are the same price i would recommend getting any of those instead of this and unless you are specifically interested in this exact setting this is a better deal for most attila would be close enough and it offers improved mechanics and graphics for a lower price
