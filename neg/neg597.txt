2020 story excellent graphics excellent sound excellent gameplay horrendous giant disappointment after playing divinity original sin 1 138 hours in me and my sister considered giving up on the game the ai constantly cheats and the armour system removes nearly all tactics and fun from the game grind down shield stunlock repeat now larian studios is great and they deserve all the money they get for they really give a but i really cannot recommend this game to the point where i write a review which i never really tend to do but i can literally not understand opposing views on the gameplay after trying so hard to understand it truly pains me the amount of anger this game instilled is unthinkable
