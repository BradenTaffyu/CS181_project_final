2019 early access review the fact that it s 2019 and my review has the early access tag says something honestly the game was a fun thing to play i use to love playing this with my dad we racked up 300 hours in a16 4 alone countless late nights surviving in the zombie infested world and most players would probably agree that 16 4 was the best version of the game a17 and beyond has just ruined the game for me honestly i haven t played much of the a17 version because once the first stable version of it came out i had the worst experience i constantly fell through the world and experienced low fps inside of buildings i will say the graphics looked better but that s it still a game riddled with bugs out the ass honestly i had given up hope on this game with a16 4 sure it was fun and all but it was still broken as with low fps in some zones zombies bugs etc it was just bad after seeing the work of a17 and hearing of this a18 that is now coming it just basically confirms that the game is ruined the devs don t listen to the players much had a real of a experience on the forums with multiple moderators who belittled me and insulted me for reporting bugs and complaining about how the same bugs were present from one update to the next i don t understand why some people still have faith in these devs it would be an amazing game if they listened to the players and got their fuicking act together
