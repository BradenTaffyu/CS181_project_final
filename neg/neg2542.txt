2019 edit look at the laundry list of dlc totaling over 100 and think about how there are major game breaking bugs and poor optimization that has existed in some form since the beginning it s obvious the developer is milking a few hardcore folks who overlook glitches and don t mind using workarounds to recover from some of the issues i really wanted to recommend this game it has great potential here is how i feel after buying almost all of the dlc pros beautiful world design fairly realistic sounding effects decent animal populationcons this is the most buggy game i ve ever played most of my playing play style is guided from using or avoiding bugs some of the dlc should 100 absolutely be in the base game atv hunting cabins to display trophies gun integrity system isn t fully logical shotguns with buckshot are incredibly weak against even the smallest deer and fox and can ruin integrity even up very close but can give 100 on a rabbit and instantly kill it even when just hitting a leg a crossbow can apparently kill every creature on the planet as easily easily or more easily than a firearm injury system doesn t make complete sense entire length of the spine damaged creature runs 300 yards hip and both rear leg bones shattered animal runs full speed 400 yards maps like layton lake terribly optimized for atvsin short it falls short as a simulator short as an arcade shooter and short as a finished title due to the bugs developers stop with the dlc and fix the insane amount of glitching and ai issues the atv should be free considering one would spend more game time opening up the map than hunting i won t even be mad that i paid for it if you introduced it for free edit after another 38 hours playing and letting new content an patches arrive here are my thoughts i still do not recommend this game numerous patches and paid dlc released i m still experiencing bugs from 2017 game changing bugs like losing access to areas i have already discovered my gun may discharge when travelling to a tent sometimes calling in a pack of angry buffalo trying to kill me regardless of how many times i discharge my weapons none of them ever scare off i have to kill them all or get chain killed just because i want to use my tent i am still 100 adamant that the atv should be free the game walk is really slow and the game designers want you to pay money to not need to walk for several hours at a time travelling between areas when opening up a map this is not supposed to be a walking simulator with moments of hunting this game has so much potential to be one of my favorite games ever it kills me to have to not recommend it because the developers keep rolling out paid dlcs instead of making the core game viable and a relatively bug free experience i can even overlook the absolutely terrible ai if they fix bugs that make you lose progress and release atvs for free
