2021 do i like oxygen not included it s really hard to say i know that i want to like the game and there are parts of it that i do however i ve slowly come around to the realization that oni is terrible at its core this is a base building game emphasizing resource management the game is ultimately about an ever dwindling supply of resources whose scarcity forces you to discover and adapt to new ways of playing so far so good where it utterly fails is how it manages complexity your first goal is survival food and oxygen oni s gimmick is that matter can t be destroyed it is but let us ignore that and thus every input has an output that needs to be stored or reused it isn t enough to produce food and oxygen you also have to deal with heat and waste it is at this point fans will say oh oni is supposed to be hard it just has a steep learning curve to which i laugh heartily sure this part of the game is well paced and it involves expansion and experimentation it s why i ve played as long as i have oni s mid game on the other hand is about dealing with the sins of your past you must move on to more sustainable practices except there are no buildings that outright solve problems many buildings only create new ones especially if you don t know how to use them thus it would be best if you pivoted to learning about exploits because the alternative is something that doesn t work for example you can freely use germy clean water in sinks toilets and showers sound odd well you can use chlorine or heat to remove the germs except those solutions are far more complex use more resources and add to your existing problems so you choose new issues or exploit a quirk of the engine oni s mascot should be the liquid airlock it is symbolic of every issue i have with the game it isn t enjoyable to set up but it costs almost nothing and is infinitely better than the next best thing that being not to pay much attention to gases if you don t like the exploit and want to manage gases your third best option would be doors automation signals and pumps that solution is roughly on par with ignoring it save it uses energy fuel labor and materials you can complete part of the game without using too many exploits but note my words there too many exploits some are required this is because there is a considerable gap between the starting technologies that work and the ones that require hugely complex setups to function with any level of efficiency it isn t good learning and it isn t good design these exploits exist because provided solutions don t exist or are vastly inferior oni is a dense game with interesting pieces and enjoyable complexity but the complexity is misplaced at no point does it reign in old problems to let you focus on new ones i can t recommend it the people who like oni will say this is all working as intended it s supposed to be obtuse boring and painful to play that s what makes it fun the developers have nerfed many of these exploits over time which suggests they don t endorse them but they can only do so much because this is how oni is played rather than restructure the tech tree or maybe add in some missing links they ve opted to simply make the exploits a bit less effective without addressing why they are so desirable in the first place it leads to a game that starts strong and either you master every quirk of the the engine or you grow annoyed and stop i just can t recommend that
