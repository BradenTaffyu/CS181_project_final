it is sad that i have to do this but i just can t give it a positive review yet warband this game predecessor is one of my most played games ever in the past so i ve been following this for years and years the pre release trailers showed an incredible update to the graphics and the battles looked great and they are in fact some of the best part of the game but that however is pretty much the only improvement you see it really tells you that something is wrong when you just can t finish a save not because the game is too bad but because it is too tiresome this game is not marketed as an infuriating frustrating game like some souls like game are that require repetition and learning so when you find yourself so pissed and tired having to grind army after army having to go to from village to village recruiting one or two soldiers because the village won t give you more due to being at war with you and if you force them to give you your relations will drop and they won t give you recruits even in peace times all the while having to dodge enemies it gets old really fast this game has some major jumps that could be really nice if implemented in the right way the first jump is upgrading your clan and getting a companion the second is becoming a mercenary and finally being able to beat other nobles then you can become a vassal and you will most likely be gifted a fief but that is when things stop being so fun the next jump is to finally having your own kingdom but you better be prepared to spend hundreds of hours dealing with the most frustrating mechanics and ai firstly having a fief requires either a garrison or you need to be close by so a party of 150 won t take it from you but the constant war the villagers and caravans being ambushed by bandits or enemies and the villages being raided means that the city will never ever pay for its own garrison so a city can t pay its own garrison but you need to somehow pay your own party wages plus the garrison which means you have 0 time to breathe because the wages in this game are expensive and daily not weekly as it used to be in warband and the day goes by fast maybe the wages are not expensive doe maybe it is just absurdly hard to earn money if not from constant battle there used to be a way to make millions being a blacksmith but it is mostly patched now caravans cost around 15k or 22k if you want better troops but it doesn t matter because it will get attacked anyway you have to be very very lucky to have a caravan making 500 gold daily workshops will halt production in the first week or so due to lack of profits and both caravans and workshops are limited depending on your clan level but let s say you overcame all that the easy and still sort of fun part and decided o start your own kingdom well that is the major problem of this game diplomacy never heard of it the game is simply relentless it is just war war war during my last save 3 kingdoms were very strong with 15k armies one of them was very very far away behind one of the other stronger one but for some godsdamn reason it would always declare war on me and cross the continent with 3 or 4 armies to force me to pay tributes but let s say you actually defeat their armies again and again using strategy patience and lots of time would this make them pay you tribute well of course not your inventory will have half a million in items looted your prisons will have 40 nobles from their kingdom yet they will still demand tribute to stop sending their men to be massacred making you have to go around reconquering cities or lifting sieges almost always outnumbered 5 to 1 but let s say they are busy fighting each other for once and leave you be for some weeks you finally have time to convince some lords to join your cause after they join you give them a nice fief full of troops and even give some of your best troops to them well good luck with that the npc lords will have no money because fiefs don t profit much remember and it is their only source of income if not in an army with you and you will watch the troops in the garrison slowly disappear due to unpaid wages oh the troops you gave to the lord also gone same reason giving troops and money to your lords fix this a little bit but very little bit and it is extremely annoying have to chase them around the ai is not very bright so it becomes truly tiresome having to farm the money train the troops gift them and 5 minutes later see the notification that the lord was taking prisoner losing most of the hard work you did buuut let s say the lords actually manage to hold their own and even create an army well the war will eventually start and while you are busy sieging or defending a fief you will have to watch an 800 men army chasing a party of 40 which has twice the speed of the army once the small party is out of range the army will go for a good objective like defending a fief or sieging a poorly defended one but wait is that another small party close by oh how dare they and there goes your army again chasing a random party obviously not catching it sometimes it stays in this loop until there is no more cohesion and it disbands meanwhile you lost another 3 castles while trying to defend one anyway the problem is the late game sometimes you don t have time to even sell your loot it is war war war there is no diplomacy alliances intrigue or options to talk directly with enemy kings to have better terms nothing you can t manage cities talk to lords go to villages try to buy stuff nothing there is no time it is only pay tribute and defend my last save i gave up because i was fighting against 2 huge kingdoms and 2 weaker ones eventually settling to pay absurd amounts of tribute to the stronger ones making my lords very very poor with 30 men parties to focus on the weaker ones only to have a third big kingdom declare war on my almost immediately and invade my kingdom with five five huge armies with almost 2k men each was it possible to fight back yes but at that point i was simply too tired it was not funny anymore the grind was too annoying so yeah just a short review with some points that crossed my mind not much honestly i could talk a lot more
