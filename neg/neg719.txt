2020 it is important to note for the sake of this review that i played fallout 4 for hundreds of hours when it first came out all on my xbox 1 back in 2015 2016 i then put it down in for years refusing to play it at all or even talk about it the reasons for my disappointment in this game are complicated but it mostly comes down to the following although fallout 4 has improved massively on the combat formula from previous entries and power armor in particular is just awesome in this game and is the only major thing redeeming it for me from being totally awful it unfortunately hardly feels like an rpg at all from beginning to end unless you mod heavily you are told who your character is what they think how they talk what they believe even if that contradicts with you playing as a lootin and shootin murderhobo and the main plot line is hopelessly railroaded uninspired vapid and forced seriously it s just the fallout 3 plot in reverse and that game wasn t known for its stellar writing either what was bethesda thinking when they gave this game s story the nod probably that it wouldn t affect their profit margins most companions despite how superficially interesting they may appear at a glance can be summed up to a few conversations triggered by certain random actions while looting or in combat a strange design choice and there isn t really much room for you to become attached to them unless you imagine that these interactions are more complicated than they really are why the hell is piper going to like me more because i opened a safe why does strong hate everything that i do other than kill things this shallow level of detail to the huge detriment of the game and to the fallout franchise as a whole applies to damn near every quest in the game and to every faction in the game as well main factions like the brotherhood act in obvious contradiction to their stated goals in the lore why oh why would they blow up the institute when their prime directive is to hoard technology like kids on halloween hoard candy because blowing stuff up is fun i guess the only explanation you hear from maxson in game is that mutants and synths smell and gotta go don t ask questions the institute never explains how their horrendously immoral experiments mesh with their stated goal of helping humanity and the railroad makes even less sense why tf are untrained humans going to worry about combating a super powerful and highly advanced organization when they are always in threat of starving to death in an apocalyptic world and why would they defend synths despite the robo guys constantly murdering people on the surface the minutemen are really just a vehicle for radiant quests and you d likely enjoy the game more if you just avoided preston garvey and never spoke to him once during the entire game unless you really like radiant quests i could talk about plenty of other things and this review would stretch on for way too long so to sum it up fallout 4 is an adequate sandbox game a pretty damn good shooter and an absolutely abysmal rpg and entry in the fallout series defined by its shallowness as much as by its widespread monetary success not a good sign for fans of the older games if the next fallout game can combine the kind of storytelling seen in new vegas with the combat of fallout 4 we ll be in for a real treat but as of now i m afraid that this series has potentially been irretrievably disconnected from its rpg roots to all of our detriment edit fixed sentence structure allowed comments
