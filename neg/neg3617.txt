2017 early access review used to love this game 16 alpha killed it for me i don t mind the increased zombies i m even okay with resource sources giving less resources not so okay with not being able to make steel until level 40 but it doesn t take too long to get there where i draw the line is this zombies literally spawning inside locked rooms of my base frequently clipped into placed items and boxes my minibike teleporting into a mountain when i get off shop keepers spawning outside of shops telefragging zombies the appear where you are actively standing and insta stun lock you to death pretargetted hordes they ran directly towards me while i was undetected and altered course when i did while still undetected zombies suddenly becomming immune to water effects so few animals i saw not but vulchers for 9 hours zombies that can fall for thousands of feet and not take damage zombies that ignore all forms of player debuffs because players were using that to their advantage to devs listen i get it players were using your mechanics to their advantage and you wanted to add challenge back in cool make spider zombies climb down walls so cliff edges aren t perfect defenses make it so a single inch of water doesn t slow down everything make it take a moat more importantly realize that if a small but vocal portion of the player base does nothing but complain about these tactics remind them that when they are playing they can opt to not use them instead of ruining other player s experiences for the small vocal hardcore group that can t get over other people having fun how they want to when at least most of these are patched i will change my review
