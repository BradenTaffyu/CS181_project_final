2023 well i spent a decent amount of time on the beast not bad of a game for sure however the grinding is just not acceptable it is not the monetization which is the issue imho but rather the time it takes to acquire new cards passed the first 80 or so during your first games you build your deck hence you pretty much get a new card every game played or two after this sort of tutorial you start accumulating new cards but with a much slower pace i e one every 12 collection levels which is kind of fine for those who don t know a collection level can be acquired after playing a few games however passed the pool 2 which is 79 cards this pace slows down like significantly you still get something every 12 collection levels but rarely a new card you got variants avatars credits gold titles etc this makes you earn a card every 60 collection levels or so this in turn equates tons of time and tons of credits and when i say tons this is literally tons you can play hours and hours just to get a crappy card it is not that i am against grinding but this is waaaayyyy too much even farming the most obscure reputation in wow feels a pleasure compared to this after 78 hours of game play i have less than 125 cards out of 300 and my last card acquired was so long ago that i almost forgot i have a very good answer to this uninstall farewell
