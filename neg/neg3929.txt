early access review instead of dedicating time and effort to give evolved some much needed tlc we were instead given a soulless cash grab of a remaster that s barely functional as a long time fan of the franchise who s met countless wonderful people and made many fond memories playing the previous version between the constant issues on a mechanical level and the questionable business decisions by the company this leaves a sour disappointing taste the only reason why i even own this game is to try to help run the unofficial servers i m a part of but even then i can go weeks the longest being an entire month with the game deciding to just stop functioning i ve tried every possible fix this isn t a pc issue my specs are more than capable to run the game and i have to wait until another patch to see if it wants to start running again could never recommended this with a clear conscious do yourself a favour and get evolved instead
