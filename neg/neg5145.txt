2016 they are milking the crap out of this series it s completly disgusting release a full game with only 4 playable factions which cost 60 and then one by one sell additional factions single new faction for 18 99 until you profit this game came out so fast after total war atilla it s like they sold this incomplete half ass d new total war game as a brand new complete title for 60 and the game wasn t actually even complete and they are now just selling bits of the game as they make them for 18 99 truly just makes me sick and it s such bullcrap because i would like to be able to play more than 4 factions lol cuz that gets really old really quick but your out of your f mind if you think i m going to purchase a single one of your b dlc s r i p total war games of old where quality and passion mattered
