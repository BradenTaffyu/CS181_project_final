2023 please support vellmori shd eod on twitter the former cg artist that was unjustly fired after korean incels targeted projectmoon initially over the lack of swimsuit ids for the game only to move onto vellmori as their scapegoat after finding out the former artist was male i believe this was a hasty decision and this reflects on their practice poorly as this would not be the first time kjh has bent the knee for a vocal minority of their audience only this time it sets a horrible precedent for the future going forward that korean incels will feel entitled towards i love this series but i can not financially support it or recommend it to my friends anymore due to this poor decision i hope that proper changes will be made to the company going forward as a lot of personal insight on this situation seems to come down to a breakdown of communication in the pipeline as other outsourced artists have come out with their own story but in the meanwhile as a longtime fan i am disappointed
