2022 skip to the bottom for the short versioni have been excited to play europa iv for probably about 7 years now i saw my friends playing it as early as 2014 2015 from what they told me along with the videos i saw of it i knew it was probably one of the best strategy games out there but it is not a game i would be willing to recommend to the vast majority of people it is a pretty good strategy game all things considered but there are 3 major things that keep me from giving it the thumbs up the pricethis is a given in any review about this game the price of the game plus dlc is a joke i added this to my wishlist around 2017 and every sale that has happened since i would check the price for the complete collection i never once saw it drop below 115 hell over time it has actually gone up on sale to over 120 and i had all but given up hope of ever buying it the only reason i got it at all was the ukranian relief humble bundle deal for 20 that is a great deal but that is the point i am trying to make i watched the deals on this game for 5 years and never once saw it priced reasonably if anyone will get this recommended they will have to wait for the next war in europe to get a fair deal just pay for the subscription it is only 5 a month is a sad joke to me if i want to play a strategy game i want to be able to own it and hop back into it anytime i get the itch not pump another 5 bucks into it for a month i might play on off side note the last half dozen dlc for this game have been mixed or worse on reviews paying a subscription fee for a game that is progressively getting worse is a dark road to go down the tutorial this is the most complex strategy game in terms of different mechanics and depth i have probably ever seen outside of dwarf fortress you might see jokes in other reviews talking about how they finished the tutorial 200 hours in it isn t as funny after you have watched your 4th hour of tutorial vids on youtube or lost your 6th run in a row to something you didn t even know how to proccess paradox has a couple of great tutorials on youtube but that is it they have only 2 videos a pt 1 and pt 2 without any follow up vids on the other several dozen mechanics granted it is due to the content creator being busy there are probably only a few friends i know of that i would recommend this game to knowing the complexity of the mechanics in this game and they already have hundreds thousands of hours in this game already going hollowthis game more than any other strategy game i have played has left me with a hollow feeling upon ending a session or run to me it is a combination of the same or similar starts warscore mechanics and coalitions the end date next part is just my line of reasoning through my game experience my first game i ever really got off the ground i was france i spent a century slowly beating back england to spend the next century fighting north american naitives leviathan dlc bad meme with another century taking down the massive colonies and economy of portugal who owned all of south america as the economic hegemon i was slowly conquering west africa while the military hegemon of the ottomans that i ignored for 3 centuries were conquering east africa i conquered almost all of it and was prepping for the ottoman clash when boom 70 hours of buildup for an end screen i had never felt so cheated in a strategy game from that point on i never wanted to play the game casually to avoid that terrible end it boiled down to playing the best countries i could fighting wars in certain orders constantly and trying to skirt the edge of large coalitions forming realising multiple times i put a few dozen hours into a run that would probably stall out wore me down to the point where i just stopped the point is that if you don t want to be cucked out of an unsatisfying ending you have to play optimally you do the same similar starts with your specific nation or else you won t make it to world conquest unless you are an europa savant a simple example as france you will never avoid the war against england you will always fight the hundred year war and prep for that the warscore coalitions have been created to slow down the pacing of the player which is understandable neat mechnic but has been balanced against the players favor over time you can see this in old guides of world conquest the tediousness of the warscore mechanic combined with the desire not to be forced out of the game before i am finished with it made me apathetic to the gameplay as a whole tldreuropa 4 is an incredibly complex strategy game that i thought i would deeply enjoy and it sucks to not be able to recommend it the price of the game with dlcs is probably the most expensive of any strategy game out there piled on with the fact that so many recent dlc are terrible along with balance changes for them the game takes dozens if not hundreds of hours to master with most of my friends giving up on strategies if they take more than 5 hours to get the core mechanics down it isn t a good recommend even most of my strategy savvy friends wouldn t sit through hours of tutorial vids to get a general grasp for europa the game leaves me personally feeling unsatisfied either trying my heart out to conquer all i can or being forced to meet an end game screen just when things were getting good even if i mod it to allow any timeline it would still leave me with a slow plod through countries forced to only take a certain number of provinces allowed by the warscore system without even the enjoyment of achievements to make any progress meaningful it just grew tiresome for me edit i found a workaround for modding with achievements and a 3rd party program to make ironman games into non ironman games to continue campaigns after 1821 but it is not allowed by the core game files or the base game i will probably play more of this game but the point still stands
