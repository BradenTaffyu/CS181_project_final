2020 i know my review time says 66 hours but believe me i played it a lot more from the external installer i was a war thunder veteran until at least a year ago i grinded through both planes and ground forces up to 5 6 battle rating in all nations here s my reviewthis game is simply said a scam it tries to draw you in under the pretense of fun and historical accuracy the gameplay experience initially delivers the mechanics being nice and fun the vehicles quite detailed the combat being fairly enjoyable but once you start going down the rabbit hole it becomes hell don t think you ll be having fun in this game past early game the grind is insane and cruel only made less awful if you buy outrageously priced microtransactions that will drain you dry most new updates only add premiums or super top tier vehicles that you ll never get to unless you sink in an unholy amount of hours and money tons of fun vehicles are locked behind absurd paywalls 60 for one vehicle in the store some vehicles in the marketplace can go for thousands of dollars and the event vehicles are not any better events used to be fun but they ve been slowly but steadily increasing the difficulty to the point where an event just means your new job became playing war thunder for a whole week non stop unless you wanna pay 60 bucks to skip the grind it s not even fun and challenging it s just tedious and infuriatingthis company doesn t care about the players or historical accuracy or gameplay or fun or integrity they promised the game wouldnt go past ww2 long ago they broke that after they saw the money that they could get by increasing the grind there s bugs and glitches and features that the community has been asking to add or fix for ages but all are turned down in favor of more grind more events more premium vehicles and of course there s no way to play for fun custom battles are super limited you can only play the vehicles you grinded so unless you just wanna play with the starter tanks you re gonna have to grind your ass off in an extremely hard infuriating and unrewarding progression in a game where every single possible thing needs to be grinded or bought or boththe simulator mode battles which this game pretty much keeps to be able to boast about being an online sim are pretty much just a much more tedious realistic battles with the camera stuck in first person in the planes and in the tanks literally on top of the turret these lazy people didn t even bother making interiors for tanks because who cares about an actual simulator experience am i right they ve long been abandoned and are super limited in what and when you can play them lots of times even if you try you wont be able to get into one if you dont have the right vehicles grinded out and they re tedious and dont offer anything new anywayanother awful factor that contributes to this is the community super competitive and often toxic they ll also defend the game from any criticism regardless of if it s fair and will throw attacks at you instead about how you should git gud there s also lots of drama and hate in public matches which you ll spend most of your time on since you dont earn xp in private lobbies god forbid people actually enjoying the progression or gasp skipping it progression was originally concieved to make games rewarding in this game it s just a method to make you suffer until you pay uptruth is if a game isn t enjoyable it s not good and war thunder will lure you in appear to be enjoyable for a bit and then slowly turn up the heat until you re the this is fine meme suffering through countless hours of ginding and barely having any amount of fun free to play pay to enjoyif ea pulled any of this they d be completely shunned and attacked into the ground but since this is a niche freeeeeee to plaaaaaaaaaaaaay title they sneak under the radar with these absolutely abusive mechanics with little to no criticism or backlasheven if you go the paying route and say ok i m just gonna pay my way into having fun good luck you won t each decent tank costs the same as a whole aaa title and you can sink hundreds into the grind and barely get anywheredo yourself a favor if you havent played it yet and run go to another game which is actually designed to be fun and not to scam you and if you re a war thunder veteran for the love of god do yourself a favor and quit this game will do you no good your time is better spent elsewhere it took me years to get disillussioned with this game and actually quit but i m a lot happier after the initial withdrawal with lots of better games to spend my time inanother tank game will come along eventually scams like war thunder and world of tanks won t be the only option
