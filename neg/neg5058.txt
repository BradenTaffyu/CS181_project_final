2020 to quote happy gilmore the price is wrong b tch i liked this game and i did enjoy playing for the one campaign i played when i first bought it since then it s sat in my steam library and i haven t ever felt the urge to revisit it much of the bitter taste is from creative assembly sega s business practices when it comes to the total war series as of late i am a big fan of total war and i love the concept merging turn based grand strategy while you manage your realm with real time strategy battle segments where you command and manage your troops on a massive scale is genius the idea of putting the series in a one off fantasy setting into the warhammer universe is also genius but unfortunately around the time of rome 2 creative assembly decided to really change around how cities are developed managed and really bogged down much of the gameplay so that while still fun slows down the campaign time in a series where the campaigns were already crazy dragged out more so than this around the time of rome 2 creative assembly also began the practice of never ever dropping non sale pricing limiting sales in terms of percentage off and locking the vast majority of game content behind ludicrously high and numerous dlc paywalls there s been dlc before for sure but it was more reasonably priced to begin with they further dropped the price when the games became older and had typical steam sales so it was never that unreasonable even then they would start you off with the majority of the factions to play as so what you get now when you buy a total war game made after 2013 is a bogged down bloated overpriced shell of essentially 40 of the full game be prepared to pay a king s ransom i really do think you re better off playing the much more reasonably priced shogun 2 my personal favorite it really does suck because i d love to play this series more but it just feels off i really disagree with how creative assembly and sega have been managing this series
