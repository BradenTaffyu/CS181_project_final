2023 imagine this you are a grown up man working a 9 to 18 job you get home at 19 30pm have dinner and you sit down to to play for no longer than an hour the only historically accurate war video game you can afford that covers your love for both russian and german engineering for a little bit before going to bed after 340 hours of game play i found out the only way to enjoy this game is by playing research vehicles or up to tier 2 anything besides that gets either to expensive to repair or requires an absurd amount of time to unlock time that i obviously don t have every day that goes by i feel like this game is being changed so the user player has to use a credit card to feel accomplished on the battlefield this game started as a beautiful free to play where we had fun no matter the outcome of the match sadly those game are long gone just as a radkampfwagen 90 once the match starts punishing the user even by doing good while playing it s not okay it s quite hard to say this but i feel disappointed by the gaijin entertainment producers team for the user reading this review don t get yourself fooled by the free to play tag invest your time in something else thanks you for reading regards kps yes i used some of my free time i use to play to write this review
