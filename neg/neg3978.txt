2020 edited to reflect progress i ll admit it iracing is finally getting it right the current tire and damage model is so much better than when i wrote my original review i m actually shocked that they have progressed so positively granted there are a few things that still need sorted the issues that still stand out are the incident points system although i don t know what they can do to fix it and the vehicle physics on grass cars are still generally uncontrollable once off the racing surface lack of grip is understandable to a degree but not zero grip iracing doesn t have wet weather therefor the grass should reflect that otherwise they ve made good progress original review do you like racing then move along do you like ice skating you do then this is the sim for you the road racing tire model is laughable at best why because you re either going to do one of two things when you drive this sim get angry or laugh at how ridiculously inaccurate the tire model is iracing owns the multiplayer market there s no doubt about it but there are so many better sims out there if you appreciate realism acc and rf2 for starters try those first
