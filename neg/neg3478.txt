i have been playing this game for a short while now and it s clear to me this game shouldn t have been released yet or at least should have been released as an early access title this game is full of bugs unbalanced it s not even feature complete and the improved graphics are underwhelming at best imho and now they have shared the statement that these much needed fixes will be incorporated in new to be released dlc s so not anytime soon and with this the devs seem to care more about selling dlc s than releasing a finished game in the first place don t get me wrong i love this game and it has some nice improvements but the price they ask for this game in its current state is insane if you want to play an amazing city builder play the first part of cities skyline it s way cheaper more stable and actually has content just keep this game on your wish list and only buy it after a few patches or when it s on special offer
