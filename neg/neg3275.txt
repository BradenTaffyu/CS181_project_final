2017 as much as i would like to recommend this game i simply cannot the game in its current state does not deserve a recommendation and that is really sad for me a great fan and loyal customer of paradox hoi iv at the start looks amazing graphics is beautiful ui is pleasant and well arranged gameplay seems to be a little complicated but most players should have a feeling that they will get into it and they will soon manage the mechanics and will understand what to do and the game will be rewarding howeverunlike other games like crusader kings 2 or europa universalis iv the mechanics won t expand further and you will notice very soon that your actions are very limitied there is literally no diplomacy at all all you can do by diplomatic relations is some mil access influencing others by your ideology staging a coup and making an alliance and that s it is for a 2nd ww game when the war starts you will do some cool battle plans although later on you will realize that they are not working as you woud love to and all they do is a bonus for your troops so then you will usually drag one long battle plan arrow and that s it the game is repetetive unlike in eu iv in my opinion where you have different conditions with each nation many achievements religion etc here in hoi iv you always do the same start with same techs in 90 produce same units build few buildings which are usuallyonly civ mil factories and i could go on you might have fun at the start when you try different regimes fascist communists and democrats but after some time you will realize the differences are minor terrible horrible incredibly stupid ai i played a lot of ck2 eu iv and i must say that ai here in hoi iv compared to the games mentioned is terrible thanks to that any singleplayer campaign is not challenge at all ai fails at everything from building proper units buildings securing their borders evaluating the danger fighting wars using their planes and navy naval invasions is something that probably should not be in this game because when you pick albania which is later annexed by italy via event if you pick albania and refuse their annexation italy will fail to defeat your 2 provinces with 150 divisions when you will have 6 8 150 vs 8 divisions fail that is an incredible example of how the ai is horrible any major you pick gb ger ussr usa etc means no challenge you can win the game in few years just steamroll everyone cause the game is hilariously easy if you decide to pick a hardest nation in the game which should be imo ethiopia cause they start at war with italy and they are being conquered again 100 150 divisions vs ur 10 divisions you will defeat them yes as ethiopia you are going to defeat italy because they are unable to defeat you with more troops on your land and because there are no peace deals only if you conquer everyone you will be at war as ethiopia many years even though italy won t be able to naval invade you and they will fail every attempt of conquering you i ve read somewhere that someone s said that the ai is challenging trust me i am not any amazing strategist nor strategy player but in this game there is no challenge at all my last game as spain i conquered france in 4 months after the beginning of the ww and so in 1939 we had nothing to do axis all we could do was spamming ships planes to invade england later but that was it as i ve said already the game does look amazingly at the start i was convinced hoi iv will be amazing and great game maybe the best and so i pre ordered it for 90 euros after 20 hours i realized how wrong i was it has been nine months after the release of this game and nothing has changed really there is one dlc with interesting focus trees but all in all it adds mechanics and stuff that should be in a base game already and is in other games pdx have eu ck i love paradox i love ck eu iv but hoi iv is a great disappointment
