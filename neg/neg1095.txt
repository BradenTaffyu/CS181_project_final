2017 i loved this game or that is i used to the creation club adds microtransactions that were never said to be in the game i preordered the game when it came out along with the season pass because i was excited for future content as it turns out most of the dlc was poorly done anyway then the creation club launched and expects you to give bethesda more money even after you paid for future content through the season pass so it gets a negative reviewedit i am not into vr but the fact that fallout 4 vr is another 60 pisses me off it kind of seems like something that the season pass should have covered
