2019 i really never write reviews be it for products or games but i feel that with over 300 hours in both civ 6 and civ 5 i ve got enough experience to produce a relavent review i ve tried so hard to love this game from day one my old computer couldn t run it when it came out and i bought a new one specifically to play this game i ve loved the civ games ever since 3 so it pains me to give a game i ve put so much time into a negative review civ 6 just isn t up to par with the past games whether it be the maddening ai the unintuitive tech tree the cartoony graphics or the lack of quality mods in comparison with civ v though vi has gotten better it s just a lesser quality game to previous installments so many useful features are just gone this game has had 3 years to fix it s glaring issues that were pointed out on day one and none have ever been truly addressed the excuse then was well it took v a while to work out the kinks but that excuse doesn t fly anymore i can t reccomend this game only because you can go and buy a better more polished civ game for far cheaper with all dlc do yourself a favor and buy civ 5 today
