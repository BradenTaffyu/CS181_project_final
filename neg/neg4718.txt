i m torn between recommending this game and not recommending it if you re a person who doesn t care about getting achievements 100 ing your games then i think this is a great game and there s enough free content to keep you satisfied there is nothing wrong with the gameplay and it s updated quite frequently with additional content definitely worth the money for the base game however for achievement hunters this game is a nightmare they only release new achievements for the paid content meaning that every couple of months you get paywalled out of your perfect game and have to pay 8 dollars to go get like 10 achievements from 3 4 maps that you might not even be interested in going by the 2024 road map you ll pretty much have to pay for the base game a second time 3 dlcs 7 99 a piece if you want to keep it 100 i love this game it s really fun and it has a dev team that consistently puts out content for the game but the paid dlcs are overpriced and you re essentially strong armed into buying them if you want to keep it on your perfect game list
