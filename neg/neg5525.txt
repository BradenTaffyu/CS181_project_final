2015 the game looks nice and all but the battles are not as fun as previous total war games such as the original rome or shogun 2 each battle in rome 2 looks like a huge cluster and it looks like that nothing is happening in rome 1 the battles had some realism in it you could see the soldiers pushing each other and ganging up on a soldier but in rome 2 the soldiers stand still fighting 1 on 1 until the unit routes the siege and naval battles are pretty but the ai in the game has been improved by a lot after the many patches to the game only buy this game when it s on sale not worth full price
