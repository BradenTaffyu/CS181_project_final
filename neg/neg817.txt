2021 i ll admit i ve had a decent amount of fun from this game and technically it could be said to be worth the price for the hours i put in but the setup and changes i needed to do for what seemed like basic functions the lack of a default esp manager in the standard launcher and the general poor writing and lazy feeling of quite a lot of the game makes this a probably don t unless it s heavily on sale much like skyrim i only really enjoyed this game as much as i did due to the talented modding community around it rather than the core game itself unlike skyrim significantly more of that core game seems to hinder the efforts of that modding community
