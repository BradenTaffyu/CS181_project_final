2015 i m very much split when it comes to warthunder now and it s management i was a late player to the scene i didn t start playing war thunder until a couple of months ago it was such a fun experience and i would play constantly at first things didn t seem so bad but then i got a glimpse of what the veteran wt players were so upset about the system that they use for research is designed to make you spend all your money at first i was unlocking things at a pretty decent rate now it s like i hit a brick wall and the only way to get past it is to pay real money to use the experience that i have already earned look gajian i m not a game programmer or some sort of buisness man but you guys are really dropping the ball want to know how to bring people back to your game here are 3 ways 1 hire moderators and curators who actually have respect for both new and old players based on some of the evidence brought forth by other people your moderators are incredibly rude and drunk with the power of the banhammer 2 i understand that free to play games need to be set up in a way so that it is still profitable but that doesn t mean charging premium currency for as much as you can get away 500 golden eagles to buy a national flag for your tank plane is beyond the realm of reasonable 3 i really shouldn t have to even say this but listen to your players constructive critisism sucks but it is better to learn from it then to ignore the advice do what you guys want and say screw you to the plebs and to your own game in conclusion war thunder is a terrific game it has features and gameplay that no other game has been able to repeat the problem with that is if a company knows there is no real competition gajian they are free to charge what they want for whatever they want don t get me wrong i will still play warthunder from time to time but i won t be dropping another cent on this game when it comes to scuzzy business tactics i don t have much empathy for a company if you plan on playing this here and there then disregard my review if however you are someone who really wants to get into this game be warned that you will be required to spend money unless you re cool playing 3000 hours to unlock things naturally and don t mind having only a few crew slots
