2022 i spent a summer playing this game a fair bit i gave it on honest chance after the big overhaul with voiced npc ect my honest opinion of things the game did right are here quests dialogue more well done than 4 but come nowhere near 3 or nv waring over large resource workshops felt great made the world feel more alive community is very welcoming helpful never once had a bad interaction with another player most people don t have voice chat enabled but even just emoting and dropping supplies for newer players was a common sight c a m p system well implemented allowing you to have your own personal fort with friends server wide massive boss monstershowever my gripes with the game kept accumulating in the following bugs a massive amount still some requiring you to straight up alt f4 storage limit this is where the transactions really come into play despite having a large section of the game being centered around crafting building you are given a limit on how much you can store you can pay a very hefty 15 usd a month to get unlimited scrap storage however that is all you can store is scrap what else does this hefty fee give you an allowance of cosmetic currancey and the ncr ranger outfit from fnv the ncr that hasnt even been made yet updates the game surprisingly has had lots of updates and as nice as more content has been they are all essentially daily grind fests with little to no thought put into dialogue lore or quest lines pick this up if you and some friends that have never played but want a short fun story to progress through before reaching the grindy hollow end game do not pick this up if you want an fps mmo you care about fallout lore at all or you want another fallout game pick up destiny replay new vegas with mods or play outer worlds
