2023 60 for a modernized company of heroes ii the game is just bare bones just not worth the full price sadly cons new campaign total war style is too repetitive cinematic campaign is just average not enough multiplayer maps missing diversity inside each faction we should have more doctrines explosion animations are really not good voice over for the germans is a terrible choice en vo with de accent what i can forgive is the balancing as it is quite usual for rts at launch but the rest selling it for 59 99 it hurts man
