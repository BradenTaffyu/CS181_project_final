2018 stellaris just had a big update from 2 1 to 2 2 before the update i loved the game and played a ton it was exciting well balanced 4x space combat and empire building with a hard sci fi vibe however the update added an absolutely insane level of micro management changing simple well balanced systems to screen after screen of little icons and text and more than doubling the number of resources which are produced by multiple systems reliant on each other in different ways it is a total mess and has killed the game for my whole group you spend your whole game trying to remember what types of pops produce what resource from working in what building to satisfy what need instead of zooming around blowing stuff up completing events or colonising planets
