2020 i have 249 hours in this game and until 2 days ago i would have given it a thumbs up unquestionably if you re a fan of the previous 3d fallout games this is more of the same in a more colorful world but this week fallout 76 introduced a new wrinkle one wasteland which is marketing speak for level scaling the idea of level scaling is that as your character grows in power so do your enemies if you enjoyed the power trip of leveling up and going back to pummel the tar out of those stupid mole rats that used to pop out and harass you well sorry now those stupid mole rats are level 77 and soak up five shots apiece from your triple legendary weapons the net result is you end up using a lot more ammo and a lot more health not to mention a lot more time with no corresponding increase in the rate you acquire them quick hulk smash combats with throwaway enemies are now drawn out matters of life or death they took a pretty fun game and with a single update made it ten times more tedious there s no way to opt out of it either it s a pity
