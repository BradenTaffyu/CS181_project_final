2023 the games broken and i don t think the devs intend to fix it the games not finished it it was in early access for a few years and officially released with little to no change from ea they do patches which mostly covers crashes but the core mechanics are what eventually makes the game tedious and strenuous you d think your hard work ll eventually pay off it wont a lot of the mechanics used don t work in your favour once you get to end game regardless of how small ai clans are they can still fund armies and they tend to respawn with troops even if they have no fiefs and if they make no income somehow they ll even afford to pay for mercs even if the ai doesn t have fiefs the clan doesn t disband or defect to another kingdom they ll continue to assault your villages as well to no end you re punished if you don t kill persistent lords nobles and your e punished more severely if you do everyone in calradia and their auntie knows you executed someone and hates you for it making the very little social aspects of the game more difficult than they already are difficulty aint even the word just janky the rng is abysmal to boot marriages and vassals cost a large fortune and almost impossible to get without large capital wars dont make any sense you can be winning by a large margin but you have to pay for peace regardless of if youre winning or losing and it tends to be again a large sum kingdoms will wage war with you at random even if they have absolutely no chance of defeating you diplomacy what s that you have two options start war or make peace nothing else if you start a war just know it wont end not without you paying a tribute youre single handedly funding the war and peacetime almost inescapable the game is akin to bethesda s elder scroll games the coding and mechanics are cheap so they end up relying on the community and modders to keep the game functional just to break or corrupt your saves with a future update patch bro play anything elseif you want 3rd person medieval experience with close combat mordhau or kingdom come want to wage war and lead armies or war sim crusader kings europa unversalis total war pretty much any of them but i recommend three kingdoms personally
