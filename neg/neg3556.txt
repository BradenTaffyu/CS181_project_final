2023 early access review is this game worth recommending to other players in its current state no it s so extremely buggy at times unplayable the lag is crazy you cannot run this game on anything above the lowest settings otherwise your pc will fry you need to use the console to lower your settings further turning off shadows clouds ect just to get 60 fps but don t worry you ll crash multiple times in an hour anyway due to fatal errors i m honestly in disbelief the state this game was launched in and the updates barely help i m posting this review shortly after the announcement they ve made about scorched not coming out until march even though it was promised on launch aswell as letting us know that there are these new dlcs for our dlcs that you have to pay extra for to get skins engrams and the new dinos that come with the dlc maps that were originally free i m not sure how many times studio wildcard is going to go back on their word or delay releases but surely it s a record at this point they somehow managed to sell us the same game that runs and squeeze more money out of us for the only new content new dinos and push it back to up to 2 years release at this stage don t buy the game it s not worth it right now just wait until there are enough updates fixes and hopefully enough of our voices to stop this dlc paytowin ontop of dlc ontop of remake is aborted granted if asa somehow changes my mind and i think its worth recommending i ll gladly update this review
