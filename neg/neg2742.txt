2017 got it when it came out felt like an early access game really bad ai kind of poor mechanics very poorly explained tooltips largely a struggle to learn and by the time i learned it it was no fun anymore stuck around the first few months and tried some of the initial patching that made the game slightly more bearable still a major let down i wanted to give it some time to mature before actually reviewing it fast foreward 1 year and 3 months the game has been heavily patched and reworked as well as more filled out via dlc unfortunately you re expected to own all dlc to play because mechanics from those dlc creep into the vanilla game but only parts of them for the full power of those mechanics you need to buy and enable the dlc the big problem is that parts of the vanilla game has been balanced into those dlc features so you cannot enjoy the game without the dlc because some portion of the game mechanics are essentially behind a pay wall it feels like ck2 all over again each new dlc adds new features which really just reworks old features or expands them into their own frankenstein to be micromanaged and you re going to get the dlc play style whether you buy it or not but to encourage buying it paradox makes a few choice features only available if you buy and enable it edit i don t play this game multiplayer nor do i have any interest in doing so so anything i should be thankful for in that category is moot
