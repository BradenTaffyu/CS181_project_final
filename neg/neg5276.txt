2023 seems like troy 2 0 the tw game i liked the least no stupid cloak skirmishers destroying the enemy walking by like in troy at least i lost weirdly my 1st campaign at legendary because i cannot finish or move armies with no access to the event tab either sad i had a great start talking about a great start even if i am a tw vet since shogun i thought it was fairly easy as i had most legitimacy 1 turn before becoming pharaoh at turn 45 with over 100 legitimacy sad i cannot move my armies anymore and finish my turn because i was on a roll and about to become pharaoh i was playing the kushite clan in the south led by amenmesse it looks easy to become pharaoh playing max level in 1st campaign difficulty seems easy for legendary level a level that has gone for battle that stops at veteran now maybe another level of battle would have been nice considering beating the ai is fairly easy so far i just started a new campaign with the girl only a few turns in but so far so good i hope i do not end up getting stuck later like in my 1st campaign by not being able to move armies anymore and finish my turn after a battle the economy and trade is a joke like in troy ai is trading away key resources to potential opponents instead of letting them cripple example i need food badly to support my armies and used to get 4k of food per turn from other clans including those who compete for the pharaoh title against me lol economy broken just like in troy ai playing a bit better with invasions and a few good calculated moves but othwerwise nothing too crazy or overly smart battles are fun even if i did not used many unit types yet not sure i would recommend it and like another user has written very few people asked for a period like ancient egypt for the next tw game thousands have asked for tw med3 and by incorporating some of the gameplay of ck3 it could be an epic game instead they went for this one arcadic type tw game like troy and troy was a disaster unlike troy though i did not get it for free so for over 100 pre ordering this game i feel like a fool atm i might just go back to rome 2 with the great mod in 3 parts divide et impera and keep trying to win a long campaign with carthage or something this mod is so hard and fun i would suggest to wait for some updates and perhaps a sale to get tw pharaoh coming from a long time tw lover
