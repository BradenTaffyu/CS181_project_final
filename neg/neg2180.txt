2016 i like this game rather i really want to like this game there are a crazy ammount of problems that i have with it most of them being already listed in the most liked sections of the reviews pros awesome simulationawesome combat awesome tanks and planescons toxic communitytroll developersterrible balance issuesterrible pricing clipping issueshellish grindcheating fairly prevalent afkers and bots galore honestly this could be the best wwii simulation battle game of all time but it s too unbalanced to remain fun if you do start playing i reccomend not buying anything in the way of booster packs premium memberships or premium tanks as they are all what i consider to be fairly overpriced
