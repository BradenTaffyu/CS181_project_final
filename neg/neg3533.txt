2022 i didn t really know how i felt about writing a review until i two starred croquembouche and saw cure 1 000 patients pop up for the last star it s the little things that bring the game down for me curing 1 000 patients takes forever even with fast forward on and a 90 cure rate and i could forgive that if i could set up the hospital and walk away but you can t because the end of year awards that i don t care about and can t turn off will pause the game if not that a pandemic alert and it s not that pandemics are inherently bad but there are only two of them and you can ignore them entirely to basically no penalty honestly once i ran out of new diseases about halfway through the base game i realized i was only finishing the game because i knew i could and not because i wanted to i ve spent most of my 90 ish hours watching youtube or on my phone just waiting for objectives to finish
