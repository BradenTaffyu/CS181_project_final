2018 i feel bad giving this a do not reccomend reaction since i have played it for a very long time and i do genuinely like it in many ways but of the two options steam gives me the more negative one fits better i d still say the game is worth picking up if you like action rpgs but i have too many problems with it to say it is really a good game if there was a mixed option i d select it i m saying do not reccomend because it best fits the tone of my review which is largely negative and the two options steam give are pretty dumb with that in mind take the do not reccomend more as a general negative response than a literal lack of reccomendation the good the game looks nice in my opinion its not photorealistic but it has a nice stylistic approach that really fits the retro futiristic design there s a few visual bugs or murky graphics but overall its pretty nice the comanion system is very nice and really makes the companions feel like real characters who actually pay attention to your actions its a better system than the infamously buggy new vegas companion system and means that you can never miss out on companion quests by accidentally going too far forwards the power armour is fantastic a massive improvement over fallout 3 and new vegas rather than an item of clothing its an enitrely seperate mechanic and it feels amazing the gunplay combat is also a general improvement over previous fallout games and feels pretty nice still kinda clunky but much better than 3 nv building is meh some people may like it i thought it was kinda fun but too buggy and frustrating to be truly enjoyable the bad rpg mechanics by far the worst element of fallout 4 is its stripping down of the rpg mechanics that made new vegas so good your character is already heavily railroaded before you can even play them before even creating your character their backstory relationships and everything else that goes into creating a character are already written out its really a terrible choice and i never felt like i was playing my character compounding this problem are the changes to dialogue rather than the list of dialogue options written out in full with what your character will say you have a wheel with 4 options ala mass effect worse these options are very vague in their description and totally lack consistency sometimes sarcastic will be a light hearted joke and sometimes it will be a fairly mean spirited put down the only way to find out is to select that option which kinda sucks one particularly unwelcome return from fallout 3 is the chance based speech checks seriously these are just stupid it doesn t reward the player much for taking speech charisma options since its just luck based you can go heavy in charisma and miss an important check or go nothing into charisma and get lucky its an incredibly dumb way to have a speech mechanic and absolutely pales compared to new vegas skill based dialogue options the second major dialogue problem is that they are spoken outloud by your character while the voice acting for both a male and female courier is actually pretty good across the board its still a bad addition it along with the railroaded character design process mean that fallout 4 feels like a game where you play bethesda s character not yours skills being removed and the rework to perks are both bad i can appreciate them trying something new but it didn t really work out and means every character largely feels the same rather than older fallouts where you would get better at certain skills as you level up forcing you to ration out your points and prioritise what is most important in fallout 4 its just waiting till you are a high enough level to take perks with the only governing stats being your special scores which you can also increase from levelling up story writing and worldbuilding the other major problem with fallout 4 tying into the lack of rpg mechanics is the world it inhabits and the stories it gives to you much like fallout new vegas fallout 4 offers you 4 major endings to the game unlike fallout new vegas there are no minor factions of any importance whatsoever in f nv many factions were tied in with how you played the game finishing the game in one ending would have drastically different actions for minor factions than with the others even if you followed the same path these factions are all extremely memerable they all impact the major factions and even each other fallout 4 has none like this literally 0 minor factions of note the few discernable factions have no real bearing on the world no real impact ultimately the problem with fallout 4 is that the world just feels empty sure its filled with pretty locations and in parts it can be fantastic there is some brilliant environmental storytelling that you have to find on your own and at moments like that fallout 4 felt like a truly brilliant fallout game but for most of the game the world was bland pretty locations inhabited by boring generic people no faction other than the main 4 ever have a major impact on the story or the world of fallout 4 because of this despite the fun i often had exploring and playing i can t say i think fallout 4 is a very good game in its genre its not a terrible game but its definitely a step back in many ways from fallout new vegas and removes many of the things from fallout that make it good
