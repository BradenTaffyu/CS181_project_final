2020 at long last i can finally say with confidence that this game has actually broken me if you want to know why then i have a plethora of reasons in this review when i first joined in 2015 the game was very enjoyable fast paced fun and all around a good experience i began to make my way through tier 1 and into tier 2 but that s where the problems started around 2016 i felt as though i made almost no progress through the tech tree on any nation i thought to myself maybe i m just bad at the game i ll try to get better and so i did just that playing custom battles and trying out rb for the first time still i made next to no progress i started to just play every now and then as i realized that the pathetic amount of progress i made after every round was not really doing anything for me except for burning me out and making me want to try something different about a month later i returned to the game with a clear mindset i started making progress again and wanting to be more involved however i ran into the same problem of feeling burnt out fast forward to 2017 and i really haven t played much for the past months the strain of endlessly grinding got to me and i simply didn t want to play much anymore i simply wanted to get a jet that was my goal from the day i got war thunder but with each update the addition of new vehicles ahead of me pushed that goal further and further away at this point i started to learn more about the games mechanics rp gain and anything i thought would change the state of endless grind i was trapped in as i know now this didn t change anything but at the time i was so desperate for a raise in morale that i tried convincing myself that i was gaining progress i didn t want to admit that i probably would never get a jet now it s 2018 i am still playing and i learn about the chronicles event i decided that i wanted to participate so i set a notification on my calendar for when it would most likely begin however before then i subconsciously started to realize that i simply wasn t having fun anymore with the game i stopped playing and i didn t even bat an eye when my phone notified me of the chronicles event fast forward to late 2019 and i decide that i want to try war thunder again i got a new gaming laptop and i got war thunder on steam by now i had about 1000 hours on war thunder before this but i didn t have it on steam yet i tried playing the game again and i finally broke tier 3 on the us tree however entering 2020 i started to ask myself do i really want to play this game i have spent 5 years grinding and i m not even halfway to getting a jet is this really what i want to spend a sizable portion of my life on do i really want to keep chasing this goal that kept getting further and further away hoping that it will all get better soon so i started pondering that question every day and the answer was a simple no and most of the community agreed i started to realize that the game was cleverly designed to force you to spend money to escape from the grind and turns out i fell for it i bought golden eagles in hopes that i could use them to end this never ending cycle but they didn t i turned towards their website seeing that they refused to respond politely to people who had the same question as me for example on the news page for operation f r o s t someone pointed out that the event was grindier than previous ones to which an admin responded saying that the rewards this time are much greater than previously but that doesn t make any sense when you realize that most rewards were still quite low tier then i turned to steam to see the reviews and the response from the developers revealed that they didn t care in the slightest most times people complain about this they get a copy and paste response from a dev saying that they should go to the forums but the thing is it s a f cking review a review doesn t matter where you post it you should be able to respond to genuine issues regardless of where it s posted and this brings me to my last point it is now that i realize just how greedy gaijin is i have seen all i need to see and i no longer want to associate with this game or the company that made it if a dev sees this then please read this carefully grind only drives players away from this game if you want to make money forcing them to pay up to skip the grind is not the best solution if you want them to enjoy the game and spend money on it offer them a good experience that they actually want to keep and to support so please fix the grind and now i have resigned from war thunder it is no longer worth the pain it brings me to keep playing farewell everyone and have a good day hopefully gaijin will see the error of their ways and war thunder will be great again
