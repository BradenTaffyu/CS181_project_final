2017 not only is the game an embarrassment to earlier fallout titles it s now become a platform for bethesda to embarrass themselves i ve uninstalled this turd and have no intention of downloading it again until it s not plagued with that disgusting creation club which we all know isn t going to go away go buy new vegas or fallout 1 and 2 instead
