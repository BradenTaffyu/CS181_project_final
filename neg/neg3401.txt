to be upfront i have only reviewed this game now due to their first press release of the year i have complaints with the game in general itself among other things but the biggest thing i cannot excuse is how the devs repaid their loyal customers cs1 was a near masterpiece and outside of good game development the devs were loyal and friendly to their customers cs was the only game i can think of for a long time where buying dlc while costly at times was hardly a second thought because it both added content and was repayment for how much respect we as customers had for them cs2 totally flatfaced most of us i bought cs2 not too early after release and expected what something between what was written about it and what i saw in cs1 i quit playing 10 minutes in when my graphics were all over the place didn t work half the time and when they did i felt like they stepped down considerably from cs1 after a number of updates i played again after hearing it s better quality wise my honest opinion on cs2 is it s not only unfinished in many areas but in places the game has taken a one step forward two steps back approach like special industrial zones changing and how they did was nice but it felt off the mark in other places like with how unnatural the zones are and how not many people can even occupy that site as a job and of course cs is a traffic heavy game but cs2 traffic ai is beyond broken as even with perfect road design you will always see cars paralyzed by excessive yielding and cars wanting to turn into a turning lane so they can turn out of it at the next traffic light and god help you if you don t yield to their wanton desires overall there s a lot of stuff that should be in the game that isn t stuff from the old game that should be like what happened to designing intersections with stop signs in the game and buggy issues that have yet to be fixed and with a game so close to modders you d think day one there d be mod support there are mods right now that could be here on steam that have fixed a lot of the issues mentioned but aren t here because the devs have spent their time doing whatever it is at the end of the day i can at least move on and forgive knowing these devs since their track record with cs1 was great but since cs2 the devs have seriously not only let down their fans but outright betrayed them and now they ve gone full out blame game by accusing the fans their loyal customers of being toxic they suggest just making honest critiques and making suggestions but then ban or delete anyone who makes them in the game s related forums for being toxic i was originally waiting to see if they would fix more with the game before i left a review of any kind but after seeing this latest toxicity accusation against us i decided to join others who ve left negative reviews in order to show the devs we don t appreciate being missled and gaslit about a game they should have had no issue releasing in the first place i will only swap my recommendation if they apologize and fix the game seriously from now on until then i will continue to play since i have the game but i will not buy anything else from this devs like dlc until they change their ways
