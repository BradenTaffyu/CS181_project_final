2018 bought this game when it was still a pretty amazing experience not that the base game itself was that good but at least it was a good platform where mods really made it an amazing game i loved controlling massive fleets of carriers supercarriers dreadnaughts and more to fight incredibly powerfull oponents in spacebattles that no other game could offer since the game has dumbed down the options for building ships restricted everything that made space combat fun removed ftl in favor of a liniar hyperlane map and now they re planning on removing the whole planet mechanic with tiles too in order to dumb it down into a symple eco page probably going to keep making it less enjoyable and then offer dlc for people to get half the lost experience back making the base game unplayable just like they did with eu iv up till now i d have recommended the game but if you read this don t bother go find a diffrent game because stellaris won t be worth it for the amount of money you ll need to pay to get a decent game in the near future update paying for 10 dlc s more and years of updates the game is alright now i quess the competitive scene is alright and it can be played casual with friends its not great but its playable
