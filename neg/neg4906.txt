2022 a truly wonderful game well made and a great adaptation of three kingdoms i totally recommend it if you like total war and or three kingdoms stuff only thing that really pisses me off about this game is the pricing for 60 dollars you can get 30 percent of the full game and only 1 out of several time lines then theres like 20 dlcs for like 10 dollars each if your rich give it a try and you probably wont regret it garbage marketing design take a look around 60 is supposed to be a full game not 20 30 percent the stupid dlc s barely add anything
