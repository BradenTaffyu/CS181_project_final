2016 hearts of iron 4 is a strange game it has many good and bad elements to it but ultimately it leads me to not recommend the game honestly simplification isn t necessarily a bad thing and hoi4 did this in many good ways some of the complexity of hearts of iron 3 was just confusing and unexplained ui hoi4 s ui is relatively clean and easy to use with the exception of the air menu being clunky as hell but not necessarily confusing but other than that my experience with the ui has been good the graphics and artistic direction of the game however i m mixed on i was originally against the combined map style that combined terrain and political map modes however i ve gotten used to it but it would be nice to have the option stellaris i ve heard has the same problem in this regard which is complete lack of map modes there isn t even a vp victory point map mode which i feel is sort of critical the game also suffers from spam lots and lots of spam you ll hear constant noises once the world war kicks of and have constant alerts about naval and air combats it is very annoying i have no idea how this got past testing maybe it only annoys me but i can t understand how anyone deals with it also something that is actually more complex than hoi3 is the production and logistics now you actually have to set production lines for various equipment tanks infantry equipment trucks etc you can also make variants of said equipment for better performance or specialty use you make this equipment by setting up production lines and assigning factories so you can produce very little of a specialty item but mass produce a cheap item very easily also these production lines use resources but these resources don t matter because units don t consume them they re only used in the initial creation of the equipment and that s it you can have little oil and still make tanks but at a slower pace you can literally have zero oil in your country and not be importing any what so ever and it won t affect your already existing tanks at all this makes no sense as the axis alliance with romania ploiesti and their push to the caucasus baku was caused entirely by the need for oil to fuel their industries and also their armies you will never face a crisis to get fuel for your army or a need to make an urgent push towards oil refineries because your already existing tanks take no fuel maintenance it can be argued that resources are important which they are but it s greatly diminished however your factories are very important without factories you can t produce anything not even basic equipment for your armies your production can be hindered in a number of ways such as capture of factories or damage due to strategic bombing so you need to keep at least some aircraft in reserve or at the home front to intercept enemy bombers to not have less factories or you would have less if the ai was there the ai doesn t seem very good and i m not saying this as some sort of mastermind strategist i only have 90 hours in hoi3 and never completed barbarossa but when in my first attempt i defeated the soviet union as germany i didn t feel any sense of accomplishment for me it was literally draw a line and win i drew a line in the battle planner and let the divisions go i could ve had less casaulties and maybe did it faster if i had controlled my divisions manually but i feel the game is way too easy if i can literally set one line for barbarossa and win that and when i did take leningrad moscow stalingrad there was no victory it became a whack a mole type hunt to capture random soviet cities that became their capital when their main armies were utterly defeated fun and after all of that the most infuriating part of my review honestly is the damned peace conference system you will almost see things like yugoslavia annexing the entirety of germany or the ai taking random pockets of territory as germany i couldn t even take territory up to the ural mountains i was forced to let italy take some land when they participated very little this is because of the system where you can t use up more points than the person behind you so if you and the person in second place are very close you can t do much while if the person in third place has very little points as is often the case due to minors it means the second place person has basically free reign also one last point i wanted to make this is purely my opinion and i m basing it off of what i know from previous paradox titles my first game was crusader kings 2 this game will be riddled with dlc lots of it there s so many missing things major espionage national focus trees and minor portraits that paradox will not ignore a sequel is meant to build off of it s predecessors and hoi4 does that in many ways but it feels some stuff is being left out for future dlc one example is that hoi4 has less than 500 portraits even counting portraits that are the same people w different clothes while hoi3 had over 17 000 unique portraits ultimately i don t recommend hearts of iron iv i enjoyed it and will continue playing it but i can t recommend it honestly due to its problems i will not use nor accept wait for the dlc i shouldn t have to and i don t know why this is such a popular argument i might change this in the future as the game improves because i definitely will keep checking in
