2021 starting with the good it s a great platform to set up intresting multiplayer games coop or pvp zeus is amazing and of course mods now with the bad the dlcs some are good some are not worth the price some are just awful but in general they re way too expensive a massive ivestment to get them all and if you dont own them and somebody out of your control sets up a game with them you ll suffer game breaking popups all over your screen physics are janky af vehicles and even movement sometimes behave like its gmod or even worse than gmod sometimes destruction looks quite bad sound design and gunplay sound underwhelming not outright bad but just not as good as other games like squad now all those are possible to overlook often but the thing that fully kills it is the community the community now if you just have a group of friends and play with them you ll be fine but most clans groups squads whatever you join are ugh the worstnot only you ll get bullied if you aren t good at the game they ll also actually add grind to it like they ll often make you get promotions and in their stupid group before you can actually get access to all the game s features and play different roles it s packed full of edgy violent military wannabe larpers that are just the most annoying kind of cringe in the universe also these clans have this braindead annoying retarded kind of tribal mentality where they ll constantly get into drama with one another and just in general it seems like half the players of this game need to see a psychologist i m sure there are exceptions but that s my experience now apart from that the modding community is just the worse instead of working together towards a common goal you ll get 10 mods trying to do the same thing all working independently and fighting each other and this going extremely slow and just so stupid often this competition is linked to the same kind of clan mentality they ve got since sometimes mods will be attached to a specific clan officially or unofficially hell some clans just play with private mods they make and don t release just overall awful community maybe if i d been more lucky with who i got to play with my review of this game would be positive but as it stands i cannot say ultimately i had much fun with it or that i see myself coming back to it anytime soon
