2023 even tough i still like the game it is heading in a worrying direction recent updates came out with game breaking bugs still present weeks later some dlcs introduce new limitations on the base game like requiring espionage from nemesis to counter new enemies or introducing a leader cap and locking a way to overcome it behind the paywall called paragons the idea to slow down population growth to keep the game playable even on relatively powerful pcs is a creative workaround but not a real fix for such a serious performance issue and in general the technical debt of the game if the producers keep prioritizing new dlcs over quality then i can no longer support them or recommending it to others
