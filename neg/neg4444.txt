2023 i ve played every single civ since its creation god knows how many hours i ve drained in civ 1 2 i love the series i love the game i love micropose sid meier everything that has come out of there was been great but for the love of me i just can t get into 6 as i did the others i ve got every expansion for it and add on but the game just falls so short and flat the graphics are fine the music is fabulous and it just really isn t that different from the other civ s but 6 just doesn t flow and play as well it becomes abit cumbersome and boring you quickly lose interest in it whilst previous versions you can just sit there for hours end and anticipate the ais next move further to add the game is just to buggy takes to long to load and it is far from perfect there is plenty of random times it will just crash for no reason or it will sit there forever ending a turn and the more mods add ons expansions etc you get for it the more it slows down and i do have a killer pc and you can notice it but mind you my settings are maxed out oh and god help you with how slow this is when you play the largest map with the most ai players
