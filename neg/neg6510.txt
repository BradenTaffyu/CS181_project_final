2018 i absolutely love this game i have every item in the game as far as i know and i ve completed every achievement sadly though i ve been false banned and now i can t even play with my friends anymore it s a beautiful game but do beware there s the ever so small group of people who get false banned you could end up in that sliver of a statistic don t bother emailing support either because they just reply with automated emails and if you try to contact them again they threaten to perma ban you just for basically bothering them
