2018 early access review in 5 days it will have been a year since this game was updated update yay the review i spend the least time on gets the most attention which guilted me into making this a more thorough review after a year and a few days the game got updated to 17a my not recommend review is solely based on the sloppy dev performance waiting months for a minor update was barely tolerable before but going a year before updating an early access game is intolerable and i feel should hurt your ability to list a game on steam the 17a update was pitiful more quests a few vehicles and a zombie buff i couldn t believe this took a year to produce a dev team should have been able to produce this update in 3 weeks a single dev could have done it in a month if they took their job seriously this took their team over a year i loved this game it honestly doesn t have much to change before it is ready to go full release but the devs keep changing core features and adding features no one was asking for they seem to have made a fun and popular game and are dedicated to identifying what made it so loved by their community and changing what was loved and adding very little while ignoring some of the bugs although minor i can t recommend this great game because i don t know if the devs are going to make it better or just ruin it pros and conspros the best voxel based zombie survival genre game on the market great replayability satisfying difficultycons very poor development process unreliable updatesconclusion if you are interested in this game i would say you should definitely try it however be warned these devs are out of touch with their community and don t seem to take their work seriously
