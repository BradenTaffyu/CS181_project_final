2021 tldr ca broke the community trust with their announcement about the non future of three kingdoms they killed the game without releasing the promised northern expansions dlc with the xiongnu and won t be patching any more bugs of which there are many dear ca i have always bought multiple games and dlc so my friends and i can play your total war games together i was elated when i saw that you were tackling the rich history of the three kingdoms period this has been one of the more frustrating total war titles as the dlc never covered the period intended and was full of bugs on launch unfortunately some of those bugs still exist today which with you abruptly ending the support for this game has turned my dissatisfaction into intense frustration i do not know which executives had the bright idea of going and pushing this marketing ploy talking about the future of a beloved title when you announce instead you will cut all support and take away our much looked forward to northern tribes dlc as well personally this has meant an enormous loss of trust i know many in the community feel the same ca you have lost the proverbial mandate of heaven and i hope you can turn this around and make things right to your fans fix all the bugs and release the promised dlc with all your profits from total war warhammer and others you can easily do this
