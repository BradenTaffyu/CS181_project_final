2014 if you like deep immersive strategy games play rome 1 or medieval 2 instead if you like getting kicked in the nuts paying for overpriced dlc not the complete overhall of kingdoms or the purchasable special units of empire here the ve cut out chunks of the finished game to resell after to maximise profit if the gold version with all the downloadable content comes down to around 20 i d advise buying it if you allready own and have played to death the rome medieval 2 empire napoleon and even shogun it might be worth a purchase although after playing the others this will feel like an empty experience waited till the game was playable till i write this review over the last 12 months the game has gone from being unplayable due to graphics bugs crashes and fps problems after a year of patches they now have a game thats unplayable as you get bored and think of other things you d rather be doing instead like sorting socks i ve played the total war series since shogun and have thousands of hours of play on the series especially the original rome i love classical civilisations and medieval 1 2 even a couple of hundred hours on empire this game looked like the game i was waiting for fantastic graphics complex gameplay and a lasting challenge even more so with dlc how wrong i was comparing it to the original rome which i still play from ten years ago is difficult as the new version lacks so much content gameplay and complexity that made the original so much fun the new one has better graphics just lacking visible unit upgrades terrible unit cards and cohesion in battle whats lost is summed up well here not by me over all its like they thought lets take the strategy game they ve been waiting 10 years for rome with modern graphics and cut all the top level strategy out politics dynasties etc take off the factions people will want to play all were playable in rome1 to sell for premium dlc s the strategic ai sai is atrotious even by total war and civ game standards but the combat ai is passable but you tend to autoresolve battles as the sai can rarely provide a good enough army to be fun to fight
