2023 buy it on a sale a year after release and it still feels half empty engage in diplomacy craft trade and conquer new lands in a vast medieval sandbox what diplomacy trading options are limited unless u manually do it yourself workshops are bare bones and still say level 1 without any other levels existing sandbox hardly sure the combat is just as fun as ever however outside of combat the game feels so lacking note that most of my time was played during ea when i actually thought they d finish this game
