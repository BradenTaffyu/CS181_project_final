2022 i see you look at the 450 hours i ve spent on this game and wonder why in the world i d have spent so much time playing a game if i can t recommend buying it well let me tell you why the gameplay it s fine the story it s cobbled together and mediocre at best replayability you betcha this game s got so much replayability so why wouldn t i recommend it because it s ok there s nothing special about this game those 400 hours all spent on mod content the game itself is only as good as far as the modding community can take it like skyrim fallout 4 is bethesda s attempt to appeal to a wider audience while retaining their rpg fans but this ends up dumbing down the game with filler content and over simplified mechanics vanilla fallout 4 on anything below survival turns the game into a slog where you ll be mowing down enemies and gaining not much substance from the game as a whole far harbor dlc was pretty aight tho
