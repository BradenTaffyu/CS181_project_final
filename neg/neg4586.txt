2018 update 2 10 19with coming storm getting released soon i wanted to revist the game now that redshell has been removed i can t the new launcher is broken and when i hit play from within the launcher the launcher will open itself but not the game it s just a loop of the launcher opening itself can t start from the game s exe file either great job tl dr generally a mediocre game that is not as good as the previous entry and contains unethical redshell software i love firaxis studios firaxis games is the same age that i am and in a way has always been around since my earliest days i ve been playing since civ 3 released and one of my only memories of my late estranged father is centered around a game of alpha centuari i hate putting personal information in a game review but i want to highlight how much of a benefit of a doubt i gave this game i love a lot about this game such as the new art direction and the unstacking of the city i love seeing cities that do not just have the same layout with the same buildings i like having builders that build in an instant but only last for three or so projects and i like that traders make organic roads that make sense instead of the weird spiral roads that civ v tended to have culture being a tree that follows in the style of a tech tree is fun and makes a game feel more unique i once had a technically advanced civilization but lacked any sense of suffrage that difference made my game felt unique and i hope it gets explored so that the cultural civics tree becomes more distinct from just a separate tech tree after saying all those things i loved about the game it pains me to talk about the negatives the ai in this game is dreadful and often makes no sense ai civs have unique agendas which sounds cool but often becomes a confusing mess for instance the roman emperor trajan is programed to have the agenda optimus princeps in which he tries to incorporate as much land as possible under his borders but does not like civilizations that have little land this does not make sense because the less land the player has the more lands for trajan to have why should trajan look at me with disgust because i am playing at tall game letting him have more valuable lands china s emperor has a similar agenda where i try to build as many wonders as possible but do it when players build wonders that makes sense the less wonders a player has the more wonders the chinese emperor can have why does trajan not follow this logic worst of all is the norse leader who hates me for having a tiny navy which totally makes sense because i m landlocked from every direction the whole ideology system is made worse than the previous game instead of picking one of three major ideologies and encouraging a kind of late game world war you pick one of three ideologies that just determines what kind of cards you can put down i did not feel like any one was separate from the other somehow the game feels strangely empty and unfinished i do not really know why but i feel almost like this game is kind of pretty but plastic my biggest issue with this game is firaxis s use of redshell redshell is a program that is included in the game and cannot be disabled without breaking the game redshell tracks information such as websites you visit your devices your ip addresses used to play this game the resolution of your monitor your user id steam and your fonts this data is anonymized but i remain unconvinced that a smart person cannot get this information either from reverse engineering software which is illegal but still happens or from company side this is used by a marketing company to determine how effective different advertisement campaigns are and where the most active players come from this is just opening a wormhole that i did not want to be open the legality is debated but generally assumed to be legal and fine as there is a eula that vaguely refers to collection of data problem is that eulas are outdated and designed to discourage understanding due to legalese wording excessive length and vague descriptions i m disappointed in firaxis for this behavior to simply put this software in and assume a player is fine with it without making an explicit easy to read and opt out description of this software is unethical on their part i will not play another firaxis game for as long as they believe that it is fine to abuse the outdated eula system to gather information for their benefit
