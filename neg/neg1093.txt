2015 roleplaying aspects there is no roleplaying in this game you always start off as a concerned parent and you stay concerned parent special basically doesn t matter in this game you can be 10 across all special except charisma and it won t change anything seriously i found one just one inteligence check in this entire game nothing more the only checks that are left are charisma based and 95 they are like this give me more caps that is it you can t roleplay in this game because the dialogue is limited to 4 options and it doesn t matter what you take 99 of the time it all leads to the same conclusion the voice acting is one the worst decision they could have made i gave them a chance but this is just bad i have never felt connected in any way to the main character i never cared what happened to him he is not me he is some sort of idiot that even with 10 intelligence can not draw even the most simple conclusion like when he leaves the cryo sleep he is convinced that it happened like a week ago for gods sake npcs now onto the characters most of the npcs in the game are boring as hell even companions are hardly interesting and the way the react to your actions and how long it takes is poorly designed for example there is curie who you can impress by being nice siding with railroad etc i did many things like but it still takes ages to romance her and i hate this system in fallout nv companion quests were much better solution than this terrible system and there wasn t even one time i cared for my companions they are immortal why should i care the only companions i like so far are dogmeat and cadsworth but other than that i want to shoot some of them in the face and here we get to another stupidity of fallout 4 essential characters they are almost everywhere basically you are connected to the quest i can t kill you it breaks immersion and is annoying when there are some npcs like mama murphy who you want to shoot in the face but you can t the only thing you can do about her is to build her a chair somewhere where no one will ever find her character progression now let s talk a bit about character progression and how inferior it is compared to fallout nv or even fallout 3 in both of those games you had to pick your special carefully otherwise your build would be flawed and you would suffer a lot they were rpgs that punished players for making stupid builds and mistakes you could not become a jack of all trades because levels and perks were limited so you had to be careful what to choose in fallout 4 though there isn t such thing you can become 10 across all special or even 11 if you pick boobleheads just by leveling up there are very few builds that will make player miserable such as the one focused on charisma so it much less punishing than previous games it is more streamlined which for me is not a good thing anyway as you level up you can either boost your special or take a perk which sounds good on paper but in practise it takes away from the game because the most important thing in this game is to get you damage and let you build weapons other builds are much less optimal it wouldn t be that bad but because bethesda cut out skills karma and reputation there almost no alternate ways to do quests the only instance that required high int and nothing more was found by me after 40 hours of playing the game which is just bad main plot and sidequests now onto the quests and main storyline the main quest takes the player through the ruins of commonwealth in order to find shaun the son of the protagonist unfortunately it is quite predictable and does not allow too much flexibility in the end we find him and we have to decide which faction to support so the main quest is bad but it has never been great in most bethesda games or even the most important side quests were the most important part of playing fallout games for example in new vegas there was a quest in goodsprings where you could side with either the town or the powder gangers doesn t seem impressive does it however you could join one of those sides whenever you wanted or even back stab the one you supported for example side with powder gangers but lay mines on the road and kill them all before they come to the town or just murder them after everything ends so you could take all that sweet loot and once again fallout 4 disappoints in that regard 90 of the quests are like this go there kill raiders rescue someone go back the amount of radiant quests is staggering and quests that are not radiant still disappointed me most of the time the issue with them is once again is that there are very few alternate ways to them the only good quest so far for me is silver shroud a bit cliche and still not that great but i enjoyed it unfortunately i can not say the same about most of the other quests combat and no level cap before we go into combat though i want to pinpoint a tiny detail which is no level cap sounds awesome doesn t it unfortunately it once again is poorly designed system that does not work well with the franchise this game features way too many radiant quest that are meant as nothing more but a grindfest this game is full of grinding grinding and grinding otherwise your character is just weak and it still not done that well because you receive little experience for most of the quest and it would require hundreds of them to get you above level 100 which just plain stupid now let s talk about the combat and difficulty i have to admit it is one of few things bethesda managed to improve it feels much more fluid and natural although it is still nothing incredible quite mediocre i would say it is still a step up from fallout 3 and nv though unfortunately the same cannot be said about difficulty as i was playing with my level 250 character cheats i wanted to verify something i came across a super mutant suicider with level 250 the same as my character i think you understand what that means level scaling and bullet sponge enemies are the bane of this game how is it that 50 caliber sniper rifle does nothing against him even though i hit it in the head it is really frustrating and the game is full of them legendary enemies are basically buffed up versions of them also the different levels of difficulty are like this you deal less damage take more damage enemies deal more damage enemies take less damage just bad right legendary enemies are enemies that spawn randomly in the game whenever you kill one of them it drops an item with additional effect such as penetrating laser musket ignores 30 of armor or something like this sounds good on paper but most of the time you get something like this ghoul hunter gamma gun deals 50 more damage to ghouls with radiation so it does nothing against them in fact it should even heal them more which makes no sense sure not all enemies scale but it is still poorly designed system with way too many flaws crafting now lets talk about weapons crafting and armor it is great that you can modify your weapons power armor and such it feels natural they also completely removed weapon degradation so you don t need to worry about carrying 10 rifles so you could repair your favorite one it got tiring i admit that but in new vegas there were weapon repair kits making it a piece of cake to repair however that lead to the fact that the most important aspect is crafting also materials like alumminum being the most important thing in the entire game armor and weapon inflation the game becomes too easy with couple of mods to hunting rifle you waste so much resources on crafting it is not even funny and it is required in main plot so you can t really skip it last part is in the comments last page 3 last comments i run out of space
