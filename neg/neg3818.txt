2016 early access review for all the content this game has it is amazing a bit buggy at times however no bug ruins the game even if you get launched to space and die falling down on impact for no reason at all however the game has completely failed me on unfair hackers every server i am on i get hacked if its pvp and i kill someone they hack me and kill me back unfairly if you see mandarin chinese name tags they ll fly around and hit you once to kill you and take your stuff the game has a lot of content however does not provide a successful revenue to report hacking which completely ruins the game since i have no revenue to report players i ll post the name and server of one player who inspired me to write this review server naked and afraid player razorthreader players believe its just chinese people that hack the game however if you simply google how to hack 7dtd you ll find endless sources any player on this game can hack you if they feel like it wreck your base kill you and take your backpack the overall idea of the game is great but has been completely ruined by imcompetance with dealing with hackers the only way to stop players from cheating is to buy your own server and password protect it that basically ensures you have no multiplayer experience whatsoever i m moving on to day z and miscreated hopefully the developers will actually care about their player base and disallow hackers to take advantage of players that grind for good games
