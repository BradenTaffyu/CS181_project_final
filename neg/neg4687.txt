2021 7 26 2023 updatei still can t change the review to positive on this game the dlc pool has more remastered dlc that new content this just shows how lazy the devs have become with no true competition they just do what they want and people keep buying it the only thing that makes the game somewhat enjoyable is what the mods add to get the best mods you need to use a 3rd party launcher because like mentioned in my original review below this update the devs change the game structure to try and make mods more difficult to make much needed game play mods i wanted so badly to like this game i ve tried to play it and i just can t get into honestly there just isn t enough difference compared to the 2018 game sure the new stuff is nice and the game looks good but its just more of the same overall honestly i would have been happy if they would have just added the new stuff to the 2018 game as a paid dlc if you take the time to break down the new stuff most of it had similar mechanics in 2018 all of the fluids act like oil the brake disc tool is a redressed balancer the fuses and stuff is just like all the other parts without bolts at the end of the day its just the same game with sprinkles also the game is a ton less customizable with the new file structure i m very disappointed
