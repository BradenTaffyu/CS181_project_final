2023 early access review i want to like this game i really do i really did but i bought into early access nine years ago since then there s been huge improvements and huge changes not all for the better the team have completely reworked every system in the game multiple times whether it s crafting perks procedural gen farming you name it it s been scrapped and redone suggesting they have no clear idea of what they want it s now 9 years later since then i ve had two kids one of whom is now old enough to actually play the game maybe you can still enjoy the game for what it is but expect whatever features you do like about it to get removed when they do a complete rework of something else if the funpimps ever finish the game it might just be the best zombie survival game ever but the funpimps will never finish this game
