2020 i ll admit i like this game indeed i like most paradox games however as always paradox continues with it s toxic dlc policy a game about making alternate histories except alternate histories are locked behind paywalls want an imperial british empire 15 want spain to actually have a focus tree 20 indeed some nations integral to ww2 e g italy russia ussr still have yet to get updated trees and when they do you can guarantee it ll be behind a paywall what s even more disheartening is the update policy in the beginning you could still have mods with alternate histories but paradox just like in stellaris and in eu4 regularly updates the game often simply to make it so alternate histories or edicts and decisions allowing alternate paths are suddenly bugs and crash the game leaving many a good alternate history mod on the workshop un usable un playable or un updated the ai is awful sometimes it s laughably stupid and sometimes it s scarily fast often randomly even when changing difficulties luckily the actual system of front lines states and conquests are brilliant no more single clicking each province a la eu4 unfortunately peace conferences are broken as heck i ve had many playthroughs ruined by a war never ending for whatever reason even after everyone capitulates their cities conquered and nuked their soldiers 0s rather than 1s it s a shame that paradox has a monopoly on this market genre if there were alternatives to paradox i d buy them in an instant but paradox hold a stranglehold on the market their games giving you just enough to entice you in only to be slapped in the face with dlc paywalls don t buy this game not because it s not fun but because it actually costs more than just the initial price
