2020 early access review can t believe my first review on steam is a negative review on a m b long story short i wouldn t recommend this game to asian players at the moment because 1 all asian players are subject to the censorship and law of ccp since the asian server is censored and supervised by a chinese team i wouldn t recommend it to asian players unless more asian servers are added to multiplayer games or developers add an explicit disclaimer stating the situation so buyers have a informed decision 2 single player campaign still requires a lot of polishing in aspects of power balancing among kingdoms quest development and relation mechanism as it s still an early access i have fun playing the single player campaign for over 200 hours now and to be completely honest i don t mind the minor bugs since the developers seems to be working hard to deliver i don t even touch multiplayer battle and it may sound silly to some people to care for politics in a game but i think the developers owe their early access supporters this much to let them know what they are in for or maybe it s time to draw a line and call out some country s bs at a time like this well hopefully things would be better in the future and i could change my views on the game but at the moment i would say i might have spent my money on other games if i knew about the above situations
