2023 after almost 100 hours here s an update for my review its still negative no offline play no lobby browser no pregame planning no ability to kick players no voip in 2023 and probably wont be in 2024 there s only 2 or 3 sidearms worth using only 3 primaries worth using no variety of builds like in pd2 dont spend your money on payday 3 go get 2 or even payday the heist the 24 hour peak of pd2 is 45 765 while pd3 is at 5 177 and it ll undoubtedly go back down to 1 000 or less in acouple of days one of the bigger points for me is not having something like crimenet or a server browser to find games you search for a specific heist and a difficulty on that heist then hope 3 other people are looking for that same heist and with the game settling around 1000 people at peak times i doubt out of 10 heists and 4 difficulties that you ll be able to get a full match so you ll be playing with maybe one other dude and bots that were programmed by the new guy i dont know who s making the decisions overkill starbreeze or deep silver but they should be fired and replaced with someone who understands the player base and what the game needs old review no offline mode and the servers just got stolen ill change my review to positive once an offline mode comes around so when the servers get shut off in 10 years i ll still be able to play it
