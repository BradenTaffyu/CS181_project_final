2018 fallout 4 is one of my longest played and most loved games of all time recently i have become vexed with steam and bethesda more and more over these incessant updates in attempts to stop mods or make more money off of it after nearly every update from steam bethesda mod developers have to change their code reupload it and then we the players then need to update our mods for the world that we have built the builds have been stable until another update comes along not only this you think there would be a simple option to stop updates but steam and bethesda do not allow this we have to hack the game to pieces to deintegrate it from steam usually causing more bugs i do not recommend this game from steam period stop it stop breaking my game stop forcing us to do 1 2 hours of updates every time you decide to release more crap from creation club this is a world that i have built over the past years leave me alone steam
