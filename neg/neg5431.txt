2023 i have played the previous title coh2 quite significantly and have to say that every problem with that game has been maximized in this game somehow path finding is even worse than coh2 balancing is a thing that exists except not in this game i have played all factions for at least 5 or 6 hours each with some going even higher mainly dak and the british and can say without a doubt germans are simply better at everything and seem to benefit the most from balance patches further snowballing the problem it seems like it takes a great deal of skill to play the allied factions especially the americans the main reason for this is that the allies have a very limited unit roster compared to the axis who have a unit or ability for every occasion mixed with over performing infantry on the side of the axis and lackluster machine gun options for the allies means its a blobbers paradise out there for evidence my axis win rate is roughly 80 while allied win rate is around 30 it was roughly 50 50 when the game first released but since then balance has taken a nose dive with no sign of recovery so far perhaps this game could be good if relic fixed the myriad of issues that plagues this title but it definitely wasn t ready for release
