2020 when the game launched i bought it for a full price because it looked atmospheric and i really love the whole steampunk feel that the trailer showed but after playing the game for a couple of times i realized that the game has a very low replay value all the events are scripted and in order to succeed you have to build the same buildings in the same order research the same techs in an order and send your scouts to same locations when the endless mode was introduced i returned to the game only to be disappointed again same scripted social events same tech tree the only difference is that the map for scouting changes after every storm when the season pass was announced promising new maps and new mechanics i decided to give the game another chance and bought it in my vast stupidity the first dlc the rifts added in total a new map and a bridge that s it you get a bridge the new dlc the last autumn added more content but the game is filled with bugs which prevent you from playing the game check the forums and reddit and the developers did not fix it 10 days after the launch the game breaking bugs exist in the main story the first that launched in the new campaign and in the endless mode also regarding the endless mode once your colony is comfortable enough around day 35 40 you can just leave the game on and go do something else because there are no random events in the game it s all scripted and even after you fix the generator your scouts will still find parts needed to fix it instead of the much more needed resources like food or coal i will say that the game is fun on the first or second playthrough but i would recommend buying it and the dlcs only with some major discounts and when you buy it get the soundtrack it s amazing if you want a better management games try cliff empire or surviving mars or even rimworld
