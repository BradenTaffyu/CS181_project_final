2022 this is a great simulator for tabletop games which is why it saddens me to write that it shouldn t be played a recent act of moderation in an attempt to make the global chat of the game a neutral space means that moderators have been banning anyone who speaks about the lgbtq community this wouldnt be so much of an issue if they also banned hate speech against the lgbtq community but they do not as a result it has become a safe space for people who are openly anti lgbtq which has alienated the entire lgbtq community i wouldn t recommend supporting this game in its current state and unfortunately wont be using this program again in the near future
