2022 recently scs announced on their blog blog scssoft com that the upcoming heart of russia dlc will not be released they say that it s because of the conflict in the ukraine and they claim releasing the dlc would mean supporting or tolerating russia s actions but in the same statement they also claim that they try to be apolitical neutral with their games with the decision to not release this dlc they re no longer apolitical neutral because if they really would be apolitical neutral they would release the dlc as planned but instead they have chosen their side which would be fine if they wouldn t claim that they re apolitical neutral so hereby scs can no longer publicly claim that they re apolitical neutral hereby i would not recommend buying any software from a company that has double moral standards
