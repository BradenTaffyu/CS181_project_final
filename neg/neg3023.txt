2018 the game is pretty much broken at the moment main concerns 1 new fleet manager is buggy as hell yes it might be fixed in future but it s a full release not beta or something2 new expansion system is too much micro you re going to need science ship to full explore the system construction ship to build the starbase for every signle system couple it with hyperlanes now taking years of travelling it s just not fun3 new war system is just unplayable the only possible wargoal now is taking your claims
