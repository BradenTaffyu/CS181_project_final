2023 early access review 12 21 23 edit i thought i d give this game another shot a few things have changed for the better but most things have stayed just as bad or gotten even worse i was shocked to see some of the older problematic cards being unchanged also why are there still cards with effects that aren t tagged as ongoing or on reveal it s good to see this game is still as predatory as ever 2 2 23 edit i deleted this off of my pc and phone i m done being punished for having bad luck with the rng aspects and money superseding skill as i stated in my review it really is a lot of fun and actually very fair early on that s how they get you the gameplay loop definitely gets its hooks in you and before you know it they might succeed in turning you from a f2p player to another poor sucker to milk i m not an idiot i know that s sort of the point of most f2p games but this one seemed so different at first i never gave in but it got to the point that i could either keep banging my head against a wall for a game that isn t going to reward me for my time and skill unless i spend money or you know spend money i would love to see someone borrow the format for this game but then either make it a buy to play title with zero microtransactions or make it f2p but any and all purchases are cosmetic only you can t shouldn t mix real money purchases or obfuscate them through currency exchanges with the acquisition of cards in a competitive card game lastly i ve come to the conclusion that it s kind of gross that they re pitching this as being in early access when they re taking money from people hand over fist but still get to fall back on the ea excuse when things don t go right it works mostly for ea titles that are full games with a set price because you re usually not expected to pay more after that maybe a dlc or two are ok if development is going well a f2p card battler with paid mtx constantly bombarding you with buy me buy me just doesn t fit that mentality very fun and addicting game you will have a blast early on however once you dip your toes into pool 3 cards and beyond you will see how predatory the systems in place really are you can have a decent time as a purely f2p player like myself but you will grow tired of seeing certain meta decks that are mostly impossible to get without paying by time you might possibly assemble the top meta deck from a month or so back for free the new meta flavor of the month will be there to ruin your fun couple this with huge sweeping effects from rng like locations cards that play for you having to draw from your opponent s deck losing your deck and getting random cards and so on and so forth there needs to be a huge balance pass on cards locations and the current means of earning cards cards with amazing abilities that can t be directly countered because they aren t typed as ongoing or on reveal abilities need to be addressed asap i m looking at you lockjaw and dracula great game but it s trying to cross the line between pay for convenience and pay to win without being noticed we see you
