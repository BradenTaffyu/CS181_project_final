early access review this is the single most disgusting disgraceful thing currently existing in the gaming industry to my knowledge and it seems it will only get worse from here this comes from someone with a thousand hours in ark survival evolved i used to enjoy this game a lot years ago but only because i played with close friends eventually the gameplay got so incredibly stale that not even the best company could not save it i ve not played it for a couple years now and likely never will again even the time i spent playing it i wish i could have back the game has been in early access alpha development as they call it for 12 years it began as a kickstarter but is still missing many of the promised features from that it s laggy and unoptimised incredibly ugly bland and boring the gameplay consists entirely of finding loot to kill zombies better and killing zombies to find better loot nothing else there s no exploration no goal no objective no story no narrative it s one of the emptiest games i ve ever played some of the changes they ve made in the past few years have changed certain aspects of the game in a major way mostly negatively some people would say the game has only gone backwards i m not not sure if i am one of those people but it certainly hasn t gone forwards there s no other game like it but it s by no means a good game the fun pimps recently announced that it s leaving early access as a full game in july as update alpha 22 still missing all the promised features almost the entirety of the a22 update is going to be visual changes the first planned feature after that in q4 2024 is outfit dlcs amongst other unimportant and insignificant things human enemies aren t set to come until q2 2025 and the story mode q4 2025 yet they call this a full release version 1 0 the current price of the game is 18 99 it s set to double after it leaves ea they re adding outfit dlcs as i said and if you own it on console already you have to buy it again likely at full price they re also working on another game 7 days blood moons which is just 7 days to die without the boring stuff but still bad i don t know what the price of that is yet and it will also have in game purchases edit just read that it s also being removed from xbox gamepass yet another scummy tactic to trick people into buying the game when they wouldn t otherwise it s not unlikely the game will be abandoned after 1 0 they might drop this game to work on the other spin off game maybe they ll spend 12 years on that one too or maybe they ll abandon that before even releasing it and actually continue working on this or they ll abandon both and leave with the money they get even if they continue working on this game it will be years before it even remotely resembles a finished product let alone a fun game it s not worth buying until then
