2017 product received for free early access review i was given this game for free friend bought it for me had a lot of fun playing it with friends we pretty much played it every day and are still playing it now with a good mod considering the fact that the game has been charging people money and has been on early access for over 3 years without mods the game can feel noticeably incomplete animations are buggy which sucks when you have to land a head shot zombies can spaz out spin around like a top or glitch through the floor or wall large parts of terrain can just disappear you can fall through the world chests bug out not allowing you to open them needing you to exit and reload the world all in all it is also very poorly optimized runs poorlylook i had fun with the game that is very important but i can t recommend buying this you guys need to respect yourselves if you buy games like these and they do well eventually we will be deluged with promising and perpetually unfinished products we don t buy hopes and dreams we should be buying finished games buy this game in another 3 years maybe then if you want to give money away to a charity who am i to stop you but i really don t like these kinds of practices i m going to guess that this game will be in ea forever edit processor intel r core tm i7 4790 cpu 3 60ghz 3 60 ghzinstalled memory ram 8 00 gbsystem type 64 bit operating system x64 based processornvidia geforce gtx 760update 3 years later on a new pc still in alpha i tried to play again a few weeks back and it still runs like absolute trash i just can t play this game and not feel like a total idiot like what am i doing playing this garbage please don t give these people your money
