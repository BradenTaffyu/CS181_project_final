2021 i love this game i have put over 1 000 hours into it but i cannot recommend anyone purchase it paradox is an awful company their dlc policy is atrocious their lack of playtesting of any sort is an insult to the community they exploit the devotion and goodwill of their fanbase for profit at every opportunity while all of these trends have been known for years leviathan has taken them all to new levels the company pushed a dlc and accompanying patch that was obviously unfinished and actually game breaking for many people the half assed corporate speak apology they issued and deleted afterwards is just the cherry on top of this sundae paradox needs to be punished for this or it will only get worse every copy of a half baked dlc bought just reaffirms their management s confidence in their exploitative business plan with that in mind from this day forward i will not purchase any new paradox products until changes are made
