early access review to be honest for a game that s been in early access for 11 years yeah it still sucks kinda it is a pretty good mindless experience to delve into with friends but for most people you are going to find it very boring repetitive and hard to get into it s a long haul of a game and that shows with just how long it has been in early access for starters it runs horribly on my above average machine it runs the exact same on low settings and high settings which means there is a humongous cpu bottleneck going on that the developers need to figure out i crack 60fps most of the time but dip below pretty often and everything lags horribly this is a game that should feel better than it actually does the gameplay is pretty good it s a fun looter game base building game and tower defense game all in one with a decent amount of customization as well however this game is what separates the patient from the normal people with most people playing solo or who are just impatient quitting long before their playthrough really gets very deep the guns feel fine but of course have the classic lag and stuttering the shotgun still doesn t work right and a bunch of other crap if you buy the game before your refund window is over you ll be able to decide whether the game is right for you or not trust me it s okay not really much special to it it s just a really really buggy game that rarely works quite as intended and with 1 0 on the horizon i doubt the small talented team behind it will be able to fix hardly anything wrong with it currently my recommendation is that you buy another much better zombie game like project zomboid left 4 dead 2 or a non zombie game like titanfall 2 there s much better ways to spend your money than this game but who knows you might find this to be your dream game so check it out if you are interested
