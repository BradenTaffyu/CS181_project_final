2022 edit 2024 two years after my very critical review and swtor has not improved much in fact in many ways it has gone even further downhill notably its management has been handed over to a 3rd party broadsword so bw can work on other projects i guess dragon age the most notable changes i need to lay out here game engine was finally ported to 64 bit somewhat improving performance woes for many people though it s still quite janky here and there reason being that it s just a hasty port sans optimizations and don t even dream of any graphic improvements the complete gtn overhaul consisting of a massive babyfication to the point players are being guided every step of their buying selling process so it s nearly impossible for them to make any mistake for people like me who thrive in mmos with similar free market auction house systems this was the game s nail in the coffin and believe me the game had a sizable amount of dedicated traders prior to this change many of them were utterly banned with no recourse for simply being very good and very dedicated to sniping flipping stuff on the free for all gtn for most of their playtime this was never against the tos and it never involved botting just clever searching and dedication they had a lot of credits and items and bw decided to cast the blame for the game s broken market and currency hyperinflation onto them you won t see anything about this on the forums however because the forums have also been severely babyfied under the guise of curbing harassment and trolling most posts bringing up legitimate criticisms of the game or bw ea broadsword disney are also pruned with impunity so if you give the forums a glance it seems like everything is fine people are pleased and whatnot meanwhile the game s subscriber count is at an all time low a far better metric of how the game is doing tiny morsels of poorly written story no actual expansion on the horizon tons of season pass slop with ever more shallow rewards and uninspired cash shop items in a desperate bid to at least hold onto the lowest common denominator of players and squeeze some money to cover the server costs really the way it stands now pvp is dead always has been the story fizzled out the player trading aspect of the game has been killed criticism has been silenced no expansions on the horizon no graphic overhaul on the horizon no original events all that s left is a star wars themed season pass daily mission grind i don t recommend this to anyone if you like star wars i say go install skyrim along with mods that add lightsabers and force powers and stuff the end result will be more enjoyable than the old republic original 2022 review have several thousand hours in this game pre steam stretched across many years i m sorry to say that after the latest updates i can t recommend this game to anyone looking to play it long term legacy of the sith aka 7 0 is a low effort expansion that is a step backwards in every single way compared to its previous 6 0 onslaught that stood strong for 2 years the game needed an update instead it got 7 0 here are the highlights short forgettable story content months of announcements for around 1 hour of story content on release content drip to follow over the next months drastic rework of the class systems cutting down several utility abilities or locking them behind specialization choices almost everyone opposed this they did it anyway previous endgame gearing system was straightforward and allowed anyone to obtain the highest rating and most legendary armor sets regardless of how they played new system is convoluted involving 4 different pathways each with its own separate currency either way you go about it it s a lot of grinding to do for a few extra gear rating upgrades rework of level sync marked by aggressive capping of all stats and removal of irating stacks altogether resulting in the total erasure of sense of progression as now high level properly geared players take as much time to wade through solo trash mobs as low level players wearing hand me downs weird attempts to reinvent the wheel by bringing ui modifications that absolutely no one asked for the highlight of this was a highly touted solution in search of a problem feature that allowed players to stamp custom weapon designs in their character s visible outfit again something no one asked for as we already had moddable weapons before the feature was absent on release and players were forced to use generic looking junk until after much uproar bioware released the feature 1 month later instead of the planned 6 months more uncalled cutting down of features why remove ls ds tokens why remove renown levels why remove amplifiers from gear they also wanted to restrict group finder to only a handful of flashpoints each week but again after much uproar they scrapped it just one silly idea after another this is of course on top of the existing actual problems that bioware did not address one bit such as ongoing ingame currency hyperinflation giving new players almost no chance at meaningfully participating in the player driven economy to obtain premium cosmetic items they either pay real money or quit the game many repeatedly reported yet ongoing serious bugs chronic poor game performance on modern systems yes i know this is innate to the outdated game engine but it s worth mentioning because in 2022 this game isn t novel enough anymore to warrant tolerating this in conclusion if you re a new player and at all a star wars fan i still say by all means come in sub a month or two enjoy all the voice acted stories and such the game s main claim to fame to veterans and would be return players there s nothing in it unless you like re doing everything you ve done before for the past few years
