2023 this game has a charming style and deep game mechanics so i want to enjoy this game but i just can t the early game is nice you dig out a strange creature and wonder if it s dangerous a quick look at the database tells you it s not hostile and you realize this is not a game about exploration and wonder since everything is already known it s strictly about expanding and exploiting what s around you after 60 cycles days i find myself watching a 20 minute video on how to use a metal refinery and i stop and realize that i just don t care enough to continue this is too much work for not enough reward even if i m playing on easy mode i played plenty of factory games and enjoyed them but this game i just can t get into the late game this game is not for me and i can t really recommend it
