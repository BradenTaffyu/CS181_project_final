2023 product received for free early access review as of right now i cannot recommend aim lab to anyone because of the lack of information provided in the new results page prior to the updated results page we received information comparing the just performed score accuracy and ttk speed to the average of those categories after the update adding the new results screen we don t receive any information about our average scores and instead are told how well we did compared to our best worst recent performances only receiving information about the outliers of our performance creates a disillusion of our own performances and cant tell how well we did against our performances that occur more often than our greatest or worst
