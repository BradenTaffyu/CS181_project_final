is the game fun yes is the story interesting yes it made me curious to try a second playthrough to see the different paths and character choices is the game buggy yes very is it worth the asking price no not in its current state too many bugs break up the main story experience and it comes off as rushed or unpolished when important cutscenes for the main story quests bug out and freeze don t load in or repeat multiple times when they finish is not acceptable for a 50 usd game that is nearly 8 months out from its launch date i came back to finish my first playthrough i started a while back at launch and i was genuinely enjoying the story again patch 1 2 released and i m now softlocked in a story battle because the patch changed many of the abilities my characters used and now my team gets wrecked unable to retrain my characters and change their abilities since its in a story location that doesn t have an npc for retraining i didn t anticipate an update breaking my characters like that so my most recent manual save is far enough back that i might as well start over momentum gone i ve never had the brakes put so hard on a game i was enjoying before so i can t recommend this as it is now maybe when they stop doing major overhauls this won t be an issue but owlcat games have had some serious oversights when it comes to pushing updates to this game there needs to be some serious all around polishing to this game before it matches what was advertised
