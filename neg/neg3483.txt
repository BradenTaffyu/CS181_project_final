an excellent city painter but severely lacks the economical and logistical gameplay that it was clearly intended to have taxes and or subsidies have no impact on development occasionally you will profit or lose millions due to a glitch some signature buildings are non functional as a valid workplace eventually your city stops exporting goods completely and fails to appropriately move goods between your multitude of stockpiles and businesses the visualized supply demand chain is a farce land value is disproportionate to negative effects like pollution lack of services etc traffic nodes which are extremely difficult to alter force vehicles to make last minute lane changes assets poorly conform to uneven topography honestly everything looks bad unless it s on a flat surface elementary schools function not as an educational institution but a day care center to hoard children until they become of age there is no workshop as of this writing to share city saves or copy and paste intersection designsthis game is the closest thing most of us have to relive that simcity2000 feeling i just wish the developers focused on their existing strengths rather than trying to do too much like nearly all games nowadays this was unfinished at launch and remains so to the developers and coders if investors are not willing to pay for your end product in a timely manner look elsewhere it is your education talent and dedication to art that some money grubbing jerks have regrettably spoiled i hope to speak for a lot of gamers when i say releasing a game early is understandable and simultaneously unacceptable
