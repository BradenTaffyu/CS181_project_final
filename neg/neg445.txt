2023 i tried to give this game a second chance and try out the pitt and atlantic city expansions after initially playing the game and finding it bug ridden boring hollow tedious and greedy i was forced to jump through hoops to access the expansions by doing tedious repeatable daily quests given to me by personality less npcs with wooden dialogue and performances i went through all of this just to end up encountering a bug that made the dialogue needed to start the expansions inaccessible this game also has the cool feature of having no brightness slider this game has been garbage since its inception and will continue to be nothing but garbage update i decided to suffer through the set up quests for expeditions once again on my lower level 10 character to get around being locked out of expeditions on my main me and my friend who is level 12 played through the first quest in the pitt together the quest was simple kill a bunch of bad guys luckily most of the enemies scaled to our level but the few the game actually required us to kill were level 40 bulletsponges that could instakill us if they wanted to the ai in 76 however is so abysmally bad that most of them just didn t fire back the weapon i was using was a hunting rifle because it was the only gun i happened to have ammo for during the expedition i noticed i was finding ton of ammo for it but for it alone and nothing else the fight took so long my rifle would end up breaking leaving me to be forced to finish them off with melee my experience playing this quest was not only one of the worst experiences i ve had playing fallout 76 but perhaps throughout all of my time gaming in general i genuinely had more fun playing the daily quest for the set up where you just cook soup
