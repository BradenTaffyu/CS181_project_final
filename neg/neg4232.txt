2017 early access review it s interesting but i wouldn t call it fun most of my enjoyment of this game comes from starting over and over again and i ll explain why at it s core it s a management game which i love with all the difficulties placed at the start in the beginning you need to manage your ever dwindling supply of water oxygen and food and increasing quantities of issues co2 pollution once you unlock more all the research the game becomes increasingly more complex but also much much easier and less interesting as a result there really isn t much to do once you get past the initial growth phase other than tweak efficiency or expand which might be fun if you really enjoy spreadsheets min maxing physics but that s not really my cup of tea would i recommend it maybe it really depends on if you like physics simulators
