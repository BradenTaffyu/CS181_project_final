2019 this could be a really great hunting game sadly this game has so many bugs that is ruins the gameplay and immersion for me for example just before writing this i could not select a weapon or anything else from my inventory with each new update new bugs are coming and they are not fixing the old bugs fast enough i don t know if they fix t this bug but for me for a long time i come across animals that are just frozen get stick in tree s really bad pathfinding or they disapear after shooting in the ground
