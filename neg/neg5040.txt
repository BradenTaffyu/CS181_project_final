2023 it pains me to leave a negative review on one of my favorite entries in the franchise but there is no music on the campaign map apparently this bug was introduced in 2021 along with the game s release on epic you used to be able to fix this by rolling back to a previous build but then ca removed that option altogether furthermore ca has not provided modding tools for the music files for copyright reasons so this issue cannot be fixed by the community if you intend to play the warhammer 1 campaign be advised that this is a full priced game sold in 2023 where the majority of the in game music is simply gone missing no longer there i think the single player campaign is a nice change of pace from the second and third warhammer games but there is no way i can recommend this game when such a glaring issue has remained unaddressed for so long also on a more personal note i think it s absolutely shameful that a game released on steam in 2016 cannot be enjoyed as it originally was i realize ca is primarily selling this game as a warhammer 3 dlc but the campaign is included in the price of the product and should be fit for purpose i can digitally buy games released in the 90 s that have no sound issues whatsoever a game this recent being sold with over half the music missing is nothing short of shameful
