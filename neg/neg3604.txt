2023 early access review how is it that the devs keep making the game actively worse with each patch look i understand some of the tweaks players could live at bedrock and be untouchable cool zombies can dig that s fine players aren t using the traders basically at all added missions far out man i m here for it players are stockpiling water too easily remove the jars after drinking and remove ability to craft them what excuse me where the hell did i put the jar did i drink it and throw it against the wall like i m a frat boy with a beer the devs constantly overhaul systems that worked fine prior and usually the overhaul is much worse than the previous system the threads on steam are locked so we can t discuss it here we have to talk about it on the forums where devs can remove responses honestly after years of this game i think i m just done in 9 5yrs of development there have been highs and lows the lows are getting lower and the highs are getting reworked into something worse
