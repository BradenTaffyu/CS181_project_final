2018 loved the game before 2 0 very free form and dynamic with many possibilities game had problems but nothing truly game breaking in my opinion the recent 2 0 changed all of that took me a while to really let it sink in i actually tried to give 2 0 a chance but having played several full matches i have come to my own conclusions about the quality of the 2 0 update instead of actually fixing the issues that plagued the game pre 2 0 they just threw the whole game in the bin and scrapped together a stale skeleton that just ends up being a poor man s sins of a solar empire and many of the problems aren t even fixed so what was the point of the overhaul it s like they didn t think the update through at all and just winged it the early game is very stale now and always the same no matter what faction you are it s always a very slow race for as many star systems as possible and the mechanics for system claiming are tedious and boring the new war mechanics completely suck the fun out of fighting wars instead of balancing and fixing the issues by tweaking the existing mechanics the developers jury rigged a constraint to just deflect having to actually put effort in to design coherent game mechanics instead of fixing the issue for players that like fighting wars they severely punish the players that like fighting wars instead it s sad all in all i just really don t get why paradox decided to completely wreck the game two years after release instead of taking their time to work on a stellaris 2 or something used to be so fun and interesting now it s stale tedious and boring the only good things coming out of the recent overhaul are the star base mechanics customization that actually sort of makes a difference and feels nice and the fleet manager sweet sweet quality of life aside from that the game still feels somewhat incomplete after two years many features are still irrelevant and pointless like the faction system and sectors and empire customization remains a glorified difficulty slider i say get sins of a solar empire instead after 2 0 it s pretty much the same game albeit with less customization but with coherent game design and is actually fun to play and balanced
