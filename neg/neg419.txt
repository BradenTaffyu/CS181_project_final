2023 just played the new atlantic city part of the game it s just more crap when will you add in real quest lines this is just more crap to kill with your meta builds no real story or quest lines please make real quest lines and stories not more grinding bs i like the game i really do i would not have put in as many hours into it if i hated it but my god man let modders in so we can at least get something better then what you are shelling out i was hoping for something better but like starfield it s just sad it s like you don t care about the game or players anymore just the money you can make off of them
