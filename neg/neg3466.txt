do not buy this game would get a refund if i could went back to this game over 6 months after release now that mods have been out for a little while game is still unplayable tried a few mods half don t work half are pointless when they do work not doing nearly what it was described to do economy land values and demand for industry commercial residential etc are all still way bugged or unbalanced nothing seems to make sense for demand just seems like random bars fluctuating every new save and there s no effect when you ignore the demand too this game is very incomplete compared to what they advertised this game would be able to do don t even get me started on how insanely stupid the traffic ai is in cs2 i thought drivers in real life were idiots but wow the ai is on another level of dumb if you re not running on a beast of a rig with all the latest and most new hardware your in game simulation will come to almost a complete halt when your city population is barely over 50 70k right when i finally get to a point that my city is growing flourishing economy and looking like an actual city the simulation just cooks my cpu and runs slower than 1x speed even when turned onto 3x speed you cant make any real progress or see the effects of your new construction until hours of real life time later it was taking over 10 seconds in real time for just 1 minute of in game time to pass last night my simulation made it through the first 2 years very quickly then once my population approached 60k it took almost 8 hours of real life time to get through just 3 months of one year in game i know a lot of the above has everything to do with computer specs but most people don t have a 4000 series video card and the latest and greatest processer etc any mid low level rig any rig thats slightly dated is going to run into the above issues i m having that s a problem when your game isnt optimized to work smoothly on a mid level computer even when turned down to the lowest settings the game can go overall since i can t get a refund i m going to hope that maybe one day in a year or two this game will be in a playable state until then co and paradox have lost my faith entirely and i will not be giving them a cent more of my money complete your game before talking to your community about purchasable dlc nobody wants to purchase anything from you guys until the game actually works foolish that developers get away with something like this feels like such a scam
