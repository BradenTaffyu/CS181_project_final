2016 this is a difficult decision i thought it was quite fun to play through the first time but there are some major issues that definitely need to be fixed in order to get me coming back for more pros the visuals are absolutely gorgeous there s so much attention to detail it s insane i love the way cities are organised ingame especially when compared to the spray paint city tool of civ 5 roads actually connect in meaningful ways rather than cutting through everything and creating unwanted super roundabouts there s a day night cycle and cities light up when it gets dark flocks of birds travel the map and there are chickens wandering around the granaries with all the details the world feels much more alive in comparison to the one within civ 5 and sometimes i just sit there looking at the screen because of it the animations are superb and smooth the district system is a welcome addition in my opinion and it adds a lot of depth to the game city states are easy to manage and aren t a complete chore like the ones in civ 5 the barbarians can annihilate you if you re not careful they re more of a threat than an annoyance which is actually fun the new policy and government system is good fun being able to organise troops into corps and armies is a very nice addition and helps to simplify combat gameplay there are some aspects of the ai that have improved from the previous game but cons boy can the ai make some stupid decisions sometimes spontaneous war can be enjoyable but when the civ declaring the war has absolutely nothing to gain from it and won t even bother to show up it s just annoying the agenda system great idea but i feel some of the agendas are stupid and sometimes the penalties are way too high for example ceopatra hates civs that don t have a large army so if you re not focusing on troop production early on she ll probably denounce you and declare war on you and every other civilization that doesn t meet her stupid standards she basically spawns into the game hating a buttload of other civs the penalties are way to high and because a lot of the agendas clash in some way everybody starts hating eachother except ghandi casus belli another awesome idea but it didn t really make it easier to declare war without gaining warmonger penalties for example in one game ghandi was converting all of my to his religion so i decided to declare a holy war on his ass this casus belli gave me a medium warmonger penalty which i thought would be easy to manage but as soon as i declared the holy war everybody hated me and denounced me and i lost 14 points to each relationship so for me the warmongering penalties are way too high and need to be adjusted theological combat again another cool idea but there isn t enough depth to it since there are only 3 religious units there s not a lot of strategy involved especially if you re up against ghandi s theocracy and his religion focused entirely on theological combat when he came in with that wave of apostles knowing that the warmonger penalty for holy war was too high all i could do was wait until he converted everything and remove all the heresy after maybe if there were more units and terrain modifiers this could be fun but for me it just wasted screen space it s insanely easy to win a cultural victory the first time a played i won a cultural victory but i wasn t even aiming for it i feel like this has something to do with the crazy culture boost from launching a rocket and the fact that you need to focus on culture for a bit in order to get the really juicy policies it gets the point where in order to get a scientific victory you need to actively neglect your culture and tourism output this definitely needs a bit of tweaking what else can i say this game was fun to play the first couple of times but with these issues present i don t really feel like playing it more i want to have alliances clashing over scarce resources and not everybody hating each other because they want more wonders or because they won t bother to settle on my continent in my opinion there are a lot of small issues that have a big impact on the game and i can t really recommend it until they are fixed
