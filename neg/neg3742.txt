2019 early access review i played this game for a long time but today my patience is exhausted it was a really great game and you could spend days on end i started playing long before it appeared in steam and i like everyone waited a very long time and watched its development but now it s dead like the zeds that walk in it still moving but without life and do you know when it happened this game have a lot of things and improvements that it needs there is only one weapon of each type and there are no alternatives shooting and weapon behavior to put it mildly is not impressive the light passes through the floors and walls and acts where there is none or vice versa temperature and getting wet work like in disney cartoons the concepts inside and outside work as in constructors for a mentally challenged the movement is so primitive that you still can t get into a car sized hole there is absolutely no support for the workshop and other modding tools when games like kenshi ksp project zomboid have long acquired thousands of mods and a strong community this game has a very weak interface that starts to slow down as soon as you try to do something with it and tons and tons of what else in this game is wrong or annoying and a couple of trains of bugs on the siding and you will say that this is only alpha stage it s early access and still is not complete and for 5 or 6 years from 2013 or 2014 i don t remember exactly i always agreed and never said a bad word but now i can answer the question when this game became dead this game became dead when devs instead of doing what the game really needs began to change what is already working over the past year or two there is absolutely nothing new over the last couple of years several new buttons have appeared in the menu instead of this disappeared several biomes the type of soil many buildings including the largest ones and the once huge world that was not seen possible to pass now could be crossed in one day there is no longer a large open water and no rivers and mountain systems there is practically no water at all anymore i once said wow here is a really smooth quality system not like in diablo with 7 types of stuff here it is not anymore i once said wow here is a clever skill system that grow when you do something and not like in stupid games where you can learn to trade by killing frogs here it is not anymore nothing new happens here only changed what already worked and the hard truth is that this game is no longer in development just devs do some in it do not buy this game it no longer develops
