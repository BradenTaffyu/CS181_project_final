2016 this isn t fallout well i should say it isn t what fallout is supposed to be where in the indepth dialogue where is the indepth choices i will give a great example back in new vegas you were a courier who was shot without giving away too much of the story you eventuall catch up to the shooter at the casino he is in charge of you have a ton of decisions relating what to do maybe you kill him on sight maybe you convince him to work with him maybe you get outsmarted by him maybe you seduce him as a woman screw him and then go on to murder him in his sleep where is the level on indepthness in fallout 4 nowhere all this game is is a shallow attempt to market to that braindead shooter base that only likes to shoot things i don t want to play this game again
