2023 i love card games i played mainly mtg in real life and tried different games at pc but playing this seemed really fast and easy comparing to all those other card games mechanics cards everything is really great this month the game celebrates its first anniversary as a new player i had a blast starting the game the month before i made some decks played with opponents have fun little that i know after hitting pool3 the game showed its ugly side the first thing i learned that before hitting pool3 you ll face bot opponents meaning there isn t a real person against you so the game is really easy to hook you in after hitting pool3 you face opponents that hit pool3 too but since pool3 is so huge you ll face opponents that have many more cards then you you ll face opponents that have soo much experience than you and you ll lose a lot i mean a lot the game before pool3 and after p3 are like night and day so you won t gain the montly prizes that you can only won by winning games that means you need to buy those rewards for real money if you want to get more cards pool1 2 cards are fixed everyone gets them starting the game one by one pool1 has 46 cards pool2 has 25 cards you can get all of those in a week or so depending on how much you play the game that is the fun part pool3 has 99 cards and you will get all of those in a year yes a year they nerfed boxes that gives pool3 cards other people get a p3 card from 4 caches now you get two from 9 caches those caches are tied to credits which you can buy for money or earn limited amount of daily they removed gold from those caches now gives ticket which is earnable for free anyway since pool3 size is soo big the cards you get are differs from player to player let s say 20 of them are good cards as a new player getting those cards from caches at the start of p3 is very slim so you ll have trash cards you won t have a deck to compete with others and you ll play just to entertain the players who started the game early than you i think they need to drop pool3 count to 25 cards and make new tiers for every 25 cards so at least you ll face opponents from same 25 cards list which will be more manageable the game doesn t care about new players they gave out free cards like kitty pride to all players earlier this year as a new player you need to pay 6k tokens to get it you ll only earn 1 2k tokens a month how is that fair it isn t this game needs more stuff for new players this game needs a wishlist system how can a box opening gatche type game doesn t have a wishlist system this game needs a true player ladder system that based on their experience and total card count this game needs a catch up mechanic without paying money until that happens don t spend any money before you ll hit pool3 or you ll be sorry
