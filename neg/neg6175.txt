2023 it s an owlcat game is not an acceptable excuse this is their third release they should know better by now be better there are a lot of good things i would love to say about this game despite its flaws i love it to death but it is virtually unplayable in the later acts bug after bug piles up until the whole game comes apart at the seems empty text boxes uncompletable quests incorrect flags on dialogue options leading to nonsensical outcomes stuck cut scenes you will be reloading a save every 5 10 minutes to try to force the game to work properly a bugged talent here and there or a side quest yeah i get it but the ability to actually complete the game should be the bare minimum standard it is unconscionable to recommend this game in the state that it is in maybe in a few months i will change this review and be able to give the game the praise that it could have deserved but i can t do that right now
