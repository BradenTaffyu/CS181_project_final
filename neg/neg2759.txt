2016 preordered game and have been playing paradox titles since eu2 the game isn t bad but unfortunately there is no maybe button on steam so it has a promising structure but at present it s pretty shallow and boring diplomacy is pretty bad barebones options ai doesn t react to deals they should accept with their eyes closed war system is terrible no cb to declare autosurrender don t even gert me started ai is very weak acts passively never really a challenge allied ai will blob and follow your main fleet regardless of actual strategic situation planet development is basic at best seen better systems in 10 year old games espionage non existent trade trade routes commerce is absent battles are very underwhelming it s a paradox game i know but really weapons come with different ranges but all battles invariably end up in a chaotic melee no orders no behaviour just blob and pray very weak land battles were better in moo2 a 20 year old game the resource gathering and starbase construction is very similar to galciv it s ok but it gets repetitive and it s not original paradox has a strong tradition of historical games real world historic events without this context i feel this game looses a lot of appeal and originality i mean this would be an ok game in its present state if it wasn t by paradox if i think that this game has victoria 2 as a mommy and ck2 as daddy it s really a letdown and it doesn t live up to the hype of course there will be many dlcs i personally dislike this marketing strategy dlc spam and i think in the long run it will be more negative than positive for gaming in general tl dr would be ok if i wasn t expecting victoria hoi ck2 in space as it is it s a step back
