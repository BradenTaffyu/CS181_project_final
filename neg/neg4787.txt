2023 edit more update after a few gig updates without any info i was wondering what was added maybe a surprise or maybe just some bugfixes so i logged in happily and bumped into a for more information read here doodoo allow me to quote at least a shorter part in addition we may collect information about your browsing behavior such as the date and time you visit our websites the areas or pages of our websites that you visit the amount of time you spend viewing or using our websites the number of times you return to our websites other click stream or website usage data and or emails or ads that you open forward or click through to our websites really reaaaally i am sure you only get information about how much time i spend on your website sure sure i start to paint eggs and i ll be the easter bunny i just pressed exit this is a priority the bugs will never be fixed i am almost sure about it ppl still lose save files and there is still no other way to cut the grass in the base game just with the dlc and other yummies just read back the last month s negative reviews i think it s time for me to let this game go for my older reviews please read lower edit since i like to be fair i want to add extra information about the situation no i didn t buy more ram not yet but thanks to the people who were so kind to upvote my issue or the fact that a lot of other people complained as well who knows after some patching the game is now playable 2023 october i had to play a bit with the mix of the options to make it smooth and certain things look worse like no matter what i do mirrors and windows are odd and certain custom items have glitches too but hey at least it works and i can live with these minor issues also i can see with same options the game goes below 60 fps in the nearly empty garden while it works like a charm in a house full of furnitures i wonder how long it will work i don t dare switch the thumbs up i m afraid for the original review please read lower i have one very simple reason to leave this negative i really hate when game makers change the system requirements after buying a game months later and it is beyond my control especially if they forget to fix this on their page yes i am upset the main game needs 4 gigs of ram at pets dlc we were at 8 but farm dlc raised the minimum to 12 16 recommended i like the game but you know that s not the solution get a better pc months after you bought something and if you wonder why did you buy a dlc if you knew it had higher requirements guess what i didn t i don t own the farm dlc at all yet my game is eating my computer alive the system downloads the items and mechanics that belong to the dlc but doesn t activate them if you don t own them my game is literally unplayable after a few minutes it barely loads houses and i have some saved up for myself those are simply crashing in the middle of loading and other typical things ya know my computer doesn t have enough horsepower anymore and yes i tried i turned off everything to get the super ugly minimalistic version and even then the pc is spinning at 94 96 with only the game on enjoy the realistic looking eh what am i talking about just get more ram you say i hear ya eventually i will when i can but i feel screwed so i leave this here so people can see that not everything is a rosy smelling bubblegum the bonus is this issue won t care about anyone because house flipper 2 is coming yay i don t care i can t even play the first one properly anymore
