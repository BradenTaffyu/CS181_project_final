wotc has introduced the hideaway a shop you have to unlock with ingame currency you have to buy with real money to unlock a shop where you spend another ingame currency this system is one of the most predatory systems i have ever encountered it s like a textbook example on how to push every psychological button to get you to spend money 1 it hides the real cost behind two ingame currencys 2 you can t buy the exact amount of ingame currency to unlock the shop it costs 2800 but you either have to buy 3400 or 2x 1600 3 this is the most disturbing part you earn the second currency by just finishing your daily quests and stuff but you can t spend it without unlocking the new shop this means you always earn stuff you can t spend every few minutes you get a reminder that you have that currency and you can t spend it this is horribile
