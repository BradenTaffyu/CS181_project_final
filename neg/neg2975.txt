2018 the new update is garbage i wish the 2 0 version was optional almost as a hardcore mode i am only saying this because in the old update things were simple but effective ships weren t that bad to make borders worked just fine and you didn t have to annoyingly spend of minerals just to claim stars protecting your empire becomes more of a chore than a game and if another empire declares war on you the enemies can just take stars in your border away from you since they can just destroy your station easily actually putting defenses in your system is a pain as well because military stations can t be standalone anymore and upgrading to starholds is expensive not only to upgrade in the first place but to maintain the credit and mineral generation are all sorts of up recently i notice that at one moment i am generating roughly 25 ec and 55 minerals and then suddenly a pirate fleet attacks dies instantly to one of my stations and a governor dies and i am at 8 ec and 27 minerals what i don t understand anymore the game used to be really good but now it s just confusing tedious and more of a chore than a game
