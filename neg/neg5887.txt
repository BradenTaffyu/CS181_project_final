early access review i don t get the unrelenting hype train after playing does it have potential you bet is it anywhere near obtaining that potential not even close perhaps with the influx of cash the dev will expand and we ll see some real progress on the title i m nervous it has taken so long to get to this state what that means for future improvement frequency pricing it is a good thing this was released at 30 it isn t quite what i d expect for being deep and re playable at 30 its neither of those things at 40 this game is a wait and see how it improves for another year
