2017 early access review 8 years later and this game is still in early alpha i wanted to like this game i really did a sandbox zombie survival with minecraft style world deformation was exactly what i wanted at the time i sunk 200 hours into this over various updates so it wasn t like i didn t give it a hard try but the game has barely gotten anywhere relatively speaking and is frought with endless bugs and performance issues even on my high end machine the last straw was how the most recent update a16 was handled it was released extra early to a select group of streamers and testers who signed up for the pre experimental build and waved in everyone elses faces this is not what early access is supposed to be segregating your community in favor of people who market your game for free is a terrible way to treat your customers of course one of the developers madmole thinks differently in this post madmole thinks that giving him money for early access isn t good enough to get early access and responded to his well earned criticism by banning dissenting users on the 7dtd forums i regret giving the fun pimps staff my money as a result of their childish behavior if you want a well supported early access title i suggest factorio or subnautica which are very responsive to users and are developing the game at a much faster pace than the slugs making this huge pile of dissappointment you should be ashamed of yourselves fun pimps i used to think better of you update i am amazed at the positive ratings this game is getting despite at the laughable upkeep of it i wouldn t put it past funpimps to manufacture positive reviews their loyal fans took the time to downvote most of the negative reviews afterall i don t see how else they could possibly achieve anything above a mixed rating organically update hey look another year passed and barely anything was done with the game it s a miracle they haven t given up by now update as of 2019 alpha 18 is now out such speedy progress so i decided to see if anything worthwhile was done during the past 2 years alpha 17 yes 7 years and they are still in alpha has brought very little to the table other than weapon mods more options to customize your world with and a revised leveling system most notably the zombies are basically made of steel now i spawned in tier 6 weapons highest quality available and it still took at a minimum 3 hits per zombie to the face unless i got lucky and triggered the decapitation perk even more annoying is that the zombies now try to get to you in the shortest path possible this means that during the blood moon they will smash through your ceiling instead of trying to go around to the path of least resistance like they used to the dealbreaker for me is that the already worthless electric fence traps now lose durability when zapping things quite quickly so good luck trying to fix those with a horde outside your door the blade traps don t fair much better losing effectiveness after shredding a handful of those ultra tanky rad zombies basically there s no point in building a base anymore no matter what you build they will all line up in a tight cluster and shred through multiple layers of steel blocks you re better off putting around on a bike or that depressingly slow gyrocopter if you want any hope of survival the gyrocopter by the way is pitched upwards by the e brake button you can imagine what kind of frustration that brings oh and have fun exploring too every last house is filled with at least several zombies sure makes the caveman phase fun when you are beating back three zombies with a tier 1 club and no perks at every single location even when i cheat this game isn t fun it s nothing but work and making sure nothing touches you you get stun locked by 2 or 3 basic zombies guess what you re dead and of course a cavalcade of bugs framerate issues and overwhelming lack of content are still present after all this time oh wait the back talking trader guy gives fetch quests now so immersive steer clear of this shovelware nothing but boredom and frustration awaits you especially if you attempt multiplayer update 2024 why do they even bother at this point
