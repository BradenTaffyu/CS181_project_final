2017 i m an absolute fan of the franchise i have been playing civ since day one i have pretty much grown up playing civ games well i tried hard and harder but i can t like that civ vi in its current shape yes it does look good yes it quite feels like a civ game but it serioulsy needs fixes and since the release almost none of the well known issues were addressed and now that the cqui mod is not being updated anymore it is just not even worth launching the game until either firaxis fixes the bugs and gameplay issues or the cqui mod is updated again
