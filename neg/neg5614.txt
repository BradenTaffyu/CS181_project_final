2018 i ve played this game for some time and it is my tenth most played game on steam 177 8 hrs as of typing this review i will say i do enjoy the game sometimes it s buggy sometimes it s easy sometimes the ai cheats but overall i believe the game is good and a lot better off compared to release there are some times however where i still wonder how such a game can be so buggy 5 years after release however this recent controversy with the update adding women generals to the game and the response the developers made is completely unacceptable to me as a customer adding onto that ca describing their games as historically authentic and not historically accurate sounds like a lame ass dodge to the point being made that women generals were a very rare occurance back in this specific time period and overall a very poor excuse for why they will remain unchanged in the game let me be clear that i am not angry or upset about women generals themselves being added to the game i don t think it s necessarily a horrible thing in my personal opinion i think that the average 10 15 spawn rate for factions that are not rome greek states carthage and some eastern factions 0 is a bit high but again that s my personal opinion there s even one faction kush that has a 50 chance to spawn a female general imo that s way too wide of a percentage but i will admit that i am ignorant on the history of kush so it could be more historically authentic than i actually know the real issue i have is with how ca responsed to this criticism if having female units upsets you that much you can either mod them out or just not play what a completely unacceptable and ridiculous response i am a customer of your games i bought your 60 game and i put up with the bugs the glitches and even the spyware you put into your games i even tolerated being spied on and this is how i am treated as a customer absolutely unacceptable behavior from a professional game company if a sizeable portion of your consumers have a problem with how you handled something why not negotiate or discuss the problem at hand here s a quick list of ideas that i think would ve been a much better approach make a slider in your game that abjusts the spawn rates for female generals explain the historical accuracy or as ca says authenticity and what historical data if any drove the company to add this to the game in the first place add a mod to the workshop from the developers themselves that removes females generals from the game entirely and make sure to keep it constantly updated add females generals as an optional free dlc so people can install uninstall at their leisure eg europa universalis 4 women in history free dlc add events for historical women generals leaders etc to spawn in the game add anything to make female generals removable abjustable in the game these are thoughts coming off the top of my head i shouldn t have to be brainstorming for ca but it seems like someone has to i also shouldn t have to rely on other customers doing the work the company should be doing even when i found a mod to remove women which i don t even really want to do there was nothing but horrible things being said why are they not being banned here s some direct quotes i found these sensitive as gamers getting mad because women are in their vidya gaems lmao given how only a few of those crying mewling right wing wimps actually subscribed the mod it is essentially proven that those incel losers were just brigading the tw series the basement dwelling are simply a shameful existence you are so filthy people aww poor little boys all upset i wonder how mant incels this will hopefully shut up ca told me to mod my game if i didn t like change and here i am modding my game and getting insulted for it i don t even want to fully get rid of women in the game but i have no clue how to mod and so i am forced to take a side the developers refuse to cooperate or meet halfway i will be taking my money elsewhere and you can be sure i will not be buying another ca title and i advise you do the same
