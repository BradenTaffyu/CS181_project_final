2019 i don t think i have ever been so torn with regards making my feelings clear about a piece of entertainment media than i have about the total war warhammer games the game is great a whole bunch of fun compelling campaign play deep strategy within the battles themselves endless spectacle joyous aesthetics and sound all in all a treat for the senses and the mind however were it possible this however would be written in 40 foot high flaming letters the dlc policy with regards this and the previous title is absurd firstly an entire game mode the mortal empires campaign essentially the sandbox pick a faction and play mode is locked behind owning the first game a game which still retails for 40 as standard the vortex campaign a more story driven campaign that comes as standard with tw wh2 still has many of the aspects of an open ended campaign though lashed to a competitive resource gathering mechanic with a select few of the other races this tends to lead to a hard time limit to finish your game before the enemy can complete their objectives it also limits you to the 4 races that can take part in the vortex campaign secondly and perhaps far more egregiously to me many races lords and special units are locked behind the dlc for the first game dlc which again retails for anywhere between 5 and 15 a piece as of right now during the lunar sale 50 off on most of the dlc 75 off tw wh1 getting access to all the content for tw wh2 would cost you 90 ninety quid at half price or better as i said at the start this has torn me i love the game it s a grand old time it really scratches the large scale battle itch and marries it to one of my favourite ip s in the world but the monetization is beyond predatory verging into protection rackets and italian american s with tommy guns territory i cannot in good conscience recommend a game that treats its customers with such utter disdain much as i would otherwise love too thanks for reading
