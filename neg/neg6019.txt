2016 europa suffers from two main problems 1 the core mechanics of the game have been constantly changing since release and there seems to be no end in sight this makes it very difficult for someone to pick up the game again after a prolonged break at which point either your save is broken or you are penalized for not having access to the latest dlc 2 there is something decidedly unfun about the game s challenge your victories feel hollow over beating braindead ai and your defeats feel cheap due to rubbish coding behind the ai to compensate for its idiocy i had my fun in the honeymoon period when the game was fresh and new but the allure is gone now and the game does the opposite of what a good game should be doing europa puts me in a bad mood
