2017 i m done fine the game is hardcore i get it i spent a lot of time learning the system and after many hours and a restart i developed a team i was comfortable with experience is hard to come by in this game and most of the game you feel underpowered most of the battles are ambushes with no way to study the fight and plan i e stealth is worthless because you can t reconnoiter and then set up for the fight a standard for turn based games like baldur s gate etc i managed to stomach all this until stupid quest mechanics that fail for capricious and unknown reasons i stated experience was hard to come by with little chance to gain from quests one quest fails because the quest givers fled no indication was given that this was a time based quest no indication that this was even a possiblity so after a day of game time i came back to the quest completed all the tasks go back to where the quest givers were and got a notice that they fled quest over no experience
