i will just sum it up is the game good hell yeahis the game broken yupis the game economy broken yepis the traffic ai broken partiallydid colossal fix the game since the release nop they mostly complained about the community as long you got a good pc and want to have a small populated city you will be fine otherwise wait a bit until they actually fix the game i do not recommend the game rn because the game for me is not in a finished state
