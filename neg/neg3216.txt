2023 i am an old player returning to this game and chose steam as its launcher platform to see how it is doing now what the hell happened to this game authoritarian devs not listening to feedbacks bottomless pit greedy monetization that grows worse and worse every single year into a giant blackhole rivaling the likes of ea balance issues less and less fun and more stress in matches every time they update the game i really wanted to enjoy this game i really do i m just a simple ship nerd once upon a time it was enjoyable however what the devs are doing to the game is horrendous players stand up let us rise
