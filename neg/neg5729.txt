2018 rome ii total war is a decent enough game in its current build dlc is poor but nothing more than that i ve invested a considerable amount of time into this particular installment in the series as i did with empire shogun medieval i ii rome i ect but i can t help but feel something is missing that makes a great strategy game there lacks a severe sense of immersion and risk reward i really do want to love this game and as someone who has a passion for and has studied history i feel it is vital to be able to immerse yourself in the incredible changes and cultures of the period but a lack of depth truely does prevent this from being the case the inclusion of steam workshop is a plus which has allowed hard working people of the modding community to bring this game up to an acceptabel level however something i must factor into the review is the following the redshell scheme you have lost so much credibility and respect from the total war community your sales will drop even with the tw saga cash grab because commited players invested trust in you and you betrayed them you refuse to listen and try to bleed your committed players dry respect is a two way street after all rant over get your head outta the clouds creative assembly
