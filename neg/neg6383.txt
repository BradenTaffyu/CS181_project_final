this game does so much right but it sucks as a game the problem it relies solely on the monthly festival playlists for engaging gameplay events but when that s over it has no legs to stand on because the core multiplayer experience is completely undercooked with hundreds of cars and dozens of tracks this game has 5 pools with 4 performance classes all consisting of bog standard races it s the epitome of boring and the fixes are so simple in each weekly playlist there are pve events that offer fantastic variety themed events around specific types of cars like suvs or 50 s muscle at one point they experimented with stock only races putting everyone on a level playing field why are these not rotating pvp events ranked from fh4 was removed ignoring obvious fixes such as making it non contact this also renders leaderboards worthless since there s no competitive rankings not to mention they re all hacked team races from fh4 gone endurance tracks like the colossus and goliath are absent from the track rotation one of my best memories in this game was pvp on those tracks before they removed them in a patch the entire drag race type is ignored completely c and d performance classes are not included it legitimately blows my mind how much multiplayer potential this game is leaving on the table so what s left eventlab 2 0 is the best in game track editor i ve seen that isn t outright dedicated mod tools great except getting to race on those with other people is essentially impossible without organized parties with the removal of servers from fh4 players phase in an out of the map making it impossible for people to congregate and naturally form convoys not to mention cars are ghosted so you can t hardly see or engage with other players anyway pgg isn t facilitating pvp eventlab races so that s another avenue gone the eliminator has completely busted vehicle balance that hasn t been addressed since launch ignoring foundational issues such as an awkward often unfair final race the party games are just that maybe you like capture the flag i for one prefer to race horizon tour pve while featuring an interesting rotation of car restrictions is considerably less interesting compared to the trial because of its lowered difficulty this ultimately means one thing the main way in which you engage with this game is through the festival playlist that s where you find interesting races through the seasonal championships play multiplayer albeit pve eventlab races play challenging pve trial races against unbeatable difficulty ai and so on additionally the devs have done a fantastic job offering a steady flow of new cars which makes the playlist very rewarding to complete every week but as soon as that dries up with no serious singleplayer content and real means of interacting to other players outside of the extremely stilted and simple multiplayer it s game over the rest of what this game offers is disjointed hamstrung and honestly geared to just make you buy forza horizon 6 and leave this whole experience with all of its potential behind
