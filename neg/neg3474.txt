there s been a known bug for the past two months where having parks makes crime skyrocket it completely destroys your city growth both in terms of population and wealth it was flagged two months ago and still no fix for an issue that essentially will destroy your save unless you decide to have no parks whats so ever i bought the game hoping that enough time had passed to deal with these small kinds of issues and that mods could patch the stuff paradox failed to deal with that s still not the case i recommend waiting another year or two if you ever decide to purchase it
