2016 i ve enjoyed the previous fallout games but fallout 4 was a huge disappointment for me this is mainly because the rpg elements i loved from previous games have been reduced or removed completely it feels more than a shooter than a rpg which is a real problem for me the story is very linear and the choices you make play very little part in how the story ends if you like shooting stuff and modding weapons this might be a great game for you but if you want a good rpg game with a good story i suggest playing or replaying fallout new vegas instead
