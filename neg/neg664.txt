2019 i honestly can t recommend this game as it currently is there is way too much rng built into it you go on numerous runs where you probably don t really have a chance based on the cards that are available or relics that you receive the basic premise is you keep trying until it actually offers you a synergistic build and then you could get screwed by a bad shuffle a bad shuffle is a thing with all card games but when you factor in you went on how many previous crappy runs it just feels really bad there is no retry system so you just have to star over i don t really feel like i m out played or not prepared ever i just feel like rng screwed me over whenever i talk to my friends about it the convo is never oh that s a clever build its always how did you manage to actually get all that i know its a roguelike but i still feel like there should be either more options throughout the game for building or different persistence options there is an unlock system but honestly i was receiving some of the items prior to unlocking them so i don t quite understand how that works fully that system is the only real progression in the game and its not much you get 3 characters currently i believe a 4th is underway talking to my friends we all kind of feel similarly the first character is kind of boring generic he does have build variety though the second is pretty good with decent build variety and the third is very rng based because he requires some very specific cards overall i feel its a bit lacking considering you always start with the same deck in terms of fights there isn t actually a whole lot of different fights you mostly just encounter them in different orders based on your seed and the path you take after a few full runs you will have seen all the different rooms the monsters in a room are not randomized so there are only really 10 or so different rooms in an act with the steam sale i feel like i got my money out of it but i guess the basic theme of this review is i want more i don t think you would be upset for purchasing this but i do feel like it gets stale pretty quickly after beating it i only really go on a one or two runs every once in a while before it gets stale based on rng and your ability to deck build that could occur very shortly one of my friends beat it in a few days the good news is it sounds like they are still actively developing it or adding to it so it could get better in the future one change i would like to see is starter deck variety maybe have the option to start the silent with the generic starter deck a shiv deck or a poison deck for example it doesn t have to be that specific with the decks but just something different to try each time to mix it up
