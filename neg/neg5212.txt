2017 ca policy on dlc is horrendus the game itself has a lot of potential the visuals are good the lore is good the battles can be good but the grand camapign is bad the ai is bad the turd needs polishing and that would require a team of deticated enthusiastic individuals rather then greedy we need more dlc misguided
