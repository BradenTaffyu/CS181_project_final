2018 never thought i would be writing a review like this for ksp so many hours a drop in the bucket compared to some a masterpiece of a game ruined by greed by itself there s not a single wrong thing with the game but this is vastly overshadowed in my opinion by the shady privacy practices of take 2 i haven t touched the game since squad became part of take 2 haven t agreed to the new eula the new boilerplate agreement they put a couple of months back was enough to raise concerns now those concerns are a reality with this whole redshell fiasco adware overreach aside im just completely heartbroken is how i part ways from the game that got me throught some though times i will be uninstalling and requesting a refund dont care if it gets denied dont care for the money i just dont ever want to see this game ever again on my library
