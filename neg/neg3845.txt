2018 early access review it s unfinished it s been in alpha for five years five years let that sink in a moment i don t know what the hell the devs have been doing either it s been about a year since the last update any update at all there haven t even been small bugfixes they re about to update to alpha 17 some time within the next year though i don t think this is ever coming out of early access don t get me wrong i do love this game i have 500 or so hours on it at the time of writing but if there was a good alternative i would switch in a heartbeat this game fills a very particular niche of mine that other games don t unfortunately not to mention the pricing priced like a full game advertised as a full game the only place i really see it say that it s still in alpha is the steam page and that s just because they have to also it runs like and is buggy as hell
