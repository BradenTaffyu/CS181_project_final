2016 stellaris gives you the feeling of running a space empire the loading screen artwork shows fantastic alien landscapes the music has the standard space exploration epic feel to it and the alien portraits are numerous and look great the superficial ingredient are all there it looks great and it feels great then you actually play the game for a while and the gameplay problems come tumbling out one after another the central problem in strategy games is what to do about the fact that the guy with the biggest army empire wins paradox s solution to this problem is to make science scale with your empire size and to limit gains from wars to a few planets and throw on a limiting timer there are no interesting victory conditions just dominate 40 of the planets there isn t very much strategy beyond the standard rock paper scissors of weapon and defense choices i almost get the impression the design choices were made to just drag the game out so long that the ending becomes irrevelevant because no one ever plays that long ok so maybe it s more intended to be a story thing or an empire simulator as opposed to a strategy game for story not enough happens beyond the standard mid game invasion of 3rd party aliens as an empire simulator it just feels incomplete there are clearly mechanics that hint at this with all the choices to be made for empire traits and their consequences however there aren t enough input mechanisms buildings and policies which allow for interesting gameplay with these elements stellaris is like someone took a lawn mower and put an awesome space age car shell on it it s great to drive around and feel everyone looking at your cool car just don t actually try to race anyone
