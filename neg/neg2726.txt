2020 i have played this game since launch and have over 600 hours spread across 1 0 to 2 whatever it is now throughout most of this games life i would have given it a positive review however as of the time writing this i cannot there are many reasons for this and i know my views wont be shared by a lot of people but i feel they are valid reasons to not recommend this game now don t get me wrong i have enjoyed stellaris a lot and have tried to really love it but i feel that what you actually get currently for the price you pay is not justified this game started of good with lots of steam but went sideways more than it went forward and the potential it has for becoming an absolute masterpeice in grand strategy has always been there but never realised 1 the ai in this game is simple and terrible and has been since launch offering no challenge at any stage of the game the only way to provide a challenge to yourself is to give the ai buffs to their economy with the provided slider in game creation this doesn t make the ai better it just lets them build bigger fleets quicker very unsatisfying to play against and gets boring quick once you reach a certain level they my as well not even exist you can literally have every single other empire declare war on you and it wont make a difference 2 bugs are numerous and have been for years bugs that have been in the game since 1 0 are still present and its just unacceptable they range from your fleets suddenly being unable to attack enemies but still be attacked enemy fleets being able to disengage combat immediately every time ally fleets declaring war and just orbiting their capital planet letting the enemy conquer everything with no resistance textures for models not loading etc etc 3 game breaking lag i don t experience this one as much as others do as i have a good cpu i really feel bad for the ones that find it crippling but during the endgame the game slows down to an absolute crawl and becomes incredibly laggy it gets worse the more the game goes on it has been like this since launch and nothing has been done that improves this 4 lack of true endgame content the endgame crisis were introduced to provide a challenge to the endgame before this once you reached a certain point in your growth from then on you could just steam roll every opposing empire and fallen empire with no issue and they could do nothing to stop you an endgame crisis does delay this point for a bit but only if you adjust the slider making them more powerful otherwise they too will be steam rolled this once again comes down to the ai being very poor and the only challenge you get is from buffing them with a slider 5 over priced and under delivered dlc this will be the most unpopular point i have to make but the one that tips me into writing a negative review some dlc released are 1 3 the price of the base game yet in most cases deliver 1 10 of the content on top of that the content released has often been them reworking how some mechanics or economics work instead of actually bringing in new meaningful expansions the new content that is actually delivered would be ok if priced accordingly but it is not the content also doesn t provide any late game challenge or experiences to keep it feeling fresh and meaningful i could write more but honestly i cbf if you enjoy rts and especially grand scale ones you will probably find hours of enjoyment in stellaris especially if the issues i stated above don t bother you however if they would bother you and there are many more smaller ones i could have listed you could regret your purchase and become frustrated with paradox as i have
