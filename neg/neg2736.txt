2019 bought game quite a while before 2 2 hit but as i dislike playing games before major updates i stopped when 2 2 was announced that was a mistake 2 2 broke the game entirely ai wages wars and then uses fleet to patrol against pirates never showing up builds so many ships they go bankrupt does not upgrade buildings can collapse entirely after you take one of their planets and generaly act like 2 year old i tried playing few games but after 150 years game becomes unplayable for one more reason other than ai lag when population of galaxy reaches certain level game slows down unbearably as pops and trade routes for that matter make checks for better jobs and routes way more than they should if you combine that with miriad of bugs some capable of destroying the game all on their own like dissapearing districts when terraforming and massive ammount of micromanagment from new pop system you get massive mess that only plays with your nerves it pains me a lot as i enjoyed this game but i do not recommend buying the game or any more dlcs until it is fixed
