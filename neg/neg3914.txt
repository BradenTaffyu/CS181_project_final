2020 i want to recommend this game but can t boss damage caps are the absolute worst it s completely changed the game no longer is a great sword a viable weapon to use against any of the bosses in fact any large and slow weapon is useless against bosses because if you hit them you re still doing the same damage as if you had built stats that favor faster weapons except faster weapons are just that faster so by having boss damage caps they have effectively made every slow hard hitting weapon useless because of the amount of time you re left open after each attack and the damage you pumped into this thing being non existent in every boss fight god binding of isaac was ruined when they introduced boss damage caps too i use to love this game it was a shining light in the darkness after binding of isaac became unfun to play due to item bloat and the boss damage caps and now dead cells has it too i now quickly get bored with the game no matter what run i get because there s really only one effective way to play this game and it s grabbing the fastest hitting weapon and doing some math to reach the boss damage cap and then dumping into other stats to raise your hp not fun it s no longer about playing the way you want it s about playing the way the developers want you to play
