2023 early access review as a hardcore ark fan i would definitely not recommend this game for the following reasons 1 wildcard has proven during the course of this launch that they have no respect for open communication to their fans they had a developer send a pretty crappy response when people were trying to figure out dates they did not deliver even 50 of what they said they would 2 they have completely ruined the modding community for this title be requiring the use of curseforge as a mod platform curseforge clearly can dictate what you can and cannot post as a mod and since it s the only way to publish mods for this game it will fail hard 3 there is nothing in this game that makes it any better than ark survival evolved higher resolution textures 4 wildcard has made an exclusivity arrangement with nitrado that will restrict your ability to setup a server with another company which has monopolized this service nitrado has promptly taken advantage of this by raising their price triple the normal price unnecessarily i am completely disappointed by wildcard s approach to this release and how they have treated their community i am going to be requesting a refund of the game
