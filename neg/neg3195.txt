2021 wargambeling turned a very good game into a trainwreck of gambeling and game mechanics without counters aircraft carriers and submarines im looking at you it s still fun to play but i d be wary if you are a new player the game has gotten to that stage where the publisher will squeeze every dollar out of the game before the active players drops off to much more gambeling and pay2win mechanics will likely be introduced looking at wargambelings actions over the last year or so proceed with caution
