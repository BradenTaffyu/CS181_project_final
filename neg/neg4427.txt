2018 gonna compare to civ 5 so people can have a reference 1 if you have two copies of a strategic resource you can build ridiculously large armies as long as your economy can support it in civ 5 if you had say only 4 copies of oil you could only build 4 battleships 2 nuke defense sucks in this game works fine against bombers dropping the nuke but not against nuclear subs or missile silos 3 a lot of the descriptions in the game feel incomplete 4 cartoony graphics was a step down from civ 5 my opinion don t buy full price buy on a sale and try it out i ll be going back to civ 5
