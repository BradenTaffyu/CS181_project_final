story is good but god emperor damn the combat encounters aren t fun at all do you like having to cheese every mechanic and talent given to you do you like losing entire combats because you missed some overpowered item on the previous planet do you love starting every combat with only enough cover for one party member and the rest die turn one because the enemy went first and gunned them down in the open well if that sounds good to you you ll probably enjoy the masochistic hour long combats and you better pray unity doesn t bug or crash and force you to start over again i only have this many hours in the game because of sunken cost and a stubbornness to complete this game out of spite don t touch this it all goes downhill fast in enjoyment after the prologue which conveniently takes up about 1 5 hours and risks you not being eligible for a refund
