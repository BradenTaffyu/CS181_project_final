2018 tried the new dlc s to see if they added any kind of replayability or alternate playstyles outside of a strict build order and priority list nope game is still extremely linear you either do exactly as you need to in order to succeed or you lose they ve had ample time to add new features and developments besides maps but without any change this is still going to remain babbys first city builder with vapid morality theme that you can easily ignore once you realize there is one and only one right way to play the game picking two different colors for which bar you keep full lower isn t a choice it s cheap and lazy the game has a great soundtrack tho endless mode seemed like it was going to add a bit more depth to the game but it s still a two dimensional thin parody of a city builder the game is polished the score is great but when i get right down to it the game lacks depth and severly lacks replayability i was expecting much more replayability but in my three unsuccessful play throughs i noticed that they were all nearly identical the randomization feels like flavor text with no alteration to gameplay the purpose choice feels like flavor text with no alteration to gameplay this is really sad since i was hoping they would be more impactful with clear styles and gameplay choices influencing how the play adapts instead i got two different buildings with essentially the same effect and a handful of new laws that accomplish roughly the same as what their counterparts do i kept comparing it to they are billions despite the gameplay being radically different the principal is the same resource management planning and decision making but with such a linear path and build options and little ways to diverge from them you re going to be doing the exact same thing in nearly each attempt in tab the random generation adds a layer of pressure and variety that this game sorely lacks and it hurts replayability i also have a few smaller gripes such as the easy to miss notifications for important things such as techs and laws and the game speed keys not unpausing the game one solution i can see that would fix my major issues would be to add more stylized playstyles and game mechanics such as underground building variants building airships for scouting or resource purposes choosing to leave yourself as way to make the player decide whether to stay in your crater or migrate to warmer part of the world these all seem like dlc ideas but that just reinforces my notion that there just isn t enough content here i enjoyed my time with it but i don t think i m going to pick this up again until some patches dlc hit
