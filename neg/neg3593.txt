2023 early access review one of my favorite survival games as well as just games in genera and to see this game grow has been awesome that being said the a21 update and its re balancing of the drinking water mechanic has greatly hurt the immersion and feel of the game turning a basic perfectly fine mechanic into a complete chore which has snuffed a great deal of enjoyment from the game same goes for the learning by reading mechanic using level up points and gaining xp from doing related tasks was a perfect system that made complete sense while having books on the side as a bonus however the new learning system has turning the game into an extremely boring grind as you spend early game not getting basic resources and base goods but instead going to traders or old dew collectors for filters while also going mailbox to mailbox in hopes of learning to make a bike i m confused at how the devs thought this was a good change i much more preferred living as a soul survivor and would ve much rather seen the addition of something like ai survivors in the wild who you can work with or fight instead of having these unrealistic traders with immortal bases who refuse to help anyone other than in trades just leads to a very unimmersive game a huge downgrade from alpha versions past i m also extremely disappointed in tfp fans and devs responses to any criticism regarding it with devs and other members of their forums openly being toxic towards long time fans who are against a senseless change devs have also been on record as claiming that its their game and they ll do as they please to which i feel its a fair statement but that they shouldn t be so hostile towards fans who don t support the direction fans who invested money into their project overall a bad change and an even worse response to criticism has led me to lose a lot of respect for tfp and has driven me away from the game one which i have some 700 hours on between console pc in light of a21 p s if you have similar sentiments then i recommend modding the game or using full on overhaul mods like darkness falls or undead legacy the latter of which being my personal favorite way to play which create a much more balanced system doing more to create a complete and balanced game than tfp has done in their 9 years of alpha release development
