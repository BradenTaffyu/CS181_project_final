2017 this game is a lackluster shooter and a terrible role playing game with over four years of development time it is stunning that this is the quality of game they managed to come out with bethesda did a truly horrible job in writing this game the factions have no true justification or originality to them no characters stand out in this game it feels as if everyone you talk to may as well be the same as the person before them in prior fallout games you could speak to almost any individual and they could tell you a sufficient amount about themselves to make them feel like a real person the towns have no real history behind them either and the each seems the same as the last fallout 4 fails to provide a captivating environment quickly becoming stale this game is nearly unreplayable because most choices feel like they have little weight and as a result the commonwealth is unimmersive and unremarkable i would only recommend buying this game if it was 20 including dlc
