2014 early access review update the developers maliciously and falsely flagged this review as abusive in an attempt to hide delete it which was promptly dismissed by a steam moderator update2 the forums are still being mass censorshipped to this very day alongside the discord proof survival game with potential that ends up failing drastically short due to the huge random factor surviving your first couple of days is easy since food is borderline abundant in every house along with water being a common commodity at every tap toilet and bathtub eventually however these resources will dwindle not only by the human consumption but due to the basic services shutting down leaving any fridge dependant foods to be almost instantly spoiled leaving you very dependant on rare canned foods chips and other conserverd commodities which will run out real fast depending on your character just create a farm you say fantastic idea just one flaw you need to find a shovel trowel and plant seeds while seeds are rather common trowel shovels are not i have spent countless of hours killing hundreds of zombies to clear out a big piece of farm land just to spend even more time searching dumbly for seemingly common tools in order to have any kind of chance to survive and then you have the second problem of water you will need a lot of it especially for farming and it s extremely heavy which means the game is basically forcing to you live near water sources another serious randomness issue you will run into is finding axes saws in order to make logs and planks don t find any forget about trying to build a base just scavenge forever is a semi viable strategy for a fairly long time if you know what you re doing but that gameplay loop turns mundane real fast what about the combat well it s sorta broken with zombies randomly ignoring being pushed and getting a hit on you in a game where a single scratch will end your run due to there being a chance of you getting the zombified infection that can t be cured in any way shape or form just be careful or wear armor zombies in this game are extremely plentiful and firing any sort of gun to avoid being scratched will form massive hordes chasing you in no time ammo is rare and armor clothing crafting is another case of requiring several rare items while also being unreliable uhh play with friends in multiplayer to even the odds it s bugged to sh t mostly because they only had a beta up for like 3 days before pushing it out as released tl dr avoid this turd like the plague and go play cataclysm dark days ahead instead it s free and infinitely better in every way
