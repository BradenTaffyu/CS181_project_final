2022 early access review here we go i ve played this game since it launched for early access and i often stop playing it for awhile and then comeback after a couple of months to see if anything has changed i m displeased so to say that it has not the game has a lot of potential for sure but it does not get the attention it deserves from the developers bannerlord has now been on early access for more than 2 years i believe and the full game will be released this year it is said which i do not believe taleworlds has had almost a decade to prepare and launch a game that we believed was going to be worthy of a game of the year award after such a long wait well that award will not be granted i assure you the game is fun in the beginning but when you reach mid late game it starts to get rusty it is sad that the only way for the game to be fun is if you have 20 mods installed where sometimes the mods don t even work together and the game crashes mid battle hopefully taleworlds gets the message and starts listening to their fanbase more
