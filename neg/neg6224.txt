developers change core gameplay content in the name of balance for a single player game there is no balance nor fun to be found anymore this ruined many builds made many player choices useless or actively detrimental destroyed future gameplay options and didn t appreciably reduce the amount of bugs and errors i recommend actively staying away from rogue trader and any owlcat game or at least refrain from purchasing them on a platform where automatic updates are forced
