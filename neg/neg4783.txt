2018 i love this game but i really shouldn t if house flipper was still in early access i d be giving it a full thumbs up and eagerly awaiting the finished product but it isn t it s a full release game with a full release price tag that plays like a late alpha buyers can completely disappear from the interested list despite resorting to walkthroughs to get every single request met it also makes no sense that a buyer can still buy a property that doesn t meet their needs for some buyers the helpful lists of likes and dislikes feature dislikes in green and likes in red bugs bugs and more damn bugs and i don t mean the cockroaches switches and sockets from demolished walls often stay floating in place and are unmovable yet still count as trash textures disappear there is a house missing an entire section of roof not so much a bug as an oversight perhaps objects such as plants can sometimes be placed on window sills with blinds sometimes the same plant can not sometimes you can place a plant on a bed installing items such as showers or radiators will often simply stop allowing you to click the parts and requires a complete restart of the game to fix though sometimes even this doesn t help and i ve ended up selling a house in a state out of frustration window cleaning can sometimes refuse to let go and requires pressing esc to get out of it staying like this until restarting i could go on i really could very few objects or features in the game haven t bugged out for me and then there s the all important sparse catalogue for a game completely centred around decorating there s surprisingly little to choose from and what is there is largely hideous the lack of consistent naming is also a huge issue beech on one item is not necessarily the same colour texture as beech on another item for example there are few item sets and those that are there are limited one thing in particular that bothers me is the baths both of which have flat textureless grey panels the showers are black if the developers wanted to make a basic bathroom set why didn t they make everything white white goes with everything we ve seen in some houses some very nice items of furniture and bathrooms but these aren t available to buy i m curious as to why the catalogue is so limited and why the textures are so awful when the devs can clearly make far better i think my love for this game is more bloody minded than deserved it could should have been a classic maybe it will be given enough patches and free dlcs i certainly hope so
