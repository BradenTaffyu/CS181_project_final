2018 while there are aspects of this game i ve enjoyed a lot when it comes right down to it the game is fundamentally broken and the devs don t seem to care once you get past the missions and get to the actual house flipping part the flaws start raining down on you the very worst is that your prospestive clients simply don t work they don t follow their own criteria some will offer to buy your houses over and over and over again even though they don t match well at all with their likes in fact sometimes they can have a large list of things they hate about your house and still be the highest bidder but in case you were thinking that was because they were still the best match for the house i can tell you in no uncertain terms that that s simply not true my last and until this game is fixed literal last house i flipped sold to someone who was disatsified with a number of aspects of it the second highest bidder had not a single complaint why the hell would a person buy a house that is full of things they hate over someone who loves everything about it oh and you can t actually use client likes and dislikes to truly guage what to do a number of them have overlapping likes forcing you to have to resort to cheesy solutions like adding children s toys to force character interest down of course since the ai in this game was apparently coded by a crack addled brain dead chimp even then characters will continue to desire a house as if the presence of things they find literally repugnant isn t so bad after all what is the point of the house flipping aspect of the game when the clients are the most broken and temperamental rngesus you can possibly imagine so little of what you actually do how you actually choose to flip the house has any bearing on the outcome why even bother so many people seem wrapped up in getting more items or houses added to the game i d just like it to function as an actual house flipping sim but that doesn t seem to be in the cards
