2020 do not buy this game this game is currently broken head to the discussion page and you will see many complains about save files issues and consistent crashing of the game late into the campaigns i myself have had all my save files being unreadable again if you buy this game now you do it at your own risk of money and time you will likely run into issues late into the game it seems the developers tried to roll out unfinished patches to take advantage of the covid 19 lock down situation and end up breaking the game instead
