2016 i pre ordered the game i followed all the videos and promotional content they released before launch i didn t complain about the pre order dlc from rome 1 and medieval 2 i had a very positive experience with ca and so i let the whole thing slide and show faith how do i feel now i feel like my girlfriend i was with for five years tells me the night i propose to her that she is running off to marry my best friend whom she was dating for 2 years behind my back i feel that cheated why promotionally ca did its best to lure us to buy a game with high expectations 40 higher budget it will look much better at launch this is pre alpha footage our goal is to make rome 2 the best total war game yet we trusted them and gave them money for a product we have not seen what did we get i ll state my positives so to be fair cinematic camera addition of naval warfare it is unplayable but is the best in the series p depth and number of factionsto the important stuff battles super awkward formations and unit movement no realistic collision between clashing units ironically rome 1 had more realism than its successor animation seems idiotic and fake individual persons interact only 1v1 so if even if they are outnumbered one unit can survive waves after waves of enemies when charging units awkwardly stop and lose momentum instantly and this applies to the entire unit music is unspirational and does not change with battle conditions control areas in open fields whaaat instead of playing the enemy and thinking strategically you run to a controll area stay for a little time and you win the battle battles are super short ai is stupid beyond imagination buggy and laggy as hell naval battles are even more broken and buggy ui makes no sense all units look exactly the same one spot for unit condition so you lose precious time to understand all the status ailments of a unit e g fighiting taking fire firing etc and much more campaign ai is even more stupid than that in battles diplomacy is broken with out any explanation of what led to an ally s enemy s particular decision ai decisions are spontaneous very easy even in high difficulty level building system makes no sense loooooong wait turns and much more overall rome 2 is a beta game it is blunt boring and uninspirational i attribute the fiasco to awful project management but i can only speculatei understand ca tried to mend it with continious patching but a game so flawed in its core is unfixable no matter how you try to improve specific features also when you talk about patching at launch means you should not have launched in the first place
