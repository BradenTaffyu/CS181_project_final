2020 nice read this if you want it s kinda meh and i personally wouldn t recommend it but i did have some decent times playing the game there are moments where battles are big and you barley scrape out a victory but i can get that out of any other total war game most of the time i was trying to figure out why i kept playing because it was pretty boring that s just my opinion and i don t want to discourage anybody else from buying three kingdoms if they are super interested in it i think a lot of people could enjoy this game but i caution them because the game loses its wow factor very quickly i guess it s the ocd but i really did try to play the game and explore its mechanics in the end though it wasn t for me the new campaign mechanics are cool and diplomacy was really improved but i found myself doing the same things i would in other total war games i make trade agreements and form alliances when i think it s beneficial and then i move on with my conquering in this game though the diplomacy feels forced instead of a nice addition you ll spend a lot of time in the diplomacy menu but a bunch of stuff is locked until you get higher up in the imperial court i understand unlockables but for extra diplomatic options i mean come on if diplomacy is supposed to be super exciting then let me explore all of those super exciting options from the get go sure you can say that it could should be locked behind research but i don t play total war for diplomacy or research options in every game diplomacy has been an edition to enhance the overall product it is not the defining feature of the games nor was it required to complete them in three kingdoms though every other turn the ai is at my doorstep asking for a stone monkey that gives minor bonuses to a unit and i m wondering why it s willing to pay thousands of gold for minor stat boosts to one character maybe that stone monkey really is something special because i m not kidding when i say they come knocking every other turn it gets annoying when you just want it to be your turn again so you can continue playing the game in all seriousness though the ancillaries random items that you can get feel kinda pointless and just there to add extra content and make the game more like warhammer in that regard this statement goes for most of the other new campaign mechanics as well that feeling of filler content the spying system seems really cool but i forgot about it until around my 45th hour because it never really felt necessary it was there for an extra option to tackle a situation which i think is a cool idea but i don t really care the amount of times it comes in handy can be counted on your hand maybe two if you re lucky if it has worked for other players i think that s great because you re utilizing all of your resources to conquer the game outstanding move i didn t find it all too helpful though and it took too long for me to stay interested the building mechanics are interesting and certain provinces containing specific resources is a nice touch but it s also pretty limiting every province will have the same required buildings and then you ll probably specialize towards the minor settlement s color money type good on ca to experiment though the battles can be good when you re outnumbered but there are still problems calvary is way too op and infantry feels borderline useless at times because they don t do anything except act as a meat shield for the other units archers are ok and artillery can be really good but after so many battles shooting enemies from afar isn t that fun in an ancient setting as for units sure we can argue variety but i think too much variety can be a bad thing in certain regards i ll say that you will use your basic units throughout the game but everyone has said that so you can make your own decision on what you care about now basic units aren t bad but i would like to see more of a progression or purpose behind every unit i think shogun 2 does a great job with its unit variety i m not crazy while there are few units each one has a specific purpose and can be used throughout the campaign peasant spearmen serve a different purpose than samurai spearmen and so on but they are still both important however enough of that this is three kingdoms the battles feel like warhammer battles without all of the extra stuff is it bad no is there better yes personally prefer a more realistic and slow battle to a quick skirmish but i do understand the reason behind this not everybody has time nor do they want to spend the time to fight long battles go play ultimate general civil war for long battles it s super good even if the graphics aren t amazing the battles don t feel like they have much of an impact though it s hard to describe but when i win a battle in three kingdoms there s always another army right behind it when i take out all but one of yuan shao s provinces he still has an entire stack of troops waiting for me the biggest reason i play total war games is for the battles and they feel like a second thought in this game maybe they were and the campaign was the biggest focus but it didn t cut is for me it s too fake looking and feeling and while i love both the fantasy and historical games i don t think combining them was the best move and that leads to the biggest fault i think this game has it tries to please every member of it s audience so you end up with a bunch of good ideas from all of the other games that are jumbled together but not super polished and it ends up feeling underwhelming because the other games do their specific good ideas better for example warhammer battles they are a crazy cluster of the most random crap i ve ever seen and it feels great but i don t want to see that in a historical title i don t want to see a fantasy game with slow battles of line infantry fighting and yes i know that this is a romanticized version of china but i also feel like they tried to blend fantasy and history too much they put in records mode to make it more historical but it still feels just as unreal as romance mode i had a records mode battle where my general unit got 867 kills i took a picture and i can tell you that that s more than any unit has ever gotten in my romance playthroughs i didn t even realize he was clapping cheeks until the battle was over but this is my point even the more realistic mode feels fake but the fantasy mode isn t something spectacular either so you end up with this awkward game in the middle that has an identity crisis all in all i m gonna say that it s up to you to decide i mean it s dynasty warriors total war it has it s moments but those can be few and far between read some other reviews both positive and negative don t let the negatives scare you but don t be too persuaded by the positive ones that only say good things you may find enjoyment out of this and i honestly hope you do but it wasn t for me last thought i will say that my latest playthrough was modded and there were some seriously awesome battles but a game shouldn t have to be modded to be good and mods should be used to enhance an already good game think mount and blade style unless you hate that game
