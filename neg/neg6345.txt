2023 hogwarts legacy is good enough attempt of avalanche software to make climatic wizard game based on books that lack enough depth and complexity to make full open world triple a game out of it tldr the game probably is good enough for the fans of the harry potter series and there is no harm in enjoying art even if questionable person is behind the pen the main problems though in my opinion are completely outside of the whole drama and they will be addressed below that includes worldbuilding world design interactivity dialogue ubisoft open world and fear of warner bros executives that the game will not be big enough to justify whatever original price they put on it we should start with the biggest issues i have finishing at some minor inconveniences 1 worldbuildingthe world of harry potter and hogwarts legacy has the benefit of the real world essentially creating endless possibilities to warp it and change at will fitting the fantasy world of wizards and witches endlessly trying not to bring muggles into their business this alone should be enough to make one hell of a universe universe that hogwarts legacy barely expands on that harry potter movies altered to bare minimum enough to make couple of movies out of it the thing is videogame is not a movie and it requires quite a lot more work to create believable enjoyable and well put together world that does not need explanation outside of environmental storytelling on its own 2 ubisoft open world designsecond most visible and painful problem is the checklist well known from ubisoft productions like assassins creed so called fillers that they re giving players to sink hours into completion that has nothing of value but cosmetics upgrades craftables hogwarts legacy has quite a lot of them and i can only assume that they were made purely to fit the popular world designs of triple a games that we were fed for past couple of years once you try any of those collectables once all of them work pretty much the same and there s way more than enough of them to give you a headache especially if you re a completionist what also stands out is that every cave has exactly the same design every bandit camp is the same thing and there is simply not enough unique locations to do something better with it 3 dialoguei should put it in the first place but considering that game with mute protagonist and npcs that you can talk not even once to in order to complete the game it lands on third place just because it exists in this game and it is beyond annoying most of the characters are boring and their dialogue is something you would see more in a parody of harry potter more than actual and serious game side quest dialogue is stiff and feels like not enough budget was put into minor background characters while everything was pumped into cutscenes including characters vital to the main story 4 speaking of side quests considering that i did not finish the game yet and i m probably not even halfway through it i can t really have an opinion on main story but so far every single side quests i completed was just a simple fetch kill gather quest that also feels like a filler in addition to world design issues i stated earlier i believe there are some quests that are interesting but i am yet to complete them 5 interactivitynearly non existing this one is essentially dropped from avalanches to do list you can spin the globe pet the cat have some beasts whatever interactions with what matters are not there you can get one liners from some students in the castle every interaction that starts the quest is something you would expect current ai robots to do it is not believable characters just stand waiting for you to approach them do your thing come back and then never interact with them again for a videogame following this design you would expect to find characters asking for help midway through the thing they ask you to do not just stand and wait for their savior if you take into consideration games like red dead redemption 2 hogwarts legacy is 10 steps back in terms of interactivity with the world i will not mention the whole choice matters thing because there is no choice to nothing 6 world design and aestheticsthe most important to me certainly not to others i will start by saying that designs in this game are wonderful ambience and aesthetics of the castles interior are on par with elden rings the problem starts when you re getting bored of the castle and you want to explore outside of it because there is not a lot to explore if you take the checklist locations you re really left with couple of places that shine the most i think that while with real life locations such as hogwarts being in uk worldbuilding gets the most opportunities to shine while world design can get tricky to pull off and you can clearly see that just flying around the map couple of extraordinary locations on a simple map with just mountains and plains is something that horizon zero dawn was suffering from and it is a shame
