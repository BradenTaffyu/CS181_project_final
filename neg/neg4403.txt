2017 iv e been playing civilization since civ2 the series seems to get more shallow as they go along first there was sacrifices made to increase playability for multiplayer then recycling content to continue producing expansion packs now to broaden the playerbase there has been too much simplification that takes the fun out of managing your civilization it s starting to feel like civilization revolution which is very unfortunate all of this has ruined one of the greatest aspects of the game replayability returning depth to the managment aspect would increase the quality of civilization by a lot
