2021 war thunder is an amazing game that revolutionizes many parts of the gaming industry from small quality of life features such as tow cables to its massive scope from the interwar period to the modern day however this creates another problem war thunder is a monopoly of a game and gaijin the company that develops the game treats it as such war thunder is the only game in existence that offers what it does so if a player wants something that war thunder gives they have to go through war thunder a game which suffers from dozens of tiny cuts of annoyance that drive old players to leave and gaijin makes its money off of constant transplants of new players paying money to get some of the action themselves go to any prominent war thunder youtuber and they alone will have over a dozen videos detailing individual problems with the game and how the whole community gives feedback on so many issues only to fall upon deaf ears or at least ears that don t seem to care for determining which is good feedback and which is malicious anything from the gameplay being unbalanced to the grind involving over a year of dedicated work to other small problems contrasted with the ever increasing number of late game and premium vehicles that are increasingly unbalanced in the matchmaking algorithm and much harder to get in the first place show gaijin s lack of genuine care for making the game one worth playing for fun since it is a free to play game i don t want to stop you from playing in the first place but i beg you do not pay any money support youtubers and twitch streamers and other content creators that bring up problems with the game and see for yourself what war thunder truly is not only for your sake but for the sake of the whole war thunder community which continues to be supported by transplants of new players such as yourself as old players bleed from open wounds that gaijin does not bandage
