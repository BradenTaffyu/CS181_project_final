2021 the game asked me in a pop up to leave a review similar to how a mobile game does you want my review he s my review i have waay more hours into this game than what steam says i ve been playing this game since 2014 most of the time without steam and with gaijin s own launcher gaijin is one of the most greediest inept and downright scummy developers i ve had the unfortunate fate to stumble upon gripe 1 the grindthis game takes months without spending real money to get the next vehicle you want once you reach tier iii i remember being super excited to get to research my tiger i h1 long before the e ever came out and it taking me close to 2 months of grinding just to get enough research to unlock it the tiger 1 h1 at this point is only a mid tier vehicle imagine the grind once you get to modern vehicles i m currently researching the f 104a this jet takes 390 000 research points in a good game where you don t immediately get thrashed very common see gripe 3 for more details you earn about 1500 research points a typical game lasts about 20 minutes at this rate it would take you 260 good games or 86 hours of continuously sweat level gaming to unlock this jet without real money that is close to half a week of no sleep no family and no job to unlock this jet and this isn t even taking into account gripe 3 gripe 2 the economyanother way gaijin entices you to spend real money is through the economy of the game in this game you have a multitude of purchases you have to make to progress and do good these purchases are facilitated by the in game currency you earn through play there are many upgrades that you purchase in this way for your vehicles that bring you onto a level playing field because most people will have the upgrades and will put you at a severe disadvantage for instance just unlock that new shiny tank that you ve been grinding for weeks well now you need to get the upgrades for it one of the upgrades is a fire extinguisher take a shell to the fuel tank and it set your tank on fire you need the fire extinguisher it is one of the most crucial upgrades you will need bomber drops a bomb on your tank in spawn and takes out your engine guess you ll be sitting in spawn for the whole time you want to use that tank or bail out early and pay full repair cost oh what s repair cost only the most infuriating aspect of the economy its pretty simple your vehicle blow up you pay in game currency to repair it so you can use it again you want to know how repair costs are determined oh funny you should ask they have a base cost that is then raised based on the very upgrades you need to do good how is base cost determined who knows its completely arbitrary have a tank that gaijin thinks is too good for the tanks it faces lets just up the repair cost on that so you lose money every time you want to use the awesome tank you spent weeks grinding yes once you get to higher tier 4 more often than not you will be losing in game currency instead of earning more like you did in the previous tiers all of this together is meant to force you to buy premium or buy the currency outright this wouldn t be so bad if the prices weren t so sky high ridiculous want premium for the month that will cut your grind in half cough up 10 a month don t have any enough in game currency to buy that f 104a that will be 20 dollars to just buy the jet you still have to pay to select a crew for the jet and even more to for the upgrades on the jet that should come standard you re looking at about 35 to get just 1 jet airworthy gripe 3 the time machine veteran vehicle mo problemsthis gripe could actually be two gripes but they are so closely related i ll bunch them together so to start with vehicles have arbitrary battle rating that gaijin gives each vehicle so that they can matchmake their games and attempt to have balanced games the only problem is that these battle ratings are often historically inaccurate and would never take place in the real world battle ratings exist to punish good vehicle designs here s an example remember my tiger i h1 from above it has a battle rating of 5 3 the way matchmaking works is this tank can be placed against any other vehicle within 1 full point of it now wait you say doesn t that mean you have the opportunity to stomp lesser tanks yes that is a possibility but most of the time that won t happen the way the game actually carries out matchmaking is that it will uptier you what i mean by this is say you were in that tiger i h1 90 of the time you are going to be placed in the higher 6 3 battle rating games now beings that you are in a german tank you re going to primarily see soviet and american vehicles pitted against you so what are some vehicles that exist at the same battle rating as your tiger from these other countries first one that comes to mind is the pt 76b the pt 76b is a 1950s era soviet apc arv a 1950s vehicle going up against a vehicle that was design a whole decade prior this is extremely broken in play as the pt 76b has access to more modern munitions that will slice through your tiger like butter and has better acceleration due to its low weight absolutely broken for the americans you have a slew of shermans with 76mm high velocity guns never mind the fact that most shermans at this point still had 75mm guns that shot slow rounds we re sending your tiger against vehicles that were meant to contend with your big brothers the king tiger and panther lets move the examples over to my other grind american planes i have a f 86f 25 sabre i regularly encounter av 8 harriers a jet that was produced for korea is going against a 1970s jet that is still in service today you will get eaten alive by the air to air missiles that other jets have that your sabre does not because they either weren t invented yet or gaijin added your version of the sabre in before they embraced modern vehicles and their modern armaments that s right i can go find sabres that were added more recently in other countries tech trees that have air to air missiles but the country that designed the jet and the missiles the other jets have does not have a single sabre with missiles this illustrates that gaijin does not care about making veteran players happy they only care about releasing the next vehicle to bring in more cash so they can line their pockets in summary do not download this game do not give this scummy company your hard earned greenbacks and most certainly do not think they actually care about your criticism these issues have persisted in the game for years and they have not lifted a finger to correct them there are many more issues i could of discussed but these are the three that come to the top of my mind that infuriate me the most about this game you could google gaijin net agent or war thunder shill to get a quick glance at a couple other issues
