2014 where to start with rome 2 well it looks nice i guess but promised way too much if you re coming to this from rome total war then you ll notice a lot that is different and not so much in a good way the game is literally still riddled with game breaking bugs 1 year from release even after hefty patching that seems to have just covered up an otherwise sinking boat ai that doesn t know how to siege your settlements the game engine itself struggling to cope with 2 full armies on the field at once resulting in a perfect fps on your part but the units in game moving in a stuttering motion being just one bug that s been there from release and has yet to be fixed the huge battles take such a toll on your system even though on paper your machine should be able to smash this game leaving you feeling bitter for the price you ve had to pay for a series that keeps letting it s fans down but lying to them to get their money again there are a few interesting features like on the campaign map how you have to deal with dilemma s in your empire i like that makes you feel like your involved with you populace on a personal level there is a large unit variety which is nice but after a certain point if you re not playing as rome your empires tech just stops which has also been a problem in previous total war titles for example rome has a meagre power in your game but they can still happen upon the tech for their heavily armoured and well trained legions yet if you re playing as another faction then a few upgrades later is all you re going to get there is too much that is wrong with this game and i ve found that contradicting something the creative assembly has said gets you insta hate from their fanboys which is a constant on the forums or blocked entirely from saying anything constructive about the game at all with a mix of bad customer service bare faced lying to their customers and combined with a broken game this total war game isn t worth your attention unless it s on sale for a very low price
