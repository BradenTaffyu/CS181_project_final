2021 this used to be one of my favourite games but now i cannot recommend it at least for now klei merged the codebase of dlc spacedout with the base game and now every weekly half monthly update in dlc creates issues in the base game i purchased the base game oni after its official release just so that i don t have to deal with the issues of earlyaccess but now its like we are back in earlyaccess just without any significant content update or performance optimisation to enjoy this game better you will need mods but each update in the dlc now breaks the basegame oni s compatibility with mods if you play this game with mods than you will need to create a new game after every update because each update in dlc will break your savegame in base oni to be frank these are not the main problem the main issue is that klei does not provide us with options to play with previous versions of the game we have this option in other games like factorio rimworld etc
