2017 this game is simply unfinished civ is an amazing game when developers fix countless bugs and include features like multiplayer teams and production queues also after paying 50 for a game that isnt finished developers are apparently working on additional dlc which i have to pay more for i sincerly hope this issues are resolved soon
