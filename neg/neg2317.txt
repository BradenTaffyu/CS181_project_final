2022 this is a frustrating and sad review to write i loved this game loved loved loved it could be as chill as i wanted or as intense i ve come back to it time and time again every so often i return and play for hours listening to the chill music floating on the waves but this latest update i i hate it i do not like platforming no i hate platforming i don t buy games with heavy platforming because it s not enjoyable in any way for me it s frustrating and i have no interest in rage gaming i play to release stress not add to it why they decided out of nowhere to add a bunch of mandatory platforming in this latest update is beyond me absolutely nothing about it makes sense it s bizarrely forced the platforming areas don t even make sense why would the people of a town built above water build a series of rotating fans above platforms fans that aren t even above anything so serve absolutely zero functional purpose at all it s a crammed in obvious video game platform level in a game that otherwise has felt very organic for lack of a better word and not gamey at all and if you are going to force platforming in your game you best have tight controls and no collision issues all this platforming did is really highlight how loose and clunky the games controls are which was never a noticeable issue before with this recent update you want to play in peaceful mode that s out the window now since there s a slew of aggressive creatures that ignore peaceful settings forced mob fighting you have to fight mobs to get the items to progress and forced boss fights boss fights in raft again why they decided to shoehorn that in is beyond me boss fights in a game like this make zero sense to me especially in peaceful mode don t offer a peaceful mode if your game doesn t allow it to me the latest update absolutely feels like a different game entirely it s like the developers saw what subnautica sub zero did and decided to try to cram that into their existing game it doesn t fit it s disjointed and jarring it adds a level of difficulty and frustration to a game that did not call for it the last areas are a different game one i personally would not have bought if you do like platforming jumping puzzles and boss fights then this may still be a good game for you but i do not before this update this game was a solid 8 10 maybe 9 10 for me the newest areas are a 4 10 for me at best so i guess i m putting it away incomplete after over 170 hours of gameplay i think i ve returned to raft for the last time
