2020 i would like to start this review by saying that i begrudgingly hold the belief that this game isn t necessarily bad but as a longstanding fan of this series i can can say that this game was a major disappointment that not even the modding community could save for me if you ve spoken with anyone i m friends with they could tell you about how i drone on and on about my hatred of this game and for sure i m going to at length about it in this review however i feel that i should start things off on a positive note and go over what i think bethesda did right in this game without further ado let s get on with it shall we the positives the crafting system at least in regards to the weaponry was outstanding and while i do believe it has some room to be improved upon it truly is best we ve seen in the series thus far the gunplay is actually pretty decent in this game and from what i ve heard id as a hand in that if true i can honestly see it though dipping my toes in the negative side of this review for a moment i do feel that there was a little too much emphasis on the gun mechanics over the actual rpg mechanics for bethesda standards the companions in this game are rather outstanding sure they re not on obsidian s level but then again who really can match their level of writing in that regard obsidian have always been good at writing secondary characters something i first noticed in kotor 2 on the other side of the spectrum bethesda have always been kind of bad at making compelling companions in their rpgs that said i have to give them props they did really good on the supporting characters in this game and hopefully that continues through in their future games the voice acting on the male main character is actually pretty good that s the only positive thing i can say about the voiced protagonist however and really we ll get into all my gripes in the negatives but i ll just say this brian t delaney did an amazing job with what he was given it seemed like he had a lot of fun with the role and from the interviews i saw with him he s an absolute sweetroll the neutral honestly i ve wanted a good base building mechanic in a fallout game since fallout 3 i m still waiting for an actually good base building mechanic but hey what we ve got isn t necessarily terrible and with mods you can hardly tell that it s a janky overly restrictive overly finicky pile of garbage my real problem with this system can t really be fixed with mods though or at least it hasn t as of me writing this review we ll get to that under the negatives though as it stands right now if i mod it to high heaven it can make decent bases how i want it to so whatever it was nice getting payoff on the replicated man quest and doctor li s departure in fallout 3 the institute was pretty much how i imagined it now if only the faction was explored in greater detail but hey that s bethesda for you they re the kings of shallow faction building the negatives oh boy where do i begin i feel like a child in a candy store on free candy day you know what let s start with the rpg mechanics that sounds like fun i still remember gopher a video trying to calm people down when they heard that fallout 4 had removed it s skill system i still remember foolishly being swayed into a more optimistic look upon this change thanks to him boy was i wrong alright boys and girls let s talk about perks perks are the most memorable part of fallout s leveling system they did more than just add basic stat increases they added brand new gameplay mechanics that brought with them new ways to build your character and play in interesting and different ways now let me ask you something do you know why perks can focus on these interesting things to begin with why you don t see that many filler perks in older fallout games because they save all that boring stat increase stuff for the skill system but in fallout 4 todd howard in his infinite wisdom may his light guide us decided to just rip the skill system out of the game and in it s place we just got perks on the surface that sounds nice right nothing but the interesting part of the leveling system the problem is that those basic stat increases got to go somewhere right so what did they do they made them into perks now you may be thinking what s wrong with that well i will tell you i means you re wasting perk point on boring perks just so you can keep up damage wise with the higher level enemies the game throws at you as you level up this in turn takes away from perks you actually want to pick which in turn tones down the excitement one feels when leveling up not to mention they had very few perks to begin with instead choosing to make every perk have five ranks each which sounds cool on paper until you realize that all you re doing is nerfing the effects and making players waste five perk points on one perk just to get it to a point where it does literally anything remotely interesting or useful all of this because skills were taken out of the equation preston garvey baby whooo okay okay so to start with i need to say something i actually like this character but sadly he s not just a character he s also the vehicle by which bethesda shoves the single most insulting and dull part of their whole game right down your throat really what i hate isn t garvey although i won t lie his character is tainted in my eyes thanks to what he s become the harbinger for without further complaining let s get on with it the settlement system alright so the game has a bunch of boring as paste fetch quests that just boil down to go to place kill raiders go back and sometimes it s not even that sometimes it s just go to place build settlement and look some people find that kind of fun i don t i can only be asked to care about my home my base but when you re asking me to build like twenty or thirty fully functioning settlements i just can not bring myself to care so you might be thinking okay so just ignore that questline and do your own thing well you see i would but how do i put this in fallout 3 one of my favorite activities was just picking a direction and exploring heck that s pretty much the best part of any bethesda game you see you never really know what you re gonna find bethesda tends to put all kinds of cool locations and secrets in their open worlds but in fallout 4 part of that excitement is ruined when almost every single location you discover is just another settlement the devs expect you to build upon that they expect you to make interesting and that kind of lazy attitude just pisses me off and makes the whole world of fallout 4 so boring courtenay taylor did a terrible job on the female protagonist s voice she showed next to no emotion and the whole thing felt really phoned in honestly i was rather surprised to find myself hating her performance that much given her stellar performance as best waifu i will actually fight you if you disagree jack from mass effect i was actually looking forward to hearing her work in fallout 4 but in truth my disappointment in her overall performance was just a drop in the hat compared to my overall disappointment in the nerfed dialogue system oops did i just segway into another topic hey boys and girls you ve made it this far into my rant we ve had our good times our bad and everything in between but let me tell you a little something sweetiepie my love mein schatz have you ever played a fallout game before are you aware of how well known this series is for it s in depth dialogue system well it seems bethesda weren t because they dumbed it down so badly it makes mass effect s dialogue system look fleshed out i would love to go more in detail about that and many other things but i hit the character limit so it looks lik
