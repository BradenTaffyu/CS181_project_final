early access review i m forced to not recommend this game for a simple reason lack of updates i find it nonsensical that after achieving critical mass with their work the indie stone has kept a small developer team and they ve even slowed down their production speed mind you this game has sold north of 5m copies and we ve haven t seen a full update just teasers and crowns of rats since 2021 just start hiring modders at this point slingshot the best zombie survival experience into the next level
