2018 early access review so first off clearly i got my money s worth in game time i played this a lot with some friends when i had little other games to play i will admit i enjoyed a fair amount of time in it just wasting time digging building looting killing however it s still a half built game in terms of performance and completion of systems however after all this time and seeing what sort of updates they do i find myself left with a no for recommend this game has been early access for like 4 or 5 years now this is just plain ludicrous it is so dated now it looks like playing a game from the early 2000s and it hasn t even been released all they ever really seem to do is tweak the menu skill stuff a little change art add art remove art never actually completing the actual game just adding in little thing to appease people and give off the image that they re actually working on this game time after time my one friend who is a big fan of the game would go on about oh a new patch is coming it has this and that and the other things i go look it s all just superficial junk that does nothing to make the game actually perform better fix the duping issues complete how water should work instead of just making it glare differently what a joke just always disappointed in what the patches do as they never seem to be moving toward a completed game side note honestly steam needs to start putting limits on ea games i get they won t cause they still get their cut but man this game is a prime example of the problem with it this and dayz are two great examples they will never be complete games prove me wrong fun pimps anyway like i said i clearly got my money s worth in time played it s an ok game but it s not complete new art is not advancing anything i would not recommend it but i wouldn t call anyone that bought it an idiot just don t cry when 2 more years down the road they re still only adding new art models and terrain tweaks and it s still in ea
