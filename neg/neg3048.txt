2022 it s taken me a while to really decide on how i feel about rimworld i have over 100 hours in it and will probably log some more but most of the time i can t really tell if i m even having fun it sells itself as a story generator but none of the stories are all that interesting for starters i love games like gnomoria and dwarf fortress it s exactly my type of thing i like managing things and creating a setting in which an interesting story can take place but rimworld is not that so rimworld has a so called story teller ai which is a fancy term for event script this ai determines when events like raids disease breakdowns drones etc happen there are 3 ai by default only 2 of them worth mentioning one is just an rng it does things regardless of the gamestate the other tries to be interesting and make events happen based on what your colony is like the issue with the interesting ai is that it s very predictable you have a lot of food stocked up so your freezer will fail in some way and it will rot you have a lot of components stocked up so expect every device to repeatedly break down it s more or less if the player is doing well in this regard make them not do well this leads to you just gaming the system and living on the edge of ruin at all times to avoid these events if this were a story it would be a terrible fanfic where the writer s oc is just ruthlessly abused for no reason hence i use the random ai now there are many events in rimworld but few really give you many options which is its main failing as a story generator if there is a raid you must fight them if one of your colonists goes on a rampage your options are to attack them or let them attack you if there is radiation you stay inside if there is a cold snap you hunt for food if there is a physic drone you just endure it the game is asking you a question and both of you know what the answer is if you do not know the answer you fail this barely creates a story simply a list of events that happened independently of each other now to the next thing fights are utterly boring and unbalanced most bullets will spray wildly off to the side of their target even if the gun is of an excellent quality and the shooter is of a high level firefights are just bullets wizzing around randomly and sometimes a bullet hitting something is the end of the fight your heavily armoured sniper can be instantly killed by a bandit with an old pistol meanwhile the sniper shot and missed 6 times the reverse can also happen of course but the point is that the fights are quite unsatisfying they take ages yet are over in a second this brings me to my final point animals it feels like a majority of the events i ever see are manhunting animals or animals who otherwise decide to attack my colonists despite better options many times the game will spawn a pack of small manhunting animals and i have to decide there if i risk fighting them or just accept that i can t leave my walls for a few days even 2 manhunting rats can get someone killed due to the lack of gun accuracy if you have turrets you must also turn these off so they don t wildly spray at the animals and get targeted as even a single manhunting monkey can cause a turret to explode this isn t fun and doesn t make for an interesting story i mean maybe it s funny the first time but the game wears this joke out very fast case in point my last colony 3 people one non violent so two gunners a pistol and a rifle literally nothing happened for 90 of the colony except some cargo pods then a manhunting monkey okay we got 3 lucky shots and downed it then 2 manhunting rabbits we killed one and the other one bit a finger off the rifle guy okay great but whatever we killed both rabbits at this point i m really wanting another colonist so i can do more a quest arrives to rescue someone so i decide i ll do it my base is well defended with the only way in going through a nest of insects so i feel safe sending my two gunners and leaving my pacifist home to tend to the base one day into the journey my caravan is attacked by manhunting chinchillas i try to run but they are too fast so i turn to fight my pistol guy shoots 4 rounds all miss my rifle guy shoots 2 rounds all miss the chinchillas then slaughter them back at base 2 manhunting rats have spawned and saw my only colonist entering a door the two rats break down the wooden door and kill him a man in black arrives and kills the rats he is incapable of dumb labour so at this point the game is over a panther decides to hunt him for sport he had no chance to run shot and missed with 3 rounds and died that s more or less this game the only stories you ll really generate are dumb ones such as the above i have seen all stages of the game and it seemingly never evolves past these petty events and it really explains why a majority of the stories people have of this game are either butchering humans or having some wacky animal wipe them out
