2023 dont waste your time with this game spent thousands of hours on it between console and pc and my honest view is that this game has had so many changes come to the game for the better that instead of being apart of the base game are instead dlc such atv s tents dogs hunting equipment such as stand tripods and every single hunting reserve except layton lake and hirschfelden 7 10 maps imo are all payed dlc 75 of real hunting equipment irl for hunting water fowl are payed dlc aswell most common effective hunting calibers arent even in the base game such as 6 5 30 06 300win 7mm unless you pay for the gun packs which are all separate instead of a bundle of course the hunting experience of the game is a joke too most of it just boils down to sprinting around everywhere with my ar 15 getting withing 200yd and just blasting as many deer as i can in order to get higher level deer to spawn and because the ai is so borked they dont even care im shooting at them and will eventually walk back to that same spot were i shot them 3 minutes later and alot of the time higher level deer like diamonds spawn and sometimes they will just run out of bounds de spawning themselves or just not allowing you to get them rarely if you kill an taxidermy animals they just wont count as trophy s and wont be mountable but ive had this happen sill gun and arrow physics are pretty fun like for instance my 450gr broadhead being able to travel through an entire cape buffalo length wise lmaooverall the lighting and weather of the game is what sells it but the overall graphics are a 6 10 but there not nearly as bad as say a game like the hunter classic but for a game that came out in 2017 is expect better and the story is terribly boring you play as a no name hunter came to get as many diamond trophies as you can and overall the game is just chasing dialouge no real events the most fun story i played was the vurhonga savannah cause i thought the characters even though you never see faces were interestingoverall if you want to play a hunting game that has good hunting mechanics and good animal behavior ai aswell as a wide variety of the most commonly used hunting calibers and an experience with good graphics aswell as story there are better options that dont cost nearly as much money as buying this game and all its dlc i recommend way of the hunter its a 8 10 experience in my opinion that is simply superior to the experience i had in the hunter cotw this games trophy hunting and animal slaughtering with my friends will always hold a special place in my heart
