2014 this game is a mixed bag of epic fighter combat and poorly mismanaged company ethics history gameplay the game itelf can be quite fun and realistic depending on the different modes to choose from in the beginning the game had organized matches the ranged from level 1 planes to level 20 but that was thrown out the window for a poorly implemented 1 5 tier system the effects of fighter combat is still relatively good you can take hits in your landing gear chip a wing lose a flap or propeller and possibly still land it to be repaired aside from that it is a total clusterf k of unorganized and biased combat the new leveling system was implemented to so called make leveling faster but fans pooring in data proved the latter leveling has become a loong grind compared to the false imformation gaijin provided they pretty much want you to go premium just so you can level at the old normal speed the engine behind it is quite beautiful almost any pc can run this game and the graphic settings can be tweaked so you can either have an intense and beautiful battle or an optimized battle that still has decent graphics and details so even your lawnmower taped to a powersupply and running off gas computer should be able to run it with ease given some tweaks the real issue is the constant problems with unbalanced matches unrealistic plane mechanics and pro russian biased company the 1 5 tier matching is complete garbage you will often face planes that should not be in that tier or glitched using squad jumping 4 players 1 in a tier 2 setup other players using tier 3 people use this method to use a higher ranked tier plane to literally slaughter underpowered tier planes in a lower tier match the match making system is broken and has been unaddressed for months the plane mechanics themselves though looking beautiful dont match up to the real statistics of how that plane performed during the war players have made spreadsheets upon spreadsheets of data comparing both real world war data against the game and find it very off so many planes either underperform or overperform there real world possibilities finally as an unwritten and talked about problem of wt is how gaijin a russian game development company has been biased towards the russian nation in the game as sad as it is it has been proven by the fans of the game how badly biased the company has become almost all russian planes throughout all tiers outperform in every aspect of combat russian planes can outturn out climb out run and out gun every single nation aside from the japanese again when comparing real world plane statistics data to the games counterpart it was far off in comparison not even the fire rate of the guns was even close to the real thing so this is why i give it a thumbs down the game is fun for a week or two but becomes quite old after being slaughtered by higher tiered planes in a lower tier match and being out performed all the time by russian biased planes
