2023 i have played since day 1 and can say i did enjoy the start of the game which felt was worth it sadly the enjoyment has been dying down especially with the large amount of wait and dailies weeklies one do you need to do them if you don t wanna get left behind and imagining someone starting late makes me shudder i love project moon work especially the story and world but this game is extremely draining which makes me not wanna play my pc can run cyberpunk with stable fps on high but have constant lag at the start of mission at the end of a mission every time you open anything in limbus this is extremely draining combat especially has felt less and less fun where if you get unlucky and fail one roll even at the max chance your character can just instantly die because the dmg has gotten ridiculous on enemies even if you resist their dmg you can restart fights but it is draining some identity s just become borderline useless because their dice don t go high enough the grind with levels and uptie just becoming bigger and bigger as well don t make it more fun either this is draining the pros of this game is how you don t need to pay for the gacha at all the characters are great and so is the story especially the world building there is a lot of free gacha currency but that is because there tons of bugs that need maintenance to fix i won t play anymore and just watch other play to read the story and identities love you project moon but this game was not for me
