2023 actually never imagined i d negatively review a project moon game but here we are to be completely honest and up front here this review is a result of the summer event controversy i believe that project moon s decision to fire the cg illustrator was bad and short sighted it is especially concerning since the reason for firing the illustrator appears to be because people who were mad about design choices included into the game design choices that the director and others presumably ok ed dug through years of the illustrator s personal account history in order to find something that they might get fired over however at this point i also believe that this is symbolic of several concerning management decisions which may just be a result of being in over their head this event ultimately pushed me to honestly look at my own experience with the game and whether i m even enjoying it and the answer is no i haven t enjoyed it since before the chicken event in terms of gameplay it feels like a hard step down from library of ruina it s clearly been simplified for mobile but it also clearly didn t need to be simplified for mobile as it differentiates combat between a vs mook style of combat and a deeper style of combat in the vs mook combat you select between 2 skills which themselves are randomly drawn out of 3 or using a defensive action which is always available or using an ego action you have no choice over targeting and can t manipulate the combat in the ways that were possible in ruina in the deeper style of combat you get the vs mook combat options and also get to select targets which creates a massive amount of depth unsurprisingly the deeper style of combat is used for all boss encounters and the current challenge mode of refraction railroad the problem with this for me is that the vs mook gameplay isn t engaging in any meaningful way it s just boring filler between the part of the game that i actually like the story that occasionally gets extra annoying when auto targeting puts me in a situation that manually targeting never would ve e g a character getting staggered and then being unable to redirect attacks aimed at them there s really no reason to do anything in this combat other than to pick the win rate option and occasionally pop an ego this is exacerbated further because in addition to typical gacha grind encounters they fill the story chapters with these vs mook encounters to space out the cutscenes one chapter has something like 40 fights that are not challenging or interesting in any way unless you intentionally make them harder by bringing underleveled and underperforming identities to get to the parts of the game that are actually fun the story the unique dungeons and the challenging boss fights but then that comes to the second problem the inclusion of full on gacha mechanics has started to result in power creep with identities that are just blatantly overpowered while library of ruina had similar identities they cost 0 which made it less of a problem at release it wasn t as bad but some of the newer identities coming out are just silly and trivialize the challenge content i think this will continue to become a greater balancing problem over time because to be honest project moon struggled at balance and creating challenging content in library of ruina where they could just assume everybody had the strongest cards the story is still great at least and the dungeons still have a glimmer of hope that they could become deep enough to legitimately be fun but honestly as it is i d rather have read limbus company s story as one of project moon s web novels rather than playing it in this format
