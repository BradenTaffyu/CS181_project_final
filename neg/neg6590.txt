2016 this review is one giant rant butthurt fans go away please i have played the souls games for hundreds upon hundreds of hours each the only one i haven t played is demons souls i hate on this game because i love this franchise and i m willing to see each and every fault in each game and after playing this game for over 140 hours i can safely say the following is dark souls iii an enjoyable experience that is worth your money for the most part no first off the immense lack of polish this game is a reused asset wonderland every player animation some enemies most armor sets weapons even entire freaking locations and concepts are reused rehashed from older titles i can t find a speck of originality in this game which is a big dissapointment people claim that it s fanservice or an homage to the older titles my cynical brain sees it no more as laziness cause they were too busy making the awesomeness that is the old hunters dlc for bloodborne at least dark souls ii had the freaking courtesy to refurbish and refine reused armor sets and weapons such as giving the elite knight set a static left pauldron so it wouldn t clip so bad for example and what do they do in 3 they bring it back obviously cause they just ripped the armor set straight from dark souls 1 and added some physics to the movy bits just like what they did with every other armor set from older games also bugs lots of em this game is so unbelievably poorly optimized that its actually amazing even people with the recommended graphics card can t run this game lag spikes abound weird enemy ai glitches random all over the place this game is a bug ridden mess next the gameplay fromsoft was sitting in their office thinking to themselves man people really like bloodborne let s just take all the enemies from that game and just put a slow ass dark souls 1 pc into that bowl of rape and that s exactly what they did pretty much every enemy is annoyingly quick recovers way too quickly has way too much health and kills you in 2 3 hits in bloodborne you have massive speed a fast quick changing weapon and a gun to compensate for this but in a dark souls game you have no such advantage making every death feel cheap and undeserved lothric knights are a good example of what i mean spamming shield bashes constantly and attacking faster than a longsword r1 all the while having actual freaking poise poise let s talk about that for a moment working as intended they say apparently all it does now is keep you from losing i frames on your next roll after being attacked so basically poise is useless there is no benefit to wearing heavy armor anymore hyper armor is the new poise practically but all you need for that is a big weapon this game doesn t promote smart movement or movesets it promotes a whole lot of quick r1 spam emphasized by the dark sword and estoc pvp metas also parry frames they bring back the crappy dark souls 2 start up frames which was fine in dark souls 2 i mean in 2 enemies were fairly slow and predictable which warrants the use of startup frames but in this game where everything is insanely quick and hard to follow startup frames makes parrying in pve a complete hassle and pointless when you can just r1 spam and stunlock your way to victory like a toddler it s pretty ridiculous when a caestus is more reliable parry weapon than a buckler by the way i will say the early introduction of the soapstone and the red eye orb is a fantastic choice along with the password system making this game the most enjoyable souls game to play with friends the fact that my sl 15 buddy can summon my sl 110 character and i ll be downleveled to compensate quite nicely is a great addition and something that was truly needed in past souls games theres also the little things like being able to cancle the roll after a jump or quick switching to the first item in your hotbar that makes this game extremely convenient at times allowing you to move through your hotbar hassle free also gestures despite the fact that most of them are again reused assets they are still a great addition i wish you had more gesture slots in your hotbar because there are just so many good ones im normally not this with souls games i love the souls series because when i die in these games i usually feel at fault i usually feel like there was something i couldve done to change that situation and so i try again but in dark souls 3 i just feel cheated i feel like whatever i do is just luck a roll of the npc die see what i did there to see whether or not an enemy knight spams like he just snorted 40 lines of cocaine or if he just sits there and lets me guardbreak him each enemy is a freaking roulette wheel next bosses bosses for the most part suffer the same problems as normal enemies your a freaking snailman when compared to any enemy in this game that goes for the bosses as well there s the chore bosses like wolnir and the cursed rotted greatwood which are never difficult fights more so incredibly annoying also the bullet hell that is the crystal sages fromsoft knows how much everyone loves the cloning magic user boss they know we love it so much they made this one actually do some freaking damage to the point that he ll one shot you if you don t have perfect 360 degree vision or a summon the lords of cinder are all complete jokes bosses the abyss watchers a boss with amazing lore great first encounter awesome looks and the best song in the whole damn game arguably one of the best souls songs of all time and yet the fight itself is reduced to a clanking ganking spam fest of cheese full of 7 hit unending combos with perfect tracking they lack poise which once again promotes the belove r1 spam as opposed to actually using your human brain for actual human function and then they top it all off with a crappy bootleg maria from bloodborne which just adds on top of the already spammy combos aldrich is more of a magic spamming nuisance than an actual fight yhorm is the most dissapointing a giant anticlimax to one of the most hyped up fights in the entire game lorian and lothric are the only good fight out of any of them being incredibly enjoyable and tough at the same time theres also the super fast spammers that give you no breathing room like the dancer or champion gundyr pretty much any human style boss is just a neverending wombo combo spam fest and the final boss good ol cinderbro is just as spammy and tracking as the rest of em its a really neat idea to have a boss use only abilities available to the player great idea horrible execution you know what game had player style bosses and did it right bloodborne gherman gascoigne maria all amazing fights that truly felt like a level playing field meanwhile this guys over here with tons of poise being unparryable and a having a 65 damage dealing 6 hit combo in his second phase with insane range and perfect tracking fun all of these fights can feel like a chore feeling either insanely unfair or cheap on your own or way too easy and boring with a friend or two now there are plenty of fights that i actually find myself enjoying iudex gundyr is always a blast nameless king is always a great endurance battle vordt the deacons dragonslayer armor even pontiff sulyvahn i feel are all relatively fair and balanced fights that are always enjoyable overall i believe this game is not worth your time if you re a diehard souls lover get it on sale don t pay full price if you re new to the series thanks to dark 3 s successful marketing i suggest you spend your time on dark souls 1 2 or bloodborne first before deciding to pick this one up despite what people say dark 2 is a great and solid game in my opinion and perfect for newcomers to the souls series
