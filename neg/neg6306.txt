2023 the story and graphics are the best part about this game now on to the bad my opinion the camera angle during combat is terrible the enemy tracker is so weak its crazy the climbing holds your hand there is no drop button no jump button its just very basic the level based rpg stuff is whatever personally i think its unnecessary majority of the enemies are red or blue some enemies don t flinch during attacks you can die during your runic special moves you cannot stop or cancel them so too bad so sad i could keep going but to save time overall the combat is extremely flawed i think the that this is one of the most overrated games ever and the fact that this won goty is hilarious this reminds me of the last of us but norse mythology and less walking although there is still plenty of that overall i don t really care for this game even though i have 30 hours lol i m going to give this game a 6 7 10 i would only recommend this if it is on sale and remember this is only my opinion and you may like this game way more than i do or way less note this was my first and most likely only gow that i will play
