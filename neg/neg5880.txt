early access review admin abuse alerti am writing this review to inform potential new players about a serious issue with the game in our case specifically on the small tribes 9286 server my team and i were globally banned without any warning or violation of the game s rules this is a clear example of admin abuse and it highlights a significant problem with the game s management and support system it appears that we are not the only players affected by this issue many players have experienced similar unjust bans often due to the influence of larger tribes with connections to game administrators this creates an unfair and frustrating environment for those who invest time and effort into the game do not buy this gameif you enjoy playing on official servers and are prepared to invest significant time and effort into grinding i strongly advise against purchasing this game the game is plagued by abusive admins and cheaters and the support staff is unresponsive to submitted support tickets your gaming experience can be abruptly ruined by an unjust ban simply because a larger tribe has an admin friend in conclusion the game suffers from severe administrative issues that undermine the integrity and enjoyment of the gameplay until these problems are addressed i cannot recommend this game to anyone
