2017 early access review this game is basically the exact game i got 3 years ago which would be fine if it hadnt stayed in early access that hole time and kept promising things it couldnt deliver small updates that add useless but keep saying we are gonna add the big stuff later and 3 years later oh now we have a smoker trait its an ok game but its not the game i was told i was going to get either wait for it to be fully finished before purchasing or dont get it at all or youll be waiting for another 3 years for the final game to be released
