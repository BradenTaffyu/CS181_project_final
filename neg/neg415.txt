2023 this game is so much better than i expected it to be but with that said i don t think i would recommend it fallout 76 is the logical end point if you take fallout 4 and add multiplayer and a cash shop to it many of the features fallout 4 brought to the table naturally lend themselves to multiplayer such as the crafting legendary drops and construction but to be honest i was never such a big fan of those mechanics and the further additions fallout 76 bring to the table such as daily and weekly tasks a seasonal pass and the cash shop just make the game feel exhausting the world here is more interesting than i was expecting it to be and some of the quests i ve done have been really cool the voice acting s pretty good and the game looks pretty good but it ultimately feels soulless and for an rpg even compared to fallout 4 it lacks complexity finally i don t feel that multiplayer has added anything meaningful to the fallout formula and i think there would need to be a total rethink if there s ever going to be a fallout 5 despite everything i think there s the core of a good game here it s just a shame it s all in service of a well service
