2019 not only did the new update nearly break the game for me by rendering the mods i i have downloaded useless but this spyware bs that they have snuck back into the eula is sketchy than anything else i can imagine in addition to that the spyware app drives my ram usage through the ceiling affecting performance i won t be purchasing any more 2k games moving forward and i give this game the lowest marks of any game that i have ever purchased off of steam
