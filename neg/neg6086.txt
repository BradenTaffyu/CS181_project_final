2017 as written elsewhere while the recent global price hike was the straw that broke the camel s back it s clear that paradox has been a terrible publisher for the last years for many of its products coming out unfinished unpolished and with terrible ai anyway i cannot recommend the game in the following state and i would suggest everyone to avoid buying it product quality has been steadily going down with dlcs getting messier buggier and more unbalanced there s a global lack of focus over what should be the project goals for the game it looks like it has become one of those patreon games where the developers have no incentive to improve the game and just get lost into feature creep since as long as the game is bugged or controversial the patrons will give them money additionally some of the dlc create terrible mechanics monarch mana required to do anything meaningful and what s worse sometimes some of these mechanics are enabled in game if you don t have the appropriate dlc but you cannot influence them so you get bitten in the bum with no option but to hope the lackluster ai does sometime useful before you conquer their provinces but while quality and qa is going steadily down pricing has gone up as well as the number of dlcs there s also another thing going down the amount of content in each one i liked their games and their products spent hours and hours on them even before steam however i cannot recommend this game in its current state and especially in the hand of the current developers
