2016 spoilers ahead sigh i wanted to love this game and for a long time playing it i did but i can t bring myself to finish it or even plod around aimlessly delaying the inevitable here s the problem with what happens near the end there s 4 main factions who you can join and interact with and gain companions from you get a feel for what each faction has to offer as well as their unfortunate downsides and one of those unfortunate downsides is trying to make you completely kill off the other 3 factions fallout 3 and new vegas gave you the opportunity to talk your way out of situations and sometimes find peaceful resolutions to the conflicts here nope you gotta kill everyone else because reasons this game is begging for a round table peace conference like in skyrim another bethesda title in case you re wondering why i bring up an otherwise unrelated game get the faction heads together let them yell at eachother for a bit and find a way to bring peace to the commonwealth heck the minutemen railroad and bos wouldn t have to give anything up except in the later s case the pathological need to blow everything up just convince the institute to stop making killer synths and replacing people and everything would be fine but no each faction wants the other 3 completely off the board no matter how many innocent men women and children would die in the process and that s not an ending i want to work towards so i stopped playing and that s why i m not reccomending this game there are other little things too like people continually getting kidnapped even though your town is surrounded by 100 sentry guns but this is the big one for me which is sad because this is an otherwise really great game
