2020 early access review i ve played this game plenty enough to both love it and truly hate it the concept is brilliant and if they ever actually finish the game it will be a masterpiece but and it s a big but it has been almost a decade and every update they send out destroys any playable progress you make and more importantly than that as i ve spent hours today rebuilding a world in creative mode you can t ever build truly what you want creative mode broke for me destroying days of progress and sending me back to a blank world all because i drove five seconds away from my base literally just enough to turn around to test the truck with my gate system no matter how much you love the game its building system or the concept your creations and love won t last it is a man child of a game stuck permanently in its own broken adolescence it will never be worth the money or time investment as it will never via ever erased and rebuilt skill trees or constantly obselete constructions allow you to build something awesome and enjoy it without breaking as you should be able to this game will always update over your creations with equally broken content and it will never as it seems grow any closer to becoming anything more than a broken alpha video game concept
