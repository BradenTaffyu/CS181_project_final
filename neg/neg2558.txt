2017 edit to review so i ve been watching this game closly and the devs are very very active in fixing and tweaking the game they ve fixed some issues i ve expressed below so i now have high hopes for this game it s not perfect but the patching makes me hopeful my experience with this game decide to try stalking a deer follow closely behind on although never getting to see it because it can hear me crouch walking through foliage made of old sun chip bags crouch walking for an hour at least get acheivement for tracking 50 tracks for one animal another hour later finally see deer glitch humping a rock i could walk up to it and it would keep glitching decide that wasn t rewarding so move onto another deer 20 minutes later hear one mating call crouched and moved toward it rinse repeat 50 or so tracks later i have a clear shot aim scope a third grader could hold it more steady decide to try prone my guy must of grabbed a handful of foliage and duct taped it to from of scope take a shot from crouch headshot deer runs away like nothing happened figured well it shouldn t take long to bleed out investigate blood splatter flesh wound stayed stationary for 10 or so minutes had cup of coffee track blood trail 50 or so blood splatters later decide to let it bleed more i go to town shop at the mall go on real hunting trip shoot deer in exact spot as on game it bleeds out within 15 carry deer back to truck drive home gut deer hang meat up smoke a good amount of it go to college for 4 years get married have kids and realize i left game running go back to check it track 50 more blood splatters finally find deer take another shot body hit 10 mote blood splatters later finally find deer body victory rifle skill 1 can t buy anything useful from shop without genociding all deer any real hunting equipment you need 40 hours of gameplay to actually get toactual review weapons it takes far too long to level up to the point of unlocking a new weapon and even longer to get the cash for one it seems like when i earn enough for one weapon i ve unlocked the next one and have to choose to earn enough for that one or buy the lower weapon class one i realize using different weapon classes provides an integrity bonus for example using a lower calibur bullet on smaller game gets you more cash i m not sure if i understand this entirely not being an avid hunter codex very bare bones for information doesn t quite explain the most important issues like how to use certain equipment and why the highest calibur rifle has an accuracy of 0 looked for a wikia and didn t find much but i shouldn t have to use google to have a base understanding of a game callers very very useful almost to a fault i ve been hunting only a few times in the real world and callers have not worked so well for me it seems like i just sprint through the forest hear a warning call use the correct caller and wait seems like the other methods of hunting in this game are much more difficult and i find myself using callers to farm money for hours just to buy a new rifle leveling up extremely slow leveling progression i have 35 hours and about 150 200 animals hunted i m a total level of 15 very few skills i can get and very few perks i understand hunting is a time consuming activity and a simulation should be as realistic as possible but it seems like grinding levels takes the fun out of it glitching i ve experienced many glitches i press esc and it sends me to another reserve after taking a shot with the perk to stay scoped it shows me down the barrel of the gun instead of scope serveral several animals are stuck on rocks and trees e inspect stays until restart of game certain items requiring 0 0 skill remain locked through entire game animals remaining upright after death after coming out of aim it auto spins me 90 180 degrees instantly and animals shot over 300m don t take off running it is a beautiful looking game and has a lot of good aspects to it but the gameplay seems underdeveloped
