2020 early access review one comes to ask where are innovative contents after 8 years of developement animations are almost the same as warband although the graphics are marginally better only a handful of missions tou truly have to find your own fun can be found giving the world a flatness sensation i aknowledge that this is an early access but it seems plain incomplete to me a bad reskin of warband i m looking forward to future updates so i can change my reviewedit seems like some effort has been made in order to update the game like the progression of skills graphics and bugs that s extremely reassuring still not enough to change my review in my opinion the game is still lacking major promised features
