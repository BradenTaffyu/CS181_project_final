2016 this game had the potential to be so much more initially i was totally put off by the game s heavy focus on the settlement building as it gave me the impression of being less of an rpg and more of an rts game however a couple months later i decided to give it a try it took me nearly a month to finally beat this game but ironically my opinion of th game has not changed one bit some of the biggest gripes i ve had 1 the game still feels and plays like fallout 3 the inherrent limitations of the ancient gamebryo engine rears its ugly head here as well its pretty obvious that it never really played well with the pc architecture and was more favored towards the console hardware resulting in some strange cpu fps spikes downwards the reasons for which are a complete mystery to me other than a fresh coat of paint dx11 even then the game s visuals look very washed out at some places to my amazement the vanilla textures consumed more vram than the hd texture i installed later to improve the look of the game you can imagine the amount of effort they spent on optimizing this game 2 witcher 3 raised the bar of what an rpg experience should be sadly the game packs even lesser content than what skyrim had to offer there are very few meaningful and meaty side quests most are repetitive help this settlement rid of mutants help establish a new settlement fetch technical documents obtain viable bloodsample blah blah blah what i found truly disappointing was the game completely failed in post game quests department in case you decided to join the institute there s no meaningful impact of your role in that organization no high tech gear to unlock no improvements or tech available for settlement buildings using institute tech it was so oppresively empty that i lost all interest in the game after the credits rolled 3 abysmal load times most game engines have now become almost completely seamless in that the gameworld is continous which greatly helps in the immersion the interior exterior loading completely breaks the immersion not to mention the abysmal loading times even with a top of the line ssd installed such sloppy piece of work is simply not acceptable here 4 fallout 4 is already quite an expensive game at 60 but the nerve of bethesda to go out and increase the price of the post release content from 30 to 50 belies no impression that they want nothing more than your money i ve honestly lost all respect for this once great studio i will most certainly be cautious before buying their games before release tldr 1 gameplay 6 10 plays exactly like fallout 3 with addition of settlement simulator2 graphics 7 10 upgrade to a dx11 did not warrant in a visual boost i was hoping for very muddy and blurry visual presentation3 rpg 3 10 non existant no control over how much you wish to improve your stats like in fallout 3 new vegas 4 quests very lifeless and bland side quests overall impression 5 10
