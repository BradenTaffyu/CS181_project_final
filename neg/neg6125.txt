don t get me wrong i ve had some fun playing this one and wasted plenty of time the only reason i m giving this a negative review is because it has like virtually no match options to change things up with i m pretty stumped as to why they wouldn t include a treaty mode that s been in every other game personally i find it annoying that i have to dumb down the ai so they re not wiping me out in the first 5min but then have to deal with boring gameplay throughout the rest of the match i guess i m mostly alone in that i enjoy designing and growing my civ more than just trying to smash everything as fast as possible i d have more fun if war between civs were more organized rather than just surprise sacking each others bases maybe i m just doing it wrong dunno i ve tried playing pvp but players are worse than ai at just trying to play as fast as possible just my opinion game looks great though
