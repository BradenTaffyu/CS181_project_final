2022 between tws butchering of the internal systems to force a console launch and their refusal to address community concerns bannerlord represents a feature barren but graphically impressive act of designer hubris the community was used as their beta testers for 3 years only to have all their concerns ignored by the developers they didn t even obtain distribution rights for their campaign textures so modders cannot make changes to the vanilla map in the editor without either not being able to save or the map just being broken the campaign mechanics are non existent and were it not for the modding community the game would be a barely playable mess hugely dissapointed that this is what we got after a decade of waiting
