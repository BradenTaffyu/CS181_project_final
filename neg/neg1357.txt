2022 the game is pretty good but i have no idea why they re releasing it now it still has less content than warband and only really does battles better than it the endgame is still pretty much nonexistant there are no random events the ai is still bad both in battles and in the overworld there s no command for your troops to focus on specific enemy formations so they ll target whoever is closest usually resulting in all your archers shooting at the three cavalrymen instead of the 100 man infantry charge lords have no personalities your conduct or relation with lords still has no real impact there s no diplomacy no alternative ways to power like assassination or bribery the economy is still utterly broken and smithing is the only way to actually profit large battles don t feel decisive because the ai can instantly field another army managing fiefs and castles is still tedious and unbalanced they re basically just drains on your income the culture debuff on conquered settlements is still permanent so you always have to micromanage loyalty and getting married and having a child is still worthless since by the time the child actually grows up and becomes a playable unit you ve probably already conquered the world ten times over there are about a billion more issues both large and small the plague the game currently like bugs and performance problems but you get the point bannerlord does battles and combat well but that s about it they ve said that updates are still gonna come but it s worrying that this is the state that they re fine with releasing the game in i m giving this a negative review not because i think the game is bad but because i think it could ve been a whole lot better if they just kept it in early access for another year or so
