2018 as you can see i really wanted to like this game i played nearly 80 hours and i cannot help myself but be dissapointed at first i was absolutely stunned it s really like theme hospital but new and shiny but then i realized a very important difference between these two games there is no goal sorry but all i have to do is wait wait till 250 patiens are cured wait till 500 patiens are cured wait till some random algorithm decided that your current hospital is now worth 2 500 00 even though you did not buy or change anything within the last five hours of playing and that s it no cute little animation because you are now the best hospital in the county or something like that just a stupid letter which tells you you did it only two more stars to go so now wait till 28746234910460 patiens are cured i am sorry really sorry i wanted to like this game so much but it could have been so much better with a little more love for details and level design so if you want it buy it in sale edit sorry i have to add something now we also have a wonderful dlc which added more stupid boring levels and more boring achivements so that i will never be able to complete this game without giving extra money i will not start this game ever again i prefer my good old theme hospital thank you very much
