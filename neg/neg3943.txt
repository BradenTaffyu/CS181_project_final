2023 product received for free early access review this is my very early review after 2 hours of playing on launch day for now i would not recommend buying this game for following reasons my specs are ryzen 5600x overclocked to 4 6ghz 32gb of ram a nice m 2 drive and an rtx 3060ti gddr6x but still can t go past 25 50fps ish on the medium settings so many frame drops and i didn t even fly yet the game crashes like crazy if you try and change the video settings takes a while to process the changes too nostalgia is great but it s really unfortunate that they didn t learn from past mistakes forcing some coding that would totally f things up i d like to thank for the new ui too it s almost the same but the changes are there and i couldn t let it slide and not tell that i actually liked it that s it for now might update it whenever they decide to fix things up edit do you have some time so here is my 125 hours experience into the game put into a steam review ark survival ascended is a disappointing experience for new and old players on the franchise the lack of communication respect and honesty with the community built what we have today as one of the best yet acting dumb community of all the gaming industry first of all the game does look insanely good if you have the computer to it which by the time i m writing it means nobody runs this game the way it s supposed to be played games do have this problem nowadays where instead of optimising the whole thing and letting players decide to utilise dlss fsr which this game doesn t even have yet and other technology to get even more frames without losing their quality they just don t mind optimising it the game have a powerful engine that is ue5 it has potential but they released it like the game would run on the own engine you know the project before exporting it there s not a single config you will change that will boost your fps out of the blue keep in mind r volumetriccloud 0 sure help but comes with a hit on the graphics instead you could change some settings to have less clouds if you know a little bit about the engine you know those settings exist you can get it working but what about the player that want to turn on the game and play oh that dude he s done buy a new vga i guess the motion blur is tagged on and off by whichever setting you change low off medium off high on epic off how about you let us decide to turn on or off such setting like it doesn t affect fps yeah surprise people motion blur does not affect the damn fps of your game it s personal preference the game still have stones floating around or under the ground invisible water in random places close to the water but not visible to the player the dinos do look amazing in epic texture epic advanced settings by the way if you change it to high it will show the outside lights inside your house because of course it will the amount of dedication the project must have gotten is insane and i do believe the game will get better but after around 20k ark se hours around 2k hours on this steam account that s my current one i d say i do not expect it to get any better without heavy taxes specially graphically speaking the movement feels kinda clunky at times but still easily fixable probably the discrepancy in frametime is the reason i believe so myself it does not utilise more than 12gb ram at 1080p if you think that s the case please select ram per process on your third pary program and you ll see you re wrong if you see higher numbers you re seeing the whole memory of the pc being used that includes 6gb for windows 11 for example plus background programs matter of fact i d rarely see it going above 8gb that changes 12gb for 1440p and 17gb for 4k my cpu as mentioned before ryzen 5600x goes to 30 40 usage with the game server running in the background i ll go back to that in a minute the new ways of dealing with construction feels kinda like s but without the pistol to get things from high above i loved the implementation of degrading item s visuals and armor s visuals depending on how much durability is still left nice touch the water reacting to everything is amazing but demanding too and the forest is just incredibly realistic but again most people specially the ones who will try and run the game with a bunch of console commands are not gonna see those details which is kinda sad since the whole point of the game releasing was to make ark look and feel better about the crashes they re gonna stop eventually from 125h i played around 16h straight without a drop then suddenly i played 30 min and crashed about 3 times on the next day it s a code problem the good point as i said about the nostalgia i always play with my friends i do config a server for us closed by password everybody enters and plays the game and we have a good time but i do a bunch outside of that playing by myself but what have i done lately besides fixing the game and trying to make it look good and work so i can actually play the game it feels like they don t want us to play the game just expecting to play it i m honestly trying to be kind because i do know that there are people in love with this project and would do anything to see it s success but they re not the bosses are they which takes me to the last part of my review they sold their game to snail games i m not gonna take part in any conspiracy theories about the 1 3 bi or anything but another subject that s on the surface to be touched the control nitrado is trying to have over everything making us players have the option to put only one for now server to play so whenever the new maps release we can t put a cluster online huh it s embarrassing if you offer a good service you don t need monopoly to control because people will go back to you services but no you guys can barely make your servers stable let out give ourselves good clusters with good configuration this if not changed by the near future will kill this game alone you wanna play this game wait for the hype to go down and think properly bare in mind that you will need a great gig to play this with my specs i do get 60 fps on 1080p and dlss performance i just can t light a torch or else the fps will go to 20 my friend that helped me with reviewing this game played on her 4090 ti gig she couldn t believe the game would not maintain 60 fps constantly on native 1080p nor any other resolution unless dlss fg is utilised the game does feel good it does bring you back to ark se and it has great potential will they do anything about it only time can tell but for now if you really enjoy downloading a game clicking on play and playing for the sake of it i cannot recommend you that game all that being said if you are one of the people who will play and need help with the fps and don t care even a bit about your graphics here are some interesting commands that work up to this day 11 01 23 for easy ctrl c ctrl v with clouds r volumetricfog 0 r volumetriccloud

any more than those btw if you see someone telling you to put a steam launch option do not the game won t run on d3d11 nor dx95 what the how do you guys put two dx on the same command and expect it to do miracles thanks for your time thanks for the game the people from wildcard and thanks to arkade for the free key also you snail games and nitrado
