2018 the last updates have slowly killed this game people are being banned or lock out off the forums by asking why all there generals are turning to females ca responds by saying there games are historically authentic not accurate having knowledge of the english dictionary i know that sentence makes no sense authentic origin real actual accurate anybody for a gold star if that was not terrible customer interaction they go on to say by taking an example out of ea wonderful business policy if having females generals in the game upsets you either mod it or don t play it people use to buy your games for history not enforced 21st century diversity for diversity sake give your customers the choice please or we will react like we have with ea if you still like history total war games and have this i recommend play divide et impera mod it saves this game plus do not buy any dlc until they learn or teach their customer service some basic service skills or maybe they just hard code our choices or insult the customers more sad times ca go back to games not politics
