2023 this is a well developed game i really want to like this game but it is sadly not for me it was initially fun but after hundreds of hours of play i am simply frustrated what i like great art style soundtrack and effects slap decently intuitive ui for managing resource flow initial challenge level is accessible for beginners but scales quickly over timewhat i dislike as a die hard technical engineer a lot of the chemistry is inconsistent or just too goofy i can overlook the fact that natural gas and polluted water are treated as separate elements but i noticed pretty quickly that fossil energy sources do not consume oxygen or release water steam in a game called oxygen not included i d expect the actual consequences of fossil fuel dependence to be reflected even if that adds to the already ample challenge similarly it irritates me that i have to use energy greedy pumps to move any fluids around there s already a pressure system built into the game so why do i need a pump when gravity and gas pressure will do the work for me i should only need a pump to move liquids from a low place to a high one and instead use a fan usually to move gases through ducts the tech tree is also a head scratcher it s easy to read but a lot of the techs seem out of order or have unstated material requirements that make the tech useless when you need it the most glaring example to me is the steam turbine which while it works as i d expect hot steam in power and hot water out it alarmingly requires plastic to build one since steam turbines are traditionally made from iron alloys like steel i get the sense that the plastic requirement is instead about gate keeping the player from late game tech overall i don t have the patience to learn all of the resource chains for every system especially when they contradict actual processes that could easily have been included in the game oxygen is actually the least of your problems as you will often be running around trying to treat unholy amounts of raw sewage or trying to cool your base from all the thermal power you built to treat that raw sewage could i boil the water to steam and kill the germs yes do i have plastic to make a steam turbine no i am admittedly bad at this game and i absolutely respect the people who have the gift but why would i spend hours reading manuals and forum posts to prepare for hours of play when instead i could solve actual engineering problems that affect real people and be paid for it too oxygen not included clearly has a lot of heart which is why it pains me to say that i find it stressful unrewarding and anti educational i want to be able to recommend this game i really do but i really really can t
