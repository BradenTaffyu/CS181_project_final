i love the game and the interactions between the cards but the game is also becoming increasingly pay to win and i can only imagine it s much harder to get into the game now as opposed to when i did recent new cards have all been meta defining and instantly the best deck card available and even putting in more money than i should have i feel behind if you don t may pay to win there is a very fun quick card game underneath the slightly scummy monetisation enough to hook me as an ex mtg player
