games is sub par with a thousand dlc s that are too pricy for the games age just put them all in a pack bundle bud overall outsude of that gameplay is interesting and certainly ok but the community at this point with my experiences has been a lot of whiff s and not very friendly the community is kinda just boomergedon aka older folks that will scream at you for a hour over their plan to bumrush the enemy and blame you for not shooting everything as soon as it renders cause gun physics exist shaun you can t shoot the dirt and hit a guy in the head then get even madder when you kill more npc then him cause you didnt bumrush the point with a pistol you actually took cover shocking right playing like a npc cover hugger actually works in a realistic sim i have plenty of more short stories about folks like shaun and i only have played roughly 120 hours hence my opinion get a group of buddies before buying then get a bigger group of buddies before joining or interacting with any community in game if you aren t a solo they ll treat you nicer it seems cause you have leverage on their player count cause all the groups left it seems are small and happy to shoot themselves in the foot if its 1 person but less happy to lose like 5 people at a time
