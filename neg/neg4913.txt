2020 this should be a 10 10 positive review however the constant crashing and issues since the most recent update have made this game unplayable this is my first total war game but i was always a huge fan of the three kingdoms history novels dynasty warriors was on of the first games i played on playstation and i played several of the dw tk games that followed i ve read romance of the three kingdoms books and they are still today one of my favorites when i first start playing tw tk i thought it was the perfect game turn based strategy with live battles and a pretty in depth diplomacy system honestly a 10 10 in my opinion i also did not experience any issues with the game at this time i quit playing the game for about a month and when i came back to it it would crash constantly sometimes it would crash all the way to the desktop and the game would have to be restarted sometimes it would flash to the desktop and then come back to the game however when it came back i would have no audio and the graphics would be all messed up no color on the map almost like everything was white out this was not once in awhile either it was every time i played the game crashes would happen during battles during diplomacy pretty much at every point of the game honestly i save often so i really didn t let the crashes get to me until i was in the middle of a battle where i was outnumber 3 1 and i was actually winning nothing really ruins the immersion more than that this game with a recent update has become pretty much unplayable it s a shame too because this was my all time favorite i will absolutely update this to a positive review if the crashing is fixed
