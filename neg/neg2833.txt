2019 this game is pretty good it s not the best paradox title in terms of gameplay or stability but it s a pretty good 4x the problem with this game lies with the publisher while the changes made in update 2 0 were definately for the better the execution was utterly abysmal the game was broken beyond belief and multiple gameplay mechanics and most notably the ai are still not functioning correctly while there are mods that make the ai vastly more competent paradox is supposed to take care of this themselves instead of counting on the community to clean up their mess it s important to note that these failings can in no way be attributed to the stellaris dev team they were forced by the greedy scum that is the paradox management to push updates out before they are ready a pretty common sight for any paradox title these days with ck2 being the only exception on top of that paradox recently announced a microtransaction ridden mobile game supposedly based on stellaris in reality it s simply an asset swap of an equally morally and creatively bankrupt chinese mobile game to top of that the game contained stolen artwork and in a rather insane twist of irony the original game nova empire actually contains assets lifted directly from stellaris itself so to conclude the game itsn t a bad buy in a sale but remember you are supporting a company with a recent track record not unlike the usual suspects like ea blizzard and the other aaa companies
