2023 the game is shallow there is a lot to do but 90 of it is tedious busywork the combat never gets interesting because the enemies always take turns attacking you it s like watching a bad action movie where the hero is surrounded by 8 enemies but the enemies only attack 1 at a time i played on hard difficulty which means i had to play the color matching game to break enemy shields it s a game for children it has no depth and i didn t get the sense there is any replayability i played it through to the bitter end and i have not much to show for it the only time i was genuinely intrigued by the game was when i stood in front of a mirror and it showed my reflection in reverse i was facing the mirror but the mirror showed the back of my head i thought that was interesting and clever but it turns out it was just a graphics bug there was nothing special about the mirror no interesting backstory i will admit that the game did an okay job of showing what it would be like to be a new student at hogwarts you go to class explore the castle grounds and sneak out for adventures you discover a few interesting or whimsical things in the castle for the adventures you re basically always alone which is a missed opportunity to show any kind of friendship or teamwork which might have been part of the books i didn t read them if you want to experience what it would be like to be a student at hogwarts you could play the first 4 hours of the game it s just not nearly worth the price of a aaa title for what you get
