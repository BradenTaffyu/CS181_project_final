2020 initially i was stoked for this game because in my naivety imagined that firaxis was going to listen to the community about changes that needed to be made to civ v maybe they would spice up their new game with mechanics that we hadn t thought of and change the game entirely we got more than we bargained for tldr devs added in too many mechanics that no one asked for and only created too many problems don t buy it unless heavily discounted i don t even know where the place is to begin there are so many annoying facets and just truly unfair mechanics in this game it s hard to narrow it down to which one is the worst feature let s start off with just the sheer amount of micromanaging you have to do in the later periods of the game if you are playing properly then you will have ten to twenty cities on a standard sized map this is not an exaggeration as there is literally no benefit to having a smaller more compact empire you must continuously expand if you want to compete with the ai and other players let s go to the worst aspect of war instant city razing in civ v once you captured a city you could choose to either puppet the city annex it or begin razing it to the ground razing would lower the population each round by one unit unless you chose genghis kahn in which case razing was doubled this was fair you had a chance to recapture your city and outplay your opponent now in civ vi once you capture and raze a city it s gone poof it could have taken you hundreds of turns literal hours making a city with world wonders in it and the devs in their infinite wisdom thought to themselves yeah let s end it there this insult is further exasperated by the fact that nuclear weapons utterly wipe out all the health and walls of a city in an instant to be fair there are countermeasures to being nuked but if someone gets them before you you likely don t have that tech to protect yourself the easiest way to win a game is by pursuing a science victory that s because no one in their right mind will go through all of mental hoops to jump through in order to procure a culture victory unlike in civ v where you could basically spend more of your time generating great writers artists musicians and collecting archeological artifacts in civ vi you have to create national parks and create rock bands both are created with faith so instead of focusing on one aspect of the game to achieve victory you have to dip yourself knee deep into another aspect to have a remotely fathomable chance to win do you remember the trees for culture in civ v i member simple easy to read devs saw that and thought to themselves too simple need more words and features in comes the card system which is absolutely ridiculous in a game with a turn timer there must be close to a hundred if not many more card to choose from in the options there is but one way to sort them by subject not by percentage era or improvements over current cards you have to spend half a minute or longer just scanning through pages of cards trying to find something better that not feasible if you re in war with someone and the timer is ending in two minutes and you still have to micro all twenty of your cities in that time it s absolutely ridiculous don t feed these people anymore money they clearly cannot listen and should not be rewarded for it
