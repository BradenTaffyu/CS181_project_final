2014 there are many reasons for which i would not recommend rome total war 2 first because as you all know when this game came out it wasn t full of bugs it was literally broken of course it ran normally but you could not do one thing without there being a bug to hinder you the ai bugged all kinds of naval combat bugged the real time combat gameplay bugged in other words the game was crap and i cant believe i paid the full price for such an unfinished game second is due to the fact that rome total war i was in my opinion way better than this version and i m saying that even though the comp i had at the time wasnt powerful enough to run it and the game didnt stop crashing third is because the dlc that come for this game should 1 be free for those who got the pre ordered edition who had no idea how bad the game would be 2 be free for all others because am i the only one to think that blood and gore should be in the game at launch i simply cannot forgive companies who think they can release a game as bad as that and still try to make extra profit out of it don t you get it all sega obviously cares about is money they dont give a damn about us the players after all we ve already bought the game and i sometimes wonder if the updates really change anything at all my final rating is a 5 5 10 i highly recommend you wait for this game to be at least at 50 which is under 20 pounds before buying it
