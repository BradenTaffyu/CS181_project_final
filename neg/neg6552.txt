2016 edit 5 5 2016 my review will be negative and it s gonna stay negative until from software bandai namco adresses the issues allowing hackers to soft ban inocent players using the same lousy anti cheat system it has proven to fail before outdate and useless until the wave of ppl softbanned stop i will not recommend this game to anyone and i will try to prevent ppl from buying this game until the anticheat system works properly old review today s review dark souls iiioverview dark souls iii is the third delivery of the franchise leaving aside demon souls from the developer from software for pc and consoles this third and supposed to be the last souls ever boost overall what has been done in the past for me at least raising the bar for fans and newcommers alike many will buy this game not fully getting that s basically a hardcore game pretty much old school in the way that is meant to reward you for your hard efford the game have 1 set difficulty and you will have to struggle maybe coop with friends and try countless times until you get the grip of it eventually you ll understand the mechanic of the game and you will die in ocations but in the end this is a really amazing journey within a story that i still don t fully understand before i forget this is an action rpg game third person and for new ppl this is not something to take it lightly first steps at first when you start to understand what s an unkindled a hallow a lord of cinder you will start playing a souls game you will admire beautiful landscapes amazing scenes while playing and cutscenes that are really well made until you get frustrated by being killed by any single enemy alone in the game yet with perseverance comes strenght you will succed if you keep trying you will see the amazing many places this game have tho linear really restricted and the amazing bosses and incredible soundtrack the gameplay for me was made to use a controller rather that the keyboard but that s up to you and one final thing optimization has been done really good but the game s frames drops sometimes so it would be nice a patch to adress those issues final note i have so much to say about the souls games and this one in particular i might update this review later for me this game it s a bit expensive at the moment but if you re looking for a challange then this is a great game i m happy i ve got this one metascore 82 100 give it a try if you don t mind losing your souls unkindled one
