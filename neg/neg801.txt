2023 569 hours and still growing makes me feel as if i can voice my true feelings on this if you want to play this play it it s a good game but as an installment in fallout it is terrible fallout has always been known as a game where you can roleplay as anyone some kid finding their dad a vault dweller finding a chip etc fallout 4 decided to change it for the worst by making it that you are forced to play as a veteran dad named nate or a lawyer named nora finding their son named shaun and the only way to progress the game is that you are forced to interact with characters as a worried parent looking for their kid every other fallout game allows you to break sequence if you know your way around but in fallout 4 you have to hit sequences or the game will block you or cause the game to bug out all together everyone has complained about the gameplay and the likes so i just wanted to express one thing i don t hear as often in a review the game is really only enjoyable once mods are implied which is pretty sad with how much content is already in the base game
