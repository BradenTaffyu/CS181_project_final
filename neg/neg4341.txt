2017 civilization vi is the equivalent of an european board game the game built around a longterm plan and executing it successfully netting you the game if it s built well enough civ vi mirrors this you plan districts around your cities you time technologic civic boosts the movement rules are constrained so that you have to have a defence or offence together at that exact moment you plan on grabbing wonders and taking great people and on and on this isn t necessarily bad game design but it relies on polish and the fact that your opponent is relatively competent civ games are notorious about a lack of polish on release and the ai is the ai typically what happens is patches upon patches until the game becomes workable or even fun vi hasn t had anything close to that some dominant strategies have been nerfed but that s about it it just seems so apathetic i ll highlight the ui for a moment easy fix but nothing has actually happened to improve it but i digress i ll start with positives what did vi do well the positivesdistrictsfor the most part districts have been nailed they require you to specialise your cities and think about placement meshing with the terrain and not overwriting it not all districts are good aerodrome but for the most part it s a well thought out system buildersbuilders are essentially workers but they have such a clever fix they re one shot allowing you to instantly build an improvement it works so well with the one unit per tile system it s such a clever fix government systemthe government system as a whole is a positive it s divided up into four sets of governments each allowing a different amount of policy slots along with the bonus associated with it in general it s a very good idea allowing maximum flexibility in swapping and rewarding you for thinking longterm about what you want to do the problem is that there s too many worthless ones but it s less of a negative and more of a this could have been implemented better culture treeessentially a tech tree but for culture it s largely barren but offers good trade offs and is better then any other system civ has made for culture so i think this falls into positives neutralcity statesone of the ai or i keep getting surrounded by them and make expanding peacefully impossible a system in which they were taken off the map entirely and was instead in a ui would easily fix this and hopefully make the people who like city states and people like me happy yes you can turn them off but it s a bit like turning off all warfare for the game it s blatantly supposed to be an important part of the game negativesartificial intelligencethe elephant in the room for this entire game and its downfall there s no way to sugarcoat this it has absolutely no idea on how to play the game no hope of ever getting an idea on how to play this game and even massive advantages can t bridge the gap the game is all about planning things out long term which is something the ai cannot do when it comes to military intelligent use and placement of your troops combined with bombardment is important the ai cannot do this either i can t be confident because you can t see the ai s policy selection but based on what i ve seen they cannot do that either i also strongly believe that it simply doesn t ever have a chance of figuring out how to play the game through patches this would be bad enough however the devs have insisted on making things worse for the ai the warmongering system is such a bad idea but it s only worse for the ai you ll see one ai declare on someone and then get universally denounced and hated guess what happens then someone else declares on them and everyone denounces them so on and so forth until the entire world is mad the player can deal with this with frustration the ai can t the ai sometimes completely ignores settling their own territory and starts sending settlers over to you for no practical reason sometimes they are completely unable to defend against barbarians even into the late game i can t really say anything else the ai is bad and is almost certainly likely to stay bad the warmongering penalty is unlikely to ever leave the game at this stage which i think is the only way for it to improve it s not something you can buff until they re magically somewhat decent like in other civ games because of the game design around long term planning religionthe only redeemable part about religion is the pantheons it s interesting without being that powerful and it s a nice uncomplicated touch for a complicated game after that it just gets dreadful religions are extremely limited and about half of the game will miss out on them 50 1 leads to a weird exclusive win condition club and can actually make you powerless to stop a civ from winning benefits are mediocre and aren t really worth your time and the ai is too incompetent to actually win via religion so ignoring this entire thing just seems to be the ideal play it s also poorly documented with a lot of numbers and words that don t actually seem to mean much the worst part of this is that the ai insists on flooding you win tons of religious units making you completely and utterly unable to move any units in your empire onto their tiles we re talking a religious carpet of doom here this hasn t been fixed in any patch so far poor documentation uiself explanatory movement and the one unit per tile systemunits can only move onto tiles they have the movement points for this seems logical but it slows down gameplay so much and practical reinforcement is impossible especially with how specialised you want your cities to be 1upt also has inherent problems from combining two separate systems together and hoping they work there s simply not enough terrain to move around in a randomly generated map instead of a properly designed from a developer map slow movement times make this worse the ai has no idea how to work with this system making combat easy but also frustrating movement rules and roads desperately need fixed but this is something that the devs oddly proudly announced and as such i have a sinking feeling that it won t be addressed this is another problem that isn t as bad because of how incompetent the ai is agendas diplomacygood idea bad execution they add flair but the ai just seems predestined to hate you making this all irrelevant i ve gotten some policy combinations that make it literally impossible for them to like you what does classify as diplomacy is just throw money at them until they like you ai desperately needs a dash of realpolitik the enemy of my enemy is definitely not the person i should be denouncing and annoying ending the gametakes such a long time to end once you ve reached a dominant position how do i summarise vi it s a game with the dreaded death knell words of potential and has promise along with good ideas bad execution i can t really say i regret playing the game since i ve had fun with it and the money that went to purchasing this game was given to me i just don t see myself playing much more of the game it s nothing i will return to like civ iv or a paradox game but it has entertained me if not everything has to be a deep and significant experience then vi fits the niche of a fun fling for a few hours i can t recommend it if you aren t into the whole european board game style theme or if you re looking for a long lasting strategy game if you re into that style of game buy on sale and skip the dlc unless you really want to play as superstralia edit coast has been buffed and i ve removed it accordingly from my review it s definitely not godawful anymore
