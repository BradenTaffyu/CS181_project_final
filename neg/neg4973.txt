2021 this game perpetuates many of the flaws that have long been seen with the total war series in terms of the imbalance between what a human player can do and the ai factions you will face some though are lifted to a new level of frustration one major one in three kingdoms is that while ai armies with reinforce and support each other over quite long distances even if you have 2 or more armies standing right beside each other your opponent can simply attack each one of them singularly with no support or reinforcement from your others attacking a town you will find the towers will cuts down large swathes of your army before it even gets close it takes you ages to capture or destroy them however conversely when you are defending these same towers do minimal damage to the opposition and they will be overrun or destroyed sometimes in a matter of seconds even an opposition army with a just single soldier in it is able to lay siege to your towns these are frustrations and mean often you are not playing for yourself but playing constantly on the basis of what you might find the ai factions can do their armies always seem to be able to slip away even when surrounded or backed up against mountains and will always be one notch beyond you when you are pursuing so the game can see many turns of you simply chasing them around your territory struggling to bring them to battle this is not really fun nor realistic historically similarly often huge armies even when outside your city or wandering across your territory are invisible to you no one no local magistrate not even peasants are apparently able to see them or alert you to what is happening and then boom they are attacking somewhere in reverse though the moment you set foot in an enemy s territory they seem aware of precisely where you are the last thing i will mention this time round is even when you have passed lots of reforms and are able to recruit supposedly high level troop types in battle after battle you find many units have inflicted 0 casualties on the opposition in contrast even the weakest enemy troops are able to inflict severe damage the consequences of this are even if your army seems equal or even stronger than the opposing one often you will simply be wiped out finding you have inflicted very low casualties consequently if you want to advance typically you will need 3 4 armies each of 3 generals entourages in this game in very very close proximity to bring down 1 opposing army and then of course that army can easily separate your cluster and fight them one by one as outlined above the game looks beautiful and has many interesting features however it gets very frustrating because it is so hard to make an impact on ai factions and what you gain can be lost so quickly i have been playing total war games since 1999 and know these issues have long been unresolved in their games i hoped for better with three kingdoms but instead find the imbalance probably worse than ever as a result the game is frustrating rather than engaging
