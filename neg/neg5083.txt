2018 i m tired of it i have played hundreds of hours on multiple total war games i ve crashed through hundreds of lines of infantry with general s bodyguards in rome total war i ve raised scotland to topple the european hegemony in medieval total war 2 fought for the right to rule over the sen tus populusque r m nus in rome 2 traveled across the globe and others in empire and warhammer now we come to the end after hundreds of hours of diving into the games and supporting the franchise we are given what thieves liars and scumthose who have taken this journey with me know what i am talking about the developers have not even released games yet and they already have dlcs they should be in the game already you want to tell me that i should have to pay for each and every one of the factions in the game seperately from a 60 dollar game on top of that you want to tell me you already have them setup and ready to be integrated and yet you are only doing it to take more money from us where are the days of medieval where the factions could be unlocked by the skill of the player not the thickness of their wallets they ve lied to us for example we are told that rome total war 2 was going to have great ai they were ready to launch and there wouldn t be dlc scams but additional content to the game you wanna guess which of those actually was true not a single one are you kidding me i had to wait a whole year just to play without crashing when i had a computer above the recommended requirements even then the game is literally the ai building full armies and the only way to win is building more stupid enormous stacks then they do to win and thats literally the whole game on top of that they force you to pay for factions that are clearly already in the base game to begin with and would be the favorites of many to play as they kept sparta from us that is what first left a sour taste in my mouth a faction clearly they kept from us so people would pay to play as them its digusting the levels the developers have fallen to to top it all they literally are fine with giving each and everyone of their loyal followers spyware hidden in all the total war games that takes their information without their permission or consent this was the final straw how dare they try and backtrack and think that it is enough after simply removing a spyware they put in and only stopped when they were caught in the act we are supposed to trust people that would do this in case you are wondering the spyware is named red shell and i will put a link to a video to learn more below as well as the other games affected by this this is just ridiculous and i have to wonder if there shouldn t be larger scale ramifications for this i know i won t simply let this go as these developers would have us do i have loved the total war series and supported it every step of the way but no longer get rid of the scam dlcs give enough time to actually build a full game instead of one that should be pre alpha or early access and actually think about your legacy and fanbase before dollar signs until then everyone i hope you can find something worth it left in this series that i can t because i m tired of trying to pretend that these practices are acceptable red shell information video youtube video i think it s time we talk about the red shell spyware controversy views 53 762 patreon paypal twitter i
