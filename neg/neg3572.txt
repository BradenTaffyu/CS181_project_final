2023 early access review as of this review i have had a few thousand hours play time and have used all the available official maps the game is a lot better since release but there are still some issues that should be noted nitrado servers are dreadful wildcard snail games have dropped the ball here you will have lag regardless of player count gone are the days of ase and low lag servers these servers are also not restricted to other countries which will choke your bandwidth also sotf is not coming back and thus a wasted opportunity for more players is gone don t buy this if you want to play this game option its not coming back until we see the unreal engine update coming this year the graphical requirements to run asa are shockingly high you ll need a card in the 3000 series or equivalent to run on low this is also ruining the player count for this game as lots of people simply cant run asa and have opted to stay on ase my advice is buy with caution we all have already owned this game and its back in alpha stages just like ase was in 2016 we are owed many maps and the time frames for delivery are looking to be years on completion wildcard have never delivered on a map and its release date and thats never going to change
