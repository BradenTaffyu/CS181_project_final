2022 early access review this game has been around almost 1 decade and its still feels like its barely fleshed out there is no story there is no direction all there is is endless updates and add ons and changing how skills work or how fast you walk or painting i don t need 17 different melee weapons at my disposal i need my bike minibike to be able to drive up a hill i need a hit marker i need to be able to make a boat or at least not feel like i m swimming in molasses every time i step in knee deep water this is a fun game to play with friends but every update makes the game feel extra tedious this game is like that last duke nukem game that was in development hell for 8 years because they kept adding features and updating game engines just remake this game in a better game engine instead of trying to put flex seal and duct tape on this 10 year old design thats plauged with bugs hire literally 1 writter to plot out a long term endgame to this
