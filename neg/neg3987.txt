2022 this is a very curious game the game itself its a 5 stars the application of the game is the worst application i ve seen in my life installed the application and every time i where going into a race sound where lost and i where obliged to change the sound to fix ittried different solutions and finally i wrote support and here begins the funny side support without even trying to reproduce the problem deleted the iracing folder from my home folder and updated windows at this point you should know that saving a file in a computer is a line of code so but worked for a while so didnt complained when a iracing worker connected to my computer to do changes in it that where not described in minimun requirements neither where logic changes to solve a save file save file example when you are developing let contenttosave content fs writefilesync filename content now begins the iracing hell nothing where working every time i was entering a simulation sound was off and sometimes i think that was when i was changing from practice to race wheel configuration where lost also so game was unplayable and as i stated to support i wanted or the problem solved or my money back at this point iracing support didnt wanted to do anything as long as i didnt wanted to keep modifying my system to find the problem when the problem is clearly a code problem because as i explained before if a file saving does not work you are not going to fix it updating the system after an online sessoin and 25 emails in which they didnt wanted to give support i found and fixed the problem obviously without updating windows when you have mirrored screens iracing does not save your options and if you do a search in internet you will discover that there are more weird condition in which options are not saved for instance if you have a longitech controller you ll never be able to use some of its features cos if you activate trueforce in the configuration file configuration is not saved or if you use onedrive i would have liked to hear that disable onedrive so we can save the options cos he told me literaly if you dont update windows our game cannot save they rely in people fixing its own issues otherwise why configurations files in a competitive game are in text mode in a way in which everybody can touch them easily meanwhile the save problem have been there for years as long as my job here is just enjoy i have no other option to advise against this practices
