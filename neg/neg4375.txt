2018 the devs spent so much time on new gameplay features that they forgot the one core thing about gaming it s supposed to be fun tldr the warmonger penalties alone for defending yourself against attacks are enough to make you quit bads the ai is terrible but the warmonger penalties are absolutely positively the worst thing i have ever seen in a civ game to break it i get attacked by 2 ais i fight tooth and nail and finally get the advantage my citites are all but burning down from war weariness and i push on and take both civs out that surprise war d me together and guess what the ridiculously broken warmonger penalties last the rest of the game and no ai will ever talk or trade with me again for defending myself so i go on to lose because they sign dozens of research agreements and trade amongst themselves but i am a terribel war monger ridiculous absolutely terrible and game breaking more bads the game is not paced right even on epic you move forward too quickly i m not talking about drawing it out forever but you advance faster than you can meaningfully build units by the time you build a unit you just researched the upgrade is out literally it s just paced wrong goods not much there are some cool and innovative features like districts and how the culture tree is similar to the tech tree but these small shining lights are put out by the huge flaws mentioned above so utterly sad i paid 29 for the game on special and that was 28 too much for this trash svae your money and hope they take these overall terrible ratings to the dev team for civ 7
