2018 i stuck through dumbing down i stuck though a game so laughably buggy it six months for them to get it right however now they ve changed the game to have some rediculous over 50 female general admiral in society where women did not become generals ever and only in the very rarest occasions in the barbarian nations when confronted this was the mod response as has been said previously total war games are historically authentic not historically accurate if having female units upsets you that much you can either mod them out or just not play so after spending 60 and having them retroactively change the game they tell us to off and eat it since they have our money i m just waiting for the next off we have your money will it be with bugs more broken and dumbed down game play will it just be a 60 i win button as i advance my panzers across medieval europe anyway i ve played every one of the historically based games since the original shogun but this is the last
