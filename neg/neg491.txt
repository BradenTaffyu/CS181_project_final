speaking as someone who has played for nearly a decade and has reached a high rta pvp rank g1the game itself is fun however its p2w devs only cater to whales who spend 50k not exaggerating grindy would be the understatement of the decade ever changing metas and power creep force players to chase laughably low drop rates or drop it is possible to play for free but getting to mid lategame will take you 3 5 years playing multiple hours dailylisten to the other comments don t start playing the other reviews come off as a joke but they are just brutally honest
