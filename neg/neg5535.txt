2014 total war is a franchise near and dear to my heart so when word came round about rome ii i leapt onto the hype wagon and held on every preview i pored over and my interest in the classical time period renewed in full preordered the game and pre loaded it as soon as i could then the release happened and my love met a grisly demise it should be common knowledge by now if you ve read any of the other reviews what happened on launch day players with godzilla grade monster rigs like attila16 noticed troubles running the game on day 1 rome ii was unplayable it was horrendous i contend it is absolutely unforgiveable what creative assembly did here we were promised even better graphics than the pre alpha models we saw the summer before launch visuals were nowhere nearly close to that i don t know how they took the solid engine from shogun 2 and botched it beyond belief a game later within a month after release dlc was announced dlc and the game was still struggling with ruinous bugs and whatnot and the faction packs yeah those were in the game already ca just turns them on for the player once you ve paid for them and after that boom new campaign courtesy of another 15 at the time of course i essentially stopped playing by the end of 2013 i write this review as a plea and a warning a plea because i do not want you to buy this game like i naively did creative assembly lied to us the result of their work is this unfathomable drivel i don t care how much better it s gotten over the months it should ve run this smoothly back in september 2013 it was utterly dishonest to release such a travesty as was done here the warning to never preorder a game again i don t care how much you love a franchise i ve been burned too many times to trust any developer wait for some time after the release read watch a review or four determine for yourself how much the game will be worth to you don t preorder for a better deal wait and purchase a better game tl dr please don t buy this game it will only encourage developers and publishers like these to release half finished garbage and reap the positive feedback months later as they patch it after the damage is already done
