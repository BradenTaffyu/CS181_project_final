2022 i have mixed feelings about this one some things i really enjoy take the locale for instance boston massachusetts a historic waterside city just full of history and people to misinterpret it good stuff or the combat mechanics compared to other games i actually feel like my gun fires bullets and that both of those things feel like they should and while the game shook up the established design of power armor the sheer experience of using that armor is so so cool it s less like i m wearing a suit of armor and more like i ve climbed into a personal mech and i love seeing the pristine pre war world before exploring its ruins the jarring visual shift was a genuinely awesome way to tell a story other things i don t enjoy so much customizeable weapons took so much of a focus that actually unique weapons are scarce if a named item is 95 the same gun as what you could build at a bench it s not really fun to find one and as nice as it is to grab an area and turn it into your own the clean up process can take a while not having something you need is groan worthy and having to gather resources is a weird gear shift from building into exploring and or buying that i personally find frustrating and the freedom of design feels limited by that dreaded red glow telling you that you can t place that item there additionally the perk tree seems to gate a number of traits that i would consider essential to every build or otherwise unfun to be told you can t have because you specced wrong such as perks for enhancing armor weapons settlements and salvaging worse due to the removal of skills things that used to be leveled separately now require you to tap into your limited supply of perk points namely lockpicking hacking and weapon type damage by slamming skills perks and special together you get a lot of perks that aren t very interesting which doesn t leave much room left for the engaging creativity that littered the perk lists of fallout 3 and new vegas meanwhile the forced backstory ruins the concept of a player designed character that many of us loved about the no name stranger of new vegas even fallout 3 which hard writes you as a young adult in search of your father gives you a bit more room to be who you want by declaring the player character to have a specific job spouse and child it kills the idea that this is the player s own character this leaves many people to have fun with their characters by pretending that the story does not exist that s not a good thing finally there s the experience point curve despite my effort despite clearing the vast majority of the game s content i just don t end up able to get all the perks i want it s very frustrating to have a build planned out only to have your hopes dashed because your xp supply is drying up skyrim had this exact same issue i do not understand why fallout 3 and new vegas handled this just fine but skyrim and fallout 4 could not this specific issue is what ultimately led me to stop playing both of the latter games for a long time can i recommend this i don t know it depends on what you want if you want to shoot things with guns and lasers in a ruined boston while you build settlements and do some neat quests go ahead but if you liked the rpg mechanics and world building of previous fallout games i would struggle to do so
