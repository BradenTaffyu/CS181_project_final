2023 my low hours do not reflect how long i have played this game as i have played on the standalone client for many years now i am very much addicted to this game however i can not even fathom recommending it to any new player this game is a buggy mess that will freeze often and at the most inconvenient of times these freezes almost always require a restart of the game the emote system makes opponents look passive aggressive which can cause major feel bads the player base at large is highly toxic expect your opponents to rope go afk to not allow you to continue playing very often usually while spamming previously aforementioned passive aggressive emotes the game s economy is very bad i would go as far as to say it is predatory while it is possible to play the game completely free to play the grind is extreme meanwhile you can fast track to success by simply buying a premium currency that you can use for everything you can use the regular currency and more the company that owns magic the gathering arena wizards of the coast is shady to say the least the company has many times shown the players of magic the gathering that they do not care about the players opinions tl dr game is a buggy mess filled with toxic players and awful p2w monetization which is owned by a scummy company that only cares for profits
