2019 early access review i bought this game in july of 2014 with 351 hours of playtime 97 of which was before they revised the skill system and unfortunately it has gone steadily downhill ever since when they revamped the skill system a while back that really killed the gameplay for me and my group of survivors from gun handling to model animations even placing blocks it seems like everything has suffered from a 1 step forward 2 steps back in terms of features and functionality being added versus what is being removed or revised the skill system being a prime example of that another is no longer being able to loot downed zombies like you used to model animations seem to be less fluid than prior builds and the models animations for animals is utter garbage snake vulture especially also please note this game has been in early access for over half of a decade with no full release in sight there were a lot of features to this game that have slowly been chopped release after release each one further deteriorating the quality of gameplay to put it bluntly my friends and i played the ever unliving out of this game until the design decisions of the devs essentially drove us away i cannot recommend purchasing it in the current state
