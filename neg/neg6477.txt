2016 update from my old review from the releasea remote code execution also known as rce exploit has emerged for dark souls iii on pc this means that potentially malicious players connected to your game may be able to execute code by sending information to your game that directly affects aspects of your operating system this can lead to sensitive information leaks including but not limited to installation of malicious programs such as keyloggers or viruses theft of account information or login tokens and access to other sensitive information such as banking info or other things that may be stored on your computer do not play the game online blue sentinel is working on a fix but a complete newbie who buys this game on sale will be exposed to this regardless please be careful guys i love dark souls 3 but caution invalid game data has been detected this anti cheat programm causing legit players to get banned cheaters are currently able to get innocent players permanently banned as well as modifying stats as a result the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn t want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result fix this anti cheat programm please namco noted that some of the bans may have been by accident they ll check for false positives and in the meantime you should contact customer support i will delete this review if namco fixed this anti cheat
