2023 the game is fun battles are epic i also like mount blade overall but im not able to recommend the game maybe on a sale sadly the game is lacking many features that have been promised by the devs years ago the content is also missing and it seems like the devs have abandoned the game sp mechanics are theoretically there but after playing a while you can see how shallow they actually are and how much work is still left to make this actually a full release and not early access mp is actually what made me stay with this game its an incredible feeling when you get a 100 vs 100 player siege going that being said mp is also already dying dead there are only two servers to play on a few maps constant server crashes like every 3 4 maps there is a crash and servers are down for 30 mins overall this game just never really left early access and should still be branded as such buy on big sale or if you a huge mount blade fan
