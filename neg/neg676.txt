after all they hype and with the mod support i thought i could enjoy this one but the rng just kills it for me if you like struggling through a sub par to ruinous deck because the rng god isn t happy with you then have fun i m not interested in a game where 2 3s of my time is just frustrating and or annoying i gave it a solid 100 hours at least half of that trying out mod characters the other half waiting for it to become fun
