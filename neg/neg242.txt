to preface i have always been a fan of the mana games they have always had a charm to their story telling that i ve found fun to play through that said as of yet visions of mana does not impress the good the combat and the combat hud is an overall improvement over trials of mana the world is fun to explore and keeps you active for the most part the day one performance is alright with occasional stutters the story is fun an quirky even more so with the english dub i enjoy the funny voices and personalities they pick for the characters a lot the party dialogue during exploration is scripted rather than being randomly picking from a pool of lines that get repetitive really fast i m looking at you sand land at first i was worried the exploring would stay pseudo closed off but it really starts to open up mid to late chapter 1 the bad in 2024 i half expect most games being released on pc to have all the variable graphics settings options for every category instead of an on off button for like 5 general settings the cut scenes that are not pre rendered are locked to 30fps and can be very jarring when playing in high frame refresh rates this can be addressed by pressing f11 at the start of every cut scene to unlock the framerate the constant stuttering is a minor annoyance however still bothersome it strangely comes and goes and isn t always present the game s assets don t seem to all follow the same artistic them whatsoever assets and textures constantly fluctuate between either being hyper detailed or sub anime cartoony when streaming the game over discord it works perfectly fine for the most part with a single caveat when unlocking the cut scene framerate with f11 after a certain amount of times it briefly crashes discord and logs me back into my voice channel when attempting to restart the stream the audio is either an ear bleeding static or no audio whatsoever this one particularly isn t a bad but it s not good either the difficulty balance is confusing to me i started on normal difficulty feeling it was the intended way to play but so far i m breezing through all the battles i m starting to think hard might represent a normal setting better the audio sliders don t seem to do much for the game mix with headphones on i had to turn the sfx down due to the weapon swings hits sounding like boxes falling off a shelf in the back of my room but so far it doesn t make a difference i suspect the game s audio has been set to a really narrow audio frequency for more compatibility for gaming on tvs the really bad visions of mana starts at 60 00 usd and seeing as how it s not much of an update from trials of mana 2020 i find the pricing to not be representative of the 60 00 being asked for it before i had wrote the pricing was a scam and perhaps that was too strong of wording to the point i was trying to get across it s seems like a trend now for jrpg developers to switch to unreal engine these days and put no thought into how it will run and proper integration of features and optimizations honestly with exception of a few jrpgs on unreal engine all seem to be rushed out projects to make a quick buck final thoughts honestly don t bother getting this yet until it s on sale this is a great game for fans of the mana series but the price far out weighs the experience to be had i will continue to play this game out of love for the mana series and will update this review on the unlikely chance that square enix updates integrates or fixes any of these issues i will also post my additional findings here too in the foreseeable future tldr wait till it s on sale updateso far thank you all for your comments i love reading what other people have to say about my review both the good and bad going forward i plan to allow comments on all my reviews because i believe it show be a two way street if you don t agree what i have to say about something you have every right to think otherwise so far i m really enjoying the game but still stand by what i said earlier of it not being worth the money asked for the most part i tend to not return games unless some extreme conditions are met that said i have just entered chapter 2 and am still enjoying visions of mana again thank you for all your feedback and opinions also i feel i should list my hardware specifications for reference os windows 11 procpu amd ryzen 7 3700xmemory 32 gb 2x16 gb 3200 mhzgpu nvidia geforce rtx 3080 12 gbstorage gigabyte aorus gen 4 nvme ssd this is my c drive game location display alienware 4k 240hz aw3225qf
