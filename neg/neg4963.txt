2019 i was hoping for another shogun 2 and fall of the samurai sadly this isn t it it seems like ca can only do warhammer stuff these days the old devs that made the historical series so great probably left the company despite basing it off the highly exaggerated records of the three kingdoms book the warhammer type of super human still feels out of place in a historical total war series it is somewhat fun but feels gimmicky and why even bother building your army based on strategy when lu bu can single handedly destroy all of course you can always choose historical mode but then that one has problems too the good thing about shogun s rock paper scissor units was that elite units had an actual impact and visually you could tell them apart everything in this game feels so bland and an army of crossbows will pretty much shred anything the ai can ever offer even with elite units units rout too easily elite units are made of paper battles turn into blobs and nothing is ever cohesive enough for a well timed or maneuvered flank or rear attack the game at least has one good option and that s the espionage or intrigue system you can send spies to rival courts and eventually get them to a position of power this even allows for the taking of enemy territory without the need to declare war or just plain scouting sabotaging the enemy positions i love the character the setting but the gameplay is just so boring and typical since rome 2 everything looks the same and most units play the same even the soundtrack sounds the same aside from the trailer theme geez ca at least pony up the cash and let jeff van dyck compose the soundtrack that man made all the total war games sound and feel memorable stop focusing so much on censoring community crap when all you produce are bland games
