2023 in the current state the game is nothing more than a technical demo it is unclear to me how a big publisher like paradox could launch a game like this in such unfinished state it does sound like a joke considering other paradox rushed game launches but this time is even worse than what we are used to releasing it in early access would have been a more truthful and respectful to the customers way of launching the game this is really bad for pr and really puts a big dent in this company trust speaking about the game the issue with garbage was patched quickly but there is a plethora of known bugs that completely break the game and it s unclear when or if they will be solved some unique industry buildings are never occupied and therefore are not working the mail system is not working looks like delivery vans never deliver anything import export is not working seems like cargo terminals never export anything at all it is not possible to move building upgrades citizens leave stuff behind when leaving like their dog maybe their car too breaking the game eventually as abandoned entities accumulate the statistics graph ui is broken graphs only use 1 2 of the screen the economy budget ui is broken even at a very negative income my still somehow makes money and i have no idea where it comes from leveling buildings especially industry seem broken maybe it s related to other bugs like mail being broken but they hardly level up to 5 the variety of buildings is abysmal surely mods will add to it and even more surely there will be purchasable dlcs as well but the variety of buildings in the base game is embarrassing there is way more than this the game s official forum is full of confirmed bugs
