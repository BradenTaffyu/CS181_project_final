i have played mtg in almost every variant for over 30 years and there is nothing anyone can tell me that will convince me that arena is not rigged 95 of all my losses come from mana issues and not normal mana floods where you see a 7 land hand or a zero land hand in fact i ve never seen a 7 land hand i m talking about very specifically being dealt a normal three land hand and then drawing 9 lands in a row this only seems to happen in games with prizes on the line are you one win away from a particular prize bracket oh no looks like you re getting a mana flood and magically being matched against a opponent with a perfect god rolled hand good luck if you love mtg and want a real online experience then avoid arena at all costs i still play because i am time invested but i will never spend a cent on this pile of rubbish ever again it is embarrassing how nonrandom randomisation can be made when there s money on the line this crap is basically paying for rigged loot boxes and being happy about it run away
