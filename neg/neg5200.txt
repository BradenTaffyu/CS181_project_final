2016 pre review narrative we began by setting the badlands aflame orc and dwarf alike were slaughtered their long contested lands belonged to the wilds now the border princes fared no better their mountains of treasure were left to burn amongst the mutilated corpses of those who thought their walls a bastion all those who would defy the beastmen trembled their fear was well placed the shattered realms of men became the empire of man unified under one purpose to halt our inexorable horde we trampled across the cultivated fields of reikland and then over the smouldering ashes of their decadent cities there were none who could oppose us review the game s biggest strength was it s ability to envelope you in a player driven narrative however that just makes it like every other total war game so why should you buy it you probably shouldnt unless you like warhammer the base games has four factions who are arbitrarily limited to how far their empires can grow the magical abilites were added in place of tactical unit stances so the game feels lacking in choice when the battles begin the dlc factions are overpriced and really shoud ve been put in the base game you could ve made some epic map expansion packs or covered different times in the warhammer universe instead you dangle this tripe in front of our faces this games one save is that it has steam workshop support and an active modding community p s this review was written after purchasing the beastmen dlc the base game is disturbingly mediocre shame on you creative assembly for falling so far i remember my first total war game rome all of the factions were unlockable and the expanion you released for it was meaty now with each new installment we just get drip fed content without the opition of a season pass
