2020 a potentially great experience ruined by forced inconvenience bethesda makes problems for players by putting in deliberate storage limitations and making endgame weapons break crazy fast so that they can sell you infinite material storage and weapon repair kits if this was a free to play game that would be fine but i have already paid for the game and the full experience you can say the game is not pay to win but if i am forced to save my good weapons due to arbitrary weapon hp and the other player is able to use all his arsenal and just pay to have that hp stat re set yes you can absolutely pay to give yourself a real advantage getting repair materials is even incredibly tedious again a product of trying to frustrate the player through wasted hours into paying up t l d r the game is fun when it is being a game but so much is designed to be purposefully not fun so that you will buy the fast track content it is disgusting for them to put that in a full price game especially when the cosmetics and camp features are both fair and plenty lucrative enough for bethesda
