2017 good points it s warhammer fantasy with big armies cool stuff battles can be challenging and there are quite a few units to choose from for each faction bad points crashes freezes i got this game almost a year after release there still are regular game crashes the devs official solution is to switch steam to offline mode which does not solve the problem for everyone support is poor and game stability can be horrible if you re unlucky dlc politic i got this game as part of the humble bundle monthly honestly it s not worth more than 15 bucks because they took out chaos and rip their fans off with their ridiculous dlc politic you can disagree with the people moaning about this but they sell so many dlcs yet still didn t fix the freeze and crash bugs even a year after release what do you make of that on top of that the dlcs are constantly slammed into your face every time you start a campaign the faction selection sternly reminds you that half of the content is not accessible to you of course steamlinks to buy the dlcs are directly integrated in the game it makes you feel uncomfortable every time you start a new campaign because it pretty much tells you that you only play half the game there story if you read a review you probably heard that epic commanders like vlad von carstein or emperor karl franz get quests now how does that play out it s actually rather disappointing the quests entail only a variation of the following a textbox telling you to either go to location x send somone to location x or fight a battle against a pre made army at location x the second part of a question sends you to a different location or battle rinse and repeat there are no epic storylines you don t get to know your epic commander and leader more through the quests and there is no storyline to speak off there is very little to bring the rich lore of warhammer and these epic characters to life it s a missed chance battles as cool as the battles can be there are no unit formations anymore i loved the unit formations in shogun 2 they had strategic value no spear point formation for cavalry no tortoise formation for shielded infantry and no formation for your whole army you have the option between placing archers in front or behind your close range units that is all the options for unit formation you have seriously summary don t pay more than 15 bucks for the game it can be fun but crashes and freeze issues are still a problem for many players and assembly studios dlc policy is something you should not support by paying full price for this buggy and lacking game if it s on sale and really cheap you can have fun with it that you most likely won t regret afterwards
