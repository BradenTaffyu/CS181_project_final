2020 the game is good it s fun and addictive however unless you have cash for the expansions and don t mind being milked for every penny you have it s just not worth the price of admission i played my first 30 hours of this without any dlc and didn t see the hype everything is super tedious and has to be micro managed and when playing as an empire it just becomes way too much to handle then i bought some dlcs when they were on sale all of the quality of life features are locked behind paywalls yup want to send you navies on missions in the click of a button dlc want to be able to move this army to that bit of land by simply clicking dlc want to not pull your hair out having to pause the game every few seconds to manage every little thing on your own dlc get the base game when it s 80 off and only if the dlcs are on a massive sale too because the base game is almost unplayable with the dlcs this game is fantastic however paradox has a habit of making you give up your house to get the full experience pray for crusader kings iii
