2022 edit alright i m editing and deleting my entire review i was discussing so much of swtor s past enjoyment but that doesn t make sense does it i mean swtor is a completely different game now and most of the players left have already read enough whining from people who miss the old game so let me start over by keeping my not recommended choice once again 7 0 is a needless grindfest and before you question me i do love gear farming etc that s not the issue the problem lies within 8 million types of currencies and a slow gear upgrade system that doesn t necessarily make sense at first glance you need multiple currencies to upgrade each piece and some of which can come from different activities once you learn what sets you re going for pvp flashpoint or operation gear highest ilvl coming from the hardest tier which is most welcome back feature you get the hang of what currencies to shoot for etc but damn is it needlessly complex garbage mobile games have multiple currencies not fully fledged mmos you can easily burn yourself out here with all the weeklies you need to do for the currencies what about gameplay swtor has always had an issue where certain skills or buffs are delayed or not initializing upon click button hit that s nothing new but honestly gameplay is still rather intricate and solid for a 2022 mmo you have quite intriguing skill rotations and can easily excel over others with enough skill and knowledge with your chosen class but damn the skill bloat is real some classes have upwards of 2 3 filler attacks why just prune and streamline i don t really care about the story other than my first playthrough but i know that s important to many players i think for an mmorpg the story gameplay isn t bad at all albeit some better than others imperial agent story this is a good thing for most f2p players because the story is essentially all you re going to be doing swtor had always intended to be a sub game only due to finances did it swap to a f2p model f2p players are so restricted in everything that really a sub is the only way to go if you intend on playing seriously f2p are restricted from equipping gear pieces and have a limited amount of times they can enter pvp etc but if you re just wanting to experience the story have at it without a sub the economy has been completely destroyed years ago probably due to being able to buy items from the in game cash shop and selling in game marketplace the inflation is simply outrageous so much so that the usual gold sinks in mmo games do not work here at all no one cares about a 15k repair bill when your average market item sells for 50 mill so don t expect the economy to be particularly fun if you re the crafting seller type pvp we ve been doing the same damn matches for years but tbh they re fun for me swtor pvp has always felt like a mode that i can learn and excel in instead of simply getting lost though ffs this game seems to be filled with so many stuns roots pushes slows that some matches you feel like you re just getting tossed around like a rag doll and will likely piss you off overall though it s still my chosen activity the player base is decent it s nowhere near the level of other mmos but 7k players on average from steam charts not including its own launcher though do keep in mind many of those are probably story only f2p players so finding a top tier group can be difficult a times i do have to point out being the only star wars mmorpg during a time of renewed sw interest and only having this amount of players is kind of telling for the current state of the game overall nah i just can t recommend this game for someone to play at top tier for long term it ll always hold a special nostalgic place in my heart but i can still only stomach 1 month or so every now and again i ll be promptly heading back to wow come aug 4th
