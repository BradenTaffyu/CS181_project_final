2020 early access review so i have a bit of a differing opinion on this game then everyone else but please please hear me out and read this review before you buy i m trying to save you money part 1 zombies so what i like about this game its a good idea i have never seen a more realistic zombie survival sim in my life and it reaffirms every fear i had about the zombie apocalypse it would be really easy and boring this game is incredibly easy shambling zombies are easy to run away from and kill if you plan on playing this with your friend you can take the all ready easy difficulty of this game and cut it in half me and my friend with no combat skills have basically killed an entire city of zombies without getting bit scratched or anything of that ilk and now the city is all most a safe zone i ve come closer to death from digging in the dirt in this game and cutting my hand causing me to all most bleeding out last bit on zombies and why they are bad in this game is that you can upgrade the zombies in this to sprinters but they are constantly lagging and glitching out that it makes them all most unplayable and immersion breaking those are the only 2 zombie types you get not very interesting or thinking outside the box there the game is far from finished in 7 years more ambitious projects have been completed packaged and shipped in less time so why is this game is incredibly buggy and missing basic things like skins for items here is a list of problems with the game that have been there sense we started playing 7 years ago and still have not been solved due too 1 the devs not caring 2 them not knowing how to solve these issues either way here we go1 crowbar still has the skin of a bat been this way sense the beginning 2 food still isn t complete in the game aka protein how 3 floating cars4 dash board disappears constantly causing you to have to restart the session 5 uncapping the speed in cars breaks every car in the game making them ungodly slow 6 things being uncraftable even though you have all the ingredients these are just a few bugs that we ran into combatis pretty bad sorry guys its just right clicking to aim and then left clicking to hit and thats it guns are even worse you will miss most of your shots even at point blank shooting things feels like rng and you will eat away at your ammo supply to get level ups for something you shouldnt dont need to be doing really at all hitting zombies with melee is incredibly easy and handling big hoards is even easier now that you have cars and friends to help you out or you can just run away which is also easy final pointthis game feels dead and soul less to be honest with you there are no wild life at all you will find dead mice and fish if you choose to but they only show up in your inventory but other then that not a peep not even survivors its like the apocalypse all ready arrived before the zombies even came the crafting in this isn t done very well either its clunky and needlessly complicated the game has no real evolution either things don t really get more challenging as you play or don t get challenging soon enough its grindy and unrewarding no zombie s attacking your base like in 7 days to die unless you build your base in the worst spot possible but making the game purposefully hard doesn t mean that the game is hard if you come down to it what they did here is incredible big city s lots of zombies its a spectacle good job devs but once you get down to the bones of this game you realize every zombie game you ll ever play has done something better i personally recommend cataclysm dark days ahead with a smaller team cataclysm did everything this game was trying to do better and is way more interesting with varying enemy types npc s lore character customization way better vehicle s its all there and its incredible you don t have to wait 7 years for crowbars to look like crowbars they all ready are in that game this game tried to be cataclysm and in my opinion failed and best yet cataclysm is free so go check it out 5 10 disappointing game but worth the money if you re a fiend for zombie games you will get more than 14 hours out of it so if you equate that to 1 hour per 1 dollar spent on this game you will end up spending your money well i hope the devs make this game good one day maybe 7 more years
