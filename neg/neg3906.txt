2019 early access review i have had a love affair with this game from the time i bought it almost 4 years ago the problem is it isn t the same game that i fell in love with i understand that i bought a game in alpha and that it was due to have some major changes but the amount of dumb things you have to deal with just to play the game is astounding for one you have almost exclusively made the game more and more miserable when i started it was fun to play now when you start a game unless you ve done a significant amount of research you re simply screwed back in the day if you had the resources you could build it now you need skill points in a broken tech tree which forces you to grind zombie kills in order to make armor weapons medicine and much much more not to mention theres no way to learn about the skill tree unless you go on wikipedia and use the much more useful content created by players it blows my mind that you have a best selling steam game yet cannot even polish out the bugs before forcing everyone to start over and what about your console crowd i m sure they re loving their lack of updates and content i m starting to think they re trying to sabotage the game for alterior motives because it sure does suck now i ve watched you ruin this game over and over and over every damn patch if you just fix it and leave it alone you might just have a damn playerbase
