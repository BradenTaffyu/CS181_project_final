2023 as a genuine fallout fan it pains me to downvote this game but its issues are so glaring that i simply can t ignore them in terms of basic gameplay everything is a bullet sponge even things that make absolutely no sense my friends and i were doing a daily op and the crickets would one shot us in power armor and take dozens of rpgs to the face the broken steel questline is admittedly fantastic but the others feel extremely mindless and outright insane the game s human factions are simply split between the raiders and settlers to the extent reputation with these factions even matters you can only increase it by completing a single radiant quest once you ve advanced to a certain point in the game the pitt expansion which held so much promise as a sort of free dlc turned out to be another awful daily ops mission with a linear storyline i could go on and on but i think i ve made my point i sincerely hope this isn t the direction the devs take the franchise
