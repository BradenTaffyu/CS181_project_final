2016 fallout 4 is an amazing game with an incredible scope numerous options and playable for hours on end however it is a victim of its time and for each novelty feature it also presents a slew of problems that ultimately weigh it down despite it being an amazing package overall it has flaws that can break the game so 4 is a sequel to fallout 3 new vegas was pretty much disregarded when writing 4 and it only concerns itself with east coast affairs as a result you are a war hero from the sino american wars from a few years ago living in a small town with your wife and new born child when the bombs finally come falling down you re rushed into a vault and frozen for 200 years somewhere in that time thugs come and steal your son from another pod and kill your spouse in the process after finally awaking from your frigid slumber you stagger into the commonwealth of massachusetts that has been scourged and changed by the nuclear destruction armed with serious chip on your shoulder all the weapons in the world and housekeeping robot you start your search for your son and the dirt bags that took him contrary to earlier fallout games 4 lets you play as a pre war survivor who finds him herself in the not so amazing world of the future this is fine but the developers have decided to give your character a voice a personality and an agenda this is where the first deal breaker rears its ugly head the whole aspect of roleplaying is nearly forgone to display shiny production values you are playing bethesda s character not whoever you want to play it didn t bother me at first but after a good few hours of horribly paced exposition and tediously slow and unintuitive conversation mechanics i was pretty fed up with the sassy survivor in 3 and new vegas your character would develop over the course of the game it was your projection that is now gone other games also force you to play some character but at least they re honest about it commander shepherd and geralt are both fully fleshed out characters but at least they act on your accord your fallout 4 hero is either a jerk a sarcastic jerk or a mewling sap granted some of the lines are comical but it s weeding through a forest of bland retorts to find the hidden treasures luckily bethesda does allow you to properly customise weapons you can upgrade most guns with better recoil reduction more damage output sights scopes lager magazines the works the same is true for armour and power armour the power armour in particular saw a massive overhaul it is now akin to a vehicle and offers considerably more protection and movement options than 3 s steel pyjamas every upgrade be it to gun or armour also results in the item s appearance changing accordingly a lot of effort went into allowing an extremely varied approach for each player when it comes to equipment however there is a downside here too upgrades cost resources and resources are scarce you have to scavenge and salvage to get enough glue wire metal and other junk to make that suppressor it is great to see that all the junk in fallout finally gets a use beyond the junk launcher but it becomes such a dominating enterprise to have to find stuff it takes away from the experience you re literally doing work to play the game i was trying to escape work by playing a game but nope surviving is hard work speaking of escaping work i noticed that fallout 4 wants me to settle down instead of exploring that seems to be an awkward reversal of the original design philosophy besides guns you can also customise and upgrade settlements ripping pages from the minecraft book you can build shacks with your scavenged materials and make them comfortable homes for you and your new friends most of your new friends are boring btw so get them a shack to leave and forget them again though materials and other requirements make this a chore rather than a fun experience it gets worse when one of your friends the infamous preston garvey continues to invite enemies i swear he is the one behind it all into your new settlements just so you get to have something to do there is another thing procedurally generated quests that s an indie buzzword and bethesda slammed it in here like it was a good idea newsflash they re not they re awful every single one of them i can t even properly begin to outline the disaster they are but imagine that you were doing something boring and then some clown shows up to tell you to go there and get even more bored while also risking your life that s just great it seems that bethesda added every neat modern gameplay mechanic into their game crafting quest generation voice acting it s all here not optimised and at times even detrimental when you do follow the game s storyline you have time to admire the amazing detail on the enemy designs then stunning vistas and gratifying explosions you throw out there boston and the commonwealth look great there is enought to explore to keep you busy for a long time some locales also add some neat easter eggs and references there s even a horribly irradiated horror wasteland that finally puts all the visual enhancements to work it has to be my favourite part of the game because it actually is a desolate and dangerous part of the wasteland you can also add some mods to make it look even better oh yeah bethesda king of all moddable games decided that when you use mods you don t get to win achievements i had to get a workaround because i will not be denied then my game was running funnily turned out updates to everything messed up the driver so i had to tweak my gpu to stop running the lock pick game at 1500 fps true to bethesda s mo it is not a game without technical issues i ve had crashes to desktop with or without mods lockups getting trapped in the scenery corrupted save files bugged npc s broken quests and i think i have fallen through the floor a good number of times certainly a flawed piece not a masterpiece just a piece when you add it all up it paints a bleak picture there are so many things to do but they re mostly pointless building a town useless to the game but you can make a youtube video about it another feature that has been added for the sake of social media why go on a quest when the reward is completely negligible everything is for naught you can do it but it doesn t help the main campaign or your final goal even the grand finale ends on a downer the whole game is just depressing if you have this kind of money to blow buy something more focussed want a big world to explore get the witcher 3 want to craft stuff you can buy space engineers kerbal and minecraft for this money if you play your cards right do you want to dress up in power armour and stomp around the irradiated wastes with a giant machine gun laying waste to all manner of horrors then you re going to need fallout 4 or metroid prime at least samus doesn t open her mouth in that game to spout a dumb one liner for the sake of a sarcastic dialog option despite having spent over 100 hours the final experience was a dissapointment
