2019 early access review great game or rather it was i bought this game a few years back and have put a ton of hours into base bulding zombie killing looting etc but the new alpha 17 essentially removes basebulding from the game unless you want to build a rat maze to funnel zombies through i don t takes me six days of focused mining to get to bedrock and dig a long tunnel away from the down shaft and then a big room for a cozy little home takes zombies twenty seconds to pinpoint my location through tons of rock and to dig with their hands to my lcoation it is absurd until there s an option to turn digging off or to easily mod that behavior this game is ruined for me yo fun pimps i supported you guys in pre access throw me a bone here please
