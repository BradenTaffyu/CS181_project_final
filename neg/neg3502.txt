2021 pros dere s dinosaurs water dinos this time too wow much pretty graphicals and animationsssss new environments and weather conditionscons very short pathetic story where you don t unlock the dinosaurs like you did in the 1st game 0 reward or incentive for completing story instead dinosaurs are unlocked in challenge mode which is underwhelming and lazy feeling the maps are only slightly bigger feeling making the game feel just as restrictive in building space as the 1st game maintaining dinosaur health and status is a nightmare compared to the first game a needless change only for the worse reworked game mechanics that didn t need changing power and other certain buildings now require fuel and food to maintain power and production a tedious and needless game change that feels like it was only implemented because the devs needed to put something new in the game don t fix what aint broken lack of customization when it comes to buildings and props lacks tension and horror when dinosaurs escape park goers still lack detail and feel very lifeless and cookie cutter stil doesn t display food drinks in their hand or merchandise on their body after entering shops or food vendors and no thought bubble or stats for park guests after fans complaining of that feature missing from the first game devs aren t listening to what fans and gamers want out of a jp jw dino management game overall lacks freedom customization and effort into story very restrictive feeling for an open world park management game and is disappointing at the very least when it came to my expectations for this game which wasn t very high in the first place but was still looking forward to this title more than a lot of other games this year rating 5 10 disappointed
