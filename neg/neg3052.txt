2023 the game developer clearly overvalues his dlc s and it feels like a rip off the game was never too expensive despite never going on sales so i was happy enough to purchase it at its full price but then i saw the dlc s slowly get released and each one just felt like it copied popular workshop mods i had been playing for free and suddenly wanted me to pay almost the same price as the original game the dlc s all together cost over 80 cad which is obscene that s more than the price of a triple a game and just for dlc s this is of course an entirely personal opinion and i would probably change it if anything for rimworld ever went on sale but honestly i regret buying the base game now most of the mods i enjoyed are dlc locked so i can t even appreciate the normal non dlc version terraria is a much more enjoyable game and that goes on sale for 2 50 and doesn t force dlc s horse armor truly was a mistake that broke gaming rimworld is not worth paying over 120 for i could buy 2 3 triple a games for that
