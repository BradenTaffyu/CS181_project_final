early access review i ve played a decent amount and i decided to try the game with friends again and put in more hours with the 1 0 my thoughts i ve played since 2017 so 7 out of the almost 12 years and with the pretty much just a22 release i am disappointed because the fun pimps are slapping their community monkey paw promises story and dynamic story generation system to meet new survivors instead traders that insult you chaingun toting wasteland bandit instead they must be referring to their company being bandits domesticated animals like sheep instead they must ve been referring to us for believing them stealth and diversion instead they decided they want feral sense zombie distractors attractors instead they are distracting supporters and being attracted to releasing the game to claim it s done caves instead they put an augur in the game telling us to dig our own holes failed promises bosses like the duke of navezgane and his army of mutated soldiers play as the zombies or bandit faction so is that a subtle the fun pimps recruitment everything is fine animations especially the food eating animation all food is a slab of meat you hold in your hand don t question tfp ui you want ui sound and sfx sound sliders even morrowind in 2002 had movable and resizable windows skills perks let s make everything a straight stat increase or unlock zombie difficulty they re either stat dumps or hard counters it s too quick easy for people to avoid or kill zombies and have good bases tfp let s make zombies that have infinite stamina can outrun the player have explosives to destroy bases and enough health to survive multiple magazines from the highest tier assault rifles to the head why would we do tiers of difficulty mechanics like the alien in alien isolation when we can just add bigger numbers to health damage and speed of zombies zombie trap spawns closed door unlocked maybe zombie is it a closet zombie ceiling above you definitely zombie is it an open floor fall trap into zombies triggered area it s oprah handing out zombies that know where you are you get a zombie and you get a zombie everyone gets zombies ai tfp we have ai zombies either don t know where you are even when killing a zombie beside them or know exactly where you are on blood moons optimization tfp is that a prescription medication endgame tfp you mean the avengers movie also t6 more like seasick from the fps drop actually fixing things tfp isn t that what modders are for breaking things on purpose destroying fun see that water no why would even think to collect it what do you mean because you could do it in previous versions drinking water destroys the jar yes i too break every thing i drink out of zombies smell raw meat and attracts them let s remove that because players are complaining when they carry a buffalo worth of meat magazines instead of schematics yes because i need to read 90 cookbooks in real life to learn how to make spaghetti max render distance the entire area is clear no visual obstructions tree houses etc not even a mailbox your goal a buried quest as you re digging and finishing the quest suddenly zombies spawn all around you zombie run speed content creator finds something that breaks how tfp wants you to play nerfed with a nuke you want basic clothing options no what you really want are outfits that have set bonuses so everyone who does a certain task looks the same why can t you grow food in regular soil tfp it s contaminated that s why you need a special farm plot which is filled with rotting flesh to grow proper food upcoming promises new fun fun pimps game 7 days blood moons let s not mention you can already play it as the inspiration and ideas taken from it are directly from the zombie master mod from half life and zombie master reborn for half life 2 fun pimps either purposely broke things ignored failed to deliver or twisted the promises they had for the game now it s hard to trust them and going forward as it seems like they are directly lifting ideas such as gas dump from the zombie master mod from half life to use as a cash grab in their future game s like 7 days blood moons notes they are using an undelivered promise playing as the zombie faction and tagging their new game with in app purchases we know where this is going
