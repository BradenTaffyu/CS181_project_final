2016 pretty good expansion for the sims not really sure where all these zombies and angry guys with guns came from oh wait the cowboy has another location for me to build shacks on in all seriousness average game beth tried too hard to be like bioware and failed the good beth figured out what colour is no more grey trees and grey rocks on grey ground under a grey sky i actually liked the followers they were a huge improvement over skyrim fallout 3 s and tended to be a lot more likable than fnv s the locational dialogue they had e g warning the player about loose rocks when running around cliffs was nice made me like skyrim again previously my least liked tes fo game after fnv the bad the voiced set character makes replayability difficult i like to play as myself in rpgs and having to listen to jack from mass effect instead of using my own imagination makes it impossible it s little more than an interactive movie somehow i minded it less with bioware games probably because that s what i expect from bioware but not beth a forced husband and worse a forced kid is bad such a detailed background 30 something straight married war vet lawyer with kid is bad for a bethesda rpg and even worse than skyrim s complete blank slate at least in fo3 your only background was 19 year old teen from a vault it didn t force all these rather personal choices on you radiant chores sorry quests are back and with it the repetitive and boringly pointless go to x and kill x activities that were in skyrim worse it s near impossible to avoid them if you go to sanctuary the dialogue wheel ergh enough said about that mixed i spent most of my play time either walking around shooting things or building stuff in settlements due to the lack of quests and interesting places to visit i liked the metro tunnels in fo3 apparently boston has a really extensive one i wish they d put that in my only real desire to play is to build stuff overall 5 10 a meh rating
