2023 i love this game and have most of the dlc but i cannot in good conscious recommend this to new players looking to pick up this game the dlc has gotten egregious and base game is boring without dlc and or mods and a good portion of mods require dlc unless you know someone with most of the dlc you are buying a very boring game every new major dlc adds less and less content and it feels more like you are paying for a rework paradox the developer of stellaris has a bad track record of releasing boring and bland games and slowly update it via the means of paid dlc this most recent dlc is 15 and only changes the leaders which is not enough of a change to justify it s purchase in my eyes please save your money and find another space empire game that let s you commit atrocities of lust and war paradox will not change their business practices as long as people keep buying the dlc and game
