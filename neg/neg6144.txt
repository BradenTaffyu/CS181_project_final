2019 age of empires 2 is an awesome game and the definitive edition looks beautiful even more all overhauls are fantastic there is only one massive downside if you have a bad internet connection even on lan games the game checks regulary for server connection if only one of the 8 players doesn t suceed in the check the player is kicked and you can reset the game this is a rediculous system for such an old game can not recommend the game with this consumer unfriendly behaviour
