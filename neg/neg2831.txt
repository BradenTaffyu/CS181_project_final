2016 paradox latest title has gotten a lot of good reviews but unfortunately i cannot agree with most of them stellaris is a combination of 4x and grand strategy but does neither one very good it s very much like that pretty girl from the store you really like you woo her and it starts off very fun but after spending an evening with her she gets on your nerves and turns out to be extremely high maintenance everything starts quite well with an expansive customization of your empire where you choose government form ethics and starting technologies the early game is definitely the best part of stellaris it has a lot of exploration quests and interesting choices concerning your research and expansion this quickly turns around as you move into the midgame though quests dry up quickly exploration comes to a full stop as you run into the borders of alien empires and it turns out that where you expand to does not matter as long as you do it quickly and grab as much stuff as you can the where and how is not that important for a few reasons the important resources namely energy and minerals can be gathered anywhere the strategic resources are not very relevant to prevent you from becoming too powerful too quickly stellaris forces you to give up control of planets beyond the 5th all extra planets must be put in sectors which are ai controlled regions when asking merni a developer on twitter she said that the main purpose of sectors was to reduce micromangement this is not true not only do they increase micromanagement as i will explain below but there are techs and government forms that allow you to get player control over more of them meaning that it is seen as a direct bonus to be able to control them what is bad about sectors well here is a short list of problems the ai is incompetent in managing their planets sectors require resources to build up and then pay a tax percentage of their income the problem here is they also stockpile resources that become inaccessible to you and you have to constantly check if they need resources you constantly have to check what they are doing and sometimes manually correct this managing a planet in a sector requires something like 12 clicks if you build a colony ship in a sector it won t show up in your ship list so you have to constantly check the map systems you can only put an entire starsystem in a sector not individual planets so if you have a system with 4 habitable worlds of which you want to manage 1 because it s great well that s too bad you are screwed you don t get quests for planets in sectors you don t get to do observation of lesser races in sectors or at least don t get proper alerts for it changing sectors costs influence a rare resource you can accidently due to bad interface burn through all your influence this way in short sectors cause a huge headache and an overwhelming amount of micromanagement all just to screw over the playerquests are another major annoyance it all starts well and the stories around them are pretty good unfortunately the quests are very shallow and are almost exclusively bring a science ship and use the clicky unlike in a game like civilization v for example where city state quests require a lot of diferent types of things gathering a resource trading for a luxury trying to get techs a wonder explore kill barbarians there is none of that here the only quest you will get in this game is use the clicky or spend some science points you will also start seeing repeat quests very quickly likely within your very first game as said above sectors do not seem to provide quests properly maybe it s a bug more likely it s a badly thought out feature finally we come to the cluster that is combat there is a lot to go through here so lets get started with minor stuff land invasions are completely non interactive this is a lot worse than eu4 you just click and then well wait land units can be equipped with an improvement except no one tells you this and there is no icon or link that gives an indication this is possible you just have to find out land units have to be transported in ultravulnerable ships you can t just have them on board of your fleet it s just another headache space battles are completely non interactive not only that but your ships will actively pursue mining stations during a fleet battle for example which can completely screw you over space battles starting in the mid game hog so much resources that it slows down and possibly overheats your pc most wars are determined in a single battle while a player might be able to trap the ai s fleet through elaborate schemes in order to rebuild the ai cannot do this this means that if the ai engages you with an insufficiently big stack it s dead and you just won the war as recovery is impossible space wars are annoying it s a lot of avoiding eachother since the bigger stack will almost always win unless you built your fleet entirely wrong fleets can get stuck in situations of indecision when they are floating between two equally attractive targets they can also get stuck at long range without ever moving close enough to use their weapons fleets can get stuck in separate parts of your empire after a peace treaty as you have no control over where they go after a war ends they just go somewhere interface is horrible when trying to manage multiple ships and or fleetsthe final pillar of the game science starts as a very interesting novelty where you can choose from several different techs each time while this is certainly an innovation the randomness can completely screw you over there is no in game tech tree to see what you need for what furthermore you quickly run out of techs around the midgame and everything you get after that is small passive bonuses the dangerous late game techs provide only small advantages so they are not actually worth researching and it s not incremental slippery slope deal either aside of that there are very very few techs that offer interesting new things other than small upgrades to your ship tech all interesting techs are in societal research where you unlock uplifting and genetic modifications now i m not opposed to the idea of unlocking small upgrades but there is nothing else to teching up there are no wonders in this game and very few unique things this leads to it all feeling very much the same to the point even where at one point a single techs unlocks 2 tiers of the same upgrade that brings us to the end of this complaint review with some loose comments there is no trade there is no espionage the diplomacy is extremely shallow compared to eu4 there are no luxuries and strategic resources are irrelevant the only victory conditions are either conquering everyone or having 40 of the planets there are no peaceful victories ai s will not actively pursue victory they just hang around and don t do anything goal oriented talking about ai s if you have allies or vassals in a war they will do nothing they will just put their fleets on follow of your largest active fleet so if your biggest fleet is in part a of the galaxy and your invasion fleet is in part b and needs help tough luck i won 10 hours into my campaign but needed 40 more to actually get to the victory screen once you snowball unless you are stupid nothing will be able to stop you this becomes boring and tedious really fast in conclusion while this game looks good and starts of fine it quickly becomes an overwhelming amount of micromanagement with very little strategy involved this game will need several expansions before it gets really good and will end up being a 100 game before it s really enjoyable
