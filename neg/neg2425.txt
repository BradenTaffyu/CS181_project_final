tl dr pros and conspros really easy to earn card gems or whatever battlepass can be bought with card gems copious card drops for free and events cons microtransactions edit additional info like the most skeezy of microtransaction dopamine bump dealer game designers the in game currency is bundled in awkward values so it s good that you really don t need those unless you play literally your entire day night life gacha creep periodic mind numbingly long turns where you get to watch epic combos from your opponent battle pass really easy to get through your battle pass thus you buy card gems or whatever those ten minute turns are by design they build frustration that you aren t the one with the sweet dragon or waifus whatever cause if you had those waifus or dragons you could be winning in ten minute turns tooooo the problem with yugioh as much as i loved it back in the day is that it s grown into an unwieldy beast of effects and interactions that results in a boring mess i have the same issue with magic the gathering are people that entertained by monotony cause after watching my opponent take ten minutes to play through their turn turn two for half an hour it highlights the problem with both i know i kinda said that already they stopped trying to balance the game it s almost like most of the time they get amnesia in regard to their game and decide they need to wildly change the game and suddenly ignore every effect they used in the past then they ll come back and realize oh we have all these cards and effects let s update that magic the gathering has existed for so long that they already baked in a system into their gacha game to keep it evergreen standard setting which for them means basically the most recent stuff usually just the last three to five years worth of sets but even then they periodically drop a of sets from that format if my exact details are fuzzy apologies it s been a decade since i got off of that papercrack and i will never go back thankfully i ve learned to be more discerning i understand my mind a bit better so the third problem you might have picked up on comes up magic yugioh pokemon they ve all been a gacha trap from day 1 though we ve only come to realize how that tricks the brain it s legal gambling for kids but the laws fail to catch up for reasons i don t need to get into in a game review this game highlights it even more with all the trappings of a modern game batltlepass dailies etc i love the accessibility but frankly i see that it s designed to frustrate it s designed to instill envy to grow dissatisfied and pay for more cards however that will not ever make it possible to get through those ten minute long turns it just means that you ll periodically also get those ten minute turns that will either frustrate your opponent to the point of surrender or win you the game in one epic combo that was basically just clicking the rollercoaster of cards to get the combo off
