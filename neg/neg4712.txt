2023 aimlabs used to be really good but now they added a lot of stuff behind a paywall that would have been better if it was free there is no real reason for me to keep using aimlabs because i have kovaak s and now that aimlabs is behind a paywall mostly it s very mediocre sucks that they ruined another good thing with microtransactions subscriptions devs these days suck and are too greedy reply to the dev cool story bro i m a developer too and still going to kovaak s i do realize devs have to make money but putting universal sens and things that could actually be really helpful behind a paywall just makes people like me who were really enthusiastic about the trainer to begin with leave also most of the stuff you used in whatever engine unreal or unity are literally just spheres and cubes assets you can make for free server costs sure but let s be honest here this is just about you making a mint that might work on people who don t know development costs of games but when most of the shapes you use are primative shapes don t try to play like that the trainer was great then you started adding bloated paid stuff to try to make revenue to line your pockets many people in the reviews are complaining about this too btw not just me you would have been better off putting all of it together and selling it for 1 price like kovaak s is doing rather than try to suck your original customer base dry good luck when this dies out bud
