2021 this is a fun game with a huge caveat the company that runs it is very greedy worse than ea and activision manages the community poorly ignores player and community contributor feedback outright broken promises and lies and gates content behind lootboxes and various in game currencies in a way that makes it very hard to know how much you are actually spending on a particular item premium in game content is ridiculously overpriced multiple examples in the premium shop for tier 8 and tier 9 ships typical prices for a single ship in those tiers are in the range of 60 to 80 they have not made any new game content other than ship lines another way they reach for your money in nearly two years no new battle maps scenarios for operations or battle modes beyond temporary themed events do you enjoy pve they offer those modes but don t expect much some in game content is earned through missions however very rarely is pve included in completing those missions progress in working your way up ship tiers will take you roughly 3 times as many battles as doing it in pvp wg would much rather you spend your time and money in random battles pvp this company s business model thrives on sunk cost fallacy and the fear of missing out of game content by gating a lot of content behind time restriction in ability to earn those ships containers or items i cannot recommend this game to any new players at all while it is a fun game the way the company operates in trying to extract money out of the players is downright scummy in addition to the how terrible they treat the community
