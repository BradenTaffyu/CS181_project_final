2020 early access review can t recommend in this broken state as someone who has 3k hours in warband and around 70 hours in the closed beta alot of the issues with the mp that i describe have been issues throughout the beta that were clearly outlined to the developers who have mostly ignored the feedback from the tester i d say wait a year or atleast afew months before purchasing this the majority of these positive reviews are from fanboys vets wearing tinted warband glasses multiplayer has only 3 game modes siege skirmish tdm siege is extremely unbalanced for the attackers due to the health of siege equipment being very very low and the attackers not having enough time tdm will keep you entertained for a grand total of five minutes before you get bored of the aimless killing skirmish is the only real positive from the mp in its current state no duel or battle mode either replayability for multiplayer at the moment is very low but who plays bannerlord for the mp right danother reason why i suggest you wait before purchasing is to allow the developers to fix the absolute boring and shallow combat system currently most fights in skirmish consist of long boring 1v1 duels due to the lack of any real option to feint or confuse your opponents such as in warband and the ridiculous health of shields which results in long drawn out 1v1 duels and eventually one side losing because you ve been ganked by three people at once game is very unoptimized most users are having to turn down settings for a game that graphically is fairly average i m playing with an rtx 2070 super and an i7 7700k just finished a siege in sp and my frames were dropping to 10 15 fps at certain points really bad crashes happen all the time which is very annoying as you always seem to be losing at best fifteen minutes of progress when i first got the game i wasn t in the habit of saving often which resulted in me losing hours of progress due to the crashes save games are being corrupted by the latest patches so it s highly likely you will lose your progress in singleplayer in short just wait
