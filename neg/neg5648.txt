2018 funny i though this game was long long before the fanbase started boycotting the review section with negativity the senate system was terrible a certain animation bug forums totalwar com and a failed map system with glitched map sections ruined my experience there are of course far more bugs than what i can mention here i have come back and forth to see if this game has gone better but i feel about the same enjoyment as day 1 garbage i know i have more hours than i should have given my attitude but back then it was the only new total war at the time and i was bored so i played the one fueled my hatred towards rome 2 and finally i can see the negative review it deserves mostly negative and my opinion it should stay that way a grim reminder of what happens when a game sucked on day one and when an uncalled for attemt to revivie it with dlc s fails i know many of the total war loves this game and wants this to be great but be real it won t same regarding attila which was my favourite one for a long time it won t be good this game engine was a mistake and hopefully we won t see that in total war three kingdons my opinion unlikely very self centered review this time but i just want to vent on this game outside of the recent controvercy i still love laughing at it
