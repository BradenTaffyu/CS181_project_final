2018 in many ways this is superior game to fallout 3 new vegas on a technical level graphically it s a leap above 3 background music is much improved and enemy design is great unfortunately it s about a third of a great game wonderfully crafted locations dangling plothooks hinting towards a well crafted story is a raider camp it doesnt matter how it looks it s going to be a raider camp or a supermutant camp combat is great for fpsing and the slo mo vats is a interesting change but the randomly generated epic loot is janky crafting your own base sounds great and i will admit that i lost a lot of time messing with it but it doesnt matter how impervious your base appears if you are not there and it gets raided it will get wrecked adding in a voiced protagonist sounds great but all the dialog choices boil down to yes no more information and snarky yes there are plenty of points where what you say has zero consequence on the conversation you may get a liked that but the branching dialog trees from the previous games are gone radiant missions sounds neat infinite replayability and all that but it boils down to another settlement needs your help from infinitely respawning baddies i ve clocked 348 hours got most of the way through the main questline and i just stopped caring none of the factions had redeeming qualities and the one that made the most sense were the bad guys but since there s no way to un jackass ify any of them the background music is better but the radio is mostly identical to fallout 3 there s a few new tracks but if you re coming from new vegas it s a step backwards most of the dlcs are just item packs for the base creation stuff that modders would make in a long weekend for free but for 5 bucks 3 times instead creation club is an interesting idea but it looks to be more for god items and recolored skins for a dollar than fallout miami or new california for ten also it s been 3 years 60 for goty edition is uncalled for i can honestly say that the engine despite it s age still looks good but the storyline and the lack of things to do iks holding it back it s like a sandwich they spread the good stuff too thin and it ends too bland for me maybe when modders start releasing some total conversions
