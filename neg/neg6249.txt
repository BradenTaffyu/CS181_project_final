2023 i have hundreds of hours in this game on mobile i cannot and will not ever recommend this game due to terrible greedy hurtful business practices the devs double down on every new season the game mechanically has gotten much much better from where it was when it left beta but as far as their ever increasing pricing practices continually updating reserves caches to be more and more worthless and the fact that the last 3 spotlights i managed to farm exclusively paid out the 1000 collector s tokens instead of any of the cards in them this game is ing awful and one of the most punishing gacha progression systems i ve ever experienced dog devs dog monetization dog experience and all of this really really ing sucks because it s actually a really really good game
