it s super underwhelming especially the further in you get by the end i was just thinking is that it the world feels dead the characters actually do have some ok moments though they are rare as mostly they are very basic for the sake of their little story to make sense the ending can barely be called an ending i ll mention the true ending not a spoiler as it s obvious you win the house cup due to some points you got magicked to your house the npcs at the tables despawn you stand awkwardly at the back at the door of the great hall while 2 people you ve never seen before jump up and down with a creepy expression on their face yep that s it that s the entire ending you get from having high completion rate while playing i enjoyed it for the first 20 or so hours there is enough there to be like huh this seems cool but it s just paint the majority of the stuff under it is just shallow and lazily made it s great at first impressions it s great at seeming deep but once you get into it properly casting forbidden magic in front of npcs that hate it with no consequence choices not mattering literally at all beyond a single dialogue line tons of repetitive side content to spend hours on that simply gives you nothing special and really isn t worth it repetitive enemies and world layout locations decent story only to lose steam half way in it s just really superficial i only kept going because i kept convincing myself it d get better any moment now and it ll all be worth it instead of it just continuously getting more and more flawed
