2018 as has been said previously total war games are historically authentic not historically accurate if having female units upsets you that much you can either mod them out or just not play this comes straight from ca employee it created such a of bad reviews that rome 2 really dropped in its scores and i would be really surprised if this person will keep her job actually she doesn t deserve it nobody felt the need for this feminist nonsense except maybe the minority of female players because and let s be honest female players in this subgenre are a rarity i have enough of this politically correct thing that generally backfires against men cause you know we are men getting as answer we did it you suck it up after a game has been retroactively modified is not helping a company in retain the customers this specific customer who is writing right now had always been loyal and had no problem in spending couple of hundred bucks each year in their games but i think i had just enough of it i survived all the bad things of tw games eg desyncs in shogun 2 or the horrible day 1 of rome 2 but what i really cannot stand is disrespect towards customers therefore i will boycott britannia which was going to be my next purchase and three kingdoms congratulation ca you managed to lose one of your most trusted buyers
