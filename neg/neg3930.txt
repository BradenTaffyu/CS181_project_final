2021 dead cells is a textbook example of a souls wannabe that doesn t understand the difference between difficulty and challenge the normal difficulty is great the combat is satisfying the game is punishing but ultimately rewards skill and patience and there s so much good stuff to work towards unlocking that you never really feel like you re spinning your tires after your first takedown of the final boss however it all starts to fall apart to get the true ending the game requires you to beat it on 5 bsc the hardest difficulty as you increase the bsc of your run the game s approach to difficulty becomes increasingly lazy and artificial enemies are copied and pasted literally they show up grouped in twos threes and so on healing eventually becomes completely unavailable and you get locked into relentlessly hunting down one of two or three loadouts and playing each run the exact the same way because the vast majority of the weapons and equipment that were so fun to experiment with at lower difficulties are no longer viable to make matters worse there s comparatively little new gear to find at higher bsc the pool of unlockables to spend your cells on dries up so quickly that before long playing the game feels like running on a very frustrating very unfun treadmill and you will die again and again and again with nothing to show for the time you invested combine that with the fact that the developers have made a number of baffling changes that have utterly destroyed the balance of the game such as nerfing gold gain and severely crippling the most popular healing mutation as opposed to examining why the majority of their players felt it was necessary and adjusting the game and you have a game whose developer clearly wants to offer a punishing experience but has no idea how to craft a game that is genuinely challenging and rewarding to play
