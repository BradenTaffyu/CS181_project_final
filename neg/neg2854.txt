2018 i ll keep it simple i bought stellaris because it was unique to other 4x games you were not bound to a spiderweb map hyperlanes different races started off with different flt and different weapons but now after 2 0 stellaris is completely different to the game i originally bought and loved it turned from a unique 4x title into just any other 4x title with space hyperlanes and every race starts off with the exact same weapons they basically took our gameplay choices away from us after 2 0 i went looking for another 4x game to play but found out every other 4x game is exactly the same as stellaris where you are bound to hyperlanes they found it too hard to fix what already existed in the game so they just burnt everything to the ground and started new with something much more dumbed down than what they had before went from 3 flt choices to just hyperlanes like every other 4x game has also the fact it s as if all the past patches and balances they did never happened like i said above this 2 0 update basically burnt everything to the ground and started from zero again like those 2 years worth of balancing never happened
