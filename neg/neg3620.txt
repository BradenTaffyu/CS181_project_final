i normally don t like leaving bad reviews but wow the sheer amount of greed laziness and contempt for the community that has supported this game for over a decade is astounding it was already ridiculous that this game has been in an alpha state for 12 years but to jump the gun and call it a 1 0 release just to raise the price on an unfinished buggy alpha build that frankly was already mediocre in terms of creative direction and gameplay by a team that spends more time designing twitch integration and hiring streamers to shill for their product than actually developing said product is infuriating to put it nicely off the fun pimps i regret ever buying this game
