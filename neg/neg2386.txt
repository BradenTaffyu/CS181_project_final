2019 its lack of features and short campaign doesnt justify 60 euro pricepoint gameplay wise its the best anno they made so far but stripping it for content to sell as season pass or use the live service with content updates through the year is not suited for this game even worse late game is bugged as hell quests are broken and cant be completed while ships suddenly forget their waypoint actions
