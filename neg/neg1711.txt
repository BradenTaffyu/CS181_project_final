2023 at this point i am pissed the game is free by now which is nice but the dlcs are just way overpriced recently there have been some updates instead of only adding new and expensive dlcs which in theory sounds nice however the recent updates have just included loads of bugs imo fe my infant doesn t sleep in its crib but is glued to their caretakers feet and slides over the floor while sleeping this one is still kinda funny cause it doesn t really interrupt the gameplay but after about an hour of playing and changing between build mode and live mode the game just freezes and i have to start over yes i have uninstalled all mods and deleted reinstalles the game theres also the general frustration with updates contents why would i want an infant sim its just a toddler that cannot do anything yeah i guess realism but theres so much they could ve added so why could ve just made it a free dlc instead so everyone who wants it can install it and everyone who doesnt isn t forced to also whats with the infants positions in the clothes changing menu i can t even see half the clothes and if you select pants they just point their booties at u which is kinda weird and like i wanna style an outfit not only their bum imo ea is just trying to farm as much money as they can from sims which btw is not a new problem as u can see it in sims 3 aswell that is really sad cause in theory it would be a great game but all the money grabbing is just making me feel really frustrated tldr dlcs are expensive af recent updates have been more annoying than helpful nice imo ea is just trying to farm as much money as they can from sims but recently noticed that people are getting more and more annoyed so they drop useless updates to make some people happy
