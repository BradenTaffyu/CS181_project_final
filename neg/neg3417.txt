i wouldn t say don t buy this game i just wish i hadn t bought it so that i could still enjoy cs1 it s been a year since the turbulent release and except for resolved the critical bugs the game is still not on par compared to the first game s quality and content with regular crashes to desktops and game simulation speed grinding down to a halt after 150k 200k population there is no point in being creative you re already unable to since there isn t much content to suit your narrative yet there is no point in being expansive because after some point each simulation minute takes five minutes there is no point in discovering because you cannot spend your skill points without an either or question it s never both unless you play with everything unlocked there are improvements to the first game such as mixed zoning and road building which i m also angry about because now i can t go back to the first game after getting used to the comfort of these newer mechanics i m in such a state that i can play neither the first nor the second game with actual enjoyment
