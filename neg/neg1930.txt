2015 hoo boy where do i begin with this as a bit of a fair warning i am 100 not against the core of this game this game is quite a solid platform everything performs mostly as it should and we re getting british tanks soon that s bound to appeal to more than one might imagine the updates for the most part reasonable the amount of ridiculousness from those yak 9s going through the roof yes but this is why you get either a plane that can reasonably ensnare the little sky devils or go aaa if possible simulation is quite nice despite me sucking at them to an absolute degree realistic plays fine and if you re not keen on either arcade will likely hold what you want none of these are faulty it s the moderation base and the lack of caring that make me hit no on the recommendations panel the worst bit they ll silence you if you speak up against them about it for god s sake we re trying to help you and you shoot us down like we re nothing but scrubs and by the way that is even if you pay they don t care who you are you ll get shut up one way or another another key problem is the graphics what you were expecting me to say battle rating find another review they ll explain it i personally find it hilarious when i gun down a plane with a br higher than mine let s get this out of the way like the core gameplay the core graphics are not an issue heck they re some of the most beautiful to date for those who play realistic i m sure you ll agree with me on this if you play ground forces in realistic or simulator there is an option within the game settings to turn the bushes off yeah not down to a minimum outright off this is a huge problem that gaijin refuses to fix and it s impacting realistic ground battles to this day and simulator but realistic at the least it s understandable for low end pcs but this is straight up an advantage for players who want to shoot you while you re not even able to see them if you have your bushes on this and especially the lack of a caring development base are what make me not recommend this game if what it takes for me to change my mind is an administrative reform at gaijin entertainment then so help me arceus do it on the flip side though if you re just someone who just enjoys a good tank and plane game once all this settles down it s a good game just don t go talking negative within the game if you expect to stay there and hope you have fun out there
