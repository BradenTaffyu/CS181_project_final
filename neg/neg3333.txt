2017 paradox is of course infamous for putting out ludicrous amounts of dlc for every single one of their games but i ve always felt that most of their games in particular eu4 and stellaris are all complete games of their own and can be enjoyed without requiring the dlcs however hoi4 is the first time i ve played one of their games and felt that it was lacking something to make it complete as it is the game boils down to simply drawing lines on the map and push a button to tell your generals to advance the ai of which feel both unbearably dumb yet completely necessary if only for the sheer number of forces and fronts you have to wage war on perhaps people who really enjoy micromanagement can get more enjoyment out of this game but for me it just felt kinda dull i ve heard that the multiplayer is way more interesting than single player games and i can certainly see how that can be while the game covers land sea and air and in single players it s hard to get keep up with research on all 3 and even harder to have an industry to keep all 3 up to date perhaps in multiplayer where each player is free to specialize in their own areas it might get more interesting but sadly i ve only gotten to experience this game in single player mode for now tl dr this game is decnet but definitely not worth the full price in my personal opinion
