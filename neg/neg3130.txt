i just find their promotions criminal they sell camouflage skins for ships even though the ship can t be obtained example a player can buy a camouflage for the uss enterprise that will make the ship look like the star trek enterprise 1701 d but the game makers don t tell the buyer that the uss enterprise is no longer offered in their store they know they are ripping off the game player that buys the camouflage for 30 by not offering the ship it is attached to but the game makers don t care about their misleading sells practices they would rather you ask for a refund than be honest up front
