2016 so with the latest patch i felt like this needed a review and unfortunately it is negative the game overall feels overly simplified and has some questionable mechanical choices such as the front line system while a cool idea it the ai is unable to handle it properly and will move troops around forfitting foritifaction bonuses that can lead to the front colapseing the lack of ability to control this short of manualy moving everything and forfitting planning bonuses seems like a pretty big problem also the game feels far to stuck in history too many of the national focus trees focus on following history without much deviation and the deviation there is feels rather off and with some nations will even cut you off from other important national focuses and lastly my biggest issue with this game is that they stuck the spearhead option as part of the dlc instead of being part of the base game i understand the dlc should have some meat to back it up but something like that is actualy important mechanicaly to the game and should have been part of the patch not a paid for dlc
