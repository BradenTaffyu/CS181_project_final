2015 as a big fallout fan i wouldn t recommend fallout 4 to a fellow fallout fan people who has played the previous series will be disapointed the dialogs are rushes the skills are gone a lot of what was done right in fallout 3 and new vegas has been forgotten this is a new fallout game it s a shooter with rpg elements much like borderlands the game feels rushes the graphics is out dated the dialogs aren t sync correctly there s a lot of these minor thing that makes the game unfinished i d say wait untill it s on sale or the modding community has had it s time to make adjustments if you however haven t played the fallout series you might enjoy it
