2022 early access review if the game is in the same state it is now upon full release which is supposedly happening soon then please don t spend money on this i bought this in early access as soon as i could because i loved the first and was sold on a deeper more complex system in the sequel it lived up to none of it s promises i ve definitely have put tons of hours into it the combat is fun and many of the mechanics are fun at first but it all seems and feels like an unfinished version of a much better and fulfilling game which is why i don t recommend it in this state if this is what s considered complete it s disapointing this is why i m moving away from paying for early access games devs often seem to quit developing the game once they ve made enough profit from the early access sales meaning we very rarely actually get a finished game just a bunch of expensive demos if on full release there is a large update that adds tons of mechanics assets and polish to the game i ll update my review after playing what would be a completely different game until then don t pay for half finished half hearted crap
