if you re a casual player or you don t spend money it s impossible to keep up with the meta if you do daily challenges you get 1 key per week to guarantee the new card you need at least 4 keys every week there s a new card added to the game see where i m going the game was fun at first the token shop was decent now tokens are scarce with the introduction of the spotlight caches they totally ruined the game i feel like i m behind and i m always missing crucial cards to meta decks the game itself is really good but it got to a point where you really need to spend money and play every day for hours to keep up with the new cards added to the game if you take a break from the game and miss a season or two you ll struggle a lot when you come back to it give it a try it will be fun at first but if you expect a free to play game you won t get that experience here
