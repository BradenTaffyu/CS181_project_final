2023 early access review garbage gacha game disguised as a marvel card game the quick match pvp card game format is incredible with matches only lasting 6 turns by default and games often being settled in a matter of 3 5 minutes you can bang one out while standing in line or waiting around unfortunately the dev team working on this game is winging it at best and incompetent at worst card acquisition has been an issue since the game launched last summer and sd has applied bandaid fix upon bandaid fix to make it feel less horrible and failed every time if you re curious look up the token shop for a general idea of how it s been received since it got added a few months back it s not great and recently got changed to be even worse by removing the ability to use collector s tokens on series 3 cards the largest pool and the one most necessary for making competitive decks at that level the matchmaking is awful sometimes getting matched up against the same players 4 times in a row unless you re playing at peak hours the gap between players ranks when getting matches is huge i think it s something like 30 ranks in either direction you can be matched with meaning there can be huge discrepancies in skill level there are certain limitations when it comes to who you can be matched with regarding collection sizes such as series 1 players only being matched with other series 1 players however if you re in the much larger series 3 portion of the collection somewhere around 90 cards opposed to other series 20 40 cards it s a crapshoot you might get matched up with someone that has a complete meta deck while you just recently reached series 3 and have a frankenstein deck made out of desperation and shattered dreams shop bundles are ridiculously overpriced for what you get from them aside from some very rare occasions where there will be a value bundle to keep the carrot in front of casual players faces lots of great card variants skins are locked behind bundles and none of them so far have repeated which is a nightmare if you re subject to fomo like myself or have a particular character artist you really like and want a cool skin for the devs have no idea what they re doing as far as balance goes which is surprising considering ben brode s heading the project and he has about 80 years of experience coming from hearthstone and apparently learned nothing during them a handful or more of cards have been hit with heavy handed nerfs over the past few months leaving about half of them unplayable meanwhile other cards have their power bounced back and forth every other month because the go to approach is 1 power or 1 power problematic card effects get danced around as long as possible until they re ultimately nerfed into obsoletion sometimes coincidentally lining up with those cards no longer being locked behind the 10 mo battle pass balance passes happen about once a month so if there s ever a problematic meta like there is currently with shuri decks and previously with silver surfer decks you re going to be stuck with it for the rest of the month their customer service is absolutely horrible if you join the marvel snap discord you ll see regular posts of people having awful interactions with customer service reps that are either dismissive or unhelpful if you ever accidentally buy something in the shop with credits gold money or collector s tokens it doesn t matter there s a zero percent chance that you successfully get a refund or exchange of any sort the layout of the shop makes it very easy to accidentally purchase a skin or quick upgrade you might not want with large purchase buttons on a screen you have to scroll through all in all the underlying idea of the game is great but the execution is fumbled in almost every possible respect a digital card game can struggle with aside from art because most of it is from the actual comics i hope it pulls through eventually i m a couple hundred bucks deep in at this point and i m a sucker when it comes to sunk cost but in its current state i absolutely would not recommend this game to anyone other than marvel fans that are content with just seeing their favorite superheroes villains represented in a game people looking for a solid card game have better options elsewhere and amazingly enough you d probably spend less time and money on a competitive deck in mtg a than you would in this game with how terrible the card acquisition is for credentials before i get clown emoji d into oblivion i m cl 4000 have collected all of series 3 and most of current series 4 as of writing this and have easily double the amount of playtime on mobile than i do on steam i ve hit infinite the highest rank atm for 5 seasons in a row usually within a few days of a new season starting i ve been playing since the global launch back in october so i ve been around long enough to see a pattern of awful behavior that hasn t really changed oh and a bonus round for anyone that made it this far look up nexus events from the beta period of marvel snap it was more lootbox rng gacha mechanics that would make the likes of epic seven or raid shadow legends blush this team has been making bad decisions for a very long time now
