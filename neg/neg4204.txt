2017 to play the game you need the dlc weapons and games spawn into matches but you cannot use them unless you buy the dlc for example a helicopter was picking us up but when i went to enter the helicopter it informed me i need to buy an expansion to get into it this is the worst dlc structure i have ever seen literally ruins the game
