2016 sept 19 2016new updates all look like great improvements but announcements like content that is larger than an event pack but smaller than a full expansion is the problem with paradox more unethical nickel and dime tactics if paradox were honest this is what they would say stellaris release date 2017 60 us game still isn t finished and they re asking the consumer to spend more money on it aug 27 2016at this point i think it would better if paradox stopped releasing any updates call stellaris done you made the game you released it it failed work on everything wrong with it behind the scenes get all the features into one large expansion and release that no more than one such expansion per year in the meantime only release patches for actual bugs this would sit better with me as a consumer than this piecemeal we fixed the game a little but to get the whole fix pay us more it s like if the person who installed my sink did a bad job came over and fixed it with duct tape and then told me but if you really want your sink to work pay me for some new parts this is neither a good work ethic nor a good business ethic eat your humble pie regroup and then release a new game with a discount to current owners of course or a major end all be all expansion ie the kind that only come once a year the kind that games use to make regarding gameplay i discuss more of my thoughts comparing stellaris to master of orion in the following video youtube video every stellaris run in a nutshell views 7 457 891 i ve always wanted to use this song for something and paradox gave me the chance always happy to plug one of my favorite genres of music filk aug 4 2016at best this game has been boring from the start but i held off writing a negative review because it had the potential to be a great game if the devs responded to community feedback and increased the content in a measured fashion instead of relying on mods to do that for them but with the release of the first dlc the proverbial camel s back has been broken let me first explain what this game was lacking in cosmetics that irked me there are only 6 ship models in the game you can have dozens of factions but there are only 6 ship model styles to choose from you couldn t even at least select a color for the ship chrome now compare to most games where there is a unique ship model for every faction and that always comes out to being more than 6 the city artwork is similarly non diversified what a wasted opportunity for immersion now the boring the game is slow immersion would really help here but as i said above there s too little to carry me over every faction i play and every faction i meet just feels like alien species 2 ironically when you first meet alien races that exactly how they re labeled another reason this game is boring is that the starts always feel formulaic there will always be an inhabitable planet within your starting territory that is medium size there will always be a large planet just outside your empire range always so you automatically research colony ship and always colonize basically the same way there s no square 1 diversification in the game you don t have to be a statistician to understand that a slight variable early on has large repurcussions down the line what a wasted opportunity to make the game play differently each time instead there s the same hostile bs in surrounding systems the same gas grazers etc same same same as i said races feel very samey because you are too limited on how many picks you can take and the differences those picks make don t really make your race that radically different one huge reason this is stymied is that there are many interesting 1 quirks to allow you to get positive traits but since you can only take 4 picks period well you can take 4 interesting 1 quirks and then be left with yep 0 picks to spend on positive traits so you end up taking a couple of quirks that really don t push your race one way or the other toward something interesting hate hate hate but it s fixed in the mods use the extended traits mods sorry it s the vanilla game that counts here i m not fixing the game with other peoples stuff i want to buy a complete game not have to fix it myself with mods that may or may not contain the changes that would make me happy vanilla game counts next you ll tell me how phantom menace was a good movie if i d read the novelization or some crap no what s the biggest fix that has gone unaddressed with the game nothing less than the end game what is the end game well er you get bored because there is no diplomatic victory no military victory no economics no well nothing except control everything everywhere for some this may be fine for me it means that after a certain charm point where you re still discovering new features in the game it turns into a slog kill repeat kill repeat could there please be some other alternative for ending the game other than me getting bored but in the end it s the terrible ethics of the developer that have pushed me into outrage you are asking people to pay for cosmetic dlc when the core game itself is still woefully lacking you should be giving this art away it should have been there in the first place compare this team s work ethic to that of the team behind cities skylines they continued to add major modifications to their base game even after releasing dlc their approach toward their core game was so admirable i bought their dlc simply to support them did i need snow or after dark no but i appreciate that they added underground lanes to the base game instead of making it a dlc so much that i felt obliged to buy their dlc you should too please encourage developers like those behind cities skylines and thea the awakening and please discourage paradox from these shennanigans if you want to play stellaris my recommendation is only buy on sale if you want a good space 4x game check out the master of orion reboot ps for would be pedantic phallus weeds developer is not the same as publisher keep that in mind before you miss the point i m making about cities skylines
