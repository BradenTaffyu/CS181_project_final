2016 in fallout new vegas you were shot in the head by some the choices that you get on the way to find him are endlessly entertaining the story of fallout new vegas didn t try to force this emotional reaction on you it didn t constantly remind you that oh man you got shot aren t you angry and so frustrated fallout 4 on the other hand i have never cared so little about a mainquest or the character i play as and trying to imagine your character as someone different get s destroyed as soon as anything related to shaaaun is brought up in fallout 4 i have one single playthrough while usually i have at least 7 i don t see the point to even start a new game because what would i do differently there are no choices at all everything is set up for you please hand the entire fallout franchise back to obsidian and stick to the elder scrolls
