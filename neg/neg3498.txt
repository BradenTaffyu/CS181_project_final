2021 okay i really really really love this game but the micromanagement is incredibly poorly done when your dinosaurs get sick you have to send the medical mobile twice to check up on them once to diagnose them and then second to actually treat them the massive outbreaks that can occur the shoddy vet system left me double clicking around my park for a solid 40 minutes it was really tedious and i nearly restarted my entire save because it was getting that uncontrollable secondly the amount of broken bones and internal bleeding these dinosaurs can get is insane they have to be treated at the vet and again it s just tedious with all the clicking they make you do you feel like you re doing so much work when in reality you ve done nothing at all and now you re broke from trying to micromanage your constantly sick dinosaurs the scientist system could ve been great but by forcibly pausing the game every time you re trying to manage your scientists just adds to the sluggishness the jwe1 had i find myself staring and waiting at my screen even more than the first game scientist recovery needs to be a little shorter and they need to be able to do a little more if the game has to be paused every time you re trying to tweak their abilities or figure out if you have enough logistics to get a new research project i really love the graphics and the improved facility building systems but honestly i do regret buying the pre order a little had i have known that all the new added features don t actually do anything to eliminate you waiting for your funds to build up i would ve given this a miss and stuck to the first game yes the dinosaur animations are cute but i m also sick of seeing them fighting and getting themselves hurt i m really hoping that they fix the level of micromanagement in the game add more actual things to do while you re waiting so that the game feels more enjoyable and playable solid 4 10 great graphics but gameplay
