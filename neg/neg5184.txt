2020 fun game at first but poorly balanced and rife with add ons to get the full features and a fixed mechanic that makes the end of the game always a defeat ex many races are not playable until you pay the biggest problem however is the lack of any customization options you cannot turn off things like the raging hordes from the north that wipe out all the nations on the map eventually it feels pointless to just play to see how long you can survive until drowning the theme seemed really cool at first but this is a terribly limited totalwar title and it requires so much dlc just to make it fun that it feels insulting really disappointing at the end of the day for a total war title
