2022 like most mmos this game is enormous and takes a long time to navigate however as a player i found the game to be fun during the sixty day subscription too which i racked up 265 hours of gameplay while i will never be considered an elitist player by any standards this review is based on the perspective of a first time subscriber the pros the game was fun and the questing was a blast as a new player it was easy to navigate around the planets and start gaining experience points xp to level up additionally i could see many other players running around the zones and playing letting me know that some form of community engagement is taking place after trying out a few uprisings and missions i reached out to a few players and was initiated into a guild being in a guild benefited new players by providing a 10 xp boost additionally this allowed me to level up quickly hence as a reward i purchased some cartel coins premium currency which quickly allowed me to rack up 1 billion credits in a few days the con major it didn t take long into the game to realize the economy of star wars is disproportionately lopsided most auction house ah items measure hundreds of millions to one billion credits the cap unfortunately most good things are sold outside the ah because the broken game economy prevents these items from exceeding the ah 1 billion limits this virtual economic catastrophe is infuriating for a new player because the day my subscription ran out my overall experience with the game character connection was negatively impacted because my subscription ran out i lost access to over 500 million credits as they were automatically shifted over to an in game escrow account if you are not a subscribed player you are not allowed to simultaneously have more than 1 000 000 1m credits in your possession however if you foot the sixty day subscription bill you can carry all the money credits you want this tactic would have worked when the virtual economy was stable but now it prevents preferred players from essentially interacting within the community this also promotes a profoundly negative financial impact on the entire community including those that pay for the subscription by not allowing preferred players to engage and participate in the modern virtual economy subscribed paying players items cannot be purchased from the ah if costs exceed the 1 million from a preferred player s total allowance this tactic thus prevents the movement of finances from one player to another therefore stifling the broken economy even further a viable solution would be to remove the escrow accounts and increase the costs of auction house final sale fees based on a paid subscription versus preferred status in addition it would allow the preferred players to purchase subscribing player s items from the ah maximizing the sales opportunities for the players paying extra for a subscription regardless the fact all my funds were automatically transferred out of my inventory into this escrow account is unfortunate to make matters worse as a new player i was ill informed of these constrictive tactics before them taking place i did start by saying mmos are large to navigate but this felt more like a tactic of trickery than a navigational game mechanic to top this off the day my subscription ran out i was automatically booted from my guild royalty as i was no longer a subscribed player this left me feeling much less of a preferred player and more like disciplinary action was being taken against me even though i followed all the rules and community guidelines the game offers preferred players a way to access these escrow funds at the cost of cartel coins the game s version of premium currency the frustrating part is the number of cartel coins it would cost to transfer enough from the escrow account into the player s inventory would vastly exceed the cost of a sixty day subscription this did not seem like the initial intended effect just something that happened over time due to the virtual economy becoming hyper inflated however how it has been left for paying consumers to deal with seems inappropriate and more like a blatant scam if a customer purchases cartel coins then buys premium content items to sell on the auction house the game shouldn t reprimand the customer by seizing your virtual assets for an additional sixty day subscription which costs real non virtual currency additionally this mechanic pushes more players further away from the community because when the subscription runs out and the money departs the inventory for escrow the players will leave the game indefinitely as countless other competitors provide access to content without financial manipulation and trickery as a player i feel cheated as a consumer i feel defrauded first i paid real for the cartel coins which i turned into credits via the in game auction house then when the subscription runs out the company that sold you the premium currency locks 99 of your in game credits behind a premium currency paywall to generate more money for themselves how this is legal and not considered a pyramid scheme is beyond my comprehension imagine if you forgot to pay the renewal cost on a magazine subscription and they turn around and seize 99 of all your assets as a previous paying consumer i certainly do not feel like a preferred player after this experience
