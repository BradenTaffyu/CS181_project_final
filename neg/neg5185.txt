2019 ridiculously unjustified price hikes and low quality customer service from ca their partnership with netease doesn t help their case at all no warning no word just a price hike ridiculous doesn t cut it i sincerely hope this is temporary but looking at the precedent set by their behavior these past few years especially by certain staff members who act in an extremely unprofessional manner i wouldn t be surprised if customers are treated even worse in the near future
