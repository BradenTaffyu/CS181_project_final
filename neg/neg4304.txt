2017 after numerous shorter games and romperstomping my way through a huge map with 11 ai players conquest only victory and epic timescale i really feel that i ve played enough to say that the ai in this game is an absolute joke really this game isn t worth your time get civ v instead it s a far superior game my key issues are as follows 1 the ai repeatedly declares war sends nothing to attack you then begs for peace some turns later prostrating themselves before you with offerings of gold and luxuries 2 when at war with the ai they never attack i remember playing civ iv and seeing armies building up on my border before the ai declares war no behaviour of that sort is to be seen here 3 the ai is schizophrenic and utterly moronic they will condemn you for warmongering while frequently attempting to encourage you to join in their wars involving yourself in even a single war during an otherwise peaceful playthrough can lead to unanimous loathing from the ai with constant denouncements being shouted at you 4 the ai never uses aircraft 5 the ai settles cities in any location they can and leaves them completely undefended the ai does not choose efficient locations for city building and thus irritates that player into having to declare war in order to raze the cities and more efficiently use the land 6 the victory screen statistics are total garbage there is no map replay 7 the ui feels a bit awkward with various essential tools seemingly overlooked there is for example no list of all units if you want to find your builders you must do this manually by scrolling over your empire a further oversight is the lack of a global politics overview if you want to know who is at war with whom you must speak to each leader in turn and look at their current relationships complaints aside however i have to say that this game is looks stunning it is rich in detail and vivid in colour and the wonder animations are an absolute delight the sound design is fantastic and music is memorable and quite beautiful the new district system is absolute genius making the process of building and laying out a city a substantially more interesting and nuanced process compared to civ v it s a terrible shame that the ai is just such garbage it ruins the game i used to play comp stomps with my friends on a fairly regular basis but doing so in civ vi would be a waste of time edit some people have suggested that i play the game on harder difficulties but my understanding is that higher difficulty levels simply add a multiplier to the ai s output e g they get a 2x production multiplier so that they can always outproduce you and does not affect their behaviour since my biggest problem with the game is its broken ai playing on harder difficulties simply gives them an advantage but does not make them smarter additionally i think it s valid to compare the game to civ v i played civ v from its initial vanilla release and i realise that i m referencing personal memories from 6 years ago do not recall being as disappointed with the ai after making the jump from the mature game of civ iv to the then new game of civ v therefore i stand by my statement that civ v is a better game it is not more content that i desire but a challenging intelligent ai edit 2 while i was not impressed with the game at launch it has improved considerably
