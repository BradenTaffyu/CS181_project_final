early access review dev needs to pull their head out of their ass and finish this its been left in the dust for almost a year now lacks content and has no finish in sight this game by itself is alright always a good time rebuilding that stupid 4 cylinder engine over and over again if it werent for the massive array of mods i probably wouldnt bother to want to keep playing after i beat the game though as once you beat the rally thats pretty much all there is to do despite its fun it still is a buggy ahh mess parts fall through the map the car catches on stuff in the road that isnt there and kills you physics are garbage to the point where you will get thrown into the clouds for trying to push your van out of a ditch jail time is a looooong wait for literally no reason pitch black at night with no way to see etc if its on sale id cop it not for full price its not even finished yet and it both shows and feels like it
