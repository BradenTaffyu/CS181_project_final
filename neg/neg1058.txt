2016 the shooting is better but the rpg parts a lot worse bethesda games have been great make your own story simluators you had a lot of freedom how to respond to npc what to say and what to do the freedom the biggest best feature of skyrim and earlier fallouts to play whoever you want to be is simply gone in favour of a meek fixed choice system and you are preloaded with a defined character it i am very sad that this time i am not playing my charcter but the one bethesda thought would be a good one it is a now an open world shooter with better but still not great shooting mechanics and what feels gutted character building mechanics is it still a fun game hard to say i spent as much time with this as i have trying to get to the point when it gets better it just never got there if you are expecting the same kind of roleplaying possibillities as the older games you wont find them here if you want a middling shooter in the fallout world this is for you
