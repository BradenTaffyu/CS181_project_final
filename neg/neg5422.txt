2023 i want to love this game i have many many thousands of hours in coh2 and enjoyed coh 1 before that this game does have some improvements over the previous titles but they are massively overshadowed by the issues especially poor ui missing features and bugs however there are some serious issues i ll list a few of the worst issues and then a few of the things that are actually good after that ui issue the notifications thing is entirely pointless annoying pops up over stuff you are looking at provides no vale and is ugly everyone i have spoken to hates it and thinks it should be deleted ui issue you can t tell who is who you can no longer see their name when selecting their units or buildings ui issue the unique player colours have been made worse than coh 2 lets say you play 3 games in a row games 1 and 2 you might be orange game 3 orange is the player next to you instead so you keep clicking on the wrong units player colour should be consistent ui bug when you set unit iconts to top right they show in the bottom left still in multiplayer really annoying ui issue when changing key bindings the grid is very confusing only a coh1 2 player would figure it out even then it is not obvious and worst of all there is no ui to tell you what those buttons might do they should give hints like this box is for retreat this box for reinforce etc ui issue hovering over things does not bring up tool tips they are missing from both menus and in match options this is a serious downgrade from the previous games faction design issue the british faction is regrettably horrible it feels confused for example it has abilities from the germans in coh 2 like rifle and bundle grenades plays slow right of the bat but doesn t have strong or specialised early game units to make up for it the devs say they wanted to make the faction feel more aggressive but managed to encourage a more defensive play style instead by making it slow and giving mg s and mortars while making mobile units kinda rubbish except the grenades the army lacks good anti tank the tanks are all outclassed the 17 pounder comes too late and is far too easily countered with a little arty the 6 pounder is too weak the tanks all have 2 pounders and come too late the boys rifles are ok but cause you to drop a lot of anti infantry capability for some very meagre at even the at nades don t snare like they used to so you can t punish dives crash issue they still haven t fixed the bugsplat from coh2 crashes can and will happen especially if you alt tab even if you just alt tab in the menu screen for a minute or 2 breaching is boring and pointless it is poorly implemented and doesn t do anything a grenade or flamethrower or mortar or tank shell couldn t do the lobby host controlling your screen is horrible you can t look at post game stats and things and it just feels bad plus it is a huge downgrade from coh2 where you were in control of your own damn screen and you could even re open the previous games stats after leaving the lobby you no longer have access to see players build orders in post game summary or anything like that there is no replay feature at launch the game feels less than half finished it is like player a very early beta build which explains why the public alpha tests were so close to launch to be honest a lot of work needs doing before this game can be recommended path finding is still terrible it does not seem improved though i will say that having most things on the map even trenches be drivable means vehicles get caught on less stuff i could go on for hours but you get the point and those are some solid example of issues this game has before you even consider gameplay here are a few of the things done well towing is a nice feature could work better but its very nice to have and was heavily requested in the previous game its nice that the lobby host chooses if the lobby is allies or axis and it force switched everyone the concept for the campaign is an improvement its not worth buying the game if you are nly interested in singleplayer but at least the singleplayer has been improved compared to coh1 and coh2 the voice lines are great as always building destruction is better looking and has a greater effect on gameplay maybe i will add more to this review as i play more but you get the idea the game has lots more new issues than improvements it clearly is not finished feels like a beta build at least 8 12 months before it would be finished enough to release coh fans like me will buy it anyway and play this piece of rubbish just because we have been playing coh2 for 10 years already and want something newer but you should not buy this game by the time the game is actually finished being developed and most issues have been fixed they will give the game away for free just like they did with the last game don t pay to be a beta tester
