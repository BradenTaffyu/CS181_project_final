i really liked cs1 spent over 800 hours on it and spent an assload on dlc but i always felt the vanilla game had some limitations and while modding helped it required a lot of time and effort to make things look good so does cs2 solve these issues some of them yes but they managed to screw up a bunch of other things the goodthe new road tools are the best thing the new game does and allow for the same level of road building as modded cs1 but with far less effort and time the new buildings look much nicer and are far more consistent than cs1 s vanilla ones the mehperformance is playable but i had to lower the graphics settings ryzen 3600 rtx 2070 there s also a lot of attention to detail things that are missing that cs1 had but i cba to list at the moment the badthe simulation isn t just inadequate it s a downgrade from cs1 s i could list all the bugs and issues people have had but other reviews have already covered that so i ll sum it up as simulation feels utterly disconnected to what you re building which is even more annoying when you consider that cs1 was actually okay in this regard the solution to traffic jams in cs1 was to use the pathfinder tool to find where cims were going and where the bottlenecks were they removed it in cs2 and have flat out said they won t re add it i suspect the reason for this is because if they did it would reveal how broken the simulation actually is although the road builder is great there is no smooth slope tool like the fine road anarchy mod had this is a minor complaint and could easily be fixed with an update another issue is the way buildings affect terrain a crematorium just flattens the land having visited an irl crematorium i can assure you this is definitely not how they work the grid system also hasn t been improved since cs1 so we can t have nice connected eu buildings then there s mod support for some reason paradox is ditching the steam workshop for their own service which could have questionable longevity and support mod support was coming shortly after release forum paradoxplaza com there still isn t official mod support after 3 months but the beta will be starting soon closing thoughtsdo i regret buying this game no i got plenty of time out of it and i really enjoyed playing with the road tools plus i got it from a dodgy key reseller so i didn t pay full price if i did pay full price i d be pretty pissed i also think that if you are a hardcore cs1 player you will probably find some fun in this honestly i have little faith for the future of this game paradox seem to be more interested in saying it is what it is than sorting out all the bugs and design issues making cs2 a glorified city painter something that modded cs1 was already really good at if you could be bothered to invest the time maybe i m wrong maybe they will fix the simulation or more likely a modder will in which case this would make a good base for an amazing city builder the greed and rushed development may have got paradox a quick profit but it has resulted in a base game with fundamental flaws that cannot be patched out and while they may have the money of suckers like me now we are less likely to stick around and buy the dlcs which are the real cash cow as gaben said late is just for a little while suck is forever should you buy this game right now at full price god no wait for a sale 50 would be justified for a city builder enthusiast 80 for anyone else
