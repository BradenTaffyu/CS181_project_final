2018 my background i grew up playing total war i m 28 years old but i ve been gaming on pc since 4 5th grade will never forget the first day i played shogun total war for hours and days then i begged my parents to buy medieval total war and it was one of the best games of it s time since i have played every total war to date back then ca wasn t the company it is now they actually valued historically accuracy took the time to create videos for assasinations events and go really deep into the historical context of each battle scenario campaign see i wasn t just playing a game i was learning history too and this made it even more worthwhile to me as i eventually went to college and graduated with 2 ba s and a minor political science philosophy and history ca today and then now looking at ca today and the quality of games they put out it hurts it really does does power and money corrupt absolutely the ca of today is not the ca of the past and it shows in the quality of its games after medieval 2 total war and shogun it is hard to say any game besides the fantasy franchise if that s your thing not mine has been a success rome 2 on release was unplayable for some and a buggy unrealistic mess for the rest legions fighting like barbarians no formations cavalry charges felt like still do rubber hitting a wall gaphical errors to boot zombie faces etc i went back to playing medieval 2 total war and compared a cavalry charge there is no comparison in medieval 2 tw cavalry runs through infantry it feels like a hammer piercing wood you feel the impact as one should there lies the problem both games use differen engines in the older total war games before shogun 2 killing animations dint exist in medieval 2 character models turned red to signal low hp and just died this is a good thing because cavalry charges ran through inf they dint stop to conduct animations engine the engine for rome 2 is the same as shogun further research shows that the shogun engine was not meant for cavalry charges as the collisions create that rubber band feel you see in rome 2 cavalry stop charge to animate but for 1v1 batles animations and long range combat fall of samurai in shogun 2 infantry cavalry stop their charges and engage in hand to hand battle which is historically accurate for inf but not the horses in rome 2 this is bad since legions did not fight 1v1 and barbarians din t either in fact they swarmed the mongols were especially known to not fight fair they were literally a horde of horse archers and infantry that slashed from all sides and angles there was no bushido no 1v1 just war cavalry cavalry in rome is terrible the impact is not really there and it just feels like a huge step backwards it feels like water hitting a wall the cavalry does does not run through infantry they cant even break the first line of swordsman because they have to engage in animation like samurais compare this to mtw 2 where cavalry are walking sledgehammers if not properly countered as they should be i mean they changed the face of warfare for centuries infantry now for the infantry fighting the infantry fighting is attrocious in comparison with games of the past armored legionares take a very long time to force much weaker barbarian units to retreat so much so they can easily be encircled and overwhelmed by much weaker tribe units due to the poor combat animations they force the legions to attack in this samurai 1v1 fashion while appearing to be in formation it is counter productive for a very long time formation attack was broken it required mods to fix by this time most of the playerbase abandoned this game it took them a long time to implement formation attack and then actually make it somewhat work in my opinion it still doesn t other than for aesthetics but anyway formation attack actually made your units engage in combat for longer period of times as the dmg output was not enough to compensate for the formation and dint have the impact it should have legions tearing through poor formations of tribesman not nobles the problem still lingers and it becomes confusing if one should even bother to attack in formation don t even know why the option exist or not to i find that attacking without formation forces the enemy to retreat faster but it just feels wrong and not exciting at all they never managed to fix legion combat which is actually the staple of this game and if your willing to wach minutes of battle to see armoured legionares struggle to fight back noob tribesman because they have to animate kill model per model then have fun it s a bore naval the naval combat is not even worth mentioning is there its only there to help your troops move its not bad its not great but nobody buys this game for the ships they buy it for the elephants legions etc ai the artificial intelligence of the game is one of the worst in the series i cannot understand why this is so five years later enemy generals still charge spears head on agents agents are there they work as intended but they took out what made them fun in shogun and medieval 2 the videos i enjoyed watching videos of their assasination attemps failures and missed opportunities i loved watching samurai assasins geishas and sabotage attempts medieval assasins or spies killing priest merchants generals even the pope it was that attention to detail that made the game great they took that out too i don t see them ever bringing it back no clue why graphics the graphics are good great but this matters little when the core gameplay remains broken and boring politics and social agenda untop of all the core engine problems the devs seem to have a political agenda they thought it was good idea to add female generals while you won t ecounter them as rome there have been screenshots and proof of people encountering full rosters of female generals on the egyptian side there is no historical basis for this cleopatra is the only female pharaoh i can remember to date that is notable in the time the game takes place and she was by no means a general she was a queen that had generals lead battles for her but why they decided to just add female generals that to my knowledge have never been in recorded history in that era for any faction baffles me at least they should of just added cleopatra and left it at that allow her to lead rule but nobody else i doubt she would let any woman upstart her calling politics of that time cut throat is a huge understatement i find it refreshing that it was in fact a female gamer who had issue with this not a male gamer because to her rightly so it is washing history and just spreading lies doubling down the oppression and sexist roles woman had to overcome historically to get to today changing history doesnt benefit anyone it only actually hurts women because it implies they had rights back then they dint the attitude of the company is dispicable nowadays they took the extremity of saying their games are actually not historically accurate and if you don t like it don t buy it so i din t buy any of their dlc s since conclusion i cannot recommend this game it is not a good strategy game anymore it is quiet easy there is no historical accuracy the world map feels dead and bland no direction no cinematics other than triumph which is done for every character from agents to generals which devalues the whole thing into nothingness a triumph was a big deal in which romans like caesar used to claim power in the game is just like a pat in the back cool after all the layed out problems it is hard to find a positive when you can easily install the older tw games and feel miles of difference in fun gameplay details and historical accuracy i hope this review touched the hearts and minds of those like me roma invicta until ca conquered it with its agenda
