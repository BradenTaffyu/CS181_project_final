2023 edit for more clarity and info i started in 2013 played on and off for a number of years and then picked it up again in 2023 i like this game sometimes and i also hate this game the worst part is the disappointment in what the game could be but gaijin is a bit too greedy and a bit too incompetent to make it so grind and mode map design are just abhorrent they do occasionally make improvements apart from just adding vehicles to buy for real money but more often than not they are only making changes that directly give them money i don t have enough experience or skill to truly say things like russian bias but at the very least their balancing can only be described as incompetent aside from the fact that it takes months to years to make necessary balance changes every change will inevitably cause more to an equal amount of problems than it solved overall i do really enjoy this game most of the time it is fairly necessary to buy a premium account which is fair as they do need to make money and on the 50 off sales it s pretty well priced the thing that isn t fair is that even with a premium account and premium vehicles the grind is disgustingly long if the grind was 1 10 of what it is now i still would probably only have 1 nation completed with air and ground around 350 true hours you also have to grind the components for every vehicle you unlock which at high tiers is just horrible essentially they try and frustrate even their paying members into just spending more and more money at every turn don t bother getting into this game but if you do i find this list helpful 1 focus on your current tanks and don t focus on a goal and the grind 2 play with friends 3 there are tons of bugs and server side problems and so try to just laugh when your shot goes right through an enemy rather than breaking your screen old review still applicable gaijin doesn t respect their players and has predatory business practices they won t fix maps bugs and issues that have existed for years or dedicate resources to making their game what it could be
