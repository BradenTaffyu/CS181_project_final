2020 early access review to be fair it is a fun game the problem is since it is in an eternal alpha cycle it will never get polished enough nor optimized enough to actually feel like a finished game it s fine to keep on wanting to improve something you have created but at some point you just got to lean back and say to yourself yeah i think i m satisfied with the finish of this now lets put some paint on this sucker and call it a day eternal development just means there will never be good reason for someone to question the standards of your product cause it s alpha i am questioning this method of development addendum not only is this game now released it is now no longer playable if you as me don t want epic online services sniffing your data at all and have them blocked in any way if i could refund this game i would but i will do the next best thing and never ever touch anything from the so called fun pimps again may their company turn to dust
