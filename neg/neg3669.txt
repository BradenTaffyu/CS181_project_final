2018 early access review i backed this game way before it was on steam it s come a hell of a long way and it s great fun it unfortunately feels like abandonware with the speed the devs work lol at i hate to compare it to a game of a completely different genre but my summer car is also a game built on unity by pretty much a single guy and receives meaningful updates regularly 7dtd has a multiple person team behind it and can t put out 2 updates a year barely even 1 a year tbh they ve also taken the road of gating content behind skill points and a grind to draw it out rather than enhancing or expanding on what we have already every new feature always feels like another half assed good idea that remains unfinished they also seem to want to keep adding things people never ask for rather than enhancing the core of the game do we really need jeeps and gyrocopters when we have the most barebones combat in the world would it really be so hard to add a power attack and or block to the melee system tl dr fun game plagued by the laziest slowest devs i ve ever seen and when they do work on the game they implement half finished features and bloat the game rather than improving the core
