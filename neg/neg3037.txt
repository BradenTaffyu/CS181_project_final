2017 i bought this game during the steam summer sale for giggles since it was relatively inexpensive and i heard good things about the physics engine all of that hype was for nothing at all just a little background about myself i autocross autoslalom in other parts of the world and have driven different cars from near stock fwd with all seasons to race grade suspension on r compound tires hoosiers i have driven every generation of miata from modified nas to a stock nd so in general i have a good idea as to how a car drives both under and over the limit of grip let s start with the suspension model first drive the nd in a single make race and watch the ai handle the car note the body roll or lack thereof watch any video on the interweb of jounalists driving the nd note the body roll edit quick comparo between ac and reality noted above i ve driven an nd factory fresh less than 1000 miles assetto corsa does a very poor job of capturing how the car behaves the body roll in the nd is controlled but it is significant pitch and roll of that car are very large what ac does get right is the steering response which is controlled despite the body roll another car i ve driven is the scion frs subaru brz the scion frs toyota 86 in ac barely rolls at all both the nd and the 86 should be able to neutralize minor understeer with the throttle but in assetto corsa the car either pushes wide or requires substantial counter steer to control the resulting oversteer not quite what it should be i accidently got the nd to oversteer and had the tc kick in and i ve also gotten a brz very sideways tc was off for this one when you get it right all that is required to control exit oversteer is to be progressive with the throttle and unwind the steering wheel to straight i could not get ac to do that for me no matter how i changed my inputs a car i haven t driven but has a reputation of being loose is any porsche 911 in this case take the ruf ctr yellowbird this car should immediately go backwards if you think of lifting in a turn in ac i never felt i could get it that out of sorts the load sensitivity of the tire model is very poor it is very hard to neutralize understeer by trailbraking or controlled power on oversteer in rwd cars don t get me wrong it s still possible to spin out a rwd car but if you drive a low power rwd car the car should rotate very readily when you get on the power at the apex the lack of load sensitivity makes fwd cars understeer horribly even with extreme setups finally the abs braking believe it or not abs in modern cars is so good it is hard to beat in some cases in ac the braking feels especially poor the fronts lock up almost instantly the car stops poorly sometimes inconsistently i believe the real problem is the lack of load transfer or poor load sensitivity see above but it manifests itself in unrealistic braking performance now for the good exceptional graphics though the menus are not scaled correctly for a 4k monitor and the sounds are pretty darn excellent engine and tires have a lot of fidelity especially the tires all in all i would not recommend this game to people who take their car sims seriously i would not recommend this to people who take driving seriously i would not recommend this to someone who wants to experience what it s like to drive their dream car since this sim doesn t correctly capture that experience
