2016 this game starts off awesome and then drags really bad after about 15 hours i am having trouble getting motivated to even start playing my save again it has gotten so boring and the time it takes to restart just to see if it will all happen again will be just as boring this game is missing a lot of content that should be in base game some form of trade better ai more events diplomacy is a joke etc i dont hate the game but if you want a full experience it is not here the start of the game is done and that is it it takes a long time to play because nothing happens unless you want to just go around and kill everybody and combat is lackluster so that will get stale quick too you will easily spend tens of hours just moving science and construction ships around the map in a normal game waiting on something to happen i personally wish i had not fell for the hype and waited as long as the devs fix up the base game to be a complete experience without selling us the missing parts in dlc i will probably change this review in future
