2017 don t worry devastation is a free mechanic prosperity isn t though better pay up this pretty much summs it up the nerfs are free but the buffs you gotta pay for if you don t intend to at least buy the major dlcs don t bother buying any with the base game you can still play multiplayer with people who have dlc which makes that somewhat worthwhile but that still severely gimps the game though you can play on old versions from before they balanced things around w e new dlc they are selling that is obviously not the intended way to do it it even blocks achievements
