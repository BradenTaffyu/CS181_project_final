2019 i already own the game and all of its contents so there is no loss for me based on those greedy pricing policies yet i am not any less disgusted by that the game itself is solid with all its content the only big negative i can name is the siegebattles which don t deserve the name while i can support the game i cannot and will not support this company anymore if you want to buy buy it from a keyseller where you pay what it is worth not what the corporate greed demands from you
