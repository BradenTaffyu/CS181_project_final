2022 i really love this game but if i have to be honest is really annoying that there are just a few familys to sell the houses that you bought even when all the dlcs when you buy a house it s always the same i sell a house to every family person in the game and i don t have any new to do there are no mods to incorporate people to the game so in a certain point you don t have anything else the last 50 hours of game i have played selling the houses to the same people over and over the requirements never change for each family person so it s really borring i have another 40 houses to buy and to do what sell them to the same familys over and over there are just 10 buyers for that houses i have sold 26 houses with the same requirements a lot of times and now i don t have anything new to do there are a dlc that includes 3 buyers but them just want to buy bunkers so after that you can t sell them anything else i hope that the devs realise this and do something about it because the game apart from that is beautiful
