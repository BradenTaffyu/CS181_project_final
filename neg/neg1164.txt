2018 in vanilla this game isn t a joy to play not after the first 4 to 8 hours skinned simplified fallout with the best features aka rpg elements removed almost completely only modding the game it will get better but it s a lot of work to do my opinion buy fallout new vegas not this one edit years later after the definitive update bethesda released my opinion stands they also threw in random crashes with it while also breaking every mod for the game forcing the community to make a patcher that actually downgrades the game to its earlier version only thing better now is that the dlc is super cheap making the game as whole better
