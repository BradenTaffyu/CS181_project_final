2022 do not get this game i cannot stress this enough or at least if you do get it don t subscribe or buy anything when i subscribed it took weeks for it to take effect and for the trouble they gave me some cartel coins real money currency i used these coins to buy a combat companion named treek once i got into a fight i realized treek isn t doing any damage despite her abilities listing damage she just goes into a fight and does nothing and dies this is a known bug so i submitted a ticket wanting a refund and their customer service rep was unbelievably rude and condescending they told me treek is working as intended and then sent me this quote winning and losing doesnt matter because for some people losing is winning and winning is losing i you not they just gaslit me and said the problem doesn t exsist sent me a quote then instantly closed the ticket when i sent a follow up ticket asking to have someone look at the problem more closely they sent me the exact same person and they just closed the ticket again and flagged me as a spammer they have no phone customer service and you can t even submit tickets online only through the in game system so they can easily just blow you off these people are con artists and don t even slightly care do not give these crooks your money
