2016 interesting turn based strategy game mainly ruined by a poor guipros nice graphics district system is interesting two distinct tech trees are interesting science culture cons expansion penality which increases construction costs for buildings feels even more strange than the expansion penalities in civ5 ai uses worse strategy tactics than in civ5 during wars the ai often just walks to your cities without attacking anything and just waits within the range of the defending archers there is no feeling that your civilization is taking off the production research income only increase slightly during the course of the game the fog of war displays the areas as if they were drawn by pencil which in return harms the overview really really bad gui which is why i make a own section for thisthe gui the tech trees provide almost no overview and info i mean just look at this can only see the technologies of a single era without scrolling moreover some passive bonuses are not directly displayed in the tech tree and are only shown via mouse over the cultural tech tree is even worse since there are only four different icons for policies you have to wait for the leader animations to accept refuse an ai initiated deal pressing escape aborts the whole diplomacy the gui provides almost no info about the adjacency bonus which you gain by building an improvement or an district the city screen is cluttered e g the main city screen only shows food income food surplus is hidden in a sub screen you have to select the city before you can see the maximum populace for the city warnings only pop up if cities are overpopulated and not if fully populated some sub windows building selection carawan destination are drawn ontop of other windows in a weird way the scrolling via moving the mouse to the screen edges does not work well the icons and text are often very large presumably because they are optimized for touch or controller input giving you the feel of a console port you cannot bypass automatic unit rotation by quickly selecting another unit after the first unit has finished moving you cannot even disable the automatic rotation directly via the options menue however you can disable it by editing the ini file addition requested by lif
