2021 the game is fun in fact the most fun i have had in an online only game but i can t say it s a good idea to buy it at least right now theres big glitches that make you stuck and sometimes have to alt f4 and the game still has performance problems even on low graphics settings the quests are mostly if not all fetch quests and the ai pulls some hilariously obvious cheaty moves on you like aimbot stupidly good eyesight an shooting a bullet from their spine and the best part the devs dont care about the game in the slightest there s a glitch that is super common glitch that makes your character stuck when they try to do any sort of crafting this glitch commonly forces you to force close the game which is just fuuuuun edit the game has had about a week to fix a lot of the problems i mentioned but nope the servers are still hot garbage even though the servers went down for maintenance like 2 days ago the crafting bug is still present so you will still get stuck and have to waste caps fast traveling or alt f4ing out of the game another thing i found a lot of fun legendary combos like explosive flamer and explosive gatling plasmas are legacy items meaning if you didn t play before they made them impossible to get you simply wont have it unless a modder or duplicater gives one to you you buy one from a sus website or you get lucky with a discord trading server this is insane how a lot of glitches are still present along all this is a literal dollar tree server system that lags constantly literally every server i have been in after steel reign has severe lag problems making playing more of a chore then making fallout 3 work on pc edit they finally fixed the crafting bug and now you no longer get stuck on crafting took em long enough edit there is still the problem with legacies and now they are adding more and more actually good things to the seasons means new players wont have these things cmon a shop where you can put the seasonal items would still put the benefit of people who got it not having to buy it and the people who have to buy it would have to pay atoms from how expensive you would over price it i know i have to talk about money when talking about reviewing bethesda because it s all they care about the legendarys are still overpowered like a suit of power armor that has all reduced damage from humans and reduced damage while sitting still can make it actually impossible to kill someone the weapons are on the other side where the legacies are still overpowered and normal ones don t do as much damage i still say i don t recommend edit the pitt this season sucks it s a glitchfest right off the bat so i load in to see that one of if not the best looking place on the map has been ruined by the forgotten group known as the responders and the raiders so anyways you do annoying things for them and then you get the privilege of going to the pitt and doing things for as i speak one of two people both suck and are linear boring time wasters so i was doing the one for hex with a team and the entire thing like i said was boring near the end i have buildings in the distance pop out of reality and the game glitch they were supposed to be ambushed by trogs a returning enemy from fallout 3 s dlc the pitt anyways in this game they are simply feral ghouls that run like wendigos however these trogs never spawned and i tried to leave i became invisible instead and the only way to leave without the host doing so was to seemingly leave the server i exploded myself and became visible again the mission is still bugged and the host had to leave and come back it finally fixed itself the objective anyways and we killed all the trogs without anyone dying and doing all the side objectives too we leave and go to the vertibird i got 3 one stars a two star and 2 3 stars none of them were good as expected and i got 8 stamps the host got 10 i dunno if it was from fallout 1st or what but he still got 10 to my 8 i check the daily challenges and apparently it didn t count since i wasn t the one who started the expedition and it s 500 toward the season too i have to do a total of about a half hour of work to get 500 to get to do another daily ops but with even more glitchiness and steps and the season is introducing plans for new power armor and a weapon the auto axe also i have seen modded weapons that hog everyones legendaries still since bethesda can t be bothered to do anything but make more grindy bugfests of seasons and re release skyrim for the millionth time don t get this game still it was awful then and it has actually gotten worse with time if you are gonna be new playing this game just don t bother get elder scrolls online or some other game i dunno literally any other one than this
