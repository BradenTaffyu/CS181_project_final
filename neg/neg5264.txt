2016 i ve played every total war game to date and total war warhamemer is an unbalanced mishmash of total war mechanics and the like the stuff they added like the enhanced equipment and character stuff hardly makes the stuff taken out and stuff good like they took out most unit abilities spearmen can t even form walls for example no naval battles no city battles without a certain upgrade if i remember right so few units like for sake there s 6 playable factions some might say quality over quantity but they aren t that great either like for example there is quite a bit of imbalance here take this for example chaos the faction you have to pay for if you didn t preorder that is pretty much sucks for mp single player isn t much better do not get me started on ai in this game do not i already had to deal with ai having perfect skirmishing ability in previous games which is a thing here but even in campaign aspects they just suck they re so defensive they must get tons of cash because they constantly build 20 stacks only when they have overwhelming numbers do they decide to chase you down and they can amass armies quick too just annoying and continuing on they proceeded to sell out the units i wanted in the game i spent full price for you know i d be fine with spending a little here and a little there sometimes i love eu4 because they ve stretched the game out over years with dlc and even made the game better for people who just bought it by itself with major updates here it s just like you 20 for another faction and another half done campaign like as far as i am to understand this isn t a lot of the warhammer world anyway so they re gonna keep selling off bits and pieces including the map i hear at least rome 2 had the decency to give you all of europe excluding scandinavia a bit of north africa and arabia to play with just so much is missing and wrong i dunno how to continue if you like it you like it and that s fine but that doesn t make it good but if you think this is good please do tell me how edit made double worse since the dlc rarely goes on sale by the looks of it it s not even up for sale on halloween 2018 unless flash sales or whatever happen like rumored
