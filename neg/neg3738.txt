2022 early access review so i really loved this game however not sure i will play anymore because everytime i make any levels bases or game progress my game is deleted by another update this last update is the 5th time i have lost everything in gameplay and it has ruined the game for me i am on the fence on this one because i love the game but am done losing everything i worked for over and over if the game is ever actually finished and done being messed with i may reconsider but at this time i am rather done losing my stuff and having my game ruined it gets old and wrecks the game for me
