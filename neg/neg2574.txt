2017 a game that can be enjoyed at times but the majority feels like its too easy or just not finished with some major issues with scopes and animal ai that really drag this title into the mud stand hunting seems to be nerfed due to zones becoming less active when you kill an animal or something feed rest zones are too easy the ai is only barely challenging when hunting the hardest difficulty trophy but feels like this should be the base difficulty almost the rest is trash ai that ignores gunshots 100m away and their friends dying in a bloody mess at their feet this game has promise but suffers as it seems clear the devs are focused on making money from dlc s rather than fix glaringly obvious issues seems to be a lack of quality control the complete lack of an online competition system also leaves a massive gap in what thehunter classic provided pros pretty graphics almost everything can buy with in game money large reserves nice sounds vastly increased animal draw distance and firing range although the ai is dumb and just ignores when their herd members just drop dead larger herds and groupscons terribly glitchy and incomplete binocular and scope controls red dot sight moves at about 0 00001 degree per second very bad ai nowhere near as fun or challenging as hunter classic dont expect too much challenge some parts of the map are completely empty of animals stupid amounts of cash farming unrewarding animal scoring antlers all look similar no competitions thehunter classic had dozens feels like an arcade game animals ignore you hardly spook and ignore gunshots map is glitchy cashgrab dlc s of game changing content feels like it should be part of main game not enough variety of weapons will probably be sold to us as dlc you get birdshot and small game weapons but you cannot score from birds vermin or bunnies and they are just a non event in the game 5 10
