2017 my opinions are mixed on this game the is just like any other bethesda game that uses this engine in that modding the game is at some point essential to get the best experience fallout new vegas had very little development time but most of its bugs were due to the game engine they used and a lack of time to develop the game despite that new vegas had a wonderful atmosphere and story with memorable characters fallout 4 had plenty of development time but the writing is just garbage the game also has its fair share of bugs and is not that optimized despite all of this the game is a great time waster it s easy to get lost in the world and explore i would not categorize this as a fallout experience due to the story being comparable to a toothpick but it is a somewhat good survival basebuilding game once you install over 30 mods to duct tape fix the game if you don t mind spending an hour or two setting up mods i d recommend the midnight ride modding guide for getting started modding this game otherwise i d stay clear of this game if installing a normal program confuses you
