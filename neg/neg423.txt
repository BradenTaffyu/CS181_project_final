2023 summery avoid this game unless you are willing to risk your entire account with their questionable cheat detection attics and their unprofessional customer support internet historian s description of their anti cheat team being using a shotgun with a blindfold is not an exaggeration edit bethesda support is now resorting to changing the the status of my support tickets to reply given without actually giving a reply meaning i did not receive any email notification had i not check the support page directly within the past four days my ticket would have been lapsed this is definitely helping with the professional professional image that their support have been giving me so far update 2 another few more rounds of daily through reviews later buh thesda closed my ticket again and replied with a now please note that we only ban an account not a player that is to say you are still free to play our game but this account will not be eligible to return you can create a new account and play on that one but it will be subject to all the same rules and regulations this one is excuse me you wrongly banned me from my purchased product and i even partake in your micro transactions and you you are suggesting me to buy your product again to continue playing that s condescending to make it mildly original review below played multitude of multiplayer games and mmos even eso another zenimax game without issues but only played fo76 for a bit when their questionable anti cheat decided to flag me for a permanent ban on third party software no where related to fallout 76 and does not interact with the game at all and every time i file an appeal on their support they will reply with a standard template reply of through investigation done ban still in place within the same day failed to assure me that their support has actually done anything all they had to do is to look into my game or their session records or something to see that they are banning me for no reason instead i ve been receiving nothing but slight variations of the same automated reply every time i contacted support for the past week as of this review note that this ban is applied to the entire bethesda account meaning that by trying this game i have now been wrongfully locked out of any bethesda online content even eso it is absolutely ridiculous i will continue to pursue this matter with bethesda support i ll be honest the game itself is fine in fact i found it decently fun enough that i decided to drop some cash for atoms extremely unfortunate timing i would have saved 25 sgd had i just wait another day for their random ban but unless you want to risk all your zenimax bethesda related games consider a hard pass on fallout 76 to avoid their questionable anti cheat and unprofessional support system i will continue challenging this wrongful ban but i will keep this negative review up as a warning to anyone interested in fo76 be very aware you are risking your account playing this game
