2020 early access review huge potential but atm the game is barely working gameplay wise they haven t delivered on any of their big promises yet be it dynasty system diplomacy or whatever and have only been pumping technical fixes for half a year now and doing dumb things like nerfing income such as workshops and whatnot while smithing hasn t been touched at all in all this time and allows you to easily make say two handers that sell for 150k each while cities have 3 4 times less gold in their inventory after just a few stamina bars spent on unlocking parts hell you don t even need all that fancy steel and such can make javelins out of wood and iron and still bankrupt cities with a bundle of those it s like an inbuilt money cheatcode still 95 of every patch is crashfixes and refactoring i only paid them so they could refactor their monkey code that should ve been in order in the first place or so it seems in general balance is all over the place such as prices some mediocre bodyarmor costs like half a hundred of decent horses or a thousand pieces of grain truly endgame armor costs several times more but you can ride the whole world and not find a single one those barely spawn with default values even after creating more smithies khuzaits have too big of an autoresolve and movement speed bonus and dominate the map troop trees are questionable to say the least half the factions have way worse troops than other ones there isn t even any they are meh but they are real good at that one area thing going on anymore like battanians are meant to be master archers but their only archers are noble troops and good luck getting those in any number or sturgians who are supposed to be the shocktroop kind of guys but aserai and arguably even empire have better heavy infantry half the factions have horse archers now though if that s your thing individual troop equipment and stats still need heavy adjustment and although there already were a couple of those they somehow only seem to make matters worse some mechanics from warband aren t here yet either kingdom management is extremely barebones underwhelming and just feels lazily tackled on recruiting is somehow even more obnoxious than previous instalments and lack of effective training skill means that losing a good army takes a looong while to recover from for the player whereas ai lords just as before summon huge leveled armies out of thin air ai lords are incredibly stupid too most of all at sieges so even the vassal phase is going to be painful especially after they nerfed all the influence gain so as a vassal you will only be able to lead an army once in a blue moon rest of the time being relegated to watching them trying to build a trebuchet for weeks which gets obliterated in seconds then disbanding the siege then doing it all over again the siege system is laughable in general but it s a fairly minor complaint in the face of big problems in the game tl dr for another year or so just play modded warband as of now the game seems great when you are starting out but once you get to the endgame and start to uncover it s inner workings it all just falls apart and burns gameplay loop is way less thought out than warband s and in a game such as this it s all that matters in the end i hope they will deliver on all they promised meanwhile if not modders will do the bulk of the work once again i hope
