at its current state no i wouldn t recommend it the game is full of bugs bad performance and the biggest part of its problem is the lack of content it becomes boring very fast i was happy when it was released and could start seriously a real city without interruption and progress through the game slowly but surely i burnt out quickly the game is boring the game ceo is on us and trolling us like we didn t pay for this game if you don t like the game this isn t for you this is a major middle finger towards the community what responsible answer is that are we 5 fix the damn game and listen to your community i am still hopeful tho
