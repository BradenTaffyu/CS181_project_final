2017 game was advertised with steam workshop support both before and after release now they have removed this tag from the store page entirely and staying totally silent on mod support probably to keep people buying dlc and as far as civ games go it s just very meh you d be better off buying the complete civ 5 2020 update still wouldn t recommend it crashes a lot tons of expensive dlc wait for support to end and a complete edition to be released
