2023 no offline mode and yet you have crappy servers that are unable to survive the load of thousands of players even after two betas it s been fun having to wait for 15 minutes to host an invite only session oh and nice job scamming ps5 players since the betas upd i was about to change the review to positive but clowns and not even the heisters at overkill starbreeze not only delated day 1 patch until two weeks after the release despite a lot of people refunding the game because of bugs and poor design choices but also sliced it in different parts that will come at different times and finally they delayed even the first one at the last possible moments actual clowns upd2 day 1 patch 1 5 months later cool upd3 3 months since release the game is still barebones but we already got our first paid i mean overpriced dlc with p2w weapons nice upd4 a whole year has passed since this game launched 90 of the new content is locked behind an overpriced dlcs the dlc weapons are overpowered and have virtually infinite ammo and most of the main problems of the game are still there 1 year later they ve announced an armor reword for the december that sounds good so we ll see if they can make this game to 1 0 by that time at least
