2022 early access review great concept loved the game as a beta but its most certainly not ready for release if the finished product is even 5 times as good as e1 8 0 than the game will still be considered an epic flop im sorry great beta does not mean great game this thing is still riddled with bugs inconsistencies bad ai un upgradeable buildings balance issues performance issues and an unfinished basic quest line doesnt help that the forum mods seem ban happy towards anyone bringing up issues about the game wont be surprised if this review gets hidden or deleted would i recommend this game well now that its claiming that its a finished product absolutely not would i recommend it as a promising beta yes without a doubt
