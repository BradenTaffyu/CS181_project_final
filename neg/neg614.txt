2019 i tried really hard to get into this game i tried really hard and i even did get into it for a little bit before i got to the final act but quite simply this game has problems the first major problem i have with this game is that keeping yourself leveled requires you to do pretty much every fight every encounter and every quest flat out there is no scaling and it forces you to go through almost every quest if you want to stay up to speed with all the enemies this is especially weird feeling in the second act where you re gaining source power and there s about 6 ways to increase it to a maximum cap of 3 after you get 3 it subtly suggests you re ready to go to the next act don t believe this this is a dirty lie and will end in your demise to all of the enemies several levels above you my second major problem with this game is the omniscient enemies your big secret is that you re supposed to be a sourcerer right while i understand you ve built a reputation standard npc s dont know you are then combat starts every enemy later in the game will use source vampirism as soon as they possibly can on your character taking away some of your most powerful and underpowered abilities in mere moments do to a lack of precious soul juice then they will use source skills on you very nice for being a supposedly rare and illegal breed of magic users and also really annoying thirdly the story itself the story is alright i enjoyed parts of it and some of the writing caught me off guard but i have never quite seen a world so depressing as divinity everyone is an that nice guy down the street running an orphanage he s secretly a demon worshipping pedophile kid goes off to get sugar kidnapped and eaten by voidwoken and you return the child s disembodied arm to the mother who sobs and then gives you a bunch of gold and a random armor piece jesus himself in the game who preaches forgiveness actually the worst and most hypocritical person ever and you should feel bad for liking him i have yet to see one uplifting part of this game but i probably wont because i m going to uninstall it and try to forget it ever existed my final problem is with act 4 if you get to act 4 you will either love it or hate it it seems and by god did i hate having my level 18 party members get constantly raped by random level 20 roaming the town and having to go back to my last save like 20 minutes ago right before some other equally annoying encounter act 4 s spike in difficulty for the unprepared is insane so you better get your gamebreaking stunlock builds ready because you ll need them to have any hope of winning against the omniscient enemies who will also stunlock your team into oblivion that s my review from probably the worst divinity player ever or something just be warned this game isn t for everyone
