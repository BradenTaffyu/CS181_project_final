2020 at this point the game is completely broken japan italy and germany just steamroll through everything even when choosing the historical options the soviet union gets annihilated within one year playing a nation allied to the axis is boring for that reason while playing against them is just frustrating it s also ridiculous that toppling mussolini s regime as italy basically ends the game for you since there isn t any tree option for that outcome somebody skipped classes about the resistance in italy the 1943 armistice and the civil war paradox should fix the in game balance rather than releasing overpriced dlcs this is a pity because everything else in the game is really great
