2017 an enjoyable game a while back but it s gone downhill since then by developers every single update has nerfed the domination and world conquest to the bone it s become almost impossible and very tedious to start a conquering spree with every new addition i play single player to enjoy the game and the history behind it but it s becoming bothersome to overcome the new mechanics of conquest because developers want to slow down your conquest don t even get me started on the dlcs i d pirate this game and all its expansions before i will pay another dime to their worthless dlc policies it s sad when ck2 and eu4 total package is 250 each sadly hoi4 is heading toward that road as well as stellaris too paradox is the swedish ea of america
