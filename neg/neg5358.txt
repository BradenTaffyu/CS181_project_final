2023 i rarely take the time to review a game good or bad i m simply going to say this relic charged full price for an incomplete alpha version of the game those of us who paid for it have been doing free testing for them now they announce a massive new update that finally finishes the game yet the new content is bundled into a new way to extract money out of their loyal fans 16 bucks for this come on it s not that i have a problem with the price or what you get it it s the fact that clearly those in charge are brain dead and completely tone deaf to their player base i can easily afford it i may end up caving in and paying the 16 i also may never spend another dollar on a relic game again shocking why don t you do the right thing and include the new content for free to those who have already purchased the game as a way to say sorry for the complete and utter trash you that you released to us at full price
