2022 until they fix my constant crashing i cannot recommend this game this was an issue they created months ago when they did a patch and its not just me go to reddit and you will find hundreds of players effected the same way and the devs have basically told all of us to get bent they refuse to help us before the trolls start i have done it all to fix this game i have spent over an hour online looking up a fix i have spent days with the devs going back and forth till i was told basically that i was s o l one day i logged on to a game that ran great for over 100 hours the next day it crashed constantly with no explanations now prior to the update that ruined everything this game was great i played over 100 hours before the stupid crashing every 5 minutes and had a lot of fun this was just what i needed to scratch that world domination itch without massive complexity i like to set the difficulty to a hard level fill it with city states and as many ai as i can get and just go all out war on everything sometimes i win sometime i lose but i enjoy this game very much and i will give it a positive review to reflect that as soon as the devs stop picking and eating the toilet paper cling ons from their a and do their job to fix a game they broke
