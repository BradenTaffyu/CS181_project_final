2022 early access review with each update the devs are forcing the game to be played a certain way taking great pains to patch any playstyle they deem an exploit additionally the devs and their forum representatives are highly defensive and confrontational about feedback be prepared to be harassed and belittled on forums if you plan to discuss this alpha product with the developers and feel free to peruse around for quotes and interviews with devs and community representatives who openly state they don t like finding out their players play the game in certain ways update with the changes revealed in alpha 21 this trend continues 1 the perk and leveling system has gotten a complete overhaul total game upheavals are unfortunately a common occurrence in this game while this came with a much needed balance shift away from perks in the strength tree the devs also decided to force players to have to loot and scavenge to improve the accessibility and quality of tools armor and weapons xp gained from your favorite building and harvesting activities can no longer be funneled into combat you have to go out and loot buildings or you won t be able to improve your gear unless you are playing multiplayer and have teammates bring back these magazines for you 2 water you will no longer be able to collect water from water sources such as lakes and rivers for the purposes of drinking it you know a common survival practice for the entirety of human existence in the past you would take a bunch of jars to the watering hole fill up on murky water bring it back to base and use it for a variety of purposes you know like what water is used for no more of that efficient collection of usable water is now subject to acquiring a water filter item and using it to build a dew collector which is supposed to give you 3 pure water items a day or you guessed it you can instead loot murky water from specific container types in the world 3 traders traders were where you could grab quests which led you to all manner of interesting buildings and pois on the map you may not have found fill up on treasure recipes and materials and get some good hard cash to spend in their shops to get items you normally couldn t get not anymore traders inventory is tied directly to your level which means that if you can t make or find it yourself they won t have it on top of this they will also have less general goods and instead have more items towards each one s theme some have more medical items some guns some armor etc original review about a year ago this game was amazing it had everything you could possibly want from a zombie basebuilder with tons of options to survive the night and the monstrous hordes every seven days it was one of my favorite games for a long time and the only reason i m not in the thousands of hours is because i didn t always have friends to play with and the glaring dev forced game direction i will detail below now as the devs have had more and more time to listen to ignore player feedback they have gone completely out of their way to patch out every single conceivable way to outsmart the horde it baffled me that a dev team that listens so intently to what their players are up to uses it exclusively to stop them from playing the game a certain way everything from moats underground bases death mazes and even building a freaking helicopter and just flying away have all been fixed so that you have to play the game the way the devs want you to play it getting creative and learning the game is a thing of the past below are a few examples of what i mean when i say the devs are getting in the way of their own game farming and being self reliant nerfed even completely maxing out the relevant perk tree leaves you with a barely serviceable farm it would seem the point of farming was to plant seeds you find while looting and get a little extra back once the devs sniffed out that players were actually living off of their produce it was nerfed sustainability is practically nonexistent after this change farming wasn t even that powerful a lot of high tier food in the game still requires materials you have to forage and scavenge for being able to grow your own food was just one less thing to worry about while you prepared for horde night death mazes patched zombie ai is equivalent to having a hive mind of architectural engineers working like a well oiled machine to take down the exact structural support needed to expose you to them i m not even exaggerating no matter how elaborate your base is the zombies are coded to find the fastest route to you no matter what and if they can t reach you will destroy the blocks required to get you into range hiding under 100 meters of solid stone and just laying low nope on horde night zombies have infinite detection radius and will dig with their superhuman claws all the way down there to meet you that is if you somehow manage to close up the hole behind you because they can sniff out even the most convoluted tunnel and hatch system you can possibly come up with without even slowing down building a helicopter truck or other vehicle and staying out of range no longer possible there are now flying vulture zombies that move faster than any vehicle available in the game not even aviation can save you from these things it s really frustrating to see once again a very particular playstyle being reinforced by the developers of this game they are hellbent on making sure we play the game their way and this game would be so much more popular if they just let the players play the game the way they want i ve complained about how hordes are handled and several people told me that i can just turn off the hordes if i hate them so much and now i do but that wasn t always the case years ago it was fun when it was my friends and i tried different methods of outsmarting the endless hordes to see who did the best now it s just us trying to figure out how to hold back this hive mind of architectural engineers with the one particular style of base defense while the devs release change after change making sure we only go about it one specific way the way the devs want you to play tl dr this game feels like playing zombie survivor in your living room with your 10 year old cousin no matter what creative and interesting strategy you come up with the little kid will just say nuh uh and make something up to beat you until you are playing exactly how he wants to play on top of all of this the devs themselves have been openly dismissive of both their players and any criticism that heads their way until the devs can ditch their childish reinforcement of their preferred game style endless stream of frustrating overhauls that turn the game on its head and general dismissal of any of their players offering constructive feedback on updates changes and overhauils this game is doomed to be less and less fun or you can just use their base code as a framework and mod it there are plenty of mod authors who actually listen to player feedback
