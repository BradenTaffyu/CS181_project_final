2015 wide as an ocean deep like a puddle is what describes this game this game is fun for awhile but after awhile it gets old really fast the missions have no depth and feels very linear and its always end up becoming a kill mission nobody wants to talk they shoot first although i had some fun for the first 20 hours i cannot recommend this game at a full price get it at a sale
