2017 possibly the worst fallout game to date but a very decent sandbox action rpg let me explain very briefly the franchise was known for its thoughtful and creative writing and dialogue that lead to multiple very differentiating consequences that left you with a sense of responsibility for what you d do or say everything had weight to it but not in this one where the game basically shoehorns you into being the hero of everything dialogue has been dumbed down to just four basic responses which would ultimately lead to the same thing either that or your only option to solve things is to literally shoot everything in sight the game lacks a bit of that personality and soul of the previous titles that not even prettier graphics on an already dying engine can make up for bethesda have begun to force tropes and things down your throat like a dog right off the bat because we like dogs right here s a dog that also can t die not because it has an important role down the storyline like a sacrifice or anything no no it s just because its ai is rather stupid so we don t want you to risk killing it almost immediately when you engage in an intense firefight on top of that the game paradoxically lacks even more personality despite the controversially voiced and fleshed in playable character he or she is no longer really yours or what you really want it to be because it s already done this for you about 90 of the time you only get to choose how they look and whether or not they shoot thing or spare thing but the action and adventure is there albeit in a shallow manner the gunplay is great there s some interesting designs music s great as always stealth is still bad but there s plenty of customization and there s a lot of things to be done with settlements but the modding community has never been tasked this greatly before to actually turn the game into something better than its initial release and that s my next biggest gripe they ve basically taken that freedom from our community and slapped price tags on it sure you can still use free mods but bethesda is now muscling in on the scene trying to take a slice of the pie dividing the community in the process sorry pete hines i know you re trying hard but mods that you pay for are still paid mods not only that the content is probably on par if not worse than what s already freely available and will sit on your drive like bloatware whether you want it or not so pros great open sandbox potential smooth gunplay and action looks good fun with settlementscons bad writing dumbed down choicemaking and dialogue uninspired and uninteresting quests forced divided modding community thanks to creation club undesired bloatware contentgonna have to give it a soft no i hope this is a lesson for bethesda in that the next fallout or even another tes game will live up to our expectations and beyond
