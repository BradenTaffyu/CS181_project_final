2018 pre ordered this game back when total war was my favourite game series and haven t bought another tw game since there s been years of honestly very good patches and middling to good dlc which have by now addressed most of the abysmal features present in vanilla such as civil wars general progression trees agents being more powerful than armies and government types but while these features are all less horrible still none of them even come close to the implementations that are present in rome 1 shogun 2 and attila respectively and i d recommend each of those in that order over this game even if they had been perfect the patches were usually only interesting in the dlc campaign they were bundled with and no effort has been made to integrate them into the base campaign last time i played athens in the base campaign with government types patch they were still a kingdom rather than a politeia what truly kills the experience however is the strategy in general it s come a long way since release but every aspect of your interaction with the game is fundamentally boring almost every battle over in 10 minutes so fighting them isn t particularly exciting and auto resolve always tells you your results in advance so auto resolving is just a click to win button the ai has never been able to strategise in battle and is even worse in the campaign where they just get massive food public order bonuses to stop them losing imediately so agent actions like sow discontent are completely useless buildings are dull and there s pretty obviously a best buildings configuration which applies to pretty much every single region so there s nothing interesting there either none of these gameplay elements were deep on release and none of them have seen any fundamental changes to make them deeper or more interesting in the last 5 years obviously i ve sunk a lot of hours into the game so whether or not to recommend it was a tough call but ultimately if any of my friends had asked me at any point since release should i pick up rtw2 my answer would have been is it 10 otherwise no so i don t recommend it get rome1 if you want a roman republic simulator it s never been topped figured i should make an honest review of the product after ca intimated on twitter that everyone who s been critical of their recent patch is a nazi not very professional p s i was genuinely excited when they added queens teuta zenobia a few months ago but big explicitly non historical alterations as a non optional update 5 years after release and calling critics national socialists thanks ca but when i bought the game it was quite explicitly marketed as historical strategy and i d personally prefer it stay that way just make it optional extra content for god s sake i d probably download it women generals were great
