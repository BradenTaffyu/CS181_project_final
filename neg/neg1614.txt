2022 early access review bought this game a while ago worked just fine lately i ve been getting a crash which reads that the game has encountered an unexpected problem and needs to collect files whatever that means and the files are never collected i did some research and many others are having the exact same problem tried uninstalling and re installing tried verifying the steam files tried deleting the bannerlord docs on my pc and starting a new game and after months of trying to find a solution nothing works of course i cannot get my money back for a broken game well done taleworlds stellar effort
