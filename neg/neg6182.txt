i d really love to be able to say buy this cause it has a good basis in the ttrpg does cover the in game lore really well however its not repeat not a finished product unless you only wabt to play the first 1 2 of the game from scene 3 onwards it is buggy as hell i persevered through to scene 4 it s gotten to the point i can t even save the game without it crashing like a zeppelin very disappointed with what could have been a awesome game but was released in a state a beta would be ashamed of
