2015 for years i ve spoken praises for the total war franchise and i can say that i have played hundreds of hours of medieval 2 alone not to mention similar investments in empire shogun and rome ii but alas the time has come where i can confidently state that i will not buy another total war title for rome ii was the last straw the franchise has been devolving since medieval ii tl dr at bottom i was originally hooked back in 2007 on the first incarnation of rome total war and i was completely stricken with it until i was exposed to the hotseat variant for medieval ii kingdoms to this day many of my friends and i continue these hotseat campaigns through the retrofit mod and it has become somewhat of a ritual for us since we have hoped for a total war experience that would capitalize on this feature and maximize the idea of a multiplayer campaign since we have been disappointed time and time again empire came promising a new multiplayer campaign that could be played on a massive scale that included three entirely separate theaters unfortunately unlike the hotseat function only two players could be present and this alone was enough to shy my friends from buying it not to mention a very limited selection of factions and no ability to edit the descr strat txt to unlock all factions but no matter a simple mod fix i thought but i had to try it after having my all time favorite campaign as prussia empire had my praise i persuaded a friend to play this beta campaign we did and indeed we found it to be exceptional we could even play as the enemy faction during battles to surmount the jagged ai which for years was found to be lacking then after 10 turns of greatness the dreaded desync we trouble shot for hours on end digging through the internet to find answers to no avail plenty of others had the same issue but there were no answers how curious even following a one month delay for the release of empire quote wikipedia they couldn t fashion a working version of the multiplayer campaign no matter i thought a failed project perhaps they will fix it in the near future unfortunately despite taking my money and making a promise to this day no fix has been issued a beta they called it not worthy of a fix despite having delayed the game launch buy napoleon they said quote the creative assembly this beta programme was designed to offer a taste of the exciting multiplayer gameplay we were integrating into recent titles such as total war shogun 2 and napoleon total war i ignored napoleon entirely although i was foolish enough to buy it because of the puny map size and the pathetic faction diversity these facts did not convince any of my party to buy it either despite a supposed working multiplayer campaign where was the fun if you could not be venice spain or greece what about an african or anatolian or for that matter any small faction whatsoever i supposed it was because there was no audience for such things i supposed that all of my desires were a niche and that only my group of friends were the audience then came shogun offering another attempt at a multiplayer campaign still no hotseat mind you again i felt hope that it could be everything i had wished and again i gave the creative assembly my money plenty of small factions but little unit diversity you could play with samurai or with samurai japan is a very small place after all by the way where were the nearby eastern korean or chinese shores once more shogun did not interest the majority of my friends for there was no hotseat function no separate theaters of war how difficult could it be to bring back an old yet fantastic idea it could even be modernized and perfected but one other decided to take the plunge with me i wasn t impressed by the lack of unit diversity but i found myself well at home with the culture and the new agent system the campaign ai was still clanky and had an absurd handicap budget but at least the multiplayer campaign didn t desync or thus i thought until alas the dreaded dysync again we were halted until we discovered the problem each turn that passed seemed to bring the sav file to a bigger size just like in medieval and these new packets of data would build upon each other until finally after enough turns had passed our i and my campaign partner s sav files were no longer identical the fix exchange sav files via e mail and replace thus the desync was defeated but only temporarily it would come back to haunt us every twenty or thirty turns and we would have to repeat the process nbd i played shogun with this friend of mine for many hours we completed several multiplayer campaigns on legendary cooperating and surviving and tried a multitude of factions to mix up our geographical positioning i wanted more so i reluctantly bought the fall of the samurai campaign for both myself and my friend whom is an adamant boycotter of dlc fearing that each sale to the creative assembly is another encouragement for more dlc i foolishly purchased and gifted him a copy we went on to play two more legendary coop campaigns both for and against the imperials even with the presence of the westerners there still was no korea and no china i must admit over the years my desire to play sp campaigns has died down and i ve been looking for something to do with friends more than to do with myself that said i ve played ample sp campaigns for each title with the exception of napoleon i ve played ample mp campaigns on shogun and rome ii and i ve invested hours of effort into attempting the empire beta both lan and online as i said earlier i still do hotseat campaigns with my mates to this day and we have one rotating right now tl drrome ii review my rating 5 10 mp campaign 3 10 sp campaignpros decent good battle ai armies navies more personal customizable decent campaign ai if you pay for it reasonable unit diversity cons over half available factions are dlc terrible faction diversity more than half campaigns are dlc incomplete game through and through non tradable tech tree uninteresting tech no multiple theaters army units are glued to their generals unlike previously battle ai still somewhat reliant on stat handicaps nonfrequent desyncing multiplayer campaign limited 2 playersconclusionso what s my point each game had its admirable traits but the creative assembly continues to swing and miss gradually they have lost their innovation and they are trying to get away with selling more dlc it is unbelievable and honestly quite insulting to me that the greek states are dlc or preorder contents in my case to be honest i do have fun playing rome ii but i think it is an unfinished product there are tears in the graphics many unit animations look mechanical the load times are substantial and half the game is dlc if none of the game were dlc i would rate it 9 10 and call it a fantastic game even if it was at the expense of my ideal rome ii so what would be my ideal rome ii a blend of traits from each total war medieval ii hotseat campaign unit and faction roster diversityempire 3 theater world map political systems gamechanging tradable tech shogun good agent system rome ii customizable armies dynamic naval application good ai cultural differencesno factions dlc no campaigns dlc desync free multiplayer campaign hotseat with realtime playable battles i have no reason to believe attila will be anything but a graphical ui revamp and thus no reason to believe the creative assembly deserves another dollar of mine they are selling content that is in every respect unfinished
