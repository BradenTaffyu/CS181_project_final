2021 honestly the game has been out for a couple years now and i assumed it would lose it s bugs and faults but it hasn t the game is riddled with bugs feels incredibly unfair at times due to plenty of factors outside of your hands and even for experienced players this game is a mess 1 you have no time to catch up with the game as the era s progress way to fast science and culture are king 2 loyalty is still broken 3 the need for certain districts is to high which doesn t allow you to make cities unique 4 ai are absolutely rubbish and will hate you for the worst things 5 the whole co2 and disasters thing is now the whole endgame fun for once ruins it for the rest 6 you have to pay for new civs as dlc 7 cities feel like they don t grow at all future era with my 15 citizens city capital and 3 5pop cities 8 you have to plan your entire city era s ahead where you want your wonders districts what resources to keep 9 f ck loyalty honestly10 slightly to politically correct civ v was an amazing game and civ vi tried to bring that awesomeness with some new features while fixing the bugs and mistakes it took the worst and added bad to that what a shame for the series
