2021 uh i don t like this game epithets like challenging and difficult and so forth are one thing but this game honestly feels like it s set on rails basically it feels to me as though you have to play a certain way make the choices the game wants you to make otherwise everyone just up and dies or whatever that s not actually what the words challenging or difficult mean though certain failure isn t fun or challenging what would be better instead would be to have some way of meeting a challenge without getting punished in game with the consequences the writer developer wants you to face you should be able to be creative you should be able to fly close to the catastrophe curve and pull a win out of nowhere instead in this you just seem to lose the game frankly if someone wanted to develop a game that can only really be played in a single way in a particular order i d probably say they might want to consider writing a book instead that aside the game is genuinely beautiful to look at and listen to and has a suitably breathtaking aesthetic i genuinely mean no disrespect to either the devs or to fans of the game with my review i can see why you made it and i can see why you like it but it s a game like a train set is a game it s a shame because there s a whole lot to love here i can absolutely see why it s a critical darling there s a lot to admire there s just not much to explore or do
