2022 continual refusal to address fundamental issues with the game map design spawn camping power creep poorly thought out battle ratings to name but a few makes it impossible to recommend the game this is a great shame as the actual business of driving tanks etc is very entertaining probably best in the field i played for a while many years ago when it came out and again more recently the problems that drove me away from the game the first time are still here and as far as i can tell there has been no attempt to improve anything in fact if anything it s worse than it was before new players steer clear you may be able to avoid some of the problems in the very early game but as soon as you start progressing it turns bad typically not long after you decide to spend some money to get over some mild inconveniences returning players if you stopped playing because of problems you had with the game design sorry best move on nothing to see here current players if you enjoy the game as is great i m glad that you do i just hope that the shrinking playerbase doesn t end up affecting you to add the cas situation is out of control if you want to play the game for ground forces don t especially if you don t already have the aircraft to play cas yourself grinding the air part of the game just so you have options as a tanker is not fun
