2020 early access review frankly bannerlord is a better looking version of its predecessor warband apart from being a facelift there is literally nothing new as it follows the same premise and gameplay of warband it is predestined to become utterly boring as soon as you have established yourself it is neither challenging nor entertaining as it becomes repetitive rather soon like warband before bannerlord lacks a concept for the lategame sure you can create your own kingdom but what does that mean precisely you click some buttons do a few quests and there you go a kingdom does that change anything no not really you manage your kingdom more or less the same way you did with your party or clan before you don t get to feel beeing the king or queen you don t even have a capital you don t have a throneroom there is no ceremony you don t even have a crown well technically you can buy one but everybody can and sure a lot of them puny lords do wear crowns although being low nobles everything remains the same no matter what you do apart from the wars going on and different banners being raised over the cities and castles at least they seem to have fixed the snowballing of one faction to some extent by now but what great potential has been thrown away there you could have implemented so much more in this skeleton of a game instead you gave us the mere basic gameplay put some damn flesh on those bones some reviews state that this game is 75 of what it should be let me set that straight it is 50 of what it should be and 10 of what it could be
