2021 early access review looks deep and promising at first yet after playing a few hours the game s shallowness becomes obvious it s balanced around slowly grinding skill points and small stat boosts not player skill for example you can pull of an incredible feat of combat against well equiped foes and be rewarded with nothing but rags because your stats aren t high enough to deserve the good loot the game is filled with balance choices that come across as lazy make the factions competent at defending their domain from brigands nope just give caravans and cargo laden peasants on foot hyperdrives so they can t be caught tactics on the battle map aren t impressive and you better get used to high tier units throwing away their lives needlessly against trash mobs you can appoint units to formations but you can t actually define where those formations should be deployed defore the battle starts nor can you choose their behaviour beyond move there and stand like this foe example i found it impossible to have my javelin armed light infantry actually behave like skirmishers you can delegate formation control to its sergeant but that s asking for them to die like fools holding and kingdom management is incredibly shallow building up your domain requires you to click building icons waiting a number of in game days and receiving a small boosts to modifier x this isn t good game design there is 0 gameplay around workshops and caravans beyond buying them diplomacy feels unfinished your liege can declare peace and then 10 days later be at war again with the same nation the overal atmosphere of the game is empty with very little world building and interaction with npc s it s just do fetch quest x for the millionth time for that bit of money and standing the main quest is a laughable slog which i don t even want to go in to if you just want warband with a new coat of paint then this game will do but i expected more after such a long development
