2017 i don t understand why so many people praise this game so much to me this is just a fair game i actually prefer attila and rome ii to this yes it has so many great features but most of them are new textures and new factions which look very cool at the beginning but the strategic value of the totalwar franchise is actually reduced pros 4 new factions with heroic quests different factions with unique play styles this is a huge plus for a strategy game vast and detail campaign map and battle the siege battle is boring don t tell me to count on mods because from now on ca will not give us full siege map anymore cool and good animations especially monsters level of difficulty is fine to me ai seems to respond better in battle great sound performance i love the music so much coordinate battle with allies is now improved a bit mortal empires expansion is free for those whose bought twwh i cons another game with 1vs1 combat animations please get rid of this ca there have been many issues with this kind of combat units do not charge routing army guarding button is just for decoration routing army now run with a speed of god like cavalry your units can never kill half of them naval battles are gone they use auto resolve to simplify all ca actually does not how to make naval warfare vortex feature is not good for a strategy game everything is about rushing i don t like the intervention army mechanism still 20 units per army it has already been 10 years large scale battles are impossible each reinforce unit will join battle after another one routed rally feature turns you into the crazy mode when dealing with huge ai armies very slow army build due to poor economy balance very small amount of units while defence towers are small deathstar ion cannons now to complete 1 turn it takes you at least 30 60 secs in the late game the map is huge but you will find it boring to conquer the answer is below many factions are just copy pasted of each other why do you like to create so many small factions like that what a waste of performance on those tiny factions like those diplomacy is still the same no improvement at all prepare for the dlc whoring next year
