2017 i cannot recommend this game i am not a very wealthy person and spending money on all of the dlc s is impossible for me any new dlc makes playing on the internet with other players impossible so you have to buy them to play on line the game is interesting but i feel like the price is too high for what we get especially for the dlc s edit i checked it and it s is true it is possible to play all dlc s in multiplayer without owning them so i guess if you want to buy this game only for multiplayer and never play singleplayer campaign nor host a game it is worth it however i still believe the game costs too much for what it has to offer especially the dlc s personal opinion
