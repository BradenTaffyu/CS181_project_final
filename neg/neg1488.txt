2020 early access review the game is a pain in the ass to play right now because taleworlds seems to think nerfing moneymaking strategies while the game is still in beta is a good use of development time get the game to the point where it s feature complete squashing bugs and fixing crashes along the way then worry about balance and while it s in beta let people have money so they can try out everything and give feedback having to mod the game to be able to afford to get into the mid and lategame at a reasonable pace to test stuff out is so incredibly stupid
