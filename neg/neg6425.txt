2022 buy forza horizon 4 three times cheaper more fun and polished fh4 has more populated lobby and a lot more player interaction 100 cars more better ui and more interesting map if you have 1000 hours in fh4 and want more of the same formula but slightly different go ahead i guess otherwise i d stick to fh4 at least until fh5 is heavily discounted fh5 still has many issues that predecessors had devs seem to completely not care about fixing core mechanics of the game and rather spend time implementing features which are not that important like opening car roofs pronouns or sign language to torment deaf people with terrible cringeworthy story i imagine main cons ai still uses a completely different model of physics than the player basically random car models on rails that never slide around push you with great force and randomly decide between accelerating twice as fast as you and not using accelerator at all ui is worse than fh4 in many aspects much more consolized and large two cars in a garage column really many bugs and issues still persist for example crappy auction house that is slow to use lags and bids often fail for no reason story reached new heights of cringe especially with every other sentence being mix of english spanish lobby building seems to be much worse than fh4 i logged into fh4 and saw 60 players on my map here i never saw it past 15 this leads to a lot less interaction with other players especially forzathon arcade you are lucky to have 1 or 2 other players doing it with you there s also four happening at the same time unlike single one in fh4 still not many visual tuning parts and wanting adjustable aero forcing you to use ugly spoiler on every car please just make adjustable aero some invisible checkbox no businesses no ranked visual bugs and crashes that i don t experience in fh4for pros car sounds are better a few more performance upgrade options
