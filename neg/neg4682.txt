2021 pros its a decent game to mindlessly slide around it has a fair bit of vehicles to modify the handling is alright and its easy to get into cons the scoring system seems to lean alot towards insane angles and speed more than precision driving and smooth transitions and lines the engine sounds are very bland the global chat is like a call of duty voice chat lobby and there seem to be alot of very angry and or just vulgar people spamming there at every hours of the day all and all it kinda feels like a half baked game but i wouldnt recommend it mainly for the reason that it gets stale fairly quick and if ur hoping to just relax and slide around and maybe chat to people in there u are going to have wade thru alot of very angry and immature people
