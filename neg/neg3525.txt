2020 giving two point hospital a thumbs down is a tough choice the game has merit and is endearingly charming consone of its major issues is the simplistic and incomprehensible manner of its simulation i can t imagine tph appealing to serious sim fans because not only is the simulation shallow it also doesn t make itself clear 70 hours in and i still don t know exactly how the diagnosis process works success and failure of treatments seems to be left up to rng based on the skill of the physician and how well diagnosis went making it somewhat of a crap shoot features like room prestige and hospital attractiveness reputation and level don t appear to be any more nuanced than how they re vaguely defined while in the process of developing the hospital things will be going smoothly until suddenly there are double digit room ques for no apparent reason or you suddenly have a spike in death rates s far as i can tell that seems to happen if you suddenly hire a bunch of unskilled doctors and nurses or you were making six digit profits and now all of a sudden you have a five figure deficit then as suddenly as it happened despite having seemingly done nothing at all it s fine again even though the assistant complains about how prices affect reputation and there s even a meter to display how much patients approve of your prices i never noticed any discernable effect on overall reputation sometimes patients will just outright refuse to pay higher prices but afaict that s entirely random tph has no tools that explain why these things happen what rudimentary graphs and charts that track stats do exist are practically useless and i only remember referring to them once this gives the feeling of an off the rails simulation you ve got little control over besides these simple graphs only tell you what is happening not why it s happening you ll be laying out the same rooms with the same templates hiring the same randomly generated staff training them upgrading machines researching technology over and over and over and over again fortunately the simulation requires no micromanaging staff always seem to know how to delegate tasks to stay optimal so as long as you hire enough of them they ll cover all the bases themselves there are controls to delegate staff and room behavior but i never felt like i had to resort to using them but this means that every mission is the same every game plays out the same way with no variation tph doesn t even offer up much in the way of visual customization for rooms deco or the appearance of staff so every hospital is pretty much going to look exactly alike you ll place the same rooms with the same walls and the same floors and the same components and the same decor over and over and over again fortunately a recent update finally added room templates so at least you don t have to construct every room from the ground up anymore some fussing with door and item placement will still be required to make things fit sometimes another odd design choice while you can place any size or room shape you can only do so within the boundaries of each hospital building s pre existing shape and sometimes these templates just make getting every room to fit efficiently within them a deliberate fuss the strange logic behind this method sees someone who isn t the player laying out the building s outer walls and then letting you fit rooms inside of them wonky but you ll never make many rooms of varying size and shape anyway since each room only allows for so many mandatory components so you ll never need to construct a room any bigger than its minimum size it would be nice to be able to have one huge pan lab with multiple machines for instance but the game only permits one per room heck even being able to add multiple doors to rooms would be nice for how shallow a sim tph is the game s user interface is needlessly fussy sliders for adjusting staff salaries are a pita for getting their pay rate exactly where you d like it to be the only factor that seems to matter are the pay thresholds at which your staff s disposition to their pay improves which affects their happiness but there is no visual indication on the slider as to where that threshold is you just gotta fiddle with it until the smiley face changes even then if you want the salary set to just above what makes them happier you gotta fuss around even more sure there s a button to toggle any unresolved pay raises but all that does is set all under paid staff to the middle of the road salary oh and you can increase all staff salaries by 1 but that results in overpaying everyone why can t there just be a button to set each individual salary to just past the next happiness threshold there are three menus you ll be cycling through the most to open one you have to collapse the others you can t just have them all expanded at once but the icon to expand the menu then shifts a ways to the right so to close it you have to chase it in fact at no point can any window be open simultaneously with any other there is no resizing or repositioning of menus little issues like this may seem trivial but they quickly become a constant repeat annoyance prossince the gameplay is awfully thin most of the game s entertainment factor comes from the visuals i absolutely adore tph s wallace and gromit style graphics the visual gags are fun but you see em once and they re already old i got the most amusement out of the three disk jockies who cycle through doing voice overs through the game s soundtrack they are genuinely funny and they always have something new to say so a lot of writing was done for them they re about the only continuously fresh content this game provides because everything else is repeated incessantly i also got the occasional chuckle out of some of the random staff descriptions too speaking of the soundtrack i haven t heard a video game soundtrack this catchy in a long time it seriously took me back to the days of simple infectious jingles like i remember from say ocarina of time and i found myself humming along to the familiar tunes again and again there are only a scant few but most of them are pretty enjoyable and at least for me i never got tired of hearing em performance wise i had few hiccups tph isn t exactly pushing the limits of modern computing power so it ll basically run i experienced a few oddities after one long play session my hardware cursor started drifting i had one nurse resign because she just froze up after exiting a room and i couldn t even pick her up and the game can start to chug under large busy hospitals conclusionall in all tph is a very casual experience that ll be fun to mess with for a bit but will undoubtedly get boring pretty quick the total lack of longevity is tph s biggest flaw there should be more and varied content to keep the game fresh and really allow players to play around and experiment but as it stands every play session is awfully shallow repetitive and by the books formulaic
