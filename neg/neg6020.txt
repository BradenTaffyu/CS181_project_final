2022 this is not a bad game i would go so far as to say it is a very good game but the developers made a few gameplay decisions that i think could be very hit or miss for a lot of players and especially for the price i don t think it is a game that people should buy without a bit of thought here are some things i really think new players should know before getting into this gameit is a bit more narrative than a lot of 4x games while it never forces the player to take any particular path it does gently nudge them with missions that offer bonuses for following the historical path of certain empires it also has nation specific events and decisions that i think breath a lot of character into each of the factions i really loved this aspect of the game and i think it was the primary reason i kept playing for so longyou need a tolerance for down time to play this game this is the primary reason i wouldn t have recommended this game to my younger self given the opportunity there were a lot of points during my runs where the only thing i could do was watch my screen and wait either for units to get in position resources to accumulate or for something to break a stalemate that had me restricted you can change the speed to compensate for these periods but even so there was a lot of game time i spent not really engaging with the game the game is complicated i think overly so but that s a matter of personal opinion it doesn t really do a good job explaining a lot of the factors and mechanics which more than once led to me getting absolutely trounced because i didn t understand what was going on or didn t have a good grasp of which of these myriad of factors actually mattered it s a steep learning curve and it often wasn t apparent i had made a stupid mistake until several hours after the decision if you have a high tolerance for that sort of thing you will probably enjoy i the game i do not and finally i think it s important to note that this is not a fair game starting positions are asymmetrical and for a lot of nations the only realistic goal is to put off losing for as long as you can personally i would mark that as a strength of the game as it adds variety to different runs but i can also see how another player might consider that a weakness of the game this was a hard game to give a thumbs up thumbs down to i sank a lot of hours into the game but i never really walked away from any of my runs feeling satisfied with how they turned out but that is just a personal preference and i can easily imaging how a different sort of gamer might really enjoy this game
