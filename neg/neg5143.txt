2021 i have roughly 200 hours in this game so i think i have played this game enough to form an opinion about it if you are a historical total war game fan like me chances are you are not going to like this game i was pretty hyped when this game was announced so that i even pre ordered the game expecting it to be like the previous total war games it wasnt so what are the differences to historical total war games that make this game worse this list is going to be pretty subjective the battles are pretty short units rout quickly battles are pretty easy and not as engaging as other total war titles for example an expensive cavalry unit will most of the time win against a medium priced spear unit in other total war games the cavalry would simply lose there are no animations for fights between 2 men the construction is the easiest out of all total war games it is just not fun to build the same layout in every city special units like generals and agents are single entity units with enormous health pools interrupting the feel of a battle the were lots of occasions where the enemy army is defeated an the only one alive beeing the enemy general your army will surround him and youll have to fast forward the battle until this one guy dies adding 5 minutes to a battle that is long over sieges are pretty bad only letting you attack from one specific side i didnt like the magic in the game it just feels like point and click buffs for most of the time i dont like the rpg styled way you cant enhance the stats of the character with different types of armors weapons etc that you can give your generals they wont be displayed in battle just a point and click buff to stats pretty cartoony visuals with over exaggerated animations no naval battleswhat are the positives extremely beautiful and large map a lot of factions with extreme unit variety probably the game with the most unit variety in the franchise replayability due to the different factions and different lord options per faction the setting is unlike any other in the franchise with lots of love put into it so that it even got me interested in the warhammer franchise beautiful character and unit models though i think they aged pretty badly compared to rome 2 or shogun 2 i liked the large units like giant spyders or ogres they fit in pretty well into the tw formula interesting battlefields for example fighting in cavesover all it felt to me like a oversimplified tw game to attract the masses simplifying both the battles and the construction system to a point it made the game not that enjoyable for me this could be a great game to get started in the franchise though i would recommend shogun 2 and rome 2 a lot more medieval 2 could be great too but i feel like it aged a little bit from the modern point of view
