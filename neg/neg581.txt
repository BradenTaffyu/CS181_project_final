2020 this got longer than i expected so here thetl dr a very in depth combat system with a wide range of customization options and a nice story is counter weighed by very slow gameplay and a camera whose point of view just didn t do the world credit also beast never have i felt so torn about a game so to help me order my thoughts i m going to write my first ever review i played through the whole first and second game now together with my girlfriend on local co op these games are great to get a first experience in the video game world especially for those that are not overly confident in their ability to quickly press buttons at the right time this means a rather casual approach and it took us nearly a year to finish both games so keep that in mind for some of the critical points also split screen co op forces you into using two controllers instead of keyboard mouse while furthermore increasing the size of all menus probably because they assume we would be seated further away from the screen this made for some messy inventory management that felt very clunky but that could maybe only apply to local co op mode in the last fight a bug forced us to switch to single player mode and the inventory screen suddenly became much better arranged this game offers many pros that kept us going until the very end but due to this the cons sting all the harder here is a hopefully clear list of our opinions spoiler free i only talk about the general aspects of the game pros the combat system is arguably the strongest and most unique part of the game its turn based combat gives you a multitude of strategic options that include everything from your skills and party composition to the careful positioning in the terrain while making use of various properties of your surroundings like placing barrels or other objects to your tactical advantage there really is a wide variety of options to explore here but honestly most of our fights ended in huge fields of necrofire d customization options are very varied there are essentially no limits on what you want to become elemental mage summoner backstabber or plain crushing warrior different armours get you very different looks and even the weapon type changes drastically the feel of combat especially for melee weapons the soundtrack is beautiful and sets the mood for the entire game while a little darker than in the first game it still does not lose the lightness of the divinity franchise and also pays hommage to some songs from its predecessor atmosphere therefore is dense and very well complemented by the vibrant colours of your surroundings also very much greenery which i like also very much death everywhere which is a strange juxtaposition that i can t quite get my head around the story sets out quite common but gets enough twists throughout the game to keep it interesting we only saw one end of course but i sense there to be wholly different outcomes depending on decisions we made throughout much of the game voice over every line of text in this game is voiced spare for a bug where in group discussions lohse kept stubbornly silent with every person in the game feeling to be a unique entity with his or her or its own personality most notably the various animals you can speak to the doped rabbit already made my day in the first game this was also good for our co op endeavour as we did not constantly had to check if we were both finished reading here are two of my more personal affectations sneaking was a very fun additional mechanic in the game which gets you to quite a few places that you otherwise would have difficulty accessing you can avoid entire fights by creeping past a horde of enemies then teleport the rest of your party over if you don t have a knack for haggling you can also alleviate traders of their goods while they are currently in discussion with your other party members beast watching my dwarf waddling around through the world was a constant delight for me also seeing him transform into the ber strength fighting machine throughout the game was really cool if somewhat stereotypic cons pacing this was already a huge issue with the first game so much so that i wouldn t have finished it if i was not in it together with my girlfriend while this second game made some improvements most notably in the beginning were faster combat animations it still feels like slogging hip high through a swamp this point is probably the whole reason why i wrote this review because i kept thinking about why everything felt so slow the answer is a combination of some of the cons further down the list but here are some inital thoughts walking felt really slow especially in the beginning when there is quite a bit of backtracking going on and you spend most of your time watching beast waddling which is at least some relief d from one part of the map to another another problem ties into one of the pros from above the conversations are written like they were not really intended to be read aloud in the first place while being often very eloquent people in this game tend to take ages getting their point across if you let them finish their voice lines finally even though i liked the overall story i think it gets stretched very thin over the 100 hours of the game for every major plot moment there are a ton of side quests that you can t ignore because you would miss out on valuable xp tying into the next point level gating this almost made me rage in the second act you are dumped in the middle of a huge open world and are basically told to go out and get better which would be fine if you were allowed to explore the world at your own pace but like in the first game you get absolutely crushed if the enemy level is 2 or more higher than that of your party and vice versa so we went out into the wild only to get our behinds handed to us by some random mobs on the way while never telling you explicitely the game expects you to explore the parts of the map in a certain order that is never conveyed to you other than by the levels of the enemies in that region there is virtually no other reason story wise not to swap some of the content this became most annoying when we ended up underleveled for the area we wanted to go next and had to actively search for the right region where enemies of our level were hiding hi i don t know who you are or what you are doing here but i have to kill you but why i don t know you either because i need your xp now shut up and die camera restrictions we always thought there would be so much more to see and take in if only to camera would allow us more options the best thing i see happening to this game would be the introduction of a third person cam to get to see the world through the eyes of your characters instead of the constant isometric perspective it just feels unnecessarily restrictive most of the time we always let out a sigh of awe when at rare moments the camera zooms out enough to allow for a broader panorama of our surroundings or during one of the handful camera swoops that hint at what could have been possible this leads to the next point apparently there is a maximum character number for reviews so the rest goes into the comments sorry for the inconvenience they are sorted from bottom to top
