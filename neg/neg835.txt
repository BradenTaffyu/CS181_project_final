2016 disappointingthis is an ok game but it pales in comparison to the previous games i found it much less immersive fallout 3 had a huge map and really felt like a wasteland new vegas focused more on different factions fighting over the last bit of land that hadn t been blown to pieces the choices made by the player making a serious difference in fallout 4 the world feels much more intact there doesn t seem to be much to explore and the choices you make don t feel as important as they did in new vegas as stated by other people on here it feels less like an rpg and more like an fps tl dr not awful but not fallout
