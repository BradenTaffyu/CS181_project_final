the game is still buggy nearly 6 months after launch as of right now i can t even finish the game because the final zone have a tone of unkillable not in game prospective but literally buggy things with infinite hp and untargetable monsters i brought pathfinder kingmaker on launch and it was bugged out so i couldn t finish the game i brought wotr after six months and it ran fun to the end who would thought that their third product is even buggier than the first them for not testing their product
