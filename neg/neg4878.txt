2018 tl dr buy on sale by the third ritual i m just going through the motions two armies slog through auto resolve battles upgrade the new towns that had questionable development choices by the ai and occasionally click on the random event with kinda insignificant outcomes every tw game i ve played so far seems to fall into the same pattern i could finish the campaign but why the battles never really feel all that interesting and at times has some serious balance issues i don t think i ve fought a single battle yet where the ai didn t haphazardly charge into my well positioned forces and in more than a few occasions i ve had skaven manage ambush attacks while sieging or encamped i always use overwhelming force when attacking not because of a tactical reason but because i can t stand having battles i get the distinct feeling that as the tw games have developed over the last few years they ve given up on ai design which for a single player game is highly visible and critical i remember when in mount blade my enemies went from raiders just charging at me to a lords army where they went into formations and play cautiously i ve yet to have a moment like that in any of the tw wh games you should not pay full price for this game it feels like a expansion to the first tw wh that somehow managed to lose something in its design
