2018 absolutely garbage ai i never felt challenged the entire time economics and politics suck why cant i give provinces away why cant i request for a province without war why cant i use intimidation to get my way i beat the game 50 turns ago and have 20 full stacks i pretty much rule the world and yet i cant confederate weak factions or make factions pay me a sum to keep me from destroying them bretonia weeps but we cant send aid no no no you got it wrong you need to pay me that or you die why is it the actual mechanic of confederation in the game is completely broken have 400 reputation with itza their cold blooded logic is canceled out by only through saurian unity can the great plan be enacted so they should be open for confederation i dont have a military alliance with them anymore as i read that it prevents a confederation and offered 150 000 gold they are rank 8 and im rank 1 and i ve completed the game 50 turns ago still red on confederation it bugged me back on turn 50 when i had confederated hexoatl as the last defenders seems only way to confederate in this game is when all of their troops are dead which is bs when i have 20 full stacks and they have a single half stack they had been at war with an undead faction and lost some territory when i got my units in position i attacked in 2 turns i had control of all of the undead factions except for one that i laid siege to it was previously a lizardmen faction and after a few turns the province rebeled against the undead faction due to low order and spawned a rebel army of lizardmen who is automatically at war with me even though you could view me as a liberation force and im laying siege to the ones they are rebeling against im sure if i let the game press on another few turns they will try to attack me for some reason lol would make much more sense to ally with them or have them merge into my army or become a territorial army like a militia that defends their home province allies wont really help you either the only threat in this game is the 5 10 stacks of chaos that spawn in and the enemy factions that enact a prevention army your allies will allow them to move through their territory to attack you and they will refuse to attack anyone who you are at war with unless you completely destroy their armies yourself and then your allies will come in just to take the provinces to prevent you from issuing commandments since its contested micromanaging is one of the worst factors for this gamae in war you dont have just 1 person telling everyone what to do the devs need to work on an orders script my cavalry should automatically disengage at a certain threat level unless i override my cavalry should automatically charge in and then retreat instead of sitting there getting surrounded my infantry should attack anything within a certain distance of them so many times i ve seen a unit of temple guards sitting stationary when an enemy unit is right infront of them i ve even had units that i have set guarding artillery and the artillery get attacked and i notice too late the guards are just chilling there in the middle of the enemy as they slaughter the artillery facepalm sieges are an absolute joke it s a frontal attack the cities are not cool like in rome you wont be fighting street to street and it s impossible to even create a formation in the city as the width is smaller then the size of your unit pathfinding is an absolute joke i have to just select half of them to attack the gate and the other half to climb the wall once i breach half of the army archers cavalry and monsters will stay outside the gate and is a pain in the ass to get them to listen and enter the city units pathfinding issues is why i have to autoresolve every siege pathfinding is terrible as described above but also trying to select a large amount of units to do a single task is a hassle for my biggest army groups i have an infantry and cavalry army aided by a full stack of terradons i couldnt figure out why my terradons wouldnt listen they are the fastest unit and since they are an air unit they wont get hung up in combat thus i use them as a qrf quick reaction force and move them all around the battlefield bombarding areas that are starting to get weaker problem is that majority of the time they wont listen and will hold their position i found out i have to individually select each one they have a special ability a 1 time rock drop which looks epic if you have a full stack of terradons 160 and the times i got it to work i practically won the battle in that single moment just from how effectively i damaged all of their tank units but their ai is so terrible that its impossible to use since i have to individually select each unit instead of being able to select every unit to converge on that one spot and they actually listen then it s not worth it to utilize as its a good 2 minutes im not paying attention to the battle and for some reason they sometimes wont fire as they move to the location i dont know about anyone else but for me skink cohorts ai is broken as well they dont want to attack at all for me complete waste of a unit spot i sat them behind temple guards and they werent bothered the entire time and they only managed 3 kills thats the story of them ever i think its cuz i click for them to attack they listen after the 5th time i told them and then they stop when i look awayyou cant make the enemy surrender and letting survivors live gives you negatives like 5 casuality replenishment which is not worth the 600 gold when i make 100 000 a turn lords and heroes are like gods apparently i dont know why they did that on purpose guess its fun to see 400 warriors surrounding a single enemy unit i litterally use warriors just to clog up the area to prevent them from running so i can kill them without them retreating was this what was intended i never bought tw wh but imagine my surprise when i realized that this is just one giant dlc id like to play mortal empires yet they want me to spend another 80 theirs a steamsale now for the base game for 20 but then with dlc its 50 like wtf i liked the game but not that much and it gets old repetitive and dumb fast for a game that wants me to spend 200 i only got 97 hours with a lot of that also the computer being left on meanwhile a game i payed 30 for i have 500 hours in and still having fun and its done by an indie group of modders squad then warthunder and world of tanks are free loads of fun in that this game is plagued with ai and pathfinding issues and is not worth that much im even willing to say both games together should cost 80 including dlc not 200 lol
