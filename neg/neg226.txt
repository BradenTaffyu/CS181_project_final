tldr if you have a friend to play with and you like stories the base story line is still kindy enjoyable however the game is old feels repetitive unrewarding and slugish monetization also goes a bit far in terms of limiting f2pthe gameplay is super boring and repetitive as are quest objectives most of the time you will spend traversing the area trying to avoid unrewarding and unnecessary encounters with random enemies and because of how long this game has been around the community is also not what it used to be on positive note if you have a firend to play with or an active guild some aspects like base class storylines are still good
