2023 gaijin entertainment doubling down on the grind is the last straw that breaks the camels back for me having played a couple hundred hours and having spent a couple hundred dollars on this game was the best way for me to enjoy the game with the limited time i have available and for a time it worked for me it was first noticeable during the crafting events where simply participating to earn the higher end rewards required treating this game like a full time jobb so i never bothered as time went on even the base game became a burden of balancing the time of a grind with regards to an almost mandatory premium account time and the in game currency of silver lions all this to simply unlock a nerfed version of a vehicle which then needed to be grinded to unlock basic components like fire protection and parts and so easily the game became a burden which fun was conditional and locked behind several paywalls i can for all these reason not recommend this game to a new person or returning for the simple reason that needing to spend money to not burn out isn t a good selling point
