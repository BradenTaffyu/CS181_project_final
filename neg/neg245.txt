2023 simply not worth your effort time or money its worth noting that i ve played an unhealthy amount of payday 2 after many hours of payday 2 i came to realise the games flaws but few of those flaws were objective problems so when payday 3 dropped i went in with new expectations payday 3 is very different from 2 and that s by design which i respect so i ll avoid comparing the two currently the game is still without a content update insane given its been two months already furthermore due to starbreeze underestimating server costs the game was practically unplayable for the first few days in some regions multiplayer functionality 21 100 heist and objective co op in payday 3 is very good with many objectives benefiting people working together and splitting up to complete them something i love in other co op games so whats the problem pretty much everything else the party system is a pain to use and causes a lot of unnecessary stress apart from that with friends the co op is to reiterate outstanding however payday 3 pubs are to put it simply not an option due to the games astonishingly low playercount dead game finding players in pubs is a lost cause only some heists on certain difficulties have consistent player counts and even then this games social features are downright hostile text chat is limited to when players are in a heist not the lobby screen or end screen furthermore text chat is not worth using as a large portion of the games playerbase that being console players cannot use chat or even see text chat messages also no voice chat this makes co op more or less a lost cause in pubs and worst of all no server browser unacceptable for a game like this your only choice when choosing a heist is difficulty meaning if you are dropped into a stealth lobby when you wanted to play loud too bad not like you know if people want to play stealth or loud until the heist starts either due to the lack of lobby chat and once a heist is done get out no text chat there no steam links and you are on a minute timer anyway leaving no way to continue playing with a party you just played with for a multiplayer game its astonishingly lonely huh and no the team ai bots are not good in fact i m convinced they are designed to encourage players to avoid playing the game solo by being borderline detrimental in most cases long story short with friends pretty good although clunky however in pubs don t even bother visuals 77 100 to my knowledge the visuals for payday 3 are mostly outsourced outsourcing is not inherently a bad thing and in this case it might be why the game looks so damn good the outsourced artists clearly understood the memo that being to make a world worth heisting making a place as depressing as new york and making it look as miserable as it does takes a special kind of skill from the clutter the invasive billboards and hostile urban design and yes the grittiness all looks outstanding stylistically its not a style that will click with everyone but its admirable none the less effects are outstanding too with many textures taking permanent damage from explosions and bullets animations are a mixed bag with reload and firing animations being a little too rigid and rough but this is a point of taste like the environment design progression 4 100 it stinks i m not exactly breaking new ground with that comment but wow this games progression is so bad it brings the whole game down with it no xp from heists instead we get a challenge based system this is a concept i m not completely averted to but the challenges are astonishingly bad challenges include competing every heist 150 times in stealth and loud for a total of 2400 heist completions getting 1000 kills with every weapon placing 100 of every deployable that kind of pointless tedium if you are not going out of your way to get kills there is a very high chance you could go 5 heists without earning xp i almost don t know what to add as this has all been said before so here s something new the infamous armor system s problems are directly linked to the progression yeah that might be a new one i find that payday 3 is a tactical game with armor being a resource but since kills are good for xp this leads to armor becoming much more important with players frantically getting as many kills as possible for xp taking excessive damage in the process i cant blame them i do it too another key point is once you are done with a weapons kill challenges stop using it you are not gaining xp after all this leads players to using guns they just don t want to use and ditching guns they love worse yet money loses all value within the first 50 hours too the secondary currency c stacks are dirt cheap at their lowest price too meaning if you are patient they are just as useless i ve got more to say but this is a review not a thesis so lets move on ui 7 100 hostile no other description the main menu is beyond bland and clunky no flair no descriptions for weapon stats online related content is on a timer its all just awful so awful my complaints will likely end up sounding pretty esoteric so i m just going to leave it as the worst ui i have ever used soundtrack 82 100 with the departure of simon viklund the composer for the first and second payday games starbreeze was gonna have a hard time filling the rift left by such a talented composer however i m glad to say that gustavo coutinho has fit into their new role perfectly while gustavo s compositions for payday 2 s final dlcs bordered on overbearing and only good in moderation payday 3 s soundtrack is for the most part reminiscent of what made the early tracks of payday 2 so damn good stylistically the soundtrack is quite varied too with some synth heavy tracks balanced out by other more traditional instrumentation although i m still more than open to hearing some of gustavo s more bombastic tracks later down the line there are a few duds like the main menu track but overall very promising gunplay 73 100 compared to the often cheap and outdated gunplay of payday 2 payday 3 s gunplay is much more modern although worth noting is that its surprisingly tactical with split gunkick and recoil stats each with horizontal and vertical stats respectively ads and sprint to fire modifiers and other assorted stats to fine tune despite this weapon modifications all affect each gun in very minor ways i often find the differences between modification setups barely noticeable which is a damn shame as the framework for good gun modding is still there luckily the weapons themselves are all very distinct with varying recoil and spread patterns which leads guns with otherwise similar stats feeling very distinct and some guns just feeling right for different people which i quite like summary enjoying payday 3 is a challenge so many distinct problems bleeding into every part of the game leads the overall experience feeling cold like the game just wants you to play something else content wise i genuinely think the current variety of skills weapons and 8 heists is decent but not worth the high asking price and whats good about the game just isn t good enough especially given this games budget and whats bad is a dealbreaker for most i struggle to see this game getting content updates past the first year once the quota of promised dlc is finished is starbreeze really gonna give this game another chance and even if they do what about players still even if this game is just downright bad i still find ways to enjoy it i m allowed to enjoy a bad game right it s just a shame that i believe that s all it will ever be a bad game overall rating 41 100
