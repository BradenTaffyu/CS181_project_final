2017 the civ series should return to the basics i loved civilzation i iv because the gameplay was quick snappy strategic and complex yet wasn t weighed down by multiple layers of micro management civ vi plays show and is laggy in between turns even with an extremely fast machine i like how the developers added layers of complexity to the game but i feel they sacrificed gameplay enjoyment for features please make civilization fun again
