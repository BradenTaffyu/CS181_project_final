2022 okay so first of all i like this game and it s why i m not recommending it this game is awesome i ve been waiting now more than 2 years to get it because i m against epic games and ubisoft connect as marketplace for videogames i only tolerate steam now we have the game back on steam so everyone should be happy yes well no the game isn t fully supported on steam you don t have the achievements on steam and for that alone it deserves a negative review as an achievement hunter i choose almost every time games with achievements you also have a problem with ubisoft connect where it says it can t sync with the servers i call that and a popup comes every time you close the game to say to you that it was unable to sync with the server hope to see the achievements soon even though i think it ll never happen ubisoft don t care about it s customers as they only see us as cash cow
