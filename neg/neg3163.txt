2022 i played it alot now f2p yes fun sometimesbalance none this game is absolutely unbalanced in terms of ships and strategy the tech tree ships that you can get for free are absolutely underpowered compared to premiums that you can buy with real money considering that theres the new superships and submarines that get put into the random battles aswell which is also absolute nonesense you usually get matched against ships way higher tier than yours resulting in those ships dealing far more dmg to you than you do to them it might have been a good game once but it really is crap in the state it is now dont waste your time and nerves playing this if you wanna have a nice funny time with some friends and actually dont care about months of grinding to get one high tier tech tree ship try it out
