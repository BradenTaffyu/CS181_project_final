2016 overall unimpressive the survival crafting component is super awful regardless of how stacked your defenses are if you don t show up to help your settlements they will literally be exterminated completely every camp has the same requirements location doesn t seem to matter some places can access bodies of water and get purified water and you d think that would matter but it doesn t some camps are a lot smaller than the others and you d think that would matter but it doesn t some camps are in densely populated areas that have a lot more raider traffic and you d think that would matter but it doesn t survival mode makes some things matter but that s all oriented around the player character exclusively the main plot sucks faction side quests are all just go kill fetch come back repeat regardless of faction your character has minimal impact on the world despite being the main character and often times effective or literal leader of your main quest faction nothing you do can change how the world will perceive the institute the railroad nor the bos the ending cut scenes only cement this in with one last middle finger to the player about how the world views their faction you can t make an institute that is more respectful of synths you can t make a railroad that s less radical etc your character has no impact on the world and that is such a complete 180 from new vegas it s absurd your settlements aren t even affected by what faction the leader of the minutemen is aligned with other than your selection of flags to hang on the wall as decorations also all of the final battles suck it will always boil down to a faction war but much smaller than the likes of new vegas combat is weird as you re nerfed right off the bat y know how you start with 5 points in each s p e c i a l attribute by default and can add or subtract from there now you start with 3 you have to level up to add these points back in which you will have to do regardless of how you want to build your character because there are too many level ups that you simply would run out of options without investing in a attribute somewhere down the line combat kinda stops progressing around idk maybe level 70 i m level 84 now on my highest level character and i m stupidly overpowered combat is trivial on very hard difficulty and gimmicky on survival you scale waaaaay too hard critical banker is so op being able to crit 4 however many times grim reaper s sprint and other perks refill your crit bar consecutively plus every crit has 100 hit rate without fail even if there s no way for the projectile to actually reach the target is stupidly op this means that the early levels are hell and high level are just an absolute joke you also level up from crafting that s right if you re having a hard time try building and destroying thousands of wooden boxes for a couple hours and sure enough you ll find the game is now absurdly easy i m giving this its own paragraph because what in the ever loving bethesda character dialogue you know how you get to see the first words you ll say in all of bethesda s other fallout games not anymore you get a 1 3 word snippit or summary of what you might say the left option is often times sarcastic which can sometimes result in your character saying something so ridiculously out of character and negatively affecting your relationships with factions your companion that you ll want to reload from a save there s a mod for this that fixes it and restores it to the old dialogue system that is as far as i m concerned essential to gameplay if you think i m blowing this out of proportion play the game and exhaust every single quest like i have sometimes your character will just say the most unfitting and inappropriate thing and you ll get a little message companion hated that and now your whole situation is worse because bethesda thought it d be a cool feature to have minimal control over what you even say the down option is virtually always the good guy dialogue and the right option is virtually always the villain dialogue up and left both have some ridiculous bs going on with what they can make you say with previews that make it seem like your character will say something totally inoccuous inventory legendary item cool let s preview it to look at the stats and effects because the name isn t entirely descriptive e g mighty gauss rifle cool now you have to take this into your inventory even if you don t want it and or it will overencumber you on survival being overencumbered starts dealing immediately limb damage to your legs because that s how it works in real life according to bethesda you ve probably picked up something heavy and noticed that your legs immediately broke by 1 and you can t heal those limbs with medicine only by sleeping anyway the game puts a lot of emphasis on carry weight especially in survival mode in survival mode virtually everything has weight even ammo which i guess is neat as it adds a bit of a challenge to combat planning regardless of difficulty you can scrap miscellaneous objects for parts to help you build so there s an advantage to having nearly full inventory and then heading back to a settlement to scrap for parts this is why forced pickups become annoying the game also has some super questionable item handouts some quests will give you guns that you would never possibly want that weigh like 30 pounds and you just have to deal with that but that s been in the games before what strikes me as odd is that powersuits are basically permanently available and the game wants you to be using one pretty much all the time by giving you a minigun on your first main quest mission and a powersuit to go with it survival mode gets rid of this at least by weighting fusion cores and fusion cores aren t literally everywhere if you don t go with the bos so that s good at least your character is brokenly strong enough without a powersuit radiation is now max hp damage radiation resistant gear excluding the hazmat suit always weighs significantly more than other gear you can go through your game without this being an issue but let me tell you about the gamma gun you can subvert all of this btw by just taking the ghoulish perk but the gamma gun and irradiated mods of various guns found in the game deal huge amounts of radiation damage like 50 irradiated guns can deal huge radiation damage and physical or energy damage and for some reason the game like to calculate the max hp portion first so you take the full force of both damage types as the damage will always go into your instanly reduced hp i hated this feature honestly it s brutal without being fun and i really don t know what they were thinking with this feature
