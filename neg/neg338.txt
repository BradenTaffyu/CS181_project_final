early access review the game itself while terribly unbalanced can be fun however the devs mass censor any type of negative feedback on the official discord literally banning words so they can t be used to express discontent with changes recently a patch removed the gear score brackets so that brand new players with one low grade magic item would have to fight veterans decked out in full legendary gear understandably the entire community was against this senseless change within a couple hours you were getting your message contains blocked content warnings on discord for typing phrases like we want the 124 gear score lobbies back they also removed the in game tavern lobby with a puppy that could be petted and are now deleting any mention of the dog on the discord i have enjoyed my time with the game and will continue to play it because it s something to do with my girlfriend but the people behind the project have gone entirely overboard with running their community like the chinese communist party censoring profanity and slurs to keep a place respectful is fine but banning normal speech to pretend there s no community backlash against unwanted design changes is an extremely bad faith tactic i cannot in good conscience suggest that people purchase the game
