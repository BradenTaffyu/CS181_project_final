2017 i cannot recommend this game at all it is fun for a time just like any other tw game however this ai design going forward of designing bad ai that gets massive handicaps is boring inherently unfair and by extension just not very fun and lazy the city design is just terrible some factions have ok and somewhat interesting city planning but by no means is it comparable to attila or even rome 2 yes this game has worse city design than rome 2 which had terrible city design for a tw game though at least they tried something new unlike this iteration on the tw series so who would enjoy this game i dunno maybe people who really really like the warhammer series but for people who like the tw series look elsewhere this game takes a few working elements of attila and just butchers them 1 the combat is ok it s probably the best part about the game it s appealing in a sort of visceral way to charge your orcs into battle and to just see the lines collide however you would think the game would be a little more about fighting other factions the first 20 30 turns as just about any faction is spent fighting your own race greenskins and bloody handz the orcs of the game predominantly fight other orc factions with the occasional dwarf human fight thrown in wood elves are better off fighting other wood elves humans other humans etc etc it s just not what you expect going in the balance between factions and races feels nice and keeps the combat interesting but there are too many other problems to appreciate how good the combat could be also the legendary lord system is awesome that is one saving grace of the combat it feels cool to have a super powered unit just wreck hundreds of enemy units 2 the campaign map oh god it s bad where do i start first the ai tends to just sit in it s repective castle so any hope for open field battles is pretty much gone most fights will be siege battles which they somehow made both cool and boring every siege battle is exactly the same one long stretch of wall or in some cases two 1 with two gates and a bunch of towers that feel kind of oddly designed and rushed so although it feels cool and novel to have your orcs climbing up walls and doing battle on the ramparts it also gets incredibly repetitive and old to the point that you just tend to want to auto resolve most of the siege battles but not only that but as expected it s just lazy ai slider difficulty design i really cannot express how much i dislike this common trend of making ai more difficult through handicaps spam armies bigger garrisons better armies through faster research etc it just feels like you are never on an even playing field i lost count of the number of times i saw an ai with 1 2 full stack armies just sitting outside of it s city aside from the ai just camping it s cities the actual city design is just kind of boring the cities themselves are not in very interesting places and it all just feels entirely unforgettable the buildings within the cities are laughably simple and feel like they were rushed on design think about all of the buildings in attila and cut that down by about half and you have the city design aspect of tw warhammer almost every single greenskin city had the same buildings economy building garrison building and either a military or public order building 3 diplomacy ai just ehh the diplomacy feels about as lazy as any other tw game nothing really new or innovative at work except to confederate with other factions within your own group which i found more troublesome than not the ai goes crazy with confederating to the point where the city that you have been sieging for 6 turns may just become confederated with a stronger power and thus your siege is broken feels like a new concept with poor execution that was rushed out the ai is actually fairly decent in combat which is nice on the campaign map it s fairly horrid the ai just makes some really bad desicions sometimes or some wholly unexpected ones some people call this replayability i guess but it feels more frustrating than anything at times either your first 20 turns is a cakewalk because the ai massively derped and handed you a city or two or the ai just sat in it s cities and multiple factions declared war on you causing you to be sort of stuck in your home province because of the risk of leaving it just isn t consistent at all 4 dlc not worth the price some of it is like the 8 ones that add new legendary lords and units to mess around with to preexisting factions these feel like a nice addition to the game though it also seems like could have been included with the base one some of the dlc is just laughably bad for the price if you are gonna list dlc at 20 at least have it be fleshed out and full of content the dlc like everything else feels rushed and hastily thrown together i cannot recommend this product at all i love tw games having dumped thousands of hours likely into rome 1 shogun empire napoleon rome 2 attila but this feels like a bargain bin tw game the combat is the only saving grace while everything else feels rushed or badly implemented i guess it might be worth it on sale but this game got really boring and frustrating really quickly it doesn t come close to the replayability of most of the other tw titles
