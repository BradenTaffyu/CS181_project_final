2016 i have two serious regrets so far in my life the first one is that i didn t kiss that girl i should ve on my graduation i wish i could change thatthe second one is that i purchased fallout 4 and it s season pass for full price i wish i could change that short version if this game would have 19 99 price tag and the title would be call of duty then i would give it a minimum 9 10 but selling this as fallout for 59 99 is a robbery if you loved fallout 1 or fallout 2 or fallout new vegas don t bother with this one long version game of the year my ass what the is this game really called as fallout this is the fallout 4 everyone was waiting for no okay let me tell you why i think this game sucks ass the system remember in fallout new vegas you had tons of ending a lot of dialouge choices and lot of unique locations with interesting side quests even better question are you looking for these in fallout 4 yes then don t even try to buy this game this game is nothing like fallout new vegas or fo1 fo2 that its not even as good as fallout 3 was i actually loved fallout3 remember that in fallout 3 and new vegas karma determined what kind of person you are the devil or the angel of the wasteland man i really hoped i will have a lot of karma options in fallout4 but no karma system is gone its not in the game you re either a douchebag hero who saves the commonwealth or you re a kind hero who saves the commonwealth oh yeah the tons of dialouge options that in fallout 4 you have 4 dialouge options 1 yes 2 no 3 question 4 maybe maybe just leads you back to either yes no or question what the dude what the oh and the lot of endings well fallout 4 supposed to have like 4 endings one ending for each faction but its really just two endings one of these endings is unique and the other one is some epic but it looses its epicness by getting copied and pasted like 3 times with no changes except that there are different npcs standing by your side the story and the quests the story as i mean it starts out as an interesting and exciting story but in the end it fails to be good you re playing with the sole survivor who has a happy life with his her wife husband you two also have a kid called shaun shaun who both of you love then of course starts to happen and you have to escape with your family to the nearest vault called vault 111 after sleeping for like 140 years you wake up in your cryo pod and see your wife husband getting shot and that some strangers take away your little shaun after that you step out of your cryo pod you are like alright lets find my soni mean this sounds pretty interesting and exciting i was really hyped for this story i mean it started out really good and when i got to the half of the story everything went upside down at that point bethesda throws the worse twist at you ever and then you just have to choose with which factions you will work with i mean in fallout new vegas this was basically the same except there were no twists like this one but in fallout new vegas factions actually made sense in fallout 4 however factions don t make any sense the institute is a joke the main edit okay well let s not call them the villain faction because they weren t really bad dudes they were just like every faction in this game is a joke to be honest i mean in fallout 3 the enclave had some real sense behind their actions but the institute does not make any sense spoiler their idea is to seal themselfes forever so humanity can survive wtf railroad equals hippies trying to free toaster machines now the minuteman and the brotherhood of steel are the only factions that make sense the minuteman faction would be pretty good if preston garvey wouldn t throw settlement quests to you all the time you want to speak with him on the other hand i liked the brotherhood of steel seriously they re probably the only reason i enjoyed this game the side quests are really in fo3 and new vegas there were really fun and interesting side quests in here its either fetch this or go here kill these and come back for caps or you could do the real side quests which are just boring go here kill that and done that worth mentioning on the other hand far harbor dlc has really good side quests combat and weaponscombat is pretty much is the only thing fallout 4 gets right so good job they improved the combat of the previous fallout games so good job on the other hand weapons in this game suck ass you have two choices wood weapons or real gunsi mean there are these wooden guns the concept itself is good i mean sure they can make guns out of wood but why the is almost every gun in this game made out of wood you liked energy weapons in fallout3 and nv i loved energy weapons well too bad for you you have like 4 6 kind of energy weapons most of them are either a mini verson of the gun or just a completely usueless crap p now go and liked plasma weapons pff get the out of hereoverall if this game would be like 20 euros and it would have a different name 10 out of 10 but since this is fallout the game which was hyped beyond space this is unacceptable things i liked improved combat far harbor brotherhood of steel voiced protagonist not bad graphics edit though i said that the side quests are pretty there are some exceptions there were a few i liked edit i liked cait she s a really good companion also dogmeat d things i hated story mind twist no karma system no interesting sidequests every area that you clear just respawns every single enemy that you already killed piece of season pass some voice actors sucked the fact that this is fallout 4 the endings limited dialouge options the fact that i spent 60 60 dollar and i got nothing worth of my money that i have to give a negative review for a fallout gameoverall i personally give this game a 3 10 this game was just not worth the hype and definietly not worth the ammount of money i spent on it ps remember this is just my personal opinion maybe you ll enjoy this game peace out lads
