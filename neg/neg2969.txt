2019 i cant find a way to like it anymore since the planet overhaul which promised good change but did only the opposite while gamebraking exploits are still in the game after month of comming back the developers plan right now to create a dlc that makes it beyond boring game went from an adventure space rts to a pop speed farming camping simulator with worse control and multiplied the management needed like 10 times while the helpful ai which can help you managing is destroyed they said they want to reduce the management for more interesting gameplay its so boring the events are so cheap the spacebattle who could have safed it are so uninteresting that it is in fact just like browser clicker im going back to 2 1 that was a super good time i had so much fun in the past it offered endless fun today it feels like everything of it is wrong i am getting bored out of my mind no matter the playstyle
