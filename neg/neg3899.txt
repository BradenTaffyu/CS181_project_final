2018 early access review this game was released as an alpha in 2013 and basically nothing has changed it is still an early release and has seen very little development i can forgive the graphics where everything looks the same i can forgive the horrible hit boxes where to headshot them you may need to shoot half their height above them or their crotch because the hitbox isnt calculating the same as the graphics i can forgive taking 8 16 gig of ram because i have it i can forgive many other things to me the worst aspect is that the entire system is designed around killing you even when you do everything right you scout you sneak your constantly checking behind yourself and then you watch an entire hoard stand up out of the ground directly underneath you oh and they are already attacking before they can be harmed oh and forget running there is dogs in it and they outrun you
