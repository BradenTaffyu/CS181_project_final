2023 product received for free i want to preface this review by saying this game can be fun if you play this with a small group of friends or with a large private like minded community even solo this game can be a fun stupid sandbox with quite literally endless possibilities i should also mention that this game is also used in silly animations found frequently on youtube example being an old series called the gmod idiot box now onto the real review i played this game a lot when i was younger didn t buy it myself it was given to me by a family member played on this garbage little joke of a computer but it didn t matter if i was running at 25 fps at best i had fun with the single player sandbox then i discovered the different game modes darkrp among them i don t know why younger me found darkrp to be the coolest thing ever but i did i played it on some servers and i remember moments of fun but there was another feeling there that was much easier to ignore when i was younger let s fast forward a bit to when i got my first proper gaming pc one game i played frequently was this one and again darkrp was the game mode i frequented the most though there was a big difference this time now that i was older i wasn t having fun i feel like darkrp and subsequently other parts of gmod has some of the most toxic unbearable people i ve ever had the displeasure of encountering on the internet my younger self didn t have the mental capability to properly deal with the people i encountered it felt like i was constantly powerless to what seemed to be abusive admins moderators people crying rdm the moment any death inconvenienced them in the slightest or groups of friends deciding to make the game miserable to play for me obviously now i understand that the solution to all these problems is to simply leave the server but those feelings have followed me into adulthood now i think the only time i truly had fun like actually had fun and had no negative feelings was a night when i decided to rp as the mayor of a dictatorship so many people were involved including various admins and moderators it was all played straight and everyone was having a good time people were not allowed to speak against the government in character and if they did they were executed no one cried rdm no one tried trolling to ruin everyone s fun no admin used their powers to stop the charade it was just a few hours of orwellian tomfoolery looking back i wasn t playing darkrp to have fun i was chasing a fun high like the ones that i saw on youtube and the one i experienced that night recently i decided to join a darkrp server for some reason i guess i wanted to verify something one thing i immediately noticed is that darkrp isn t anything it was back in the day levels microtransactions time sinks and so many jobs that the whole thing would just be unpalatable to my younger self this wasn t darkrp anymore these are a bunch of scuffed pseudo mmo rpgs using darkrp s name regardless i tried to rp as various roles citizens doctor cop etc of course i had to engage with the aggravating grind the server forced me to do in order to be a high enough level to even access these jobs one thing i came to realize is that despite all the changes one thing didn t everything still sucked people were still toxic despite having 50 players i only found maybe 3 people actually trying to rp but they would quit immediately with all these toxic people collected together it attracts these freedom fighter types to come troll the people playing you might think that this would be fine trolls messing with toxic people can be funny you d be right but the problem here is that some people will end up becoming collateral damage to these trolls i would know it happened in my recent session of the game i know my younger self absolutely despised these trolls not really understanding why people had to ruin everyone s fun not like i was actually having any if you ask me these trolls are just as bad if not worse than the toxic people they troll the toxic people are self contained where as these trolls go looking for trouble instead of doing something more productive i don t know i ve never understood the fun in making people mad and people have told me that it s funny my only response to that is how unrelated tangent aside let s move on the other game modes while better in some respects suffer the same issues trouble in terrorist town is an extremely fun social deception game in fact i believe it may have inspired among us but i could be wrong on that but like darkrp i keep seeing servers with pay to win garbage and people crying rdm when they die at some point it feels like you re not playing a game anymore but you re arguing with some teenager or kid to keep your spot in the server i remember this one mode called murder that basically had an absence of server rules and it was similar to ttt i remember enjoying that game mode so much because i don t remember ever having to be worried about being kicked or ban because i made a bad call as a detective or unintentionally accusing someone falsely now that i think about it as i write this review maybe the reason so many people whined and moaned was because they were upset people weren t playing the game they wanted to this review ended up being a journal type account of my experience playing public servers of this game i apologize if it comes off as unprofessional but i think it s important to the review tl drthe game is great solo or with friends but public servers are full of pay to win garbage toxic players and trolls it feels like many admins and moderators are just as toxic as the people they host
