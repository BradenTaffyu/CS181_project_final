2018 i love this game and then it broke my heart see the thread game so time consuming and so engaging and you can lose all your efforts just like that finger snap here it is a trap not recommended for those who spend majority of their free time gaming you can be heavily disappointed when everything that you had is gone p s if you still wanna do it backup your saves enable shadow copy on the drive and install some shadow explorer to recover in case of a disaster
