2022 early access review let me start by saying i love this game it s very fun and engaging especially the first few times you play there s a lot to discover and explore there s something so sweet about that early game struggle that keeps you trying new starts it s fun and exhilarating on that first horde night i won t lie my friends and i have had a lot of fun with this game that said the staff at the fun pimps seem to have lost the vision at what makes this game so good they are currently making changes to systems that don t need changed the responses that concerned players get are often lacking information or mocking insulting this isn t the first time these sorts of changes have been made either while they promote this game as a sandbox game they don t like when players play the game in any way outside of what they want you to play many playstyles have been rendered unplayable because of this attitude if it was exploit fixing or overwhelmingly bad for the game then sure i get that it doesn t seem that way at all and the fun pimps haven t had any valid response that is respectable is this a fun game yes will it continue to be i don t know i can t personally recommend it right now because of the current state of their interaction with fans i really hope to update this in the future as i hope the game and the staff can commit to the players who thoroughly do enjoy this game
