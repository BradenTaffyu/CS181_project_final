2020 early access review here s the thing ccp has brought its censorship even into this game by banning players with inappropriate behaviors i don t know why talesworld decided to make ccp the moderators of east asian server most probably because of money i guess i love this game a lot but this isn t what i expected for waiting for 8 years not a game bans you just because you say something they don t like when you pay a full price for it
