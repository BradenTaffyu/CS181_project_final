ever read a george r r martin book and think this needed an editor with a pair of pruning shears eu4 is kinda like that a lot of negative steam reviews focus on the egregious dlc dripfeed which is fair however my problem is that the game is just an absolute chore to start with the entire game s ui is overwhelming there are buttons and icons everywhere way more than is necessary there is a school of thought that believes dumbing down systems is bad i e ck2 to ck3 but the ui ux is offensively unfriendly to newcomers the game is constantly drowning you under a fusillade of pop up messages 97 of which don t pertain to you and are nothing more than a chronic annoyance if you ever thought your games didn t evoke the late 90s internet experience of getting barraged with pop ups then eu4 might be for you an unbelievably useless set of tutorials teaches you the barest of minimums on how to do the most basic tasks which will still leave you wildly unprepared to play it s obvious from anyone who s ever touched a paradox grand strategy game that there s more under the hood than what the tutorials suggest but you re left to flounder on your own to figure that out yourself there s a reason why the adage is easy to learn hard to master eu4 has so much going on and is content to let you stumble over and over in order to understand all of its mechanics this is an atrocious approach sure the game might be utterly fantastic once you figure it all out but no one should have to fail constantly over a hundred hours or dig through strategy guides and reddit posts to understand fundamentals all of this means that simply diving in is going to punish you constantly and relentlessly in how many ways can i say this is not fun let s look at the most obvious thing one might expect to do in a grand strategy game go to war the game helpfully spells out your comparative strength relative to the enemy but does not account for how paste gobblingly stupid the friendly ai is this is doubly worse when you consider that the ai for all your neighbors regardless of where you start will immediately lock arms in alliances with all of your other neighbors meaning an attack anywhere brings a coalition of tens of thousands of soldiers crashing down upon you even if you don t provoke a fight the ai will still play this to its advantage and stomp on you with 5 different nations right away that s how much this game resents you pretty much the only time this doesn t happen is when playing on pacifier sucking baby ez difficulty which is like when you fail a boss fight several times and the game suggests you play on a lower difficulty because you re garbage and need training wheels gee sorry i don t have the time to sink into a game as obtuse as it is dense just so i don t get curb stomped in the first 20 minutes i wanted to like this game i really did i ve put a fair few hundred hours into ck3 and i ve really enjoyed stellaris so a meaty paradox grand strategy game tackling the renaissance to the napoleonic wars seemed like something i could get into but not like this the game is too cluttered to be enjoyable digging around in menus to do something as simple as assign a merchant to a trade node might be riveting for some but i personally can t believe that medieval ii total war a game that came out 7 years before eu4 figured out ui ux simplification in a way that eu4 simply cannot say what you like about ck3 being dumber than its predecessor at least it gives you a chance to figure out stuff before it tries to roll over you most of the time for proof look no further than playing as almost any japanese clan within a year and a half of starting your neighbors will declare war on you and you will be too poor to stop them of course you could play as a rich european nation and watch in delight as your nation instantly hurtles toward some civil war crisis if you re lucky it s only one looking at you spain don t bother with this bloated mass of inscrutable mechanics strung together by spaghetti code it s not the flex paradox thinks it is when it advertises that its newest patch has fixed over 130 bugs that just means there were at least 130 bugs in the game a game that is already elbowing you to stop playing even when it s working properly if you really like this time period play age of empires 3 or empire total war or watch a youtube video on the intricacies of politics in shakespeare s plays or go see a battle re enactment of waterloo or do honestly and truly anything else but play this waste of time and money
