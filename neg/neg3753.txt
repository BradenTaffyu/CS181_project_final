2021 early access review multiplayer early access impressioni initially played this game a few patches after the initial release played like a minecraft clone with zombies and the mechanics around surviving with those so i checked the game out again 8 years after release and i must say i m really disappointed impressioni don t really believe that the developer will ever finish the game due to the fact that the game doesn t really have any focus to where its going it keeps showing signs of things which just get scrapped or implemented poorly at its bare knob you look for a nice spot build a base to defend yourself against either night time zombies which are usually stronger or during the blood moon phase where the game feels more like a tower defense game which i don t really dislike blood moon phases could be really awesome but they end up just in you being ontop of your fort and you either have enough ammo or even weapons found crafted and you spammed enough stone concrete walls to hold out the night sometimes it was good and intense but i feel that part is where it s quite disappointing how easy and unbalanced it is surviving itself is only really hard in the beginning and due to the developer being able to give you a lot of different options to tweak around its balancing wise not that great and i have no idea what the intended difficulty for this game is i had some fun exploring and finding some cool items or having some relaxing time while building my base but that s mostly all the game offers unless you go for mods and play with friends then again all games are better with friends in the 8 years or more of development or atleast when i last time played they only managed to add traders who often have not the items you need vehicles a poorly implemented rpg system which is obviously totally unbalanced and some minor other things the biggest chance aesthetically and gameplay wise must be that the earth stone and so on don t break in quadratic shapes but in a more realistic looking way which makes for a more fulfilling and immersive mining experience which should be but there isn t any real reason to mine due to most deposits being able to be located from above the ground mining has zero point to it except to make some sort of aesthetically pleasing underground bunker gunplay a huge factor in such game is rather weak and doesn t feel great neither is there a good amount of traps available to be build i also found myself stuck to the wiki for a long time as many barriers be it xp wise or not having found the right blueprint or item can make the game frustrating as some upgrades require you sometimes specific items that are hard to find and despite having a lot of money to spare i cant buy the item i seek at a trader because none has them not to mention how hideous the game looks like its one of these games that just exacly look like one of these asset flips i didnt even mention the animations and sound effects which are just utterly subpar conclusioni don t feel like that the game ever will be something really worthwhile to look into it took them so long to be where they are now and i don t see any of the games functions being either deep or fun enough for me to play around with the game has neither an end goal to achieve nor are there core game mechanics deep enough to justify such an open end gameplay loop
