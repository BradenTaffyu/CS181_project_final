2022 even though i enjoy playing house flipper a lot i cannot in good conscience give this game a positive review the game started out as an asset flipper and kind of still is lots of furniture that you find in this game can be found in other unreal unity games that said the game has your basic unreal engine unity lighting and is overall just a very basic unreal unity game the devs have been working a lot on the game since release and listening to a lot of the feedback which i do appreciate including all the consistent updates that have been coming out i can tell the effort they have been putting in to steer away from being a generic asset flip game to something that is more their own which is why i think houseflipper 2 is gonna come out now which looks way more unique compared to the game currently that said a lot of their cooler content is locked behind dlc usually i don t mind dlc that much but i find the house flipper ones pretty pricey with how much the 4 dlc cost you you can buy the base game 2 times at full price 5 times when it is on discount that is insane next to that they put achievements from the dlc in the base game so if you want to 100 this game you have to buy the dlc i have seen more indie games do this and it always pisses me off to no end next to that the game feels more like an extended demo than a fully fleshed out game i would say the base game is however decently priced and goes on discount quite frequently the same can t be said about the dlc and before all the mentally stunted adults and children reply to this review and start whining about the sooo you do like the game and you are giving it a negative review low iq lol or you are judging the game based on its dlc and not even the base game pathetic i will repeat myself for you you can t 100 steam achievements the base game without owning any of the dlc that you have to pay extra for so yeah i am judging the game on its dlc oh and they broke a lot of people s save files with the latest update including mine no bueno
