2019 dlc for the dlc god pretty solid tw game but atrocious dlc practices mean i can t recommend this title with the sole exception of bretonnia every faction in the game has important on disc content locked behind a dlc paywall at times it feels like a pay per character fighting game only instead of being released f2p the devs expect you to shell out sixty dollars for the base game worth playing but not worth paying for unless you re an idiot like me give it a pass until everything is on sale
