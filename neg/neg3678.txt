2018 early access review i got this game years ago and had enjoyed playing it thought all the ups and downs alpha 15 is still a good game in its own right but alpha 16 is too broken to even play i given it a good go and i m done while you guys at the fun pimps are make the new game engine why not patch alpha 16 with the much need tweaks just to make it playable if alpha 16 was getting small updates it would help stay the weary supporters stardew valley was a single man team and has been fully released and then some stop trying to make it look good just make it play good its a game not a painting
