2018 it would be fair to say this review is made out of frustration i sat here composing this in a word document in order to get across precisely why you should skip this game in detail rather than just for joke memes i should also preface that i will still probably play this game but it s more because i m an achievement completionist rather than because i enjoy the game but it wasn t always like this when this game released it was half decent in some respects it was better than civilization 5 brave new world on release even then the cracks were showing they axed golden ages railroads were scrapped culture bombing was removed and there are various other series staples removed that made the game less interesting on release but were honestly not deal breakers then the balance patches started rolling out starting with the balance patch that nerfed unique districts this game has felt more and more like a free to wait mobile game that should be charging microtransactions to save time or skip the grind except this is a premium strategy game with none of that nonsense so why would firaxis make the game feel longer and more drawn out there are other things i didn t like either that need to be addressed i wanted to like the district system i really really did but it seems firaxis are keen on not improving the few things i could want for the district system and doubling down on all the drawbacks i mentioned earlier they nerfed unique districts unique districts are districts that can only be built by one civilization on release these districts did not count towards the population cap so you weren t actively penalized for using the unique districts for each civilization i have a feeling the only reason they changed this was in a roundabout way to nerf german s overpowered hansa district which was overpowered in part because of german s passive not because it was a unique district but that didn t help however it had the opposite effect it made the hansa the only actually viable unique district except for maybe korea s replacement for the campus district in rise and fall meaning if you want to build the acropolis district for greece you are being actively penalized by the game they also did not change the formula for how district costs are calculated rather than decreasing the cost over time firaxis made the cost increase over time in an obtuse way the obtuse way they did this was making it so that the cost was increased depending on how many districts you had with regards to how many the rest of the world had that s right you are penalized for getting ahead of the rest of the world by making new cities an extreme pain to get up and running thus necessitating diverting trade routes to them while i think this was done to curb building as many cities as possible all this does is make it a pain to build new cities not that the statue of liberty wonder in rise and fall would have you believe that is the case seriously why would you make a wonder spawn settlers in the industrial era that is one of the most underwhelming effects of a wonder i have ever seen exploration is also a pita firaxis claims that the maps are bigger and i believe them not because they re as big as they say they are i d estimate they re only about 10 15 bigger if that but rather because they slowed down movement in the game figuring that civ 5 moved too quickly they made it so rough terrain woods hills marshes and the like requires units to have the number of moves it would rob from them so in order to move into rough terrain you need to have either all your movement points more than 3 movement points or a road speaking of roads those are nerfed roads don t really do anything aside from removing rough terrain punishments until the industrial era starting in the industrial era you ll get a slight movement reduction in that each hex of road will cost 75 movement points rather than the full 1 movement and then in the modern era it will be a full 5 movement points instead of 75 for some reason firaxis thinks this is a good idea it is not roads should never be this slow i get it if this was railroads from civ 3 being nerfed to be reasonable as opposed to taking a full stack of units from 30 squares away to be right at the front with full movement available in the same turn but roads were never that overpowered oh and i would like my workers back instead of the builder system sacrificing units to instantly make improvements instead of gradually seeing your undeveloped land come to life is not fun also civilization 6 has the most boring civilization i have ever played in the franchise norway i won t bother you too much with the details but norway in essence feels like they made a decent civilization for civ 5 realized they were making it for the wrong game and then tweaked a few things so that it made sense to put it in 6 nevermind that the civilization in motion feels as useless as a wet noodle and has no way to capitalize on its early game advantages several other civilizations feel like this too especially after the trading route nerf where firaxis decided to fix the bloated trade routes not with any logical ui fix but by nerfing the maximum amount of trade routes in a game without a specific city state from 2 per city to 1 per city the way they did this was rather than harbors and commercial districts granting 1 trade route each you only gain one trade route per commerce hub or harbor per city and considering how the game conditions you to use as much land as possible due to the district system investing in harbors is not really something you re not going to end up doing until much later in the game which in addition to harming naval civilizations like norway also took england a traditionally strong civilization in the past from being an alright civilization to being mostly useless due to this change to trade routes and their earlier nerf to unique districts since their unique district is a harbor i would honestly be surprised if they bothered to playtest the updates before letting them go live this game is not fun in its current state and personally from the 6 or 7 entries in the series i ve played after all the balance patches this in my opinion is the worst civilization game i ve had the displeasure of playing from the looks of reviews on rise and fall it doesn t look like that was the silver bullet this and beyond earth are probably going to be the last firaxis products i support for a while honestly skip this game and pick up the third fourth or fifth entries in the series and their expansions instead they re more compelling even if 5 has some of the wonkiest achievements ever conceived
