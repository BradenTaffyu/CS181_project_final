2014 the release of rome total war 2 was one of the worst in gaming history in my experience only assassin s creed unitys launch was worse creating a huge outrage even outside the total war community and also some pretty funny memes the questions is is it playable after more than a year yes it is is it as good as its predecessors sadly no and while i can recommend it to you if you re looking for a good casual strategy game its still a huge step backwards for the franchise and like after playing mass effect 3 i am afraid of what the developers are doing to my beloved franchises next so while it has its good aspects i will focus mainly on the flaws of this game in this review the total war series is my favorite strategy franchise and maybe my favorite game series in general you ve got a turn based campaign map where you capture and hold cities build up diplomatic relationships with other nations recruit armies and so on and so forth when it comes to battle the game changes from the campaign to a randomly created battlefield map where you command your troops in real time total war connects the just one more turn mentality from games like civilization with intense real time battles like in world in conflict for instance this formula works every time regardless of the given time period or setting creative assembly added features until 2009s empire total war and with shogun 2 they ve streamlined it back to bare bones to get rid of the problematic ai which was all over the place in empire and napoleon rome 2 promised us an overhaul of the traditional total war concept while bringing back the diversity of factions shoguns clans all had the same units due to the japan setting and adding new features they have lied to us i still remember the moment when my legions first encountered the scythians and their mounted archers in rome 1 what i m trying to say is that you had to adapt your tactics to the foe you were fighting back in the day now although the skins and names are different every nation still seems to have nearly the same roster barbarian swordmasters really play like a legionary cohort they even throw javelins like them the biggest two problems i have with rome 2 is that its a even more streamlined than shogun 2 they ve even cut out building and upgrading streets what the so you re telling me that some barbarians could march as fast through their woods as the mighty legions of rome on their high tech streets and b the features they ve added don t work the best example for this problem is how they ve improved armies and recruitment previously you ve recruited your troops in your cities and gathered them to army stacks now you have a limited amount of stacks which gets increased by your empire level so even if i have the economic capability to recruit more troops i can t do that because my empire level isn t high enough what the flying those serve under a general who materializes the troops out of thin air apparently as long as he is marching through friendly territory and while the rpg elements they ve added to the stacks are interesting not being able to move single or small amounts of units independent from a general breaks your strategy big time if you want to capture a small city you used to be able to dispatch a small force to get the job done here you have to use one of your huge bigass armies to conquer a tiny village or imagine a rebellion at the heart of you empire while all your armies are fighting thousands of miles away normally you would recruit some units near the troublespot and eradicate the filthy rebel scum but now you have to remove one of your armies from the front leaving your cities near the enemy undefended cause once again you can t recruit units in your cities just to march all the way back and crush the rebellion and if you want to exchange the units beetween your stacks you have to move your entire stack to the other just to exchange one unit i don t have to explain why this can be infuriating at times now lets get to the building and campaign map cities are now organized in provinces with 2 to 4 of them this really helps to overwatch and upgrade entire regions but also comes with some problems those are the culture spread syracuse for instance has a cultural impact on southern italy because they re in a province together that creates public discontent and the public discontent after capturing a city in a province for instance the people of rome get angry at you when you take a city in northern italy because they re in the same province why does this happen why does local discontent have to have an impact on your already captured and secured cities and lead them to rebel what the ca i could ramble on about the hundreds of minor issues and odd design decisions of rome 2 like the train wreck politic system the faceless randomly generated generals that are just weak compared to the family tree system of medieval 2 for instance which created interesting characters that you really cared about i could talk about how you can t even see the fight animations because battles are huge moshpits with no order or discipline whatsoever although ca managed to patch the worst parts of these or how it just fails to get you immersed in the time period or that the repeated one line general speeches are a shameful display compared to the long randomly created ones of the previous games but what breaks the game at the end of the day is the bare bones a i total war is a single player game period and when you up the a i in a game that is designed for daylong sessions in front of your computer you re doing something wrong the a i was never cas strenght i admit that but compared to the budget rtw2 had the a i was never this incompetent and while they fixed the worst insults displayed in the real time battles it still seems you re playing against a brain dead infant on the campaign map giant enemy forces ignoring defenseless cities garrisons are a joke the a i randomly trying to form contracts with you even if they are completely useless almost never declaring war on you except you re playing the seleucids where its you against every eastern faction and army stacks made half out of peasant slingers and when you want to auto resolve those battles because 2000 slingers aren t worth your time guess what the auto resolve system is completely so you either lose or get unacceptable losses with your heavily armored legionaries accompanied by elite cavalry but you ve gotta give it to creative assembly they know they ve up and they ve patched big times and while everything i ve mentioned is still an issue bad design decisions can t get patched this is pure gold compared to the release state of rome 2 with the release of the emperor edition this game became something worth your money but at the end of the day looking at all the flaws this game has you re better off with medieval 2 or rome 1 speaking of money my biggest concern about creative assembly isn t rome total war 2 anymore its their dlc we re getting stoned to death by unit packs faction dlc and additional mini campaigns which are all right to ask money for but please dont display a button in the main menu that tells me to pay 15 bucks for three uninteresting factions from the black sea again the units are all reskins of the same 10 or so unit types so why even bother when there are mods that make all factions available i understand you don t have to buy these dlcs but they lack quality and are way way overpriced if they released a single huge faction pack with 40 or 50 completely new units for 30 bugs i would buy it but the bombardment with lazy ass pay 15 bucks for three more dull factions expansions is unacceptable and infuriating
