2016 if you re going to make an rpg there are two aspects that are very important 1 npc and characters need personalitythere are far too many if not nearly all npcs in fallout 4 that repeat the same few lines or have a predictable boring stereotypical personality examples are anyone in the brotherhood of steel i found some characters in the institute more interesting but still most characters are flat and are simply just quest givers lore and story are essentual to an rpg and i was so frustrated that you play as a 200 year old dude and yet every time you meet someone it goes like this hi i m a vault survivor and i m over 200 years old what happened since then oh hi i ll just totally ignore what you said and i need help with a random useless quest so maybe i ll help you if you kill some ghouls okay killed those ghouls so like what was this war and why are there ghouls and why did the institute make mutants huh well there are more ghouls so go kill them i whatever 2 quests another settlement needs your help okay but i was just there yeah well quest goes to settlement hi we need help mutants nearby are kill them all but i was just there and it s on the total opposite side of the map makes no sense yeah just come back when you re done there seems to be a lot of areas on the map that no quest will send you to it s a huge untapped resource that bethesda seemed to have ignored i understand that many want to explore and discover but often in bethesda games you do that and eventually find the quest that would have sent you there anyway non stop fetch quests with little to no backstory becomes a chore and when sent to the same identical locations that s just bad game design the concept around fallout 4 is awesome i m even from boston and really enjoyed running around my post apocalyptic hometown but the lack of story unimaginative quests dialogue with no real choices and lackluster npcs left me unsatisfied with no replay value good shooter though and awesome atmosphere so it s not totally not recommended just not a good rpg
