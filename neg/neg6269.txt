2023 early access review i have played since the global launch about 7 months the game itself is magnificent the core mechanics of the game is a beautiful engine that in the right hands would make it the best cardgame for me the games are lighting fast and the snap mechanic betting rank points cubes is ingenious why the negative review have a wild guess its a mobile game with mobile game monetization progression getting to the lategame takes you about 5months if you play daily everything in the shop costs way more than its reasonable to ask anyone and they keep making card acquisition worse and the game keeps leaning on p2w elements if this is the direction you are better of playing anything else i ll come and change the review if needed
