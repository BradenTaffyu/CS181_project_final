heard it was better than yugioh it s just as bad there s a bunch of formats all dominated by degenerate with really obvious ban targets that ll never get touched then there s the draft formats which are just pay 2 cycle til you get a deck resembling a constructed one somehow alchemy is the one most resembling playable aside from brawl but it still has infinite self replicating combos and heist which allows some douchebag to steal every card out of your deck instead of making their own but heist isn t meta i don t give a it s annoying and shouldn t exist even if you want just want to play with friends getting the resources to make new decks without paying out the ass for digital card board is next to impossible oh and if all that isn t enough this game not just your matchmaking but the turn order and your draws for engagement trying to force a 50 50 at best win rate so it s all just straight up rigged don t even bother with this
