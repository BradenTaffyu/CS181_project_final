2018 the inclusion of red shell malware in this game will probably lead me to swear off the franchise which i ve been playing faithfully since the original and encourage others to do the same whoever made the decision to bundle spyware in a game that i purchased should lose their job while i hate online tracking via cookies there s at least an argument i m viewing content for free and tracking cookies are a way for content providers to be paid but adding tracking malware to a game i ve paid for is something else entirely and i intend to punish firaxis for it i really hope others do the same because i have serious concerns about the direction the gaming industry has been taking over the past decade unfettered greed as we see with the red shell software bundled with civ vi threatens to ruin this industry it should not go unpunished
