2016 dlc i could buy the game five times but still buying all of the dlc is more expensive game is actually very nice but the thing about the expansions are that they don t really change anything if you buy a single one but if you buy all of the expansions it massively changes the gameplay playing with and without dlc is so major and they recently increased the price of the game i felt like i had to protest it i get that they need to sell expansions to get this 4 year old game going yet they do it in such a money draining way especially to the newer players although i like the company their general attitude and their games i really think they could and should do it through a more moderate marketing policy
