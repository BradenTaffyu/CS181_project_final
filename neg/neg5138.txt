2016 update 18 9 16 after putting in more than 150 hours in this game i feel like i am ready to give a valid review of this game i have never had any experience with any warhamme games before so i was mesmorized when i entered my first battle but that was soon to fade it is not that battles are bad or poorly made they are just all the same and it becomes very tedious in the long run the enemy very rarely engages you they just stand there and wait for you to engage and sieges are all exactly alike which after 100 hours of gameplay makes you auto resolve more or less every battle there is diplomacy is a joke an utter joke vey little effort were put into this by the devs you can play the game without ever really engaging in diplomacy but just pressing ok and move on it is not really that important for succes of your progress sure it will make things a bit easier but not much what really makes my blood boil is join war option if you you allies or ask them to participate in a war against a certain faction they never show up or help you defeating the enemy faction the join war option is random at best and more or less useless the overall feel of this game becomes lather rinse repeat but the one thing i loathe the thing i absolutely hate and makes me scream at this effing game and ragequit is the heroes and their lack of succes now math has never been my strong side as go the same for the devs how so let me explain if a hero has for instance 59 chance of succeding in a certain action how come it takes up to 15 attempts for that action to succed if succesrate is 50 or more it should according to my calculation take a maximum of 2 attempts for an action to be succesful nothing is more frustrating than watching a single enemy hero massacre an entire army while you can do nothing to prevent this there is no point in having heroes except bolstering your army with perks despite all of this my real beef with this game is the dlc s this game has become a symbol of gig gaming industry greed the game itself is 60 euros and at the current moment the total price of dlc s are 34 euros so total price of game pushing almost a total of 100 euros this is insane all the dlc should already be in the game at the price of 60 euros now the dlc s look good and fun but if i buy this i would support gig hence signalling that in the future they can pick apart games and sell them off at ridiculous and unaffordable prices i simply cannot and will not support this actionso my advice is do not buy this game in its current state put it on your wishlist and buy it on sale in about a year or so thank you for your timep s my reaction when enemy hero butchers my army in a single round youtube video tourettes guy views 2 713 436 we are giving away free downloadable tourettes guy soundboards to our loyal viewers see our channel for more info tourettes guy central all your tourettes guy needs
