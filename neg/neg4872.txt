2019 this isn t really a sequel if you buy this game without buying the base game you will only be able to play a few races they named it as if it was going to be a completely new game but it is really more of a stand alone dlc you cannot buy this game and play as high elves against the empire or as dwarves against lizardmen and there are many other things you cannot do without paying an additional 60 for warhammer total war they get away with this because the fraction of the full game that is called warhammer total war ii will actually run on its own it s like buying the sequel to a mario game so that you can play as luigi oh but mario isn t in the sequel didn t you read the fine print if you want to play mario and luigi together you pay 120 pretty outrageous other reviewers are defending this deception by saying that you should have just read the site where it says which races will be playable with each game but if you have ever bought any other game you know that this never how things are done naming new features does not imply that they are now the only features it implies that they are in addition to the previous features a sequel in any other game franchise does not rely on the previous game for content and pretending that everyone should know that already without any real warning is arrogant and insensitive good job for catching the ruse yourself but that doesn t mean we are just oblivious for decades the format of almost every game series has been that when you release a game called game ii it means that game i was great and now there is a totally new game available they didn t call it warhammer total war the other half of the game they called it warhammer total war ii this is bullsht and you know it
