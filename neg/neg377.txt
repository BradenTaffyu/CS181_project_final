2020 product received for free i really feel like i should preface this i played both the original release launch and now the current npc released update i got this game for free as a gift from a friend who really wanted to play with me and i was hooked but i feel extremely ripped off getting the game for free i want you all to know that this game is still the absolute buggiest multiplayer aaa mess i think i really have ever seen and all the positive ratings absolutely confuse me because i had the patience to try this game over and over only to constantly feel like i was always getting robbed npc s are not even remotely polished either considering i ve wasted hundreds of resources of caps and ammo and junk to have the npc not want to do the thing it s programmed to do like talk to another npc one or twice its a bethesda game over 5 or so times no that doesn t get to slide the quests are still an awful mess with some improvement here and there but overall it is still just horrible i ve tried one where i needed to get a certain bug part only for all the spawns to suddenly not want to give me said bugs anymore even in the area highlighted that the game wants you to go npc s are going to often bug out and not do anything or crash your game and force you to restart everything with all your resources lost to the wind because that s fair once or twice is a given ten is just a disaster the servers are still a jittering mess constantly jumping frames even on the most stable of computers you could have a titan and the game would run like garbage the optimization is a joke in this game no matter what you do your frames will stutter you will crash for no good reason and even freezing just the same there s no way to tell when it will happen it just happens it just works areas constantly do not remain consistent considering i had to fight a legendary 72 beast as a level 45 character while being surrounded by level 22 beasts because that s just how it should work right the quests will also give you the same treatment not letting you know what you re walking into they re about as consistent as the customizing your camp which for the life of me why is the part highlighting green if it still can t be placed weapons are also horribly inconsistent as well tip of advice carry a flamer everywhere considering its the only thing that actually keeps you safe other guns will vary on how they work for you or you could just go running around and tapping things in vats which doesn t remain consistent either i found myself carrying around a level 25 flamer because it was doing more damage for me than a minigun or 50 cal that was at my level that s not to mention you can literally buy caps for cash through a third party seller how fantastic is that right literally its 7 for 25 000 caps let that sink in everyone you can buy the strongest currency in the game and just undermine everyone else paying to win essentially this game is a joke still save every bit of your money and just walk away before you get sucked into this cult like enjoyment of grinding away that will ultimately mean nothing because level 1 timmy can just buy a years worth of caps for 7 this game is a blood pressure raiser and it s really nothing else at the moment and don t let everyone try to fool you into thinking its a brand new bethesda they fixed it they didn t it s still buggy and it s still a horrendous mess that has only had a few minor and major fixes out of the bazillion other issues update 2022 it s still a bit of a garbage game lmao you re better off getting it on a really good sale don t pay full price
