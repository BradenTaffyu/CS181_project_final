2015 early access review devs will never end this game s early access they are milking it to the maximum update few minor changes milk profit for a while as it becomes on the top of the recently updated steam front page then when player base decrease and sales number goes down they update another very minor change often from community mod to repeat their process by the way the way they post the changes it s ridiculous other game devs will literally laugh at them how the indiestone devs try to stretch simple patchnote into freaking 5 page essay game has a lot of good potential but no eta policy and indie project takes long time excuse they use for 4 years of development time makes me question the morality of the devs stay away at least until they finish it it s probably going to take about same time as duke nukem forever dev time difference is this devs are milking the game to the max while dnf bankrupted 3d realm
