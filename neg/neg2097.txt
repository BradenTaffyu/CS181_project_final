2020 used to be great now the rewards have been skimped down so much you ll feel like you re doing the hard grind even with premium add to this that the tank mode is so poorly balanced it s pretty much unplayable and i just can t recommend the game planes are fun but the tanks man you sit hull down behind some rocks and wait fifteen minutes for someone to be stupid you want to run and gun maybe you ll get a kill every 20 30 games if you re lucky sniping is war thunder boats i think they might get better but to grind out of the first tiers is too miserable for me to invest time into when the rest of the game is falling to crap just don t get into it the only thing that makes me reinstall every now and then is the sheer number of hours i already have in it it s some kind of sick obligation to piss myself off every few months until i get the balls to uninstall it again just save yourself the agony
