2019 my experience with rimworld is that the dev doesn t want to lose its a bit like playing d d with a dm that feels like they ve lost the game if they don t kill the player charactersthe enemies actively meta game against you and the update progressed has shown that it s intentional enemies constantly have a perfectly updated blueprint of your entire colony they will avoid turrets that are hidden inside buildings and use their silly meta power to blow holes through your walls in the perfect place to avoid any traps or turrets you might have you can t build embrasures because space people can t figure out how to build a defensive structure that would be silly you cant dig a trench or a moat cant lay down barbed wire cant build any form of sensor to detect incoming enemies even though they re programmed to react to exactly what you ve builtif you build into the side of a mountain to get some cover giant bugs will instantly appear without any warning and with enough numbers to fill entire rooms to the points of overflowingi guess you re expected to stand in a straight line across a field from your enemy and trade fire in a honorable fashion if you build your colony up with better weapons armor people you will simply be attacked by larger numbers of enemies even if it would be completely senseless to attack youa tribe of 15 people will send 40 attackers at you and then shrug it off when double their populace dies every 10 minuteswhen you attack enemy colonies they will never have the resources to actually support themselves which makes offense a net loss realism is only enforced if it makes the game difficult for the player there s a noticeable lack of realism for your enemiesthis game frustrates me to no end the enemies are obviously and unashamedly playing with a different set of rules while the devs try their best to hide ita bit like pissing into the wind but with the direction the updates have gone over the years i can t recommend this game
