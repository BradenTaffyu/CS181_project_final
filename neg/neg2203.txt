2015 games not balanced nor historically balanced so why go a unhistoric unbalanced path community is awful community manager falsely advertises packs with bad wording and contacting support does nothing but will forward message to devs its been almost a year now and nothing heard back feel scammed either bad net code or majority of the servers being in eu or ru allows for hit shots to not really hit game is very grindy unless you buy a t4 premium vehicle premium i said forget it for tanks the game has a lot of potential but theirs too many glaring issues such as balance to make it worth the time to play majority of new players wont see it untill they get a lot of hours in and i dont blame them i thought the game was amazing at first too this was years ago
