2019 early access review oh boy project zomboid tl dr the game is decent though it has some troubles give it a spin if you wish you may even enjoy yourself as i do on stream but i cannot recommend it in the current state to give a quick rundown on the premise it s a viral outbreak that turns everybody into zombies you somehow were spared in the first strike or managed to survive 6 months later depending on your starting scenario and now you need to survive it s all about survival and the game doesn t mess around with that being harsh and probably a pretty accurate portrayel as to how 99 of us would do if something like this were to happen you are gonna die a lot and probably also relatively quickly nevertheless let us get over the good things in this the gameplay features are all pretty functional looting building stealth and combat feel for the most part functional and there are little hiccups throughout the game there are some issues with all of those systems but that will be touched upon later in detail as for functionality they all work the difficulty is adjustable every aspect can be adjusted to your hearts content from loot distribution to enemy distribution as well as their general behaviour want more zombies around go ahead want them to be more aggressive faster able to smell you out easily all possible want to disable the zombification mechanic more on that later as well set it to your liking more experience gained in turn for the extra zombies you drop onto yourself sure this amount of customization is honestly great and allows you to get a gaming experience specifically tailored to your playstyle loot is distributed in a logical manner houses have most of everything with some tools some clothing containers but mostly food and water with functional plumbing for the first bit of time same with refridegeration that is if it isn t disabled already due to your settings then there s shops that contain things dedicated to said shop maybe you find a drugstore or some general goods hardware stores this makes hunting for certain items easier granted that you can deal with the zombies the first aid system is nicely designed wounds require you to either just patch them up depending on severity or if you have deep cuts or foreign objects lodged into you require certain tools to fix them permanently if you don t take care an infection is bound to happen which can quickly end your life not even the zombies are deadly but not enough medical care can also screw you over heavily the progression works nicely from getting around your first couple days to scrounge up all the equipment you can get to fortifying a location by barricading windows building extra wall segments or just covering up windows with sheets to allow for a sight blockage work takes it s time and each bit of extra defense feels like it a worthwhile investment if you know how to keep your head down the skill system is simple enough you gain skill points for gaining experience for all those actions you do running away sneaking around going on a murder spree or just leveling up the respective skills by performing them if you have a skill point available and a skill can be leveled up by performing it long enough you can advance opening up more options it works quite well for the game though in single player on survival i feel that the standard xp settings are too slow to allow for anything intricate to achieve unless you work your ass off which is not only quite difficult with all the zombies around but can become quite tideous on its own the vehicle system works pretty well you can dismantle vehicle parts install new ones and thus allow yourself to customize a vehicle frame to your hearts content at least for what your parts and skill allow driving attracts lots of attention though so beware the modability is great and the steam workshop integration works extremely well even with multiplayer which is where the game can truly shine the more the merrier in the apocalypse however with all things good there s also a lot of things that can be considered bad the zombification mechanic probably my biggest gripe in the entire game it s great that you can disable it but other than that it s more frustrating than enjoyable since you cannot play around it if you get scratched there s a 75 chance you got infected a bite is guaranteed what does that mean well you re toast simple as that you will die due to this and this makes it absurdly frustrating to deal with why is that there is no way to cure the zombification or at least halt it s progression to give you more time once you get bit you may as well restart because hell saves you time you most definitely won t be achieving anything great now anyways i d either recommend to set the zombification time to near instant or disable it alltogether the game can be difficult enough as is without this added benefit not just that but this problem with the system bleeds into its other systems namely the first aid mechanic what good does a first aid system do to you if 90 of the wounds you will recieve since zombies are the main source of damage taken unless you drop from great hights or end up in a car crash are lethal regardless of your first aid skill the system is gimped by the premise i ve decided to play without zombification for a while and noticed that the system works really damn well if not every wound you recieve is basically a glorified poison effect that cannot be removed and will kill you eventually scratches and bites hurt like hell and improper treatment can still end up killing you crippling you for the time being the content what s there is good but it just leaves you wanting more as there is as of right now too little to keep being invested into the game once you manage to survive the first troubling bit once you build up a semi decent base what s left to do explore the world is static meaning the towns position and layouts won t change as there s no random generation between towns the multiplayer has it s own pitfalls namely the delay and detection you constantly miss swings because of the lousy connectivity resulting in enemies closing the gap on you and managing to chow down on you which with the zombification in place basically means an instant game over before people jump the fence and say it s due to my connectivitiy i did ran several independant speed checks checked my routers port settings manually regardless of in a server or even in lan the connectivity is ass any other game seems to work fine the balancing is absolutely horrendous knives win you the game simple as that you can perform an instant kill move on zombies being in biting range with a knife for only a small portion of durability and since a hit is not connecting for as long as the animation is not finished you can stab your way through towns taking on small groups or even big hordes if you push them to seperate single quicker zombies this is due to the fact that the jaw stab animation is quicker meaning as long as you can single out any one zombie sometimes even more you can just kite big hordes and slowly wittle away at them blunt weapons also deal too little damage even when two handed to even remotely compete with knives just give it a try you ll be surprised looting can be bothersome if you wish to drag items into a container as can be the auto selected container depending on your viewpoint but this is minor for the most part as it stands i can t really recommend the game for it s content or balance yet it still is fun to just goof around in it i d suggest ironing out the most glaring issues before adding in more content but hey take it for what it s worth
