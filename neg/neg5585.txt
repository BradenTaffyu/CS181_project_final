2018 i have spent countless hours in rome 2 i love this game which makes what i m about to write all the more painful i never had a problem with the female general aspect seeing as i generally only play with rome or greek states i never really ran into female generals that didn t bother me i actually enjoyed being able to use the females in my family in politcs and diplomacy what pisses me off is twofold 1 ca abandoned their customers in order to virtue signal and feel better about themselves they chose to pander towards the most racist and sexist group on the internet the sjws just so they could show what good people they are if you don t believe me about the sexist and racist part just take a look at what happens to a woman or poc that doesn t share their viewpoints they are disgusting yet ca chose them over their customers 2 the response from ca is beyond disgusting they basically told their customers to go f ck themselves well you know what there are so many games out there to play i don t need to play total war anymore so i am done as long as modern world politics the very thing i play games to escape from is present in total war games i won t play or buy news ones dlc or anything else i am done until they apologise and remove this filth from their games i am gone don t recommend this game at all ca does not value you as a customer they d rather pander to the armpit of the internet get woke go broke
