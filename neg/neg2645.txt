2023 fun at first until you begin to level up without pouring in real money you will become cannon fodder game requires gold hard to earn cash gets burned with repairs and restocking ammo experience points super slow to gain and bonds each is needed to level up obtain equipment etc none of it should be necessary but cleverly designed to be confusing and restrictive for levelling up without pumping your money in i slugged my way up to a level v tank and i was excited to have some better equipment i was also immediately moved up to level vi players who have very large powerful and fast tanks all i can do is to hold back and try to help two hits and i am dead unless it s another smuck like me my shots with my best available ammo cost a lot more money takes 6 shots to kill needless to say i die a lot and early if you want to feed it non stop your money then you will have a good time otherwise you are the cannon fodder time to find a more balanced game i do not recommend this game update poured some money into the game and wow did i upgrade fast doesn t last as the game is purpose built to funnel money into the server fair enough i guess however as you go up the d bags grow in number you know those 14 yr patton want a be s do this do that i intentionally ignore their directions what becomes very interesting as you level up is the questionable players last two games today oct 24 2023 i ran into player that moved into the opening another tank and myself heavy 90cm gun high volatility shells 200 500 pts when hitting while buddy and the other tank went nose to nose shooting i placed 5 shells into his side no effect we went nose to nose next 4 more shells with the only effect was when i shot at his tracks only slowed him for a few seconds all said and done after i died he still had no damage a hack a jeannie app a purchased mod who knows who cares just more of the same old same old wot has no contact us though a lot of players do ask well i have another 20 days of perks purchased then time to move on and find a game worth playing i still do not reccomend
