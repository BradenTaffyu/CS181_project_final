2021 october 2022 update i am keeping my may 2021 update below as part of this review now that bannerlord has officially released what do we have i ve yet to play the multiplayer on official release but my expectations are that it will be dead after a few weeks and will only have been surged with life due to the official release we ll see the singleplayer has been clunked out to a pretty good spot but it still delivers what is a disappointing experience considering the amount of time since warband s release and warband s singleplayer in comparison yes bannerlord does some things better than warband and it has some interesting new mechanics but there are still things missing and some warband mods are able to compete with bannerlord s singleplayer for how much you can get out of them the singleplayer is missing development time in diplomacy and character interaction which should absolutely not be the case 12 years later post midgame in bannerlord is tedious repetitive unfun and i do not feel immersed in the world singleplayer could use more things to do way back in 2020 when the early release came out i was upset with how few quests character interactions and diplomacy options were in the singleplayer it has hardly improved i still cannot recommend bannerlord i think the singleplayer is fun to an extent but it does the bare minimum the gameplay is easily the best part where visuals audio and how the game feels come together well but it falls short in everything else that would classify it as a long lasting rpg or unique genre of its own as warband did may 2021 update i ve had some time to play recently and am updating my review i m still keeping my review at a no until more issues and bugs are addressed the game is on the right track but still needs lot of work before i can recommend it over warband the multiplayer is basically dead in north america i guess i just expect it to remain that way until they actually release some decent content in mp i don t understand where the gamemodes from warband fas went currently it seems like the only gamemode played is duel and the majority of players there s not many of them are outside of na playing this on a hard drive is practically impossible every menu stutters every time a character is loaded to interact with there s a lag and it seems like the game does no memory or item caching to load faster probably a quarter of your time is spent just waiting on things to load after using my ssd the sp is playable the tedium from waiting for menus and stutter loading is too much to normally bare performance other than anything to do with a harddrive has been greatly improved since a year ago battles are running at 60 fps for me everything looks great sound design is where it should be cpu and memory usage is average for a newer game gameplay feels right for a warband sequel i don t have any major gripes and if it paves the path for mods to do it right i don t mind native weapons or armor being a little oddball the amount of content in the sp is questionable i feel like i saw more armorsets that were interesting and unique in warband it s also annoying to me that all of the empire factions share the same type and color of unit meaning they re all carbon copies and the only difference is their shields when fighting in land battles where did the customized uniforms of warband go that could be shared between different factions but would color units based on their banner color it would fix the problem with the empire factions as they all use different shades i digress the singleplayer is enjoyable i still tend to notice game mechanics missing from warband and i don t see why they didn t add some warband dlc or fas mechanics into the campaign but maybe those are to come the sp is still missing some fleshed out content but overall it s about on par with warband s and assuming bannerlord is as easily moddable as warband we could see an extensive singleplayer collection much similar to how in warband i basically never played native there was always a mod that did things better tl dr multiplayer needs to be addressed singleplayer is good but not worth the long wait we had from warband please allow modding and more customization in mp and from creators in the community wait and hope bannerlord develops more
