2017 paid mods buggy unpatched engine and terrible writing thats bethesda but really though donations to modders is fine but paid mods are a horrid concept the engine isint really improved from skyrim and still has the same bugs the writing is poorly done and very linear the illusion of free choice is strong here but hey you can look down your iron sights so thats good i guess
