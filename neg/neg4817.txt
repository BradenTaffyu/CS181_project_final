2020 i have played this game enough to give my opinion on it not to tell you buy it or don t buy it but rather inform you what you are getting into this is by far the best presented total war game to date which is natural because we have come long way since the days of empire total war there is certainly a wow factor to it when you run it first the voice acting of some lords is impressive and makes them unique when you are about to start a new campaign which is shoulders above the previous games generic faction leaders and limited voice acting they had although some voice actors are pretty tasteless and straight up annoying on top of the melee and ranged units we had in previous games there is now magic in different lores and flavors which boils down to augments hexes wind and vortex and also lord and character abilities and loot items you can equip on your characters which make the engagements more dimensional but as developers come with newer ideas and implement them in newer faction and dlc units there is an increase to amount of micro being added to the battle which takes away from fluidity of the engagements and sometimes you will be overwhelmed with too much on your plate specially on large scale battles with many lords characters and unit with abilities and things can go out of hand this newer ideas getting into the game also causing balance issues as the new dlc content is superior to the older content for example a unit of zoats with heal and armor buff abilities going to obliterate most of the other 16 model monster infantry like crypt horrors underneath the amazing presentation that aims to impress in the first few hours there are deep flaws that surfaces as you continue to play this game and these are inherited sadly some from previous titles and some are new to warhammer there is only one single ai behavior underneath all the different flavored factions and they behave very same on the campaign map the biggest ones for me is that difficulty means rules for the player that ai does not have to play with for example no fog of war for the ai means it always knows everything about you your buildings your armies and their position the extent of your campaign line of sight and movement range it always stands in the fog of war on force march it will go around the map suffer various attrition just to attack that one single minor city without garrison you have on the other continent even though by fog of war rules the ai should not have that information the ai in this game will always avoid a fight with you and plays the cat and mouse game unless it has numerical advantage the ai does not have any sense of self preservation it will keep running and leave it cities undefended and after you have taken the last city then it comes and suicides by throwing everything hopelessly at you which by that point is too late there are many weird choices the ai makes that make you dislike playing this game against it for example in the face of chaos invasion which is very pathetic even on legendary the ai often rushes to colonize razed cities regardless of the climate suitability and the present danger of the chaos stacks the normal difficulty which many people play and start on is extremely boring and easy you will roflstump and steamroll the entire campaign map just by auto resolving a few battles but on the other hand as soon you go to a higher difficulty the ai suddenly starts getting cheats that sometimes makes you wonder why do i even bother for example it does not build any growth buildings but it cities will always grow faster than your cities even though you build growth buildings which leads to them having higher tier units than you it takes a city in an unsuitable climate and leaves it undefended with public order in green while you are forced to manage public order or spread your faction corruption and build various buildings before you can leave it unattended or face strong rebellion stacks that just pops out of nowhere and starts raiding you you will often have multiple regions and barely one solid stack while a single city minor faction fields 3 stacks by background income alone and around the campaign map on force march playing cat and mouse trying to sack your undefended cities which you will definitely due to campaign map design the vast distances and many enemies that declare war like domino and too many angles of approach that makes you feel like you are being attacked by a pack hyenas all the time some regions are tightly packed and some regions are wide and takes couple of turns to go around them and any turn wasted not fighting is a loss and also tedious beside all the micro balance issue in this game there is also a macro balance problem result of those micro ones for example the diplomacy is broken ai often trespass all over your borders and as soon as you trespass one of them a lot of them start hating you due to a red negative modifier which this in result gives them a mutual green positive modifier to ally together and gang against you every single campaign ad soon as chaos comes everybody gets this green modifier because of common enemies and leads to massive alliances of order factions which are dwarfs empire highelfs brettonia and lizards which rampantly confederate with their underdog personality faction races and make alliances and if you are a single doom faction they will all declare war on you and it boils down to fighting endless stacks every turn until you get bored of repetitions and dread it for all the wrongs reasons and quit your campaign this has been happening pretty much everytime i played a bad guy faction beside the insults and childlike hatred i had to endure at diplomacy so yeah i think this game has great presentation and ideas we have come a long way in total war franchise but we still have a long way to go this game often is annoying and tedious which makes those fun moments forgettable the ai is an annoying cheater a bully and a coward bi ch at the same time you will spend many hours playing against this personality because this game has one ai personality with many different tags and colors and not many different factions with different personalities
