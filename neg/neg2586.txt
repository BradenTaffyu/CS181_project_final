2022 i am not the type of person to usually leave reviews on games i play i have done about 2 for a joke but after what just happened to me i feel like i am left with no choice but to warn the rest of the steam community before making the worst purchase of their lives you have to understand i have played over 100 hours of the game at this point and the gameplay enjoyability is not the problem this game is completely broken it s been out for years now and the devs have yet to fix the overwhelming amount of game breaking bugs ruining the experience to give you some perspective a few months back i was playing the game and started to get really into it and high leveled then one day out of the blue my save game got randomly corrupted the game didn t even attempt to revert to a previous save and just deleted the entire save folder on its own then the game saved the newly deleted save folder to the steam cloud all this happened without my input whatsoever it just occurred instantly and hours of progress were gone in seconds i felt completely demoralized and disheartened a few days went by while constantly considering downloading cheats so i can get back all my progress artificially or just uninstall the game and move on to something new in the end i decided to just start fresh and regain my progress the old fashioned way this was because i really did and probably still do enjoy the game content a lot after a boat load of effort and many more hours spent trying to rebuild i finally got back to the point i was at when the game killed my save folder i even got maybe three times more progressed than i was with an even higher level and stats i felt very achieved and accomplished at this point and i was extremely happy to have regained my progress despite the fact that i wasn t supposed to lose it in the first place after reading all this you might think why did i write this negative review then well the story does not end here the time came for me to upgrade my pc and i did so i completely wiped my system as i ironically wanted to start fresh with everything just like i had to start fresh in cotw after everything was set up and a few weeks went by i decided to download cotw again to get back into it as you might have predicted at this point the save files weren t stored on the cloud and i lost all my progress again i have tried all day to find a fix to this problem i have consulted with online forums and experienced friends but nothing has worked i realize that nothing will probably work because the fact is plain this game is a broken mess made by a bunch of lazy leaches vomiting up spaghetti code and calling it a modern game of course i understand that this isn t a triple a tittle made by some mega corporation consisting of thousands of professional employees but the game has been out for more than 5 years and at this point you would at least expect working save files i guess that s just too much to expect from modern development this is the end of the review and my final consensus is don t buy this although a semisolid gaming experience to pay that steep of a price dlc only to lose hours of work is not worth it signing off you guys have a good night peace
