2020 honestly i will keep playing fallout 76 but should you buy it for 35 god no the majority of people defending this game are an incredibly toxic clique they depend and fall upon each other and assume so many things about this game without actually attempting to be anywhere near critical of the game this game is still flooded with enough bugs that even mose s plague pales when they are compared there are trash mobs that are more deadly than deathclaws levels are just measurements of how many bullets the enemy will sponge before you can actually kill it the npcs are as lifeless as anything else with the same rusty lines thrown ontop to make the world feel more alive than it really is fortune favours the shills and those that spend 15 a month are given an advantage forking through your scrap to figure out what you need more of is a pain in the arse weapons break far too quickly and sometimes they will break mid fight the meta slaughters any immersion that you might have once hoped to gain from this game people jumping around like kangaroos on speed with very specifically tailored weapons and armour to ensure that despite their tiny health pool they hit like a truck on roids power armour is effectively shooting yourself in the foot as legendary gear is just superior in everywhere and you can t get legendary power armour tl dr fanboys hype this game without critique and are more toxic than the trolls if the game launched like this it would still have been absolutely slammed by the media and consumers wastelanders is basically a cherry ontop of a pile of dung microtransactions playability and enjoyability p sflying radscorpions are scary update because apparently i should revise my review things that have changed more aggressive monetization an even more toxic fanbase specifically reddit and it is spreading a lack of awareness of the game s actual problems constant dupes exploits and breaks with the server that negatively impact the game for all users honestly everyone keeps on forgiving bethesda keeps on saying that everything they re doing is fine that all these additions are just cosmetic they re not there is a substantial amount of qol improvements locked behind a paywall and that paywall is getting bigger as they take away the ability for you to freely earn atoms it will take over 40 weeks to unlock everything with gold bullions the game doesn t care about progression it cares about player retention it cares about getting you closer to shelling out your wallet rather than providing a positive experience everyone that says i have countless hours in this game and never encountered a bug is lying out their arse and shelling out to protect a company that doesn t care about them i am lucky if i don t encounter at least one major bug in each gameplay session only today immortal enemies a legendary scorched beast stuck inside a tree disappearing loot yes this and disappearing power armour is still a thing bethesda needs to wake up and the community needs to stop on people that critique the game stop being elitist stop being toxic if you want actual information about the game look up joseph anderson vs fallout 76 so many of those bugs are still here because bethesda refuse to update the engine or change it bethesda s laziest title to date to quote pete hines enjoy your disappointment
