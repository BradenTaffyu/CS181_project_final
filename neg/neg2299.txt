2017 in short decent truck simulation but only very shallow game this game could be so much more too bad the developers settled with the game as it is because it is already hugely successful this game really badly needs some competition the good the trucks are nicely detailed driving model is ok there is fair amount of them as developers keep adding new ones although at a very slow pace hardly 1 truck a year the map is great it s huge and getting bigger and more detailed over time with paid dlcs fair amount of trailers that s basicaly all these 3 aspects are enough to make this a top trucking game of today because like i said there is zero competition now the bad the game itself is extremelly shallow in single player there are no goals no late game absolutely nothing to do except for driving around ofc you get ingame money for that but there is very little to spend them on you can start and expand a company by buying garages and drivers but again there is no real reason for you to do that no rewards no in game competition no leader boards no goals at all nothing there are simply no challenges but there easily could be the simulation part is not very deep the trucks brake way too easily even with 40 tons loads you can flip a trailer in a turn but thats it forget about having to worry about stuff like your trailer sliding to the side in a turn that doesnt happen in this game the trailer weight doesnt affect controls of the truck like in reality at all also forget about advanced stuff like interactive cabin and truck systems the cabins are nice but you can t switch or do anything in them apart from turning the wheel the damage model is a complete joke there is zero visual damage to the truck and even the virtual damage is a complete arcade joke i kind of understand why we can t have an detailed visual crash model but not even stuff like flat tires in 2018 even ancient games from the 90ties had at least textures of scratches on the 3d model or something and ofc there is not even slight hint of truck maintenance in this truck simulator there is no difference between hitting a concete column and a small bush traffic signs small gate rails bushes almost everything is solid concrete in this simulator game the map is huge and fairly detailed but there is no police no events constructions traffic jams etc or anything dynamic whatsoever this game used to be difficult at times but recently they added quick save and auto save absolutely removing any challenges left to this game this game is marketed at steam as massively multiplayer this is a huge lie this game has no multiplayer at all there is an alpha version multiplayer mod which is unofficial unsuported by the developer made by someone in his spare time and it shows just an example we had to wait 1 4 of a year for them to update the multiplayer version of ats and you cannot complain about this to anyone because remmember this a free alpha unsuported mod the multiplayer itself cannot be more primitive everyone is on one big map no rules no leaderboards no goals zero traffic trolls and hackers everywhere and no customer support ofc and yet scs dares to market this as multiplayer game this is outrageous to me because the people making the mod are not getting any kind of support from scs yet their multiplayer mod undoubtedly helps scs sell this game so if you are planning to buy this game to play online think again this is game made for sp to sum it up this is a decent truck driving game but calling it a simulation is a bit of a strech only buy it if you enjoy just driving trucks around for no reason i personally consider this game highly overrated mostly due to lack of competition i rate this game 6 10
