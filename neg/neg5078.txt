2016 let me start off by saying that despite my negative recommendation i did enjoy this game it was incredibly fun to play testing the few playable factions was a blast i certainly enjoyed playing as the vampire counts the most the game map is very well designed albeit a bit barren the farther away you get from the center and the ai aren t quite as dumb as they were in previous games their intelligence is still lacking yes but diplomacy has improved slightly and enemy armies fight semi intelligently the different unit types like vargheists and the hero units like karl franz do add a lot of pizazz it definitely makes it a lot more interesting than giant jumbles of soldiers clashing into each other in no organized manner i m looking at you total war rome 2 epic heroes or behemoth monsters can turn the tides of battle and the new magic mechanic can too here s where the negative recommendation comes in sega and creative assembly have continued to betray us by leaving out content that should ve been included in the vanilla game or otherwise added in one or two twenty dollar dlcs they expect us to pay for small individual tidbits and doodads just like in atilla and rome 2 the most essential antagonists in the game the chaos warbands aren t even playable unless you pay up an extra eight dollars gore costs money again and now they re even charging us for new heroes what ever happened to the integrity of developers and publishers i almost feel a little guilty writing this review without having experienced the dlc first but that s just it i shouldn t need to feel guilty because that content should be included in the game already or be far cheaper at the very least as fun as it is for a little while you eventually realize how unfinished and empty it is as most recent total war titles are i m ashamed of ca and sega even moreso because i m a huge warhammer universe fan and i feel like they ve slapped me in the face again except even harder this time because they want me to pay extra for some of my favorite races the core game lore is rich of course but you don t even get to experience all of it unless you pay an extra 45 and i m sure they re going to release more content that you have to pay for you re payingi 16 of those dollars on hero units that s ridiculous edit i don t know why people think it s a good idea to be toxic when criticizing reviews unless you re willing to provide valid criticisms without being demeaning i recommend you just hit the thumbs down button to save us both the trouble
