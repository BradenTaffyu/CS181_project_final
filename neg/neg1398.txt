2020 product received for free early access review multiplayer review the mp is far less polished than mount blade warband it s clear that the developers didn t really put much thought into that which is mostly what i m interested in the combat is an overcooked mess and not even good and the class system is designed against players fun they didn t take inspiration from warband they just made a completely different game i played warband competitively for years and they didn t even bother making a scene for us in bannerlord removed our main competitive gamemode battle and replaced it with skirmish which is honestly boring they won t even let us choose our own equipment anymore now they have pre made classes with perks instead of actual reasonable economy management they went from being medieval cs go to being medieval overwatch the main competitive gamemode feels like team deathmatch this game is a step back from warband even the graphics look dated they stayed a bit too long in closed development i m not saying the game is unredeemable but if you re looking for a competitive experience for multiplayer i can t recommend it positives seems to be a good engine for mod development so hopefully there ll be battle and free equipment choices soon crpg or mercenaries would take off in this gamesingleplayer it s better than multiplayer but it s not good feels like a completely different game from the multiplayer who d have known we have these sick capes and cool equipment we could customize our character with when we re locked to absolutely no customization in multiplayer i played m b warband for years ok years i m well invested in the scene and i played at the only taleworlds lan literally all the competitive warband players i approach think negatively of the state of combat currently update the game is still bad
