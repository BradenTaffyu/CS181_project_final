2019 early access review chalk this up as another game on the very long list of once great games that have slowly been ruined by the developers this game used to be fun it used to be in depth it used to be well balanced it used to be a lot of things that it no longer is you used to level up skills by doing that particular thing mining would make you better at mining cooking would make you better at cooking etc now all progression is locked behind a dumbed down half baked perk system guns used to be made using individual parts that you had to find that all had their own levels which the overall level of your parts would determine the final effectiveness of the gun with low level parts making a gun that was borderline useless and the incredibly rare high level parts making guns that were amazing now that s been changed to just straight making a gun from scratch literally just take some basic resources and viola you somehow magically have an ak 47 with all guns having the exact same stats the aiming used to be good now it seems completely random with whether or not you actually hit the person you re aiming at essentially just being a roll of the dice they made it so that aiming down sights on a gun drains your stamina because that makes complete sense right it takes sooooooooo much effort to look down a sight which essentially makes it impossible to play the game as a sneaky character the newer updates have added literal dozens of borderline gamebreaking bugs that still haven t been fixed head glitching glitching outside of map boundaries seeing through objects invoking server desync in order to essentially instantly kill an opponent from saftey zombies and players clipping through terrain and objects getting in vehicles completely breaking your inventory etc keep in mind this is a game that has been in development for 6 years there is absolutely no excuse for bugs this bad being in the game in such a late stage of development especially when they weren t even in the game until 1 or 2 updates ago when the devs decided for seemingly no reason to massively change the entire game they added vehicles which oh boy don t even get me started on the sheer amount of abuses that they allow for you used to be able to loot items from zombies you killed that got removed for seemingly no reason the optimization was already bad even for alpha standards and the latest update made it even worse good luck getting above 50 fps without a veritable super computer so to sum this all up the game used to be fantastic but the devs stopped listening to the community made massive changes that nobody asked for nobody wanted and nobody likes and now the game is a shell of it s former self can i recommend this game in it s current state no absolutely 100 no maybe buy it during the upcoming summer sale if it goes down to 5 or so and then revert it back to alpha update 15 or 16 but anything beyond that is a hard no the devs need to stop being morons revert the changes they ve made that literally everyone universally hates start listening to the community and stop trying to change the game into something it isn t you had a good game people loved it if it ain t broke don t fix it
