2018 you may be able to have fun with this game at its current state but it seems to be certain that the fun won t last forever i loved the game in its first iterations and after the first forced overhaul i couldn t get myself to play it anymore because it was a different game this second overhaul is not as bad but again it is forced and completely changes the game i would have loved the option to play the game differently or with some of the new features don t buy it if you want to be able to enjoy this u game as it is for a long time buy it if you want an ever changing game where you never know what might happen to it
