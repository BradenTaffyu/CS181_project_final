2019 this is not the fallout game you re looking for hard to believe it but the hype exemplified by an absolute wall of let s go pal comments during the twitch reveal stream all those years ago doesn t match the game we got in the end it s important first to establish that this really is not the fallout game you were most likely looking for for starters it s absolutely not an rpg bethesda have opted for a very open ended progression system where the player isn t tied down to one particular skill set there s power creep galore because it s incredibly easy to level up and because of the lack of a hard level cap you can basically collect every single perk and max out your attributes skill checks are gone for those same reasons your choices don t matter whatsoever because the quests both main and side are surprisingly linear and offer no differentiation part of the reasoning for this is completely absurd you only get four dialogue options at any one time and perhaps more insultingly these are usually confined to some variant of yes no tell me more and persuade the character customisation options a staple of any rpg are deeper this time around and your character even speaks instead of being a mute their whole life but the lacking dialogue simply ruins this novelty completely it doesn t end there there are other frustrating aspects to the game one of the game s factional plot lines revolves around you being the leader of the minutemen a militia interested in the defence of the common man there s just one problem with this you re asked to babysit every single settlement that you take under your wing so much so that it s now become a common meme there s no interface for sending a squad of minutemen to a location to defend it the game just wants you to either defend every one of the settlements yourself or beef up their security systems making the whole exercise feel like you really don t command speaking of plot lines all the quests are utterly boring and the characters poorly written i actually can t think of a memorable quest not in 30 hours of play time on steam nor in another 30 on my console i suppose there is the museum of witchcraft with the game s solitary moment of horror but even that was an opportunistic set piece that s got nothing to do with any quest one of the game s main features is settlement building though why bethesda headed in this direction i have no idea i mean it s kinda fun at first i suppose being able to plug together different pieces of walls and roofs and sticking some ornaments all over them to add to the aesthetic beauty but it s ultimately a chore as you have to go foraging for vast amounts of materials in the first place in order to build this crap i just can t see what it s added to the game and more to the point i can t see why the developers spent so much time and resources on implementing it when the previous method of purchasing existing properties which you could modify was satisfying enough there are pros they just don t come anywhere near to cancelling out the cons gunplay is faster and more tactical since the ai has been vastly improved from the utterly stupid enemies in previous games i e they use cover and no longer slowly walk at you firing away plus the display of firepower is deeper with a ton of customisation options for weapons even without the aid of mods combat is difficult at first in large part because the game won t hold your hand if you walk into an area full of higher level enemies but because of the aforementioned power creep there comes a threshold where you will end up trouncing anything and everything the game throws at you right at the start for instance the game gives you a suit of power armour and a minigun power armour oh boy it s actual power armour this time as in not only do you need a means of energy to keep them fuelled up fusion cores but it actually feels like you re wearing an exo skeleton sound design and all the first time you step into one it will feel pretty epic but bethesda even managed to up here as well see power armour suddenly doesn t require any brotherhood training and consequently everyone and their mother can step into a top of the line sweet as cherry pie t 45 they re dotted around the world in numbers either being worn by npcs or abandoned so they lose their lustre very quickly indeed it s also unfortunately another part of the power creep since once you step into one you just won t die unless you kill yourself or otherwise act stupid it s sad to see this is the fallout we got wide as an ocean but deep as a swimming pool
