2017 i want to love this game i really do but civ v is just so much better it isn t the cartoony graphics its the cartoony engine the city state functionality isn t great as they are more fickle than ever for less obvious reasons the condemnations are free flowing for idiotic reasons and ai is not really that great buy civ vi if you want to complete your collection or get all the civ chievos but otherwise you re better off with the civ v plus dlcs and at a much lower price 4 5 10 as a game at any price seen so far i paid 20 for game dlc 2 10 at 60 plus 29 for the dlcs
