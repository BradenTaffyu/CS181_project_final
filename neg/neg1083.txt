2017 after having many hours on this game why am i giving it a negative review well i thought about it for some time and finally came to the conclusion when i review it i should review the game and what the developers sell for the game i shouldn t give bethesda credit in my review for all the hard work of modders something bethesda clearly have no concerns taking advantage of no i can t reccomend this game it completely lacks passion and love it hits all the most basic tickboxes to be a fallout game except for a few issues beyond hitting the most basic expections it offers nothing else simple basic quests basic perks basic amount of weapons basic endings and interactions it feels like the bare mininmum was done and then that was it we need to make a fallout game a i guess do these things then sell it modders fix this game i don t mean improve it literally fix the game so it works bethesda didn t feel like making the animations for the lever action rifle work properly modders fixed it and went beyond bugs crashes texture issues get the unofficial patch that modders made to fix the game for them every home boarded up because they couldn t be bothered to make the world feel like a real world mods fix that the fact bethesda need modders to make their games sell is bad enough taking advantage of those modders with the new creation club with a poor deal is just outright sickening i ve never seen a company go from they re okay to konami levels of incompetence so quickly in around 2 3 years bethesda went from decent to a publisher you ll want to actively avoid in the future buy it on sale leave a negative review then say thank you to the modding community for fixing the game for bethesda that s up to you of course but lets be honest that s why we all love these games modding
