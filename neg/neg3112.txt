2022 no matter how much i like the game i will write a negative review there is a system of oppression in the game and if you fall under its influence no matter how well you play your projectiles will not penetrate strongholds teammates will simply die quickly and statistics will tend to 0 on ships this system exists in wot and is an extremely negative element now it is in this game and the only way to turn it off is to invest real money also the recent update to economic bonuses actually reduces earnings for almost 70 of players because it s aimed at skill players everyone else seems to have to invest more money now the last thing i want to say is censorship it is everywhere especially on the forum any negative thoughts and words are prohibited by default for this there is a rubber article an insult to the moderator if my account is blocked after this review then i will not even be surprised
