2022 this game kind of sucks man the biggest problem for me is the voice acting and writing is so terrible it pains me and i can especially say this because no matter what i tried i couldn t get the voice dialogue audio slider to work and this is a problem i ve seen others complain about too and most can fix it by just setting it to 1 instead of 0 but that still made no change for me mine was 100 volume no matter what i did for 140 hours i have had to hear the mexican characters in the game the very few the game actually has speak 3 words of english then throw in a random spanish word in every sentence it is so damn corny it makes me believe everyone that was in charge of the writing and dialogue for this game only speaks 1 language because no bilingual person in existence speaks by throwing in words from a different language in the middle of their sentences this alone has ruined the experience for me because of how unbelievably out of touch it feels and almost racist with some of the stereotypes that are thrown in at times now i wouldn t complain about this so much if the volume slider for the voice lines actually worked like it was supposed to but i digressnow beyond the horrific dumpster fire that is the game s voice acting and writing there are many other issues with the game that i never experienced once in forza horizon 4 which i have at least double the amount of time playing some other examples of issues i ve experienced in only 140 hours of gameplay online matchmaking very often would have issues pulling me in i would sit around waiting for the queue and it would say that it s pulling me into a game and it was really a 50 50 on if i would actually end up in the session or not multiple times have i completed a seasonal events challenges and not received the rewards for it such as super wheelspins cars as rewards etc because of this i never tried to finish an entire series 4 seasons or complete more than 2 seasons in their entirety there is 1 barn find in my game that is completely glitched and constantly resets its progress every other barn find was completed within 1 3 days but the last barn find i have in the game has had its progress reset over and over and after well over 3 months of playing the game it has not progressed any further of course i can pay to have the restoration completed for 45 000 000 credits but that is an unbelievable amount of in game currency for something that i m supposed to get for free i was intending on trying to get 100 of the achievements in this game but because of this bug i ll never be able to get the last barn find and get the achievement for completing all of them speaking of achievements there has been multiple times that i unlocked an achievement much before it was actually completed as an example i unlocked the achievement for driving all roads in the game when i still had about 10 more to complete a lot of these issues are things that should ve been noticed during original playtesting and never should ve made it to the public these are things i never once experienced in 4 and it really feels like this game could ve used just another 6 months of polish before its release now if i wanted to be really picky here are some other issues i feel were overlooked that i ve noticed in my playtime while you re in menus you can t press up at the top of the menu to go to the very bottom and vise versa there are many many instances in this game where you have to press down or up 20 times instead of pressing it once to end up on the opposite end of the menu or you let go of your controller to use your mouse to click on something this should never be a problem in any video game nowadays every single leaderboard in the game is entirely filled with cheaters the forza devs will find time to fix and nerf legitimate methods people use for xp and credit farming and will fix any fun glitches that people find but they can t clear the leaderboards of people cheating and going 500 000 miles per hour also cheats that have existed since day 0 still work perfectly and it doesn t seem like anyone has ever been banned for cheating either this makes where their priorities lie very transparent this one is very picky i will admit but there s easily 100 trees and objects i saw in game that were floating off the ground they use the same models copy and pasted throughout many parts of the map that don t work on the terrain that they re being placed on so many times trees are just completely floating in the air i ve seen xp boards floating i ve seen plants and bushes floating buildings etc i understand how crunched the devs probably were during the development of this game though so this is a very small thing but it really shows the lack of polish this game had before release even though i do have a lot of playtime in this game i don t believe it was worth the full 60 i paid for it especially when it s on xbox game pass and you can basically get all the enjoyment out of this game in a 1 month subscription and get plenty of other games to enjoy once your interest in this game drops off like a cliff as it did for me many months ago overall this game is a 3 10 when you re using your brain a 6 10 if you have no brain inside your head and perform no critical thinking while you re playing it and 9 10 when you re extremely drunk
