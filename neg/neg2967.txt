2016 stellaris gives a great initial impression only to let down later on the beginning is great with exploration and little story missions scattered around upgrading your starting planet and first few colonies is fun and discovering unknown aliens is exciting and then the ui strikes when you get over 5 planets you have to put any over that into an ai controlled sector the ai does what ais usually do strange things buggy things and you can t intervene you can build star ports in a sector but they don t show up in the overview ui so you have to click through each of soon dozens of planets to build ships strategic ressources in a sector you can t access them a primitive civilisation in a sector can t control your empires behaviour towards them even though in the official stellaris stream a month ago that was classified as a bug its still in the live version of the game want to find a good colony target click through each solar system as there is no planet overview want to wage war hover over every enemy fleet icon as there is no difference shown between an enemy doomstack and a harmless enemy science ship speaking of doomstacks the bigger fleet wins best strategy place all your warships in one single fleet and immediatly go for the enemy homeworld a single battle usually decides a war if there is war most of the time the ai does nothing they ll form huge federations and alliances and then do nothing the mid game consists of waiting as there is nothing happening unless you initiate a war yourself and the spoiler alert vaunted end game crisis there are 3 of them all 3 function very similar and one of them is bugged so you can never win anyway worst of all is that most mechanics either have ui issues horrible to control or are implemented poorly sectors even though there aren t that many features in it its a very light weight 4x 2 victory conditions conquest or control a certain amount of planets and the famous grand strategy aspect of paradox games never appears after one play through you ve seen everything there is and each subsequent game plays mostly the same and lastly the options menu of the game is a joke there are almost no graphic options no gameplay options can t even change the scrolling speed which is too fast when zoomed out and almost no options to customize yout starting galaxy maybe it will improve with patches currently i wouldn t recommend it it feels rushed and has a serious lack of polish poland can t into space
