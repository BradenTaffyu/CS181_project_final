2023 played this game a ton and had to witness the studio to get progressively more greedy the monetization plans to get more predatory and the development disattach from what the players want i stopped because they ultimately made me feel like cattle that they could milk for more and more money i dont mind to spend money on a free to play game i play lol since season 2 and bought tons of but they really overdid it it is to this day the only game i know where you get punished for playing without premium and you lose resources you dont even have to play badly you can even win but you will lose resources if you dont pay for it all in all incredibly sad as i enjoyed the game for historical reasons and the gameplay was pretty ok in eu before they get their sh t together i would not recommend this game unless you are an absolute mega whale npc
