2023 tldr if you like the following eating broken glass taking your ex wife s mother out for dinner take comfort in dissapointment then i highly recommend buying this game long version i would have to preface this by saying i have well over 3000 hours in the coh series i really enjoyed them but this release has so many issues and so many deep rooted problems it is an insult to the series 1 graphicsthe graphics are passable i regret the choices they made in regards to fully destructible enviroments but the game was released with many problems in regards to its graphics issues that should have been cought in alpha testing airplanes were metal silver cigars the animations that some of the planes were doing were outright wrong or just downright comedic a stuka bomb dropping down felt like a pinata coming down there was no oomph at all the infantry units sometimes hold weapons to their feet all these things are graphical in nature but overall the atmosphere this game breathes is honestly cartoonish and not gritty i prefer coh2 graphics over this one i dare to say coh2 might look just better because it has a more gritty approach to things now it just feels like american gi on mediteranian cruise gameplaythe gameplay has a lot of potential but sadly it is mired in many issuess that again show a depressing theme for this game s release its absolute lack of polish or beta testing from pathfinding being horrendous to simple bugs making entire game plans useless to list them tanks cannot drive well at all they are slow and even after 3 patches it is still a crime to try and use medium tanks throwing satchels in specific ways on infantry means the bag will get glued to the unit and outright kill them line of sight barely works as intended there are situations where someone is standing 2 pixels higher than my infantry gaining the advantage of height and seeing my units get slammed for lack of a better word the german faction just outright sucks the units they get are all early war and mid war while the allies get easy eights black princes and a wide variety of tanks the current meta is swamped with light tank spam and the germans have no viable counter to it marders barely work due to the way the turning and aiming works the developers my biggest issue is with the development team the outright disconnect between what they are doing and projecting to what are genuine concerns is painful i miss the old relic with bugoo and where it felt like we were listened to when 1 2 was released they buffed the air strafe and when i told the developers how this would ruin the multiplayer i was told that they had faith in the development team ad i had to wait 3 weeks to see how things pan out after 2 days of having as streak of losses a hotfix was released to address an issue that was flagged even before the buff on top of that all we read is how great the team is working but the balance in the game is nowhere to be found it isn t fun playing germans and we are locked into one commander i sincerly hope relic can right the ship but at this point with the developers being scaled down i worry that we might end up with this being the lat product relic releases and i find that very disturbing maybe in a year with 2 expansions the game will be better but honerstly for me this game is a hard no for anyone interested in new games i have played an additional 103 hours and witnessed the updates and the revision is as follows the game has been improved in some ways normally i would laud it but 70 of what they fixed should have been there on release there is no excuse pathfinding is still broken period this after 3 patches to improve it the balance in this game is honestly offensive relic is not testing a single thing they release the latest expansion basically added a massive desynch bug which can happen but to see the artillery the germans get plaster the allies into liquid tommy isn t funny and it is a blatant oversight in the end the game is company of heroes 0 4 if relic continues with patches and listens more closer to the community there is a game to be found sadly however a year later almost and so many things that feel not finished i don t know what else to say i only play this game with a friend but the inbalance isn t fun for axis or allies
