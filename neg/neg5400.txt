2023 i expect this honest review to be hidden or deleted by relic because thats what they have been doing to raise their games score but this game is really a 15 20 liked game if i ever seen one i could go on about everything wrong with the game but i wont for a few reasons 1 they wont fix any of it because they don t care the modern relic we have now is not the relic of 20 years ago this relic has a history of taking the money and running they knew a month ago during the beta that this game was at earliest a year or 2 away from a minimum viable product state but they decided to pushed it out anyway after it had already been delayed once for 3 months which in no world or universe was enough time to fix the alphas problems or even finish adding missing features and content people have been clogging relics forums and discord with bug reports begging for simple fixes and more critical fixes and we have gotten crickets even relic stopped interacting with the community in the discord a week after launch no communication the rate of patches slowed down even when we do get them their is nothing of substence in said patches in regards to bugfixing or balance infact with what they have done so far balance wise it shows a glaring fundamental lack of understanding on what is going on in their game or what needs to be done at even the most basic of levels 2 the 2nd reason i wont post a full review is because the steam review has a character limit and it is not possible to actually list everything wrong with this game in detail if you can imagine a problem its in coh3 from broken animations sounds visuals textures features missing features features that are there on paper but dont work incomplete models and units that are missing weapons im not kidding no ability to spectate no replay feature no ability to keep playing after the match is over you cant even repair your hq if it gets destroyed by an arty barrage or something youre just sol zero balance of any kind flamethrowers murdering everything with ease and in desprate need of a 25 damage nerf minimum mortars being near useless and taking 7 9 hits to kill a infantry squad this isnt hyperbole i wish it was horrible tech pathing and research paywalls on some factions while other factions can just pick commanders and call in offmap units and dont have to spend a penny on teching up so they just bury you alive with cheap offmap callins and the resource savings they had from not teching up 3 relic straight up lied to the community about what modders wanted lied that they would have mod support they dont have mod support they have a half working archive viewer thats even more limited than coh2s tools which themselves were already a source of incredible disdain and strife from the community because of how restricted those tools were coh3s mod tools by comparison make coh2s already bad tools look like a functional divine gift from god 4 finally i wont be posting a review in detail on why this game is trash and you should avoid it because i simply dont have the energy to yes everything you are seeing is the short version wrap your head around that god this game is horrible which is a crying shame because the setting is something fresh and fun for once its not just soviets or normandy again ugh im so sick of those but thankfully this games setting is something fresh and cool or it would of been if relic didnt make it because ontop of all the game ending bugs and lack of features on the short list above we have a game about africa and italy without an italian army xd whats next relic a vietnam game without the vietnamese a korean war game without koreans maybe a pacific game without japan tldr stay far away from this game unwatchlist it and abandon the series studio this game got the dawn of war 3 septic tank fire treatment yes septic tank fire because its worse than a dumpster fire i got this game for free as a gift and i wish i could return it im upset the person who bought it for me payed money for it let that sink in for a second i got it for free and i regret getting it for free thats how apocalyptically terrible thie game is i would never recommend anyone pay any amount of money for this game maybe 1 on humble bundle as a joke to troll a friend but thats about it and only if you didnt want to buy a candy bar or something with that 1 ya know all things considered its really sad how bad this game turned out because i loved coh1 and even grew to like coh2 over the years after many patches but this game will never be good for 2 simple reasons 1 its dna isnt salvageable and 2 modern relic those are the reasons why this game cant and wont be saved rip coh series and after seeing what its become of the studio good riddance relic
