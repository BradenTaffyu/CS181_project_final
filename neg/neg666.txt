2023 i want steam to have a 3rd option for neutral reviews but this is the next best thing to say how i feel about sts so to start i don t particularly dislike the game and as a matter of fact i love deck building and i love rogue likes so i would ve imagined this game being a dream come true however for all the nearly 300 hours of time i spent playing i didn t really have as good of a time as i would ve expected despite me loving deck builders doesn t really mean i m particularly good at them so this game expects you to bring your very best knowledge of building a deck as you go along through a run as well as relics and other things so going off of that and my lack of skill when it comes to card games i ve only ever won about roughly 30 runs out of over 1000 which is clearly an abysmal winrate i am not 100 blaming the game for this obviously but it goes to show it is extremely punishing when making mistakes or by favoring a certain playstyle which goes against the grain of what this game expects all in all this review is mostly me complaining about my severe issue in skill but overall the game is a solid game for deck building and nails roguelike elements in such a nice way which is why i ended up playing so much despite losing over and over i just would ve liked if there was a little less rng involved in card draw during a fight or when picking new cards for people that like the challenge this offers then i would wholeheartedly recommend it despite my own personal problems with playing maybe it s just not for me since it does get frustrating after a while of trying different things and i still can t win against most scenarios
