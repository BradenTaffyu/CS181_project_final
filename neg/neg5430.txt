this game is way too spammy compared to the prequels there is no punishment for being out of cover and blobbing is rampant in every game theres a reason why company of heroes 2 has more players than this one on top of that balance is a mess and the developers refuse to think of any good ideas regarding balance and dealing with spam cheese tactics are rampant and the game ends up being frustrating when you face a version of the same tactics over and over again
