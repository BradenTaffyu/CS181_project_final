2015 episodes 1 4 are amazing i remember first playing it and feeling like i ve never played a choice and consequence game like this before i was genuinely emotionally invested in the characters except chloe lol and wanted to do my best to help and learn about each character so when episode 5 rolled around i was very excited to solve the mystery and reach a cohesive satisfying conclusion i was severely disappointed episode 5 ruins it all in my opinion no spoilers of course it essentially negates the importance of your choices in episodes 1 4 which infuriates me i am a huge stickler for good endings meaning things are either wrapped up in a way that follows the rules atmosphere and expectations of the game as set by the game itself i felt episode 5 took a complete and total left turn from the original story almost as though someone else wrote the episode it felt disjointed and ramshackle enough that it soured the entire game for me of course there are many people who love the game despite the ending and others who loved the endings i am not either of those people i do recommend life is strange 2 heavily that game has stayed with me long after i ve finished it and i yearn for a continuation or dlc of the brothers stories this game however i lack anything near passion or love for it again this is definitely some people s cup of tea enough that there s still a very active and passionate fanbase if you re like me and endings are a big big deal for you it might not be worth the time i ve spent on it if you re more forgiving and lenient you ll probably love it and be greeted by a really awesome fanbase however i cannot recommend this game on my personal experience
