2022 i feel a bit mixed about this game i ll pretense it by saying that i love this game its fun and feels great to play and was my introduction to the forza series however something always felt off and now that i ve played some of the prior games i feel like i know what it is i ll be comparing it to the previous title mostly as its the only one you can still buy on steam idk for how much longer though graphics one of the first things you ll notice is the graphics they are impressive if you have a machine capable of running it at max settings theres been no care into the lower visual settings and that shows greatly on my system i have a 1000 series gpu forza horizon 4 looks gorgeous on it and runs extremely well on the max settings the cars weather look stunning every season is distinctly different in terms of colour balance whereas in this game anything lower than high looks like a game fresh out the xbox 360 era with just more polygons cars look almost like stickers on the screen and weather effects look awful can be really distracting while you re trying not to be wrecked by the ai forza horizon 5 on medium quality looks worse than forza horizon 4 on medium quality and runs a lot worse and i dont believe there is an excuse for thatstory if you could even call it that is uninteresting completely uninspired an absolute pain to get through the dialogue is not entertaining at all and often times just feels depressing to sit through i dont even know how they managed to screw up the welsh drifty boi s dialogue but it just wasn t as memorable as his appearance in fh4 theres a distinct lack of interesting stories to do and it feels like a very missed opportunity to showcase the unique environment of mexico its culture around cars the vocho story is a great example of what they couldve done but instead that is the only story that focuses on mexican car culture fh4 has lots of memorable characters each story felt distinct the businesses oh my god the businesses those are fun this game does not have businesses which were where a fair bit of my fh4 fun came from an odd choice and thats kinda what describes a lot of this games decisions odd car selection great but theres yet another odd choice in how its handled both fiat abarth alfa romeo are still missing even though it has been almost a year since the game has released and despite massive amounts of asking from the community theres a distinct lack of unique american cars brands like saturn or scion both defunct im aware are missing theres a serious lack of saloons or other consumer i can get this cars theres only 2 cadillacs 3 pontiacs 1 oldsmobile its a cool one but still and very few cars that would actually be common in mexico but there are 60 fords 50 porsches so it seems like they had their priorities straight when trying to add cars to this game they also seriously like to add cars from previous forza games pass them off as new additions i dont mind there being cars from previous games but stop trying to gaslight us on the forza monthly streams into thinking they are new to the series we want cars we haven t driven before not ones we ve driven hundreds of times and really like adding supercars or sports cars which i understand the appeal but seriously i want my sleeper cars back makes more sense to have them especially with an apparently better street scene in this game theres also a severe lack of appearance customisations most cars have 1 spoiler option and 90 have no options for bodykits or really anything that most people would want to change its not too big a deal but it d be nice to have some more customisation options online bugs oh boy i have a lot to say about this theres been a day one bug that continues to wreak havoc on our convoy sessions that has recieved no fix or even acknowledgement by the devs that is the random freezing that happens occasionally when you rewind in single player this isnt much of an issue however in multiplayer especially if it happens when you accidentally hit rewind it can seriously kill the mood of everyone in the convoy and make even the most passive person ragequit fix the damn bug already the online experience is awful you cant join your friends convoy ingame anymore like you could in fh4 you now have to use the xbox game bar otherwise you cant play with your friends its once again an odd choice considering they already had the framework to join other s games in fh4 its also a massive middle finger to anyone who runs this on linux through proton since they can no longer join their friends games as its now os locked the biggest annoyance personally has been something that they absolutely refuse to fix and thats the lack of balance between the cars if you ve ever driven the boneshaker or most of the cars added by the hot wheels dlc now you ll be aware of how absurdly overpowered they are if you encounter a boneshaker in a class open you will not be fighting for 1st place you ll be fighting for 2nd because the boneshaker has finished the race 20 seconds before anyone else did i want to love this game more but the lack of care the developers have to actually rescore the cars to match what their actual performance is its genuinely awful its worse knowing that these cars have been known to be broken since day 1 and there has been literally nothing done by the devs to actually fix them so you ll always encounter them in open or tour i want to say this game is good i really do i love playing it and i love being in the game racing but i feel like this game could be a lot better with next to no effort from the development team they could fix the unbalanced cars and instantly make the game 100x more fun to play online they could remove cheated leaderboard scores make getting the highest score mean something they could actually add unique cars to the region or listen to their damn community but they won t this feels like a safe profit game a game manhandled by some execs into losing its soul just so it could be an easy game to profit from it feels corporate its not the same horizon you had as a child teen on your xbox 360 and its not the same game as the previous title its a soulless husk of a game within a series that was at one point the greatest open world racing experience i m still going to play it its one of the only open world racing games i dont exactly have a choice to fill that niche i want this game to be the best it can be but it really feels like i ve joined just as the ship was going down good graphics wont save a game with an awful experience and this has been a champion of awful experiences lately
