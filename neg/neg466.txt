2022 this game can largely be described as fallout 4 but with multiplayer and worse in almost every way cons this game is almost as bad as a mobile app when it comes to trying to force you to pay microtransactions grind is built into f76 at almost every level to the point where the base game feels somewhat like a demo with the full experience hidden in the atomic shop and behind the fallout 1st paywall even something as simple as upgrading and maintaining weapons is an all consuming grind not to mention the constant grind to find food and drink that isn t diseased or irradiated f4 and fnv had hardcore survival modes f76 is survival mode only do people still play games where they re required to eat and drink it s such an annoying distraction the game is both online only and multiplayer only unless you buy a subscription for the game you ve already purchased but even then the game is online only is bethesda having server issues can t play is bethesda updating can t play are you traveling or away from a reliable wifi connection can t play not to mention the fact that this game is always online creates lag in everything and necessitates lower quality graphics the graphics are poor compared to f4 everything has a lag a consequence of forcing the game to be online i always hated how f4 f3 and skyrim have so many unkillable characters f76 goes a step further and makes it so you can t even harm half of the npcs a big step in the wrong direction there are even raiders in guard towers and entire raider camps that you can t engage in combat with the weight limit of your stashbox ruins the adventure loot cycle of recent fallout games i avoid junk to retain room in my camp stash box for weapons i am no longer excited to find new and interesting weapons because i have no storage space to keep them i avoid collecting missiles because they add too much weight to my very limited stash box you get the picture if you want to increase the limit of your stash box you need a paid subscription to fallout 1st your choices are even less relevant than your choices in fallout 4 i ve yet to see a quest wherein my choices and dialogue options made any difference in the overall outcome of the quest this is without a doubt the flattest most superficial take on fallout anyone could create pros it s nice to see a new environment even if it is somewhat lower quality than f4 but better rendered than f3 fnv some of the enemies are just stupid conceptually how do mothmen and windego factor into fallout lore doesn t matter let s make molemen because wv used to have a booming mining industry it doesn t have to make sense better yet let s reskin skyrim dragons to look like bats and throw those in too oops how did that con get in this part i like that dead enemies glow if they have loot and that you can select an option to search all nearby lootable corpses at once the only thing i ve seen so far that i actually thought was a really nice touch even though it s an always online multiplayer game it s been easy enough to avoid other players so far f76 isn t an unplayable trainwreck but it is definitely a cheap shot at fallout fans that follows the mobile app strategy of grinding every microtransaction it can from the player i can t stress enough that the goal of this game seems to be to coerce the player into buying atoms or a fallout 1st subscription update i still hate this game
