i gave this game a chance i really did but it s just too broken to enjoy do yourself a favour and purchase in a year or 2 when the developers have had a chance to fix the many many bugs this game currently has patches just create different bugs and i have had enough of this particular carousel if a souffle takes 45 minutes it takes 45 minutes don t bring it out after 15 and wonder why there is so many customer complaints the games massively under baked that and the performance issues but ill leave that to others to comment on although sitting next to my rig i haven t needed a radiator over winter
