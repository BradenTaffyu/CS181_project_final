2016 no strategy just mass units and pray for someone not to backstab you while you drive your expensive but extremely army into a capital i miss shogun 2 chaos warriors are a hord by the way if the horde gameplay annoys you don t bother buying it until you re sure ca made adjustements to the game so strategy and tactics have at least some effect edit if you want to play as something closest to what the old total war were pick the empire that did the trick for me
