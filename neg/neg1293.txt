2021 early access review i want to start off saying that in a vaccuum this game is an extremely good roguelike i have had a lot of fun playing this game and if that is all you care about buy this game however this game has a gruesome and horrible underbelly the community and its management and the longevity of the game will suffer horribly for it simply put the community management is not running a caves of qud community they are running a virtue signalling contest where everyone is a bash the fash obsessed lgbtqasdfeieio representative and if you don t fit the bill you are extremely likely to be banned from all outlets of discussion and that s not an exaggeration we re talking about a game where you can hack off an innocent civilian s face and eat it but if you request to be able to join the game s villains you will be excommunicated from the discord or reddit servers and you will be labeled a fascist in participating on the discord server you will be made to adhere to everyone s custom gender pronouns under the threat of being banned or perma muted and the community management seriously and i mean seriously considered completely disallowing men from the discord server before allowing you to even read anything in the server you need to submit an application upon which they will invade your privacy and check your social media accounts if you have any to look at and if they deem you unfit by unknowable metrics they will ban you from not only the discord server but the subreddit as well i say this from experience because of these things it is literally impossible to report bugs edit there is a public bug tracker through bitbucket impossible to make suggestions impossible to get assistance in modding this game as a creator and almost entirely impossible to find other people who like to discuss the game the game s community is fractured and scattered into compartmentalized servers across discord the official community will judge you and call you a bigot without knowing you and any attempt to assert a notion otherwise will be met with unforgiving force by an echo chamber of unrelenting bootlickers the community management does not seem to want to run a server about caves of qud they want to run safe space hugbox where the only people who are welcome to participate are people who adhere strongly to their personal politics because of this or until it changes i believe the longevity of this game is extremely limited and does not foster an environment where creative minds can make the best of the engine to improve upon the game with modded content the community management is actively fighting away whatever exposure the game gets and i believe will suffer immensely from cutting off the nose to spite the face
