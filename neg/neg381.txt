2023 fallout 76 is a cash grab game it basically locks away all the necessary itens to play the game normally in it s subscription package unlimited junk and ammo storage for example and the worst for me is that there are no server in my region i m forced to play this game with more than 200 ping because there s no offline option i literally have a 3 second delay to anything it sucks to see my favorite video game franchise beeing corrupted by greediness
