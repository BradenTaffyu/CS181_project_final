2022 its uughh not a good game in retrospect the game has work put into it both mechanically and functionally that much is clear the aesthetics are also nice not that that s a priority when judging the actual game unfortunately while it is amusing at first the game has a major long term problem that being its difficulty and the way it applies to the actual genre that this game is in this game is above all a city planner with survival elements the problem with city planners is that they re generally slow and more boring games often played by people who are multitasking or just in it for a casual experience another problem with city survival planners is that difficulty is almost impossible to significantly apply to them all you can really do to up the difficulty is often to limit resources and small things like that this is after all a game where you sit around for hours watching a settlement progress the only difficulty that can be applied to such a game is generally the difficulty of planning out infrastructure and managing resources and this is where frostpunks problem starts this is a game that tries verry hard to be hard this poses a problem when the difficulty of your game is primarily about resource management and infrastructure the resource management in forstpunk is tight really tight it is in fact so unbelievably tight that you will almost guaranteed lose if you don t know what you are doing and the exact most optimal way to do it this would be tolerable if it wasn t for the fact that the way this game is structured leads you to lose around 8 hours later when the consequences of your past mistake finally catch up alongside the tight resource management you also have constant events that up the difficulty from rising cold to outside discoveries this coupled with the resource situation means that if you are not running the most optimal city at the moment the next event hits you will likely lose the game and just to clarify this is not a rage typed review from a person that has lost several times in a row and gotten salty quite the contrary my first playthrough ended in 30 minutes when i realized how unforgiving the game was i promptly deleted my save and went again i finished the second save with little to no problems i then started one of the several dlcs and that s where i realized what the game experience was going to be like you start a new unfamiliar game you lose with the slightest mistake after likely several hours of play and you promptly restart doing what is at this point a repetitive grind from scratch after you re finally done the city you built is reduced to a you one no more playing it screen you then move on to a dlc that changes things just enough so that you have to trial and error your way through again this is not a fun experience repeat playthroughs are also not the best since you are always running the optimal plan to finish the game with verry little change now take that into account and pair it up with different people who go into this game the casual player will be annoyed because they have to 24 7 manage the game while devoting maximum effort and the tryhard player will go play something else because those types of people usually get off on more fast paste genres all players will likely be annoyed when they inevitably spend several hours playing the game only to lose because they didn t meet the requirements set by a person who failed to realize that not everybody worked on the game and therefore knows every minute detail and how to exploit it now there are obviously people who like the game maybe even enjoy it but i will have to vote for the no section on the recommended list because i simply do not find this game enjoyable it has effort it has care it s a game that was undoubtably crafted by a team of devoted people striving to deliver their very best that said i find the game to be objectively unenjoyable the difficulty is so streamlined that there is no enjoyment to be had it s a constant struggle and not one that is desirable to repeat the badly implemented survival difficulty that just removes the pause button making you have to play through everything again with the most insignificant change doesn t help it either it is more bland at its base than it is fun the game is in many ways still good but its overly streamlined difficulty provides no room for unique playthroughs or thorough enjoyment on initial plays making it lack in the most basic premise of being enjoyable to some people and me
