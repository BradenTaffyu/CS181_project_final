2021 either i m too good for the game or the game simply does no challenging saying that because i don t understand all the positive reviews and here is why the way the game is made you simply don t have to look much on all the details and so most people probably miss how bad some things really work after all it s easy to beat anything just put out more stuff of anything too long queues simply build another room and hire another doctor need higher prestige spam the walls with posters or certificates need faster training spam the room with training boosts the challenges the games put out are always similar achieve so much money in so much time treat so many patiens having a specific illness in a specific time not hard to beat those and if you don t there s no downside you can even simply dismiss them or not accept them overall the game provides little to no challenge i ve been playing classic games of that kind which all had some balancing and difficulty with negative effects for your success but this one doesn t have anything of the like a bad rating somewhere doesn t matter bad reputation so what too high prices patients keep visiting you anyway balancing i don t see it take as example this you can have the worst hospital but then you can have one room spammed with posters certificates and other stuff and this is btw the only way it works and what affects prestige all the time from beginning till the end and while the rest of your hospital is level 1 this one can count as level 5000 exaggerated to make it clear without anything else affecting this rating not even if you place in the staff s room like 20 radiators and burn your doctors alive the room still counts as awesomely awesome and your staff is happy with it once you start paying a little bit more attention on what the patients and your employeers do you start getting the feeling things weren t finished or fine tuned people keep bumping on each other and they only manage to move forward once they slide enough and other things similarly other things feel missing or unfinished especially since nothing has a real downside on your gameplay in the end everything is achievable even if you are the worst hospital manager money is also never a real issue in the game i suppose the game wants to make money based on the nostalgy of that classic game because on it s own without borrowing the enthusiasm of the classic fans it leaves a lot to be desired i kept playing nearly 30 hours hoping it would get better and somewhat challenging but that s not the case if a game does not achieve that in less than 30 hours then it s a simple simulation and not a very good one the one thing that seemed to be cool when watching the trailer the different crazy illnesses actually is only cool in the trailer in the game it loses immediately it s funny side i m really missing the fun part in the animations and in how the patients or doctors behave further the game is very unpersonal at no point you connect with your doctors or any of your patients since it presents everything and anything in simple text only popups all being the same this is another part that feels unfinished and as if no love went into it and these annoying messages that keep appearing you can do this and that hundreds of times when you already know that you can upgrade machines or how to hire another nurse no way to deactivate them when they come up it will keep annoy you over and over again so you see i don t understand all the positive reviews with so many things not done very well but like i said at first the way the game plays and makes you focus mostly on room building hiring training hiring room building it is easy for anyone to miss all these negative sides of the game and i believe that this is what happening
