2023 it was a pretty good game a long time ago the game now has a very large emphasis on paid content and the grind is pretty nasty the most annoying thing is that they don t let you play with your old wot account you need to create a new account in order to play on steam matchmaking is very imbalanced a lot of matches end in a total stomp for the winning team and you get in matches with players 2 tiers above yours very frequently some fun can still be had but the flaws of the game eventually become too annoying especially at higher tier 8 where your tank can barely to anything and every other tank of equal tier or higher pummels you until you develop your tank which takes some time at those high tiers that s where the fun starts to kinda dwindle
