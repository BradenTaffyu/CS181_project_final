2019 eta 4 8 24 nearly 5 years later i came back to give the game a second chance but it has become so bloated with micromanagement that it s completely beyond recognition i can t even focus on expansion and logistics when i have to stop every 30 seconds to resolve some minor pointless crisis that micromanagement is essential too because the moment i tried to automate a handful of planets the economy of my empire collapsed it s brutal don t play it original review below of the 650 ish hours i ve invested in clausewitz engine grand strategy games euiv ck2 and this stellaris was easily my favorite granted it wasn t particularly challenging most of the time and it wasn t necessarily all that deep but it scratched a very particular itch for me the feel of exploring the unknown discovering new worlds and new civilizations and building a stellar empire at the macro level occasionally pulling strings like a stellar illuminati even when they streamlined ftl which irked quite a few players i was okay with it because what i enjoyed about the game was still there and still felt like the core of the game then the le guin update happened and i m happy to say i have quite a bit more room on my hard drive now the fact of the matter is the development arc of stellaris has played out through patches and updates to such an extent that it became evident 1 players who bought 1 0 got an unfinished game which anymore is kind of a duh realization with pc games and 2 paradox is unwilling to greenlight a sequel where all of these changes might have been better received the game feels directionless trying wild new ideas just to see if they ll work and not understanding what made the game appealing in the first place getting bogged down in the minutiae of planetary development flies squarely in the face of the reason i bought and played stellaris to begin with and doesn t jive with the game being about the development of an interstellar empire it s true that the trading system needed an overhaul and there needed to be more reason to not immediately try to conquer everyone weaker than you but those are things that in another time would have been done in a hypothetical stellaris 2 not in the same game in a way that sours players on that previous game it s true that i could just back date to a previous version of the game and continue playing but it s partly the principle of the thing and partly the culmination of paradox s frustrating business practices i m tired of being soaked for dlc if the developer isn t going to listen to players and doesn t have a clear vision for the game i threw 250 hours down the toilet don t waste your time just because i wasted mine
