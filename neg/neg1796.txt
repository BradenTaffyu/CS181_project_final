2018 product received for free my history with war thunderi ve been playing war thunder for about 4 years now on and off due to not having a powerful enough pc mainly before war thunder came to steam but steadily tracking the growth of the game back in the golden age of war thunder there was only air battles no tanks no helicopters and no ships of course there were flaws with the game like the economy rp research points to unlock new vehicles gain and silver lion main currency to purchase vehicles gain but despite these problems war thunder was incredibly fun then ground forces were introduced to the game grab a tank queue up and duke it out i was completely open to the idea of tanks being added to the game as long as it was done properly how i feel about war thunder nowpersonally i believe this game is slowly being killed by gaijin entertainment a few months ago we had a major update update 1 81 the valkyries which adding many new helicopters some top tier tanks which most people won t play unless they open the wallet and 2 new planes for pilots one of them just being nothing but a reskin this is the first real bit of content plane pilots in the game have seen in a while air realistic battles or air rb is probably the most popular game mode for planes which has been simply abandoned there are flaws with it and many people try to let gaijin know about these problems but they respond with an update releasing new premium tanks and more top tier tanks which will take a new player an unbelievable amount of time to grind out i like to think of air rb as a former war thunder youtuber theorangedoom said is gaijin s bastard child it has been forgotten the game is unbelievably and unreasonably grindy without having to pay if your response is well gaijin s a company and they have to make money somehow your opinion just isn t wanted there is a line that you don t cross where you re trying to make money to where you re trying to milk new players by keeping the hype train going and gaijin have crossed it a few days ago update 1 83 masters of the sea was released where ships and helicopters were put on the live server when a couple months ago they already released a major update in my eyes gaijin is just rushing updates to keep the hype train of more and more and more new content being released to drain new players of their money instead of fixing the problems they have they add more stuff new tanks that you ll never be able to drive ships that are just an absolute mess and helicopters to go with that wonderful challenger 2 or m1 abrams that you ll never get unless you start filling their pockets while emptying yours my conclusionwar thunder once a game full of youthful energy and passion has become a destitute husk of what it once was with horrifically rushed updates that milk both new and old players of their money and flashy trailers of content only few will ever obtain without a credit card it has twisted what was once a wonderful game into a stagnant pay to progess more than it has ever been masked with the face of a shiny modern vehicle update 1 2 16 2019yesterday gaijin released a development blog announcing tier 7 and the challenger 2 the problem with this is there are an insane amount of holes in tier 6 tanks tier 6 planes only came out a few months ago and germany japan italy and france are missing these aircraft not to mention the naval isn t finished due to japan italy and france not having these ships also these four nations are lacking helicopters it s like gaijin is trying to kill the game update 2 2 19 2019once again as gaijin does they rush content and already announced a new jet although aircraft are widely requested due to gaijin barely giving any attention to pilots maybe fixing the game and all of its glaring issues is more important at the moment update 3 5 16 2019i would like to comeback to this game eventually but even with all the criticism gaijin gets about the game they fix none of the problems like the leclerc they re working on now no economy changes no map changes just wallet milking
