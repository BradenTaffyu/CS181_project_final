2018 thanks to take two taking over this game is now abandoned the job to develop it further has been given to a company containing not a single person that worked on the original as a sequel to ksp which weirdly enough contains exactly the features that were once on the ksp after 1 0 roadmap but wouldn t be profitable because easily 80 of the people that would buy said expansion features already get em for free due to being early adopters you can also bet 100 that the steam page will go poof when the game reaches near the release date once there is one and magically becomes a epic game store exclusive
