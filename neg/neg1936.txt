2021 war thunder is a great game in many aspects graphically the game looks incredible the vehicles are a load of fun to operate even if you only own a keyboard and mouse rounds are fast enough to be fun but long enough to employ tactics with teammates sadly this is where the fun stops the game features an ultra low graphics option which makes the game look like it is running on an n64 or psx ps1 while this allows players with low specs to play it allows anybody to enable the feature and gain a massive advantage over players who spend money on their systems so they can max out details like me for instance trees grass and shrubbery do not render on ulq like the do on my rig that means i see shrubs and such but you see me clear as day as far as i am concerned that s cheating they do not segregate the ulq players from the rest of us so if you want to keep a good score ratio you have to play ulq even if you own a 3090 beyond that they added easy anti cheat recently this is where i uninstalled the game eac like battleye requires the same level of access to run that your hardware drivers have to your system the last time i checked i could not buy a pci e card which adds an aimbot to every game on the planet so i do not want any program having that access unless it needs it such as my nvidia driver this is a giant no no and has been for at least two decades i work in the it industry and have yet to meet a fellow it pro who will run eac or be due to the low level access they require be was even caught sending screenshots of users desktops and parts of emails to the be devs no thank you if you value your privacy do not install eac or be most games make it optional this one does not finally the grinding is too slow it is such a pain to get anywhere after tier 2 or 3 you can pay for double experience and such but i do not like their setup either offer me a 15 mo plan like wow or don t offer me jack the premium vehicles which require real money to purchase are generally nice for a week or two after they are introduced then they get nerfed again not worth the cash to summarize make eac a user level program and i ll install it don t allow ulq players to fight against those of us who spent thousands on a good rig so we can max out details that is the real cheating here oh and while i would play again if the first two things were done reducing the grind would help i got tired of using the same tanks and planes for weeks and barely progressing honestly eac being ring0 is the primary reason i quit
