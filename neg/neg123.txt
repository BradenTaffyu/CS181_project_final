2017 early access review the hud and inventory system more specifically transferring contents of containers and backpacks to be useable is very clunky and unorganized the rest of the game is pretty cool yet this one thing really makes it a painful experience and not even in a challenging way when your only way of interfacing and interacting with the game is this disorganized and user unfriendly it makes the whole experience a negative despite my appreciation for how this game tries to have a more original and challenging take on the zombie genre i simply could not and would not reccomend it to someone with only two human hands given this glaring issue were this issue not the case however i would most definitely hop back onto the game and consider a 180 degree spin on this review but as it stands any time i tried playing i ended up stopping not because i died but because the inventory system hud and bag system made me want to drink bleach
