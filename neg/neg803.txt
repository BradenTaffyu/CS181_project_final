thanks for the new update bethesda i just love the fact that the game takes 16 times longer to load i also love the fact that all my mods no longer work because you decided to mess with a game that almost 10 years old how about you just make a new game and leave your old ones alone because it seems the modders know how to take care of it better than you can
