2017 the game has been out for over a year and yet stupid stupid bugs like not being able to scroll at the top of the screen or clear click on notifications on the side of the screen haven t been fixed yet could this be a good game probably are the developers ever going to actually fix the game they put out rather than work on yet another expansion to get more money out of you dunno
