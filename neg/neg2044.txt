2016 heavily flawed f2p game that takes itself somewhat seriously as both an arcade flyer and an air simulator but doesn t force you to buy in through ridiculous grinds like the typical f2p i ll be discussing the flying portion as i have the most experience with it the primary issue here is that the devs are russian and like all russian devs who make wwii games the commie propaganda shines through heavily and the russian bias is extremely tangible either due to national pride clouding the devs honesty or them being force fed red army propaganda as children the key to having fun in this game is extremely simple ignore russians entirely don t play maps that pit you against russians and you ll have few complaints the other factions balance well against each other but compared to the flying saucer tier unrealistic flight models of the soviet air force whose real life achievements include the worst kill death ratio in world war ii the most plane crashes in the war and probably the most pilots flying under the influence of alcohol you ll find yourself raging out due to blatant imbalancing to favor russian players and russian planes like pitting post war russian aircraft models against early pre war german japanese british american ones which is extremely prevalent in the first three tiers but consistent throughout the russian aircraft tree a good way to test the insane imbalance is by starting the game as a non russian faction and then picking up the russian tree after you ve learned the ropes to experience maximum seal clubbing as you can climb sharper dive faster and turn quicker than anything else in the game the secondary issue is that these devs have added many types and classes of aircraft to the game and any that aren t fighters or interceptors 70 of the aircraft models in this game don t serve a purpose or benefit their team in any way bombers ground attackers fighters that focus on ground targets are nothing but a liability to drag on their team and dog chow for opposing fighter aircraft they do not serve a purpose in game modes that end 95 of the time in team wipes even though there are ostensibly mission objectives for bombers to complete that almost never get done flying anything that isn t an air superiority fighter is choosing to play getting shot down simulator ww2 fighting russians in anything that isn t russian with few exceptions is also playing getting shot down simulator ww2 the russian bias wonky flight models characteristics and horribly imbalanced game modes bring my score for this game from a solid 7 10 to a 5 10 as it basically still in active beta release i cannot recommend it until it is more polished and the devs learn english well enough to read their forums if you do play it please don t give these devs any money
