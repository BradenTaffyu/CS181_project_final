2019 great game idea maps are massive guns are decent kills are tough weather is cool outside of the thunder is way louder than it should be was fun while i was able to play but i can t recommend this game because the save system is a hot mess first time my saves were corrupted to the point i had to start over started making backups then it happened again no problem i have my backups pop those suckers in then the real fun starts check points started to disappear all my outposts vanished so i had zero fast travel spots not only that i couldn t rediscover them to use they would just show as found then there was the random crashes only game in my library that causes my computer to crash like this i tried fixing a lot of my issues emailed the company my save files to see if they could be fixed nothing the community is pretty helpful nothing they told me helped tried doing some other things to see if anything would work i finally gave up after my outposts disappeared too much trouble with zero payoff
