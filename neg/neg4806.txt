i have been an aom player since its original release 20 years ago this remake is nice and i am glad to see aom coming back from near death all that being said about 50 hours in i have been playing through the campaigns and enjoying it however on my first adventure into multiplayer i noticed it takes a really long time to attempt to join a game only to be met with a message that the games full or no longer available i spent over an hour last night trying to play a game with other humans when i managed to actually get into games i was immediately kicked by the host i cannot for the life of me figure out why i was constantly being kicked from rooms after spending over an hour i managed to get into one game both of my teammates resigned in the first five minutes when the first team mate resigned i tried typing into the chat only to realize there is minutes of delay on any pings or chat to actually appear playing scenarios such as zelda settlers and castleblood are one of the main reasons i play aom on top of the already infuriating state of multiplayer i cant even tell if custom maps or scenarios are being hosted if you want to play this game for multiplayer i would avoid it until they have actually put some work into it for those that dont like to read many words here is a summary game goodcampaign goodmultiplayer lobby and que system very very badprostagma
