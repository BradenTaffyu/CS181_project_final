2016 tl dr broken ai broken diplomacymy first negative review please do not judge my hours i play my games off line as i work for travel do not get me wrong you will have a ton of fun building and managing the empire unfortunatelly there is no challenge when it comes to diplomacy i have played all civs from the original one and witnessed a lots of progress when it comes to graphics empire management and gameplay the new release brings slightly different gameplay but unfortunatelly the ai has not evolved i would love to see smarter ai not cheating ai so what is so bad about ai broken ai and diplomacy some examples include ai settlers travel unprotected ai settlers hesitate to build cities just roam ai dow when much inferior ai unrealistic peace negotiation offers when loosing trading resources deals do not make any sense sometimes you get great offer and 30 turns later bad offer for the same resource player penalty for broken promises keep units away from border building cities close to ai when in fact the promise was kept no penalty for ai broken promises ai does not upgrade units ai comments on my empire sound like riddles that i really do not understand or actually care about it almost feels like ai makes lots of random decisions one moment they are impressed with my navy i have only two ships and then 20 turns later i am denounced for having a weak navy
