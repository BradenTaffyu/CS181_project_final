2020 early access review this game is okay i m not sure it s worth a buy unless its on sale it s had 18 major releases almost 19 it s been in early access for an eternity and has seen no release good features have been scrapped and many have been left unfinished the game still suffers from terrible gamebreaking bugs such as randomly falling over dead backpacks clipping through the world and no zombies spawning during horde night the ui is terrible and i would argue that the person who designed it spent time looking at actual good interfaces and decided to do the opposite it s probably the single worst interface i ve ever seen out of my 800 game steam library between two accounts it doesn t even have food and water which are important to your character the zombies are cool well designed especially the removed behemoth but they don t work too well its very reminiscent of the old dayz zombies they clip through floors they walk on top of each other by mistake the ai is smart enough to render fields of spikes useless but also dumb enough that the most popular three base designs make them do nothing they will also hit you outside of reach of the longest weapon many times the hit registry on them is extremely poor compared to players if you play with pvp mode on it is also extremely common when you play with your friends and the two or more of you are ganging up on zombies that you can hit your friends in a 360 degree circle around you despite aiming at a zombie which leaves me baffled the world generation is terrible the roads look horrendous the maps are overly flat and lack any real cool looking features or unique biomes it is about as vanilla as vanilla gets while you can get a decent gameplay experience on the pre made navezgane map it is also as vanilla as it comes to the point where quests will only rotate between one or two buildings at the highest tier the newest poi s are a step in the right direction and it makes the act of looting pretty fun the building is okay i like the upgrade system and the repair system they are simple and straightforward i especially like the stability and collapse systems as they are very cool and a nice bit of detail my problems here lie with the basic frame blocks you can place the wood frame has more shapes than the rebar frame unless you use a workbench to change the shape but yet they both upgrade to the same the wood frame just requires more upgrades which the rebar frame is supposed to skip those stages entirely it seems to be a bit of an oversight that should be addressed the level and perk system needs some work the action based system should have stayed it was cool and relatively unique to the game the current perks aren t really laid out all that well why does cooking require strength instead of living off the land plus the ui makes it extremely annoying to navigate the perk system and properly plan view all of them the looting system is expertly done it is continually rewarding i have nothing else to say about that the developer also has a bad habit of making something good improving on it and then taking it and reducing it to bug filled bag of ashes there are severe problems with qol present in the game too like the temperature system it isn t fleshed out doesn t make logical sense how can you have both heat and cold resistance on a piece of gear theyre opposites and why does being naked make it harder to stay cool in the desert features like these get added and left unfinished and they do nothing but annoy the out of the player and theyre all over the place it s also been about two years since any real content was added most of the changes have just been changing what has existed for the worse since that time that s about all pick it up if it ever gets super cheap otherwise i d avoid it or at the very least vanilla the game can be pretty fun with mods like darkness falls which add a lot of content and raise the difficulty despite being of extremely poor quality albeit poor enough youd mistake it for being part of the base game in many situations or nitrogen which makes world generation actually as good as it can be within the confines it has
