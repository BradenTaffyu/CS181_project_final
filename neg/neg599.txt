2021 this game does so much right combat gameplay is great fun interesting world building beautiful ost what lets it down are the level narrative design choices the game will consistently move the goalposts in inane ways to punish you for random elements without warning and the consistent bugs laps where characters jump from hating you to loving you to hating you because you did quests in a certain order which broke their narrative make it impossible to be immersed worth a purchase if you want to have fun with friends or enjoy good strategic gameplay but not for a well engaged rpg experience
