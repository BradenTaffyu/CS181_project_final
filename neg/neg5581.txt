2014 was abroad when i heard that ca was going to release the much demanded rome sequal now after almost a year since it s failed release writing a review on the current game seems a proper thing to do first of all considering how proud ca were in talking about their huge budget i expected something 10 times better then the final product firstly it was false advertising with the graphics of the game in the gameplay trailers they touched it up alot to make it look better then it really was then in the teutoburg forest gameplay they talked about how the battle maps in rome 2 will be very detailed and unique like in the historical battle sadly all the maps look basically the same unit selection i simply miniscule then i go to the most annoying part of it all the dlc whoring i had a fear that with segas huge involvement in this game that they will release a few dlc like they always do but i didn t expect it to be on this scale the sheer lack of respect from ca just sums up how they treat their customers releasing units that were already in the game camal catapracts and then selling them in dlc for 2 49 euro the sad thing is that the modded units are 10 times better then the ca ones the simple fact that ca looked at factions that people played as with the all factions playable mod and then locked them so they can sell them for over 7 euro that was the major change in my attitude to this series not to mention the lack of basic features that i expected in the game they took out so many things that were put in shogun and should have been in rome 2 agent cutscenes family tree better advantage for killing a general in rome 2 they just create generic generals which replace the general who had been killed so now losing your only family general which is also your family leader makes no difference because a new one just appears also the fact that the game just creates random generals sums it up in this moment that happened to me i was playing as the julli and it passed the date caesar came to the military scene i saw he was in the game when i was creating a new army but he was with the junia family the junia family the family of brutus who killed caesar not to mention his name is julius julli julius but yeah thankfully he wan t the family leader so i was able to adopt him and this brings me to the political system has got to be the most pointless system in total war history why in hell would we use the assassinate a rival family member with the option in the political page for 12 000 denars when i could just end him to his death in battle not to mention gravatias is pointless and is only a negative because it starts civil wars it doesn t give you high office positions like in rome 1 it doesn t get you popular with the plebs or senate so whats the point the simple fact that the ai for rival family only uses the political options on you if you have enough money to counter it so for example if it costs 10 000 to adopt a member of your family they will not try to adopt him unless you have the money to stop the adoption this means all you need to do is have a generally low treasury and the only thing the ai will do is attempt assassination and this brings me to my new point just a simple question if you have a skilled general leading your only army against the enemy meaing if that army were to be destroyed your entire nation will fall and the only person who can win with that army is this skilled general why the will you try to kill him potentially bringing about the complete demise of your nation the same applies to when your army is finally built up and a battle is soon to come then the retarded ai family kill your general making the army leader less and losing a huge amount of morale it just makes no sense and just 3 more things the whole point of capture points are to prevent mosspits but especially as the greeks all you need is pikes at the entry points in the gates and the walls and you win no problem i literally had a levy pike unit with 2000 kills by doing this why would you take out the material requirements for certain buildings why must a mod fix your mistakes how in hell can i make a blacksmith with no iron circulating in my empire and lastly although many might disagree the online avatar was a good idea in my eyes although people who had played for awhile will generally dominate new players new players could till win i did it many times people with the dlc would think they have the advantage but with the right movements i would win i loved upgrading my avatar and giving him new armor aswell as giving my troops unique colors for rome 2 there was much potential the amount of different types of general apperances was huge eastern celtic roman dacian germanic punic iberian greek nomadic mix of eastern and greek but they took it all away and made multiplayer a boring match up game with no attachment to your units if i lost my veteren samuri unit i would be pissed off even if i won the battle it would be a loss to me but in a match up you have no attachment to these units if they get destroyed who cares personally i would recommend you buy this game on sale dlc wise they are boring i bought both the caesar in gaul and hannibal at the gates when they were 5 euro and i never even played them i only played the factions they unlocked on the grand campaign if you want a fun total war game i highly recommend medieval 2 rome 1 or napoleon total war if you want a newer total war get shogun it was the whole rotate on campaign map feature and the generated maps aswell which are better then it is in rome 2 this game has been a huge failure in my eyes poor graphics considering their budget boring and liveless campaign and the horrible dlc whoring i got all the rome 1 dlc including the base game and medieval 2 and all it s dlc for the price of just 2 dlc in rome 2 i was stupid enough to pre order this game i ll think twice before they release a new one hopefully they detach themselves from the sega money monster and start making total wars which they actually put effort into
