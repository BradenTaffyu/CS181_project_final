2023 early access review don t buy this game here is why specs for referencecpu intel core i9 10900kgpu rtx 3060ssd1 2tb ssd2 1tb installed on ram 32gb you ll spend your refund time limit 2hrs messing with the graphics setting to both get your fps to acceptable levels i settled for 30fps and eliminate the visual issues you get on lower setting such as grass flashing so profusely it feels like an epilepsy test or opening your inventory to find your fps just dropped by 15 20 for some reason after realizing that if you dont have shadows illumination at least on high your game with look like crap your ready to finally explore and oh wait is your textures on anything but epic unlucky as the high setting in asa is the equivalent of the medium low setting in ase oh wait have you left your effects on anything higher than than medium prepare to die of oxygen deprivation while the game renders the cool water effect and you enjoy a power point presentation of a frame rate ok now we are ready to explore cool cool i see the devs installed the natural babies mod and the corpse finder mod into the ga wait are most of the new features mods that were just absorbed into the game huh so basically if you wanna play asa here is what you do find a good shader for ase install and launch oh and dont forget your old server you owned probably doesnt exit cause nitrado owns everything unlucky 8hrs in and i gotta say this game crashes a lot
