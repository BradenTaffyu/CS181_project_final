2018 so ca just released a big update for one of the original factions of tw w even though they re the exact same faction and the exact same game you won t see any of it because it s only available for tw w2 don t get me wrong it s a good game but this is a company that will absolutely nickel and dime you at every opportunity i wouldn t be surprised in the least if they start charging for bug fixes in the future wait for a deep deep discount because this is not a company that deserves your loyalty
