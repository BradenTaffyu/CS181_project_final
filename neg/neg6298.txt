i am a long time fallout fan fallout is my favorite video game franchise and i ve played it since the original fallout however this game in it s current state has not been kept up by bethesda to be a usable product any more it s not patched to run on windows 10 or above i m on 10 there seems to be such a common trend with many users experiencing crashes it s a shame i really wanted to play this again i just purchased the ultimate package even tho i already owned new vegas without the dlc and wasn t getting an extra discount for owning the main game already so i could play it through again check out the new content and generally take more time at it than my first run through but this game is unplayable this game crashes several times an hour after following bethesda s advice from their website the usual update drivers go into compatibility mode etc that didn t work i did find some guides on installing a bunch of mods and such but wow i thought i was into the game but i m not about to spend hours installing utilities and mods to get this thing working for some it may be worth it those that have given feedback seem to say installing all that stuff does get rid of the crashes tldr if you do not want to spend hours patching installing mods that are not done by bethesda btw then it may be worth it to purchase this in it s current state for me a huge fallout fan it s absolutly not worth it r i p new vegas i m bummed about that
