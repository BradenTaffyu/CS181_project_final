2023 stellaris is a game i thought i really enjoyed for a long time but i don t i enjoy the idea it presents and i enjoy the ways it provokes my imagination to picture grand space battles bloody planetary invasions cut throat intergalactic politics and espionage and ever expanding high tech industry and scientific pursuit the game itself has these things but they are really only the images and implications of grand events while the game itself and its systems are infuriatingly shallow and arbitrary this is a game where you can lose a war against a helpless rival power with no remaining ships or armies who s every last star system you have annexed because they aren t tired enough of losing yet and you must as the game dictates respect the rules of engagement respect the closed borders respect arbitrary political limits imposed over the vast expanse of a galaxy stellaris galaxy is one where the greatest challenge of the final frontier isn t distance time ancient horrors the all consuming nightmare of warfare and greed or even other empires it s the immutable bureaucracy of the game s systems that will stand in your way this is the kind of game where it takes 175 hours to realize that you ve never once set it down and been happy about how you spent your time it s so easy to imagine stellaris when you re not playing it as a gripping vast engaging game of galactic conflict and politics it isn t it plays most like cookie clicker than anything else the purest joy it can offer is the addicting rush of watching numbers grow and grow and grow it s fundamentally vapid experience that no amount of mods or 20 dollar dlcs can really fix no matter how badly i wish it could be fixed
