2015 i love the total war franchise and classical history save yourself and just play rome total war 1 gold edition i have a quadcore and ssd and plenty of available memory and loading was still too time consuming graphics were cute but prettier graphics do not make game play better the game play was too directed not enough free form game play the agent system is irritating a single agent can stop an entire legion in its tracks and the legion can do nothing to stop it the chance of success of any agent action seems to not reflect the action mission accomplishment at all in battle labeling and unit information identifiers are frusterating in battle unit maneuver is sluggish the visibility of other units is inconsistent invading a city of any size plainly favors the computer player because of the awkward in battle user interface diplomacy is bad comedy even when i have intentionally given the ai a deal that clearly favors them they often decline the ai may start a war or initiate a battle against a clearly superior force for no discernable reason the labels describing how reliable a civilization is or their tendency does not actually mean that much the most defensive honorable factions still are likely to stab your civilization in the back curious sure i have finished the game 4 or 5 times i don t feel like i have really won though because it took so long and the in battle engagements were not much fun i ended up simulating almost every battle on my last two campaign wins because i was sick of waiting this game has nice graphics but the overall game experience is unbalanced tedious and too directed the game freedom tends to be generally cosmetic i do not recommend this game
