2016 bethesda increased the price of the season pass to 50 is it worth it hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha this was a business decision so scummy the only thing that was worse was their attempt at paid mods there are only three real dlcs being released for this game automatron far harbor and nuka world automatron is very short but it adds a neat robot crafting component far harbor is a better and more interesting addition than the main game but it is nowhere near the price of 24 99 you can get both of the excellent and far better witcher 3 expansion packs for the same price nuka world has not yet been released but it will surely be significantly diminished in scope than far harbor given the lower price what about the other dlcs they were all possible with mods instead of just having these fluff dlcs be added as free patches they decided to charge for them aside from the fact that this is the most bland and soulless game in the series it continues the proud bethesda tradition of trying to the consumer 30 was certainly a fair price for the season pass but they decided to use fearmongering and they abused the sentiment of value in order to drive up purchases of the season pass
