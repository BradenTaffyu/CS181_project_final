2015 would i recommend this game to a friend it s incredibly hyped up and for good reason it s a huge incredibly dense world of action drama exploration and so much content it would keep you busy for weeks and weeks but would i recommend it i can t recommend a broken product unfortunately fallout 4 suffers from the same bugs and issues that the last couple fallouts and skyrim suffered from i lost my level 25 character to game corruption restarted got to about level 10ish and that save file got corrupted as well i also had a couple instances of important npcs bugging out saying they re busy and never advancing the quest i was also trapped in the crafting menu when i tried to back out of the chemistry station too quickly and navigating the clunky and counter intuitive ui that is obviously designed for consoles becomes somewhat tiresome all in all i ll be waiting a month or two for this game to be patched and fixed by bethesda as it suffered the same launch that all their games do i ll also be installing half a dozen mods to make the game more playable such as a ui overhaul and more built in options and tweaks once again they spent too much time watering down the game for a more casual playerbase taking many systems out of the players hands and at the same time designing the game to be more appropriate for consoles while neglecting the pc version lost 2 playthroughs and salty about it edit may 16 2019i m coming back to you years later to inform you that the game still sucks it was flawed and poorly written to begin with if you re looking for a casual sandbox that you re going to install 30 or 50 or 100 mods on well you ve found yourself the perfect game a bethesda game if however you re looking for something with substance that pay homage to the fallout universe or the past lore and plot lines with interesting and immersive rpg mechanics and character development i ll point you towards new vegas instead odds are you ve heard of it or played it already but it s still the only good fallout game that s come out since fallout 2
