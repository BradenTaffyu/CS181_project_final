2023 the devs fooled us by charging 60 for an early access game garbage ui with a lot of copied pasta icons from coh 2 the menu is hilarious and in the menu background american paratroopers are holding m14 which is not even a wwii weapon the faction design is the worst in the coh franchise in multiplayer ukf doesn t have any tank destroyer tanks but they do in the campaign tank play lost its intensity in comparison to coh2 you can t crush infantry with any kind of vehicle or tank the pathfinding is absurd despite 4 months of delay there are a lot of annoying bugs definitely not worth the price tag at this stage and for the love of god i have an rtx 3070 and i can t play with ultra textures they say you need 16 gb of vram
