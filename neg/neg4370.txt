2023 i bought this game when it first came out played awhile and then uninstalled it i tried it again now years later to see if my opinion has changed or perhaps updates had improved it but no dice this game has made the misguided dlc features that were added to civ 5 as core game elements i know what the developers were trying to do and why but they went about it the wrong way a civ game should be about the player making large strategic decisions and while one could decide to micromanage a little mostly by allocation of civilians at cities it was generally easy to ignore most of that and focus your attention on your borders and military forces making appropriate diplomatic and militaristic decisions to keep your people happy civ 6 takes thing the opposite direction it forces the player to spend an inordinate amount of time micromanaging their empire for very little benefit the developers didn t need to hyper focus on trade religion and tourism these elements were already represented in much simpler and abstract way now i am arranging artwork in museums constantly telling traders which cities to go to and dealing with a constant influx of missionaries that flood over the borders of my empire civ needed new bold ideas to describe different aspects of a culture and then gamify them not a bunch of new specialty units and micro games for a player to juggle and eat up their time i do like some of the new aspects of city building it was a clever way to add more customization however the overall general happiness system is removed and replaced with a more complicated amenities and housing system that doesn t really add anything to the game just another tedious things to manage i already have to worry about feeding cities to grow their population now i have to worry about making them homes to will a future update or game add a plumber unit i need to order about to unclog drains on the plus side they got sean bean to narrate great choice
