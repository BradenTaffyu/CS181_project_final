2021 early access review tldr i m off to play warband somebody come get me when taleworlds stop breaking their own game first of all i am a diehard fan of the m b franchise warband was the pre skyrim skyrim of modding and napoleonic wars doubled the amount of gameplay i love the games but i don t love bannerlord i am a modding kind of guy most m b players are mods are essential to the success of the m b franchise mods make the hitboxes in combat much more tolerable they make combat rewarding there was even a mod that let you stealth through the bandit hideouts or even allow the player to attack them during the day what a stupid limitation the mod i miss most allowed you to forge multiple weapons at once and now the mod crashes the main menu you can literally spend irl days forging individual weapons to level smithing and you won t use a single one trade and combat continue to get nerfed and now all the mods that made trade and combat profitable are abandoned and the community has forgotten bannerlord to go back to making warband content i am so sick of dredging through a modlist for 5 10 hours every patch push to find all the broken mods that the community creators have abandoned because taleworlds has decided to be creator hostile these patches are only minor hotfixes i actually noticed one they pushed a fix to keep one floating cow on the ground and it broke most of the mods i was using the game crashed every few minutes if it got past loading the main menu i like most of the m b community have done their best to make bannerlord fun but the patches which are now almost exclusively multiplayer have pushed away all of the mod creators who used to make warband mods such as a world of ice and fire perisno and gekokoju on moddb it pains me to admit this but the choices of taleworlds have pushed me away from the game and it s highly unlikely that i ll ever reinstall bannerlord edit it s 2023 and the modding community have almost completely abandoned the game this review aged like a fine whiskey
