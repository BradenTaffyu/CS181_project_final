2020 product received for free too f expensive as much as i love the game the simplicity and the complexity of it the gameplay and the music its replayability and variety of game styles the cultural details and historical accuracy and most importantly the support of the devs regarding both maintenance and extra content comes with a ridiculous literal price all the points forementioned that i have an asterisk attached you can only access it with money no joke the game is unplayable without its dlc s and expansions you need to get like at least half of them to see what the game is really about i m too disgusted to check the actual total original no discount cost but i bet it s over 400 yeah the game doesn t realistically cost nearly as much it s not a aaa game its not an aa game its not even and a game best i can sanely do is a the only reason that i can imagine to get the game with discounts obviously is only if you re not planning to buy any other games and wish to play this one specifically i can see why someone would do that sure but come on is bezos involved in the game s marketing you re selling ones and zeros not gold to price it 1 trillion times its weight i got the game when humble bundle once upon a time partnered with paradox int to give it for free which in their terms means something like 20 euros more or less otherwise i wouldn t have officially played it and write this review edit sum up this game might be considered by some a diamond but it sure ain t worth a carat my played hours are not only 150 they re many times more than that
