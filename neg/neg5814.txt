2017 from time to time i pick it up in the hope it became more immersive with the patching but truth be told it is simply not a strategic game the ai is dumb beyond reason and the game is in no way tuned to be challenging it is just a case of let s see if i can produce more stacks of unit than my enemy does developing settlements is not really rewarding nor is diplomacy ca has quite a good concept with tw but have they really done much to increase the depth of the game since medieval 2 my advice is don t be fooled into buying this full price
