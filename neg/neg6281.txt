2023 great game with good card mechanisms you may be looking at this game now that is officially released for pc although the game has been out for almost 1 year although i love playing the game and i have been playing since the open release the economy of this game is one of the worse that i have experienced unfortunately the developers are more focused on releasing super expensive bundles instead of improving the economy for the masses if you are just starting now and want to play a new card game i would suggest looking somewhere else
