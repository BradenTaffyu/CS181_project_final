2021 i would never recommend this game to anyone why it s a cash grab pure and simple paradox have locked vital gameplay away behind dlc with the base game a 40 purchase being a shovelware tier minimum viable product oh i am sure the fanboys rushing to pdx s defense are sure to say shadowdragon8685 is being a salty butthurt poor the base game is fine the lend lease mechanic is locked behind a dlc if you do not have the together for victory dlc you cannot send armaments to your allies you know that whole thing that was considered one of the major facets of world war ii the entire reason there was a war in the atlantic ocean with wolfpacks hunting ships and destroyer escorts hunting submarines the whole we ll send the russians and the english an epic crapton of arms and trucks so they can keep fighting while we build up our army over here thing yeah that s locked behind dlc no together for victory dlc no lend lease meaning that you have to basically fight the war yourself that really should be the mic drop there but i m going to address the other important facet multiplayer leaving aside competitive multiplayer because pvp is a dumpster fire in my opinion any game any genre pvp no is me there s cooperative yes if the host has the dlc you can play as if you did too but here s the problem you have no time to learn how anything works unless you re playing and at the late end of the game hoi4 becomes an overwhelming impossible to manage behemoth of a mess and it s nigh unto impossible to manage without frequent pausing even if you re a master of the game if you re trying to work out what buttons do what and you can t even learn to do it in singleplayer because when you fire up hoi and play alone you don t even have that button you re in for a bad time a friend of mine pressured me into playing this game to play with them they have all the dlcs because they bought hoi 4 when it was new and bought each dlc incrementally when it came out but to catch up to them i d have to spend 120 on top of the 40 i already spent on the base game playing with them i just feel totally overwhelmed by the depth of mechanics i don t understand and i can t learn on my own it also means that i can t actually do any of the weird stuff i might want to do on my own because my crippled broken minimum viable shovelware version of the game just does not have those features activated anyway if that weren t enough the game is a haphazard mishmash of three major conflict mechanics none of which play similarly the ground sea and air controls and map modes are all very different with massively different gameplay and making them work together is an exercise in abject frustration furthermore the game is absolutely filled with things you can do most of which you should not do because doing most of them is totally a waste of your time and even the ones that are sorta worth doing just aren t as worth doing as the things that are most appropriate furthermore a lot of things that in real life were absolute game changers are just a small percentage buff in hoi4 in real life any conflict between ships where one side has fire control radar and the other does not is essentially a predetermined outcome the side without fire control radar gets absolutely slaughtered in hoi4 it s only a few percentage points not worth so much as one or two extra cruisers and definitely not worth the months of time to research let alone the godawful amounts of time required to refit the ships can hoi4 be fun yes is it enough fun to be worth 160 absolutely not and if you try to pay less than that you are not playing hearts of iron iv you re playing the shovelware knock off mobile game version
