2018 i ve given the 2 0 update controversy time to burn itself out before posting my review of this game prior to 2 0 i didn t really feel passionately one way or another about stellaris it was more or less a traditional stab at space 4x with some bits of flavor thrown in and a larger wargame like phase late game it was fun pre 2 0 yet had some problems but i enjoyed it for about 50ish hours before it became just another uninstalled game on my steam list my original positive thoughts of stellaris pre 2 0 were that it attempted to innovate the standard space 4x template by making races more customizable and a galaxy that was more of your own making than the game s i also enjoyed its generally relaxed pacing that had three distinct phases of gameplay much of the game such as with exploring sector governing and combat were hands off but with just the right amount of player input not a lot of micro required the negatives are probably well known by now boring middle game repetitive events overpowered and generally not fun end game crises deathfleets of death useless defensive structures poor ground combat blob based fleet battles random research unlocks and other smaller issues not worth mentioning then 2 0 dropped promising to completely reinvent the game well it did and not for the better in my opinion many of the negative things mentioned above about pre 2 0 stellaris are still present and in some cases are far worse meanwhile the aforementioned positives have been diminished or have turned into outright negatives for instance customization has been severely curtailed by the removal of the ftl options from race customization along with selecting which of the three main offensive weapon types your race favored from the outset missiles mass drivers lasers the ftl options were ditched in order to balance the ftl between the races a foolish move that many of the current defenders of 2 0 claim is a great strategic change that makes the game more smart i don t know about you but making the game a constant battle between chokepoints isn t my grand idea of strategy it does however go a long way to making the game feel more constrained the removal of picking your starting weapon type while less controversal in of itself nevertheless helps make the game feel more constrained and out of your control no longer can you focus your empire on a certain weapon type from the outset you must research it in doing so you run afoul of one of my complaints from pre 2 0 which was the random nature of the research where you basically are rolling dice for what the next research item is available again this takes control of your race out of the player s hands now it is very difficult to plan your race ahead of time and you must rely on the good graces of the rng gods of what your empire can realistically focus their technology on without making this review too long i ll spare all the rest of the negatives for 2 0 stellaris those two items mentioned above exemplify what 2 0 has done to stellaris the game simply wants to dictate to you how to play not the other way around there are so many arbitrary mechanisms that infest almost every aspect of stellaris that you truly do not feel like the master of your own destiny be it exploration expanding war or diplomacy everything feels constrained by some invisible hand ultimately stellaris before 2 0 was fun for a time because it was different and felt as if it would strive to further differentiate itself in the future making a niche for itself in a tired genre of like minded games post 2 0 stellaris has proven that this is not the case any attempt at breaking out of the box into something new and unique has been shattered by overwhelmingly unnecessary amounts of guardrails mechanics and newly introduced micro management in short you may have noticed i used the word constrained a lot in this review for good reason nothing describes this game in a nutshell better than that word this game has become a chore to play and any fun that once existed has long since been buried under a morass of poor design decisions and lack of ambition for innovation take my advice save some money and buy a much better and bolder space 4x game called star ruler 2
