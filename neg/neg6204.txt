unfortunately i have to say it but owlcat games is a fraud im going to explain i was very excited that someone decided to make a crpg in wh40k setting and i decided to support them by preordering rogue trader collectors edition the game was released on december 7th but so far after more than 3 months i still haven t received it i tried to find what s going on a month ago and they were promising that boxes will be shipped no later than mid march still nothing no emails 0 communication i decided that i need a refund i tried to find how i can do it on the official studio s discord channel and that s when the real fun started they told me to create a ticket ok done but i didn t get any reply in 4 days i went to the backers issue channel to figure out how can i get the answer and if they going to compensate such a innormous delay but instead of it i was silenced for a day my post also triggered other backers with the same problem some people are still waiting for pathfinder wotr boxes since september 2021 the reaction of the moderator was amazing he banned dozens of people and close the channel today i tried to find the answers again and i was banned you probably won t believe but they have a rule on their channel that requires anyone to shut up if a moderator orders unfortunately i can t add screenshots because of the ban but now i want to make this story as public as possible to warn potential buyers because at this moment i don t know how to get the refund they just ignore any requests i m banned from the customer support channels because i tried to get my money back for undelivered product avoid this company at any cost that s how they treat the most loyal customers it s very sad that the effort of the developers actively trying to be destroyed by incompetent publishers those who in charge for the collector s edition and the worst community management that i ve ever seen
