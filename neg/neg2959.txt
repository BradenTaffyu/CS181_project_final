2017 i really wanted to like this game but it ended up a disappointment i feel like i gave paradox a chance to fix the game but alas some major flaws in the combat and diplomacy system still haven t been adressed over half a year after release the combat lacks strategy it feels like it is just a the bigger stack wins the system to end a war feels very unsatifiying the ai often requests star systems from an ally in peace negotiations and winning a defensive wars has far too few benefits
