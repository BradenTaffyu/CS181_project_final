2020 loved the game until 1 9 1 every playthrough had something fun and unexpected with many liberties for what kind of space empire you wanted to have there were three flt travel methods with strengths and weaknesses army attachments think about something like clone armies with jedi commanders and border system made space feel free and dangerous il felt like wild west in space and with mods it was even better after the war score system flt and planet reworks there are many new thing and pricey dlcs that make things awesome but i personally don t like the new feel of the game new resources butchered flt travel silly concept like chokepoints in space ruined the game for me it does not feel anymore like your race or civilization is fightning for survival in a cold merciless galaxy wants to conquer or make it burn in mass killing and destruction but it looks more like city builder on a galactic scale that requires too much optimisation another sour note is that the game requires too many pricey dlcs and the performance sometimes can be wonky with huge galaxies obviously it is my humble opinion i feel like the devs butchered their own game but it still is a lot of fun art and soundtrack are top notch and the devs are still working on it
