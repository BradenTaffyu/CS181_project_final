2016 updated aug 6 2016 new info starts at tl dr details in the game are fun up to a point big picture and grand strategy not so much original review disclaimer i m a design contributor to the new master of orion game which is a competitor to stellaris that said i m also a big fan of space games in general and i wanted to like this title expected to like it the real time with pause the bigger scale the story driven elements stellaris isn t a classic 4x game it follows more in the footsteps of distant worlds which i had trouble sticking with due to its cumbersome combat mechanics than classic 4x franchises that i ve worked on like civ and master of orion i played stellaris for a whole day and was having good fun with it my wife complained that i should come up for air because i spent all my free time on it on the day it came out but i couldn t figure out why my empire was limited to just 5 planets in a galaxy of 600 stars i complained about how slow it was on a forum and someone else explained how you grow your empire beyond 5 planets sectors what a dreadful design choice they filled the game with stuff to micromanage scaled up their galaxy to huge proportions then want to protect the player from having to micromanage on a huge scale their answer automation you only get to control a tiny handful of planets directly you have to automate the rest once you automate some you can settle new ones did these folks somehow miss the memo on how master of orion 3 tried this move over a decade ago and just how badly it went for them anything not worthy of the player s time and attention should be abstracted away not rendered in excruciating complexity and then automated by force strategy games are about making interesting choices having to automate most of your empire isn t an interesting choice far better to have a simpler design and a smaller scale to the galaxy so that every choice matters enough to deserve the player s attention they apparently cared more about realism depicting every planet in the sol system having lots of dead stars with uninhabitable planets and having huge numbers of stars and factions in massive galaxies than they did about core gameplay there are things to like in this game and i m sure you can find lists of them in other reviews for me this notion of forcibly automated complexity is a deal breaker i wish i had waited instead of prebuying the professional side of me does not regret taking a look at the game and seeing how it works what i think it does well and what i think it does poorly but the personal side of me is sincerely disappointed in what i found people play games to play the game not bang their heads against the desk watching automation play most of the game that s my two bits don t make up your mind based on my review only though look around see what others are saying maybe automating most of your planets isn t nails on chalkboard to you like it is for me and you ll have more fun with it edit additional information the sectors seem to have a dual design as an empire grows and factions develop within it the game is supposed to have migration mechanics that lead factions to congregate in specific sectors this adds internal political pressures to a large empire which is a valid path to balancing big vs small empires a sector can be a home or base for a given ideological faction or even a minority race once aliens are part of a large empire this part of sector design may or may not be good i don t know yet but it s a valid reason for sectors to exist apart from the overzealous vision of how to shoo players away from too much micro the part about only being able to control a very limited number of planets the ones not assigned to any sector is a separate design decision that is setting up the sectors as meaningful political boundaries is one thing and forcing all the sectors to be run by the ai is a separate design decision it would probably be an easy fix to open up sector control to player choice and let the player decide how much micromanagement they want to do instead of the devs imposing their will with the implication that they know better devs don t always know better fans understand this let the player control what they want to and automate what they want to just a suggestion new update aug 6 16ethics differences make your empire want to fly apart at the seams also there s currently no peaceful means of winning a final victory so there seems little point in playing the peaceful ethics and play styles unless you just want to muck around in a huge sandbox with them so you need to conquer or subjugate everything you don t manage to settle yourself almost nobody agrees with you so whether you uplift them to sentience infiltrate their societies roll in with big armies or anything else if their ethics don t match yours very closely they will not be happy and immediately will start trying to secede from your empire via factions that might be ok to deal with on a certain scale but when your empire is 50 planets and you need another 150 to win and you have to charge through the teeth of near universal resistance both before you conquer and after i m just not feeling the payoff here i have popped half the game s achievements have to get those in ironman mode btw and could round up most of the rest but it s a dull slog if you can enjoy the endless micromanagement despite their sectors design you still end up micromanaging your influence supply like mad mining all the asteroids and uninhabitable planets with resources and trying to get each new planet you settle off to a decent start before you turn it over to the automation by assigning it to a sector there is a soothing kind of low level relaxation fun to the near endless expansionism and there are military threats from rivals but the wars boil down to my stack of doom sod vs yours and he who has their stack broken first has pretty much lost the war in one showdown unless the margin of victory was so tight the winner lost 75 of their fleet or more and even then they are in better position to stand up a decisive army from a head start than the other guy is from scratch so the wars are very short in terms of grand strategy and very long in terms of mopping up the details the fallen empires you just avoid whatever ticks them off it s different for each one avoid doing that and boom that s it no threat they just sit there unless you do the one thing they won t tolerate whatever that is the spiritualists for instance could not care less about their borders or yours you can even poach stars away from them by settling near them and pushing your borders in to their lands and they don t care but don t you dare lay a finger on one of their couple of holy worlds or you ll feel the holy smackdown real fast the militarists just don t cross em even getting near them starts to accumulate border tensions just give up on settling anything within a couple of hops of their borders and they ll sleep like babies etc to the game s credit territory does change hands militant empires are capable of growing even by lots but you can protect yourself by not being too greedy just always be the guy with the biggest sod and you re set at least against any single opponent sometimes they team up on you but it just means you need a bigger sod and you need enough defense stations to keep one enemy busy while you squash the other before you go and squash the other one your sod not the biggest whoops you might be able to avoid theirs and do some damage to them but you can t stop any of the damage they decide to do to you that s not the winning move build the bigger sod details in the game are fun big picture and grand strategy not so much
