2020 i m torn on how to review this game i have been a fan of the total war series since medieval total war i still remember the fondness i had for that sprite on sprite violence and the deep civilization builder i have played nearly every total war game since so i m saddened by my experience with three kingdoms you will see in my record that i have spent 34 hours with total war three kingdoms this was spread across 160 turns of non stop warfare literally i could not get a single turn where i wasn t at war with someone culminating in the creation of the kingdom of wu i created an empire that stretched from the deep south to the far north from east to west the kingdom of wu conquered nearly all until it came time to actually do anything as the kingdom of wu you see everything that had occurred in the 160 turns was as the wu clan as soon as my clan declared itself one of the three kingdoms my campaign ended i can no longer proceed to the next turn because the game immediately crashes if i try i have gone through every troubleshooting step imaginable and it never fails if i click the button i m staring at my desktop again i have contacted support and they told me to do all of the stuff i had told them i had already tried then they asked me to provide the logs that i had already provided then after three days of customer support they told me they would pass it on to the developers and appreciated my feedback that s it no i m sorry your game is broken i m sorry you wasted 34 hours of your time playing something that no longer works i really did enjoy my time with this game but in the context that it was going somewhere now i m afraid to even start over because i worry that i will waste another 34 hours and have it happen again so instead i have a game that i wasted my money on that will go unplayed in short i am deeply saddened
