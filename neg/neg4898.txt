2019 while i do agree with most people on how bad ca have schrewed up with cencoring mods and partnering with netease i will speak for the game and the game only it has potential it has interest but it falls short quite short firstly three kingdoms do a lot of things right if you can ignore the bugs let s go over that before we tackle the bad the foodsystem while i would have liked it to be more advanced is a nice toutch diplomacy has a new coat of paint and seems to be a bit more smooth and easy to understand with personalities to each faction leader making them unique and interesting to negotiate with the relationships between characters is quite interesting although taken a little too far it is too easy for two characters to hate each others or love each others because of one trait duels in romance mode is something i can t help but love but i would like to be given some options when starting the duels like the option to only capture each other or simply chase each other away lower risk but simultaniously lower rewards strategic resources having the need to get specific buildings regions or trade for them in order to advance your other buildings and your faction puts some more complexity to the grand strategy the reform tree quite beautiful the visuals overall so good many likes and now for the things i find bad there is quite a low variety of troops available to me especially during the start of a campaign speaking of troops while i like having characters as generals i do not like being forced to use them in order to field a retinue unless i am playing as a very specific faction i am also finding myself being forced to use specific character classes in order to field specific types of units want a decent anti cavalry unit better use the champion any archers of worth not unless you have the strategist good cavalry depending on the type shock or meele you can only use the vanguard or the commander that is unless you are willing to use tthe militia starting units who quite honestly are not that good anymore when you hit mid to late game or research the dragons elites which takes a very long time and they are quite expensive as they are meant to be elite units the bugs oh dear lord ca fix your game before you start making new dlc please the narrow path to victory the point of the game is to become the new emperor of china that s it nothing else even when i played as a governor type faction i was never allowed to rescue the emperor and try to reinstate him during some faction intros i was told how loyal this leader is to the han and how they wish to save the emperor but when i do get to the emperor i apparently take control of him as a puppet emperor just like everyone else kinda hard playing as a loyalist not allowed to build or have forts of any kind to hold chokepoints on the campaign map only the encamped stance for me i guess the sieges something that has been deteriorating ever since its glory days that was medieval 2 units bugging out and not finding their way on walls or in the streets makes me prefer to delegate auto resolve those fights simply because i dislike them so much an empty campaign map everything seems to be focused in the north and the south is literally empty of factions being deserted overall it feels like they got a bit lazy in some areas of this game and focused too much on a few other things so how do you make this game enjoyable mods get lots of mods to fix most of these issues and you are set for a good time but only if you are willing to overlook the rest of the bad stuff surrounding this game and its company have a good day
