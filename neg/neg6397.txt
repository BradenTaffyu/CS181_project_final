2022 tl dr it s a great game fun big open world to explore and full of things to do lots and lots of cars to get upgrade customise unfortunately the multiplayer is horrible it feels like it wasn t made by people capable of rational though and it s been made for 3 year olds multiplayer is absolutely horrible it s nice having random people drive around in your world but there is so little of them unless you re on the highway near the volcano or at the festival you won t be meeting many people there is this awesome thing they advertised so much called horizon arcade that consists of get this 3 whole game modes those are team king survival capture the flag or crash opponents 1 crash opponents 2 crash opponents 3 you do this twice and you re fed up with it and fed up with people leaving your team after round 1 so you re stuck going 2v6 online racing is either you have the op car so you re racing in the front or you have the non op car so you re stuck getting rammed in the back including when all players are on the same team against ai still getting rammed by teammates creating your own events this was also advertised as a great amazing fun thing it really isn t there is no option to save what you made so if you want to make something worth while you either sit down for 10 hours straight or just not do it these events are constantly shoved in your face at random so there is this thing super 7 it s 7 random community challenges that you have to beat i did this once and never again every single one of them was just hold gas drive straight and jump and then woah you actually beat the distance you were supposed to jump incredible job would you like to like this challenge one would think that they would feature some actually worth while creations but nope livery and designs oh boy this is where the pg3 comes to play anything mildly sexual will get you banned a sticker on the car that says carhub that looks like logo yep ban a sticker saying free vbucks yep ban an anime chick with giant breasts and barely any clothing nope seems fine to me best thing about this is that they never tell you any of this stuff is banned and even promote those liveries when buying a car you get taken straight to a page with user created liveries to chose from i bought the bmw isetta and the first recommended livery was the carhub one i used it for 1 day until a friend told me i can get banned for it at which point i removed it 5 months later i get banned for sexual content which me over in the last day of a month long grind for an achievement so i can redo it all again promoting bannable liveries and then banning people for using them without telling them you can get banned for something like that hipocrisy at it s finest if the game is made for 3 year olds why is the main reward mechanic a literal slot machine huh the games ai is some of the stupidest ai i ve ever seen at first i started at above average difficulty and thought cool the more i play the better i am the higher i can make the difficulty and the more rewards i get except nope the higher the difficulty the more made up the stats of ai cars are they accelerate from 0 to 100 in 0 2 seconds they take a corner at 250km h they slow down from 250 to 40 in 0 2 seconds it s so horrible but to be fair it doesn t really matter higher difficulty makes you get more money per race but 99 of your money comes from the the aforementioned pg3 slot machines so it s alright general bullshitting they included lots of assists you can turn on in difficulty settings which is nice if 3 year olds actually play this game they have it easier except they made the assists so damn strong a blind person could play the game literally most popular strat to playing the game 50 laps of the longest race place the controller in a way where it constantly accelerates and go to bed but the devs don t like this which makes me wonder why they implemented those assists in the first place and why they haven t done anything about it for 5 months information shown by the game is wrong in 99 of the time this race can only be done in this class of cars so i click on allowed cars list pick one upgrade it take it into the race it doesn t allow me to take it so i take some random car instead teammate next to me is using the car i wasn t allowed to use or use suv for this one thing took a car from the suv list did that thing didn t count had to look up a guide and pick what car they were using in order to finish it basically if there is a challenge to do just go to google look it up follow the steps one by one to avoid any stupid broken game design and you might be able to complete the challenges the characters are the most annoying people i ve ever seen in a game unless you are the target audience a 3 year old child i already spent 100 euros on the game and to be fair it s fun driving around your dream cars in the map but is that worth spending so much money on looking back at it no it really isn t especially with the way you get treated by microsoft but i should have known that
