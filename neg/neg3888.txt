2015 early access review it was fun playing this from alpha 10 to alpha 12 the game was really fun but alpha 13 broke the game and took all the fun out of the game as of alpha 18 the combat is still clunky even clunkier than a12 and the zombie animations are hilariously embarrassing if it was possible i would withdraw my money from this project
