2023 edit finally finished the game many many patches later and it s still a no from me they ve made a lot of progress patching bugs though a number of quest chains are still broken including a lot of the code that feeds into the endings based on decisions you ve made which is a hell of a kick in the teeth after playing all the way through my original impression of the game stands the writing and art are incredible they did a great job of capturing the flavor of 40k a universe i ve been a fan of for 30 years the xenos feel alien the dogma of the imperium is brutally accurate the game looks and feels perfect but the game is not fun to play even when it s not a janky mess the character progression and abilities system is an inscrutable mess for the pathfinder games i was willing to overlook this because that s just pathfinder but the dark heresy rogue trader ttrpg isn t this messy they added much of this themselves to poor effect the system is designed to be broken by the end of the game i resolved most combat encounters not just in the first turn but in the first 1 or 2 characters turns infinite shots with the heavy bolter that each give a flat damage per shot buff i wiped the floor with the final boss in 1 round of combat and only used a handful of the useful abilities to do so because the ui is a mess of combat options of which you almost never need any character progression is just no fun because you level so often it gets annoying because your choices feel meaningless tool tips aren t super helpful the mechanics are just busted beyond that the game feels short most of the levels are pretty small and there s no exploration of any kind you can fly to planets and scan them sometimes make a decision or two but you rarely land on them and when you do the level is the size of a shoe box even main settlements feel pretty flavorless after the very first one there s no base building no changeable environments it s like flipping through a beautiful 40k artbook all polish no substance the end result is a game with a story that feels too short but gameplay that feels too long endless inventory management that s a chore because of the volume of stuff you get loaded down with over complicated based boosts to random abilities particular to one or another class with 55 levels of progression x 11 characters you spend hours leveling up only to find that your abilities are worthless in the end game and you need to respec or a build only works with a specific piece of equipment the buffing de buffing classes are a chore to use and largely unnecessary i was glad when combat became trivial because it was never enjoyable or challenging at this point i won t come back to try this again unless i see a patch that completely replaces the character mechanics a decent story and excellent character writing aren t worth the dozens of hours of grinding my teeth just trying to get through the experience of playing original review i backed this in alpha and beta and am embarassed by this game at release i ve loved owlcat s previous games and was willing to forgive a fair amount of jank but this game is utterly broken at release the game design is dodgy out of the box the mechanics are rough and confusing even compared to previous games when pathfinder seems comprehensible compared to your ruleset you ve done something wrong that said i was prepared to make due until i got to the end of the content that was in the beta and the game is just broken no quest chains work and all content is non functional gonna need to wait for 6 months for them to patch this game a few times to make it back into a barely playable mess a shame i love 40k and the writing in the game is phenomenal
