2021 whilst i really like this game i cannot recommend anyone buying it there is a serious exploit making the rounds online that lets hackers mess up your save game really bad and bamco and fromsoftware have been made aware of it a long time ago and they have chosen not to patch it so unless you use 3rd party software to protect yourself from hackers you are putting your save game to serious risk every time you engage in online play not to mention the plethora of older exploits and hacks that have not been patched fix your game from this is not acceptable
