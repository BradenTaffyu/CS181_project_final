2023 early access review sadly i cannot recommend this game the developers keep ruining playstyles because they want you to play their way in a sandbox mainly single player game you will not find what you expect here you won t be building massive castles to isolate yourself from the horde you will not be looting dangerous places for the possibility of super good rewards and the game will most likely be completely different from what you saw online or what you played year ago why below are some examples players looking for military bases and gun factories to find guns right away let s make it so you will literally find only bows in a military bunker if you re not high enough lvl players building massive fortified bases with walls etc let s make it so zombies home in perfectly on the weakest part of it players using a ton of traps in mazes etc lets make traps break after killing like 3 zombies and lets make it so zombies just tunnel through walls if the maze is too long players making underground bases lets make it so zombies can dig all the way down magically knowing exactly where you are players using helicopter on horde night to fly around escaping horde let s put in superman vultures that have super speed and shoot projectiles into the game the game keeps changing almost entirely in every single update just to stop people from playing the game how they want
