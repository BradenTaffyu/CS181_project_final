2013 the latest patch 1 37 has effectively ruined the game overnight obviously the devs were seeing dollar signs and thought now was the perferct time to bend over the large and loyal player base that they have built up since release the game now appears to be one gigantic grind fest unless you are prepared to invest large sums of cash and i do mean large sums on top of this the new teir system has removed any fun that you may have been expecting in arcade mode expect to fly your 1930 s era biplane against fighters from the late 40 s and 50 s kinda like taking a knife to a gun fight it s absolutey astounding how they have managed to take what was an addictive innovative fun to play game and totally destroy it glad i didn t spend in more money on this in the steam sale
