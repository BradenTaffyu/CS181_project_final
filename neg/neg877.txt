2016 by far the weakest fallout game to date i will say that it is a beautiful looking game but it really isnt an rpg more like a first person shooter with some dialogue and a poster you can put stickers on that give you some power ups this is the first fallout game that i stopped playing before beating due to boredome edit still not a good fallout game but i learned to treat it like just an fps rpgish game
