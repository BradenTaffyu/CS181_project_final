2023 rimworld is a great game i enjoy playing it but on its own it s also a rather simple game with plenty of limitations and imperfections the main quality the game has going on for it are the thousands of mods freely available in the workshop i myself used to enjoy playing with anywhere from 200 to 500 mods at a time creating my own lists tailoring my game experience to my tastes very few games out there allow you to do this it s great then the dlcs arrived sure they re optional and with royalty it was still possible to find almost any mod out there that would work even if you didn t own the dlc ideology made things a little bit worse now many mods relied on the new mechanics to work still these dlcs were expensive relative to the base game price and added little original content of their own but eventually i bought them just so that i could play the game with my mods as i used to do before que biotech biotech rips off a few mods ideas packages them for about 75 of the base game price and completely breaks almost all mods out there that i used to enjoy i refuse to have to pay almost as much as the base game i already bought to be able to play as i used to do previously unfortunately most mods won t be updated or mantained for those who do not own all the dlcs legacy versions slowly disappear and large modlists are now simply broken and unplayable it s understandable but this has effectively killed my ability to play and enjoy the game permanently until i shell out the money for biotech after i already paid the base game and the two previous dlcs to top it all of the man behind the game is an out of touch egotist who has started to change the price of the game every other quarter supposedly based on the strenght and inflation rate the latest dlc was already too expensive now it s insultingly so and it feels like being made fun of i m very disappointed i miss my game shame on you
