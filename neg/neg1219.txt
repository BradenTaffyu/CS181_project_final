2016 edit fallout 4 has the swagger but no substance fallout is a rpg fallout 4 is a sarcastic dungeon crawler with bouts of contemporary memes this replicated opinion of negativity comes from a source of profound love and is not deprived from anger or biased perceptions this review serves as a small movment of change within a circle of dissapointed fans who refuse to accept or validate a although decent mistake fallout 4 is like good clothing on a hollow shell it looks good until you get to know it a little from a fan of both fallout and the work of black isle studios and for the record i kind of liked fallout 3 i have to admit seeing this entry in the franchise become so mainstream as if the series is at it s peak and this game represents it s heightened elevation that makes me upset fallout 4 should not represent the franchise to the widespread consumer base despite this being a creation from dedicated hard workers it s still misdirected and relatively insulting to what the original developers established quite frankly it s ambitious marketing from both themselves and fan enthusiasm got it this far oh and there are game files that prove this game is somewhat unfinished well beyond cut weaponary but rather cut mechanics and depth expected from such a title that being said that leads me to my next general statement i admire others who love the video game industry to me it represents a distinguished degree of attention and dedication but with the industry s increase in a consumer base it s adapted to a shift into the mainstream ecosystem video games by default are incredibly immersive products of escapism there is nothing else like it but with this new found attention games are heading into the realm of the broad and shallow i ve noticed a increase in high profile games being unfinished yet being passed off as other wise these games are ambitious so much so that they tend to deviate from the established formula of it s predecessors within it s associated franchise to appeal to a mainstream audience these games end up becoming empty with little bits of the extraordinary those little bits of the great allowed me to put 50 hours into this it was a decent game but not a memorable experience i m giving it a thumbs down to prove a point not because it s horrible but because it jumped the shark while lost in the sea of sightless ambition and it became a tantalizing product because of it they knew what they released
