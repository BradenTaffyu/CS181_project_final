2018 paradox completely changed the game i bought with the rework of 2 0 but i m not going to comment on this as it would pretty much be the same as everyone else s complaints about 2 0 the bigger issues in my opinion are the ignoring of issues such as the a i and other core problems with their recent games making half baked games that have many glaring issues paradox s development policy of spamming out dlcs that don t add much to the game and paradox s banning of any dissenting opinion of the direction the many games and company as a whole are going edit cant even start the game anymore
