2018 the only real possitive thing this game does is the gunplay and it fails in every other reguard compared to previous installments the story and this will be with spoilers because it s been out long enough is a joke you re given way too much backstory which prevents you from forming one of your character by yourself telling you how you lived your life how your voice sounds and the fact that you have a child now some might see that as a good thing because it gives the player motivation and a reason to follow along your son gets kidnapped and you have to find him you wake up and promise your dead spouse that you ll get him back and then proceed to run around and spend several in game months looking for duct tape to build another settlement turret honestly i completely forgot about my son because of this aspect of collect everything that isn t nailed to the floor so it kinda makes it seem like my character doesn t actually care anyway moving on once i remembered about my boy i tracked down kellog s cornflakes with dogmeat who i skipped over the first time because people said how horrible and in the way he was but the game couldn t understand this so it forced him on me anyway and proceed to shoot him in the face reguardless of if i wanted to or not and there in lies the main problem in this game the fact that i can t have my character be what i want them to be in new vegas yes the comparisons are constant but it s a great example of an rpg fallout done right you can go through the entire game and all of it s dlcs without killing a single person and that s one aspect i wanted to do in 4 i wanted to forgive kellog and spare him because that s the type of character i like playing as killing sure but if the hard choice came down to it i d spare someone not here though here i had 4 options and only 4 kill kill kill or kill sarcastically never did i have the option to spare him even though i wanted to which for this game makes no kill runs impossible and that s a deal breaker the dialouge system is even worse you re limited to 4 and only 4 options of speaking no more no less which means you ll have a constant slew of duplicate things to say that lead to the exact same outcome but since the game can t stand the idea of me maybe not wanting to do a quest more times than not it s just 4 different ways of saying yes plus the fact that you re given a single word to describe what you ll say maybe two words in the other games you re given a fully typed out text box of words that tell you exactly what you ll say so you never feel like that you said something your character wouldn t here though it s the opposite i m reminded of a bit of a video that the youtuber rags did on the game where he talked about this he had his choices and he made it clear that he wasn t going to pick the yep option and what ended up happening even though he didn t select yep the first thing his character says is yep and that s just irritating other aspects that excluding nuka world there s no skill based speech checks anymore now everything is based off of charisma which means 9 times out of 10 to get anywhere you need to binge on charisma points in order to earn money effectively while again in new vegas you had various other skill and perk options to talk about rather than just having speech be the only option to get your way not to mention it tells you how much you need to have in a certain skill in order to proceed rather than what three did with a percentage number but even that is still better than 4 s color system which is basically yellow easy orange medium and red hard it never tells you that actual chance of success plus it breaks if you just so happen to set your hud color to any of those three colors so you can t tell anymore i could go on and on about how many other issues this game has the bugs crashing boring as hell quests characters paid mods and yes that s what it is let s not beat around the bush here but this is getting long winded so i ll finish this up on my last point that i think this game suffers in the fact that my character speaks and has a pre defined backstory you re either a male soldier or a female law graduate you ll always have a son and you ll always start out in the pre war era which turns out is pointless because you re there for all of 10 minutes then you re thrusted into the wasteland it was touted that the pre war section was going to be amazing but it turned out to be fluff anyway in terms of an rpg less is actually more in new vegas you re a courior who got shot in the head that s it that s all you need the game lets you define who you are and how you act and more importantly you re mute not counting grunts so your characters voice can be whatever you invisioned for yourself russian scottish irish all that is up to you not in 4 though no no in 4 you re either the male va or the female va i don t remember their names and never anyone else you can t have any of those accents you can t be mute you can t even select from a list of voices like in a game such as saints row i mean at least have a little bit of choice in the matter look my end result for this game is that it s decent but it absolutely fails as a fallout game it s streamlined to appeal to the lowest common denominator stripping away features from previous games in order to make it more simple to attract casuals my advice is to just play new vegas at least that game does next to everything right and is brimming with content as it is does dlc the right way and still has a massive modding community behind it to add boat loads more content for free and on a side note whenever the frontier for new vegas comes out it s going to make 4 and it s dlcs look like a joke thank you for your time and enjoy the rest of your day
