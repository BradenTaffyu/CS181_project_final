2016 no more rpg elements upcoming dlc could be done easily by moddershates amd cards and runs like on themin the older fallout games you chose how you wanted to progress with the story if that makes any sense for example new vegas story was kinda revolved around finding this one guy who shot you although there are other things in the story if you didn t care about him you could just let him live if you did care just kill him make a deal with him i m pretty sure you could also work with him if i m not mistaken in this game the story revolves around you looking for your lost son if you don t care about him you can t just go do something else or progress the story in another way you have to care about your son and lost wife husband if not too bad you re not progressing in the story the game is just a glorified open world shooter with barely any rpg elements and for a fallout game that s not good 4 10 because the game itself isn t that bad but for a true fallout fan this game comes short
