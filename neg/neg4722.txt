2021 early access review i wouldn t say this is a particularly good game it does feed certain ocd tendencies but there s a lot of hunting for dirt in some small corner that you have a hard time finding even with the dirt locator vision i will point out that today on the 0 4 update i 100 d every level in 18 2 hours of playtime i suppose the game wasn t that expensive but it seems pretty short for a zen type game you can get lost in for hours like euro truck simulator 2 or farming simulator 19 dev notes 1 adding a tool that highlights dirty parts underdeck joist 7 8 for example or adds a sniff function to find spots of dirt like viscera cleanup detail would reduce frustration 2 the skatepark level was given to me too soon before i d unlocked the most powerful washer and it was frustrating because of it you should stack the smaller levels before the big ones and encourage getting a more powerful unit over other things 3 the rust mechanic is still kinda screwy and basically needs the metal soap to remove 4 the turbo nozzles are virtually useless 5 the text message function doesn t add personality to the game at least for me it needs to be funnier perhaps snarky otherwise it s just there
