raft is a brilliant game if you love creativity or lesser so survival the game starts off in a brilliant way in making you feel isolated at sea the survival aspects come into their own during the early game when you don t have the ability to get unlimited fish veg however once you progress through the first 2 3 hours of the game the survival aspect goes out of the window it is nearly impossible to run out of food or water unless you re a smooth brain if you like the creative part of building a raft you will love this game however you might not like the grind for resources to get your raft where you want it if you re this sort of player play creative the story is completely pointless may as well not be a part of the game i played this during early access the starting of the story intrigued me i wondered how the world came to be this way wanted to find out more as soon as i could when they came out with the story update i couldn t have been more disappointed you could get primary school children to write a more compelling story complete waste of time the technology progression is also stunted the game decides to give you the tech you need most to reduce hours of grinding once the story has been completed why do i need superior tools when the game is over overall i had an okay experience i wanted to support an indie developer to see what they could bring to the table and unfortunately they bring nothing unique to the genre
