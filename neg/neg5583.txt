2018 this game is not historically accurate and is more of a fantasy game now the developers of rome 2 creative assembly patched the game to be historically authentic not historically accurate in their own words if you are looking for a semi historical or realistic strategy game this is most certainly not it they decided it was more important to virtue signal than to let a once accurate game remain accurate and lets not forget about the red shell fiasco where they implemented hidden tracking software in their game without letting their playerbase know then attacked their playerbase when they wanted ca to stop putting hidden programs in their games this just shored up my decision i will not be buying another game from creative assembly until the sjw s are removed from the studio and stop pandering to the left
