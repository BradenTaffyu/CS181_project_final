i really enjoyed the game generally the problem is that i was committed to the characters and the game soft locked me out of the rest of the game i explored all the regions and without knowing how the game worked i ended up not having enough navigation points to get to the next event to progress the plot happened somewhere in chapter 3 ish i dont want to restart the game and i found it enjoyable but needing to cheat to get navigation points means the game failed how can you soft lock the game like this huge oversight on the developer forums state that you can travel back and forth on yellow routes looking for events but that didnt happen at all seems that the game came to an end starting over had i known how to do this it likely would not have been a problem however the fact that a first time player will likely encounter this is absurd traveling around was fun literally being unable to finish the game not so much they should figure out a way to have the navigator get more powers in order to just get unlimited points eventually
