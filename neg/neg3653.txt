2019 early access review i put an ungodly amount of time on my xbox before i had a pc so my hours on steam really only shows a small portion of my commitment to this game the changes the developers have made has been a complete disappointment to me from the zombie spawn rate sneak meter to leveling crafting i don t even feel like this is the same game anymore you can t loot a house without encountering a dozen zombies i thought maybe i had upped the zombie spawn rate in the settings somehow nope even on the lowest difficulty setting it s not even worth looting houses and every 50 ft your character walks there s another 5 zombies in your view even in the woods and not residential areas i used to play this game on much harder difficulties and now i find myself not being able to stand it even on the lowest setting the sheer annoyance of having to stop and kill 3 zombies every 5 minutes has deterred me from playing even with the increase in spawn they only drop loot 2 of the time now i don t even bother sneaking anymore because while trying to sneak away from one zombie there s another one right behind you and i find myself in way more danger attempting to sneak then if i don t bring the old system back i have nothing to do at night now i can t take two steps outside of my base to mine a rock or anything because of the zombie spawn rate and i can t stay inside and craft the same items over and over to level up as that has all been changed i find myself just staring at a wall until 4 00 to do anything at night brings all the zombies to tear up your base you can t craft a forge until you get certain perks but because of the crafting changes leveling takes forever now the challenge in making a forge before was finding enough animals furniture to get the leather which was fine but now i find enough and i m waiting days to make it you have to blow all of your perk points on such an essential tool in the game the zombie spawn rate needs to come down or give us the option to adjust it i feel like having 2 4 zombies in a house would be normal and having the option to up the difficulty which would just make them harder to kill would work best the old sneak detected vs not detected method needs to come back if i can t tell a zombie is right behind me while i m placing blocks something needs to change maybe this is turned off on the harder difficulties the old crafting needs to come back or something for us to do at night to prepare for the next day rather than twiddle our thumbs i understand that a lot of these changes were probably made to make the game more challenging but i feel most of them were just annoyances to me if this is a horde game why am i struggling to prepare for the first horde on the lowest difficulty this needs to be adjustable so some of us more casual gamer s can enjoy the game without rage quitting i will be modding what i can to make this game playable again
