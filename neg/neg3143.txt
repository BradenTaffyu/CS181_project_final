2018 i have never left a review before the gameplay is good when you can find a ship that is right for you but the grind is ridiculous you can purchase premium ships for 25 usd up to 100 usd i think depending on the ship those ships can only be unlocked with purchasing not necessarily a problem there are ship tiers tiers are from 1 10 grinding through tier 1 5 is not bad and was enjoyable additionally ships have modules and things to upgrade some only with xp and some only with credits some ships without max upgrades are nearly worthless except in the hands of a very skilled player not a huge problem through tier 1 5 as the grind isn t too bad but once you get into tier 6 things really start to slow down and the ship servicing cost grows see you play and earn credits and xp depending on how well you do the ships have servicing costs and once you get up to tier 8 you have to do really well to earn credits most likely you will lose credits i had earned enough to purchase a tier 8 ship 8 mil credits but needed about 4 mil more to upgrade it fully for it to be worthwhile couldn t earn credits playing the ship and had to drop back down to tiers i could do better at so basically the economy that you have gotten used to and credit grinding flips on you at tier 8 makes no sense get the player used to a certain mechanic through hours of gameplay and then rip the rug out from under them in short the game economy is super rigged to encourage you to spend big bucks if you want to play at the higher tiers those who play at higher tiers have to play lower tier 5 or 6 ships to credit farm i wanted to experience all the gameplay and experience many ships but for me to do that i would have to spend a lot of money on a premium account i don t want to spend all this time grinding i want to be free to play multiple ships and find what i like heck i purchased about 7 days worth about 25 usd of premium account which increased the credits and xp earn rate slightly and made the grind around tier 6 7 a little quicker as i really didn t enjoy the t6 ship nor did i like the t7 for a guy like me i d typically be willing to spend 100 bucks on something like this a nice pack of higher tier ships but no way they are pricing individual premium t5 t10 ships for the price of a game 50 60 100 i read on some forums that people recommend buying a couple different premium ships with premium camo on top of that to credit farm that is the best way to credit farm buy an expensive ship and buy some permanent camo for like 20 to grind credits to spend on other ships additionally the game is super team dependent which it should be but you ll go into plenty of matches playing your ship role right destroyers spot and torp bigger ships cruisers support destroyers and battleships are the tanks but you will experience plenty of players not performing their role because they wanna try to lone wolf it or something on top of that once you get to t8 you will get up tiered plenty you will have to play with t9 and t10 ships something like 50 of the time and they will hand you your a so in summary gameplay great game economy super duper grindy or super duper expensive i don t recommend the game due to this game economy it feels like extorsion no it s not but it feels like it
