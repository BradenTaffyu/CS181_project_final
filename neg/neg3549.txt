2018 pros cool and funny graphics well designed ui perfect execusion of core game mechanicscons not enough customization mechanicsfor a game that s centered around customization i feel like there isn t enough constomization options three things that i really wished this game had floor wall customizations i e change floor wall colors multiple floors exterior view customizations i e the outside walls gardens paths and entraces don t get me wrong the game is really nice and fun but i just don t think is worth 30 when you measure this against something like cities skylines which is also 30 at least for now
