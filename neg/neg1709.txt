2020 after the unapologetically bugged sims 3 i honestly thought it couldn t get worse with sims 4 but ea has not failed to surprise actually i let ea surprise me despite my better judgment this garbage was released in 2014 and so little work obviously went into polishing and straightening out 1 minute in the end of first day he goes to bed i thought he would wake up when he was fully rested or something and intentionally didn t force him to wake up i let him sleep as long as he wanted a little too much couldn t hurt he sleeps for about 20 hours straight and consequently woke up famished and immediately peed himself 10 minutes in i make him wake up of course he does wake up good for ea but the sleep icon bottom left doesn t go away it just stays there i can do other things but it just won t go away ok whatever ea after all what did i expect then i do some stuff days pass it stays there doesn t cause any inconvenience other than the impression it gives that ea doesn t disappoint ok whatever 25 minutes in now another icon gets stuck there right on top of the sleep icon again it doesn t affect the gameplay i ll let it slide this time too 30 minutes in next day he eats i order him to clean up his plate the icon disappears about a second after it looks like he s going to do it then he just stops minds his business clean up the plate please again the same thing he won t do it ok whatever i can place the darn plate in the trash myself problem solved right bunch of hours in the stuck icons go away when i save and exit maybe that has to do with him not doing what i told him to do i can just save and exit every time the icon gets stuck the two bugs turn out to be unrelated no activity icons are stuck but he still persistently won t clean up his plate or take out the trash or rather he takes the trash and drops it before leaving the house every single time hmm ok 6 hours in certain actions randomly become undoable just whenever it would be tolerable perhaps if this bug was limited to minor actions like cleaning up but now he won t go to work i spent half an hour trying to make him go to work saved and exited multiple times nothing works finally i start a new game maybe something was wrong with the previous one a car was stuck somewhere in town a fish tried to hop out of the water but couldn t so the game understandably had to go haywire the usual sims 3 circus shenanigans could be happening and breaking the game i start a new game my sim goes to bed at the end of the day i let him sleep until the bar is fully green and i tell him to wake up in the morning 3 hours until his shift we got stuff to do before that he won t wake up i break the wake up command he sleeps like a baby he has been sleeping now for close to 2 days and i guess he s about to die peacefully in his sleep soon he ll be out of his misery at least ea my dears you deliievered a most fantastical disappointment i honestly didn t think you guys could outdo yourselves in the embarrasment department bye forever tl dr don t buy sims 4
