2023 it s payday fel matchmaking errori will update the review as the updates come you can read my thoughts and review updates in the very end of the reviewready to rob some banks pop them helmets and get jumpscared by cloakers great but the game ain t ready for you payday 3 s launch has been one of the most horrendous experiences i ve seen and it truly is a huge shame because under all the layers of grime and dirt payday 3 is a pleasant experience comparing to the previous entries in the franchise they ve taken a lot of feedback into account and have actually improved many of the more questionable design decisions payday 2 has had over the years it s been in development but like said it s under a massive wall of problems from technical to design that hinder the overall fun you can have in the game in many regards pd3 feels like a sequel to the original game payday the heist rather than a direct sequel to pd2 the skill trees make a return but in much more limited and grounded way and to be honest i quite like the skills when compared to the rather over the top skills in pd2 and they flow well with the revamped difficulty system being early in development some of the skills feel rather weak in the game or they require too many skill points to flow well enough with your build so balance is needed as of right now pd3 has also revamped armor and health system quite a lot by making armor a pseudo regenerative health pool armor will regenerate a portion of damage received after a while when not taking damage for a moment a lot like in pd th but taking too much damage at once will take huge chunks away from your armor making a more tactical cover based gameplay more viable than running and gunning health works virtually identically to the health like in pd th with the only way to recover it by healing yourself with medikits and packs the difficulty can be off putting to some as the cops can dish out and absorb quite a bit of damage even on the lower difficulties making even the weakest swat units a huge threat when in groups this has been balanced with lower cop count at a time the spawn rate can be a bit overwhelming at times especially in smaller maps making regenerating armor nigh impossibility without proper skills or builds getting some skills in and getting the feel for the damage system will negate these problems but will not eliminate them completely some spawn points for the cops just feel unrealistic and unfair barely giving you enough time to reload your weapons before a new wave of enemies come knocking the cops are fortunately balanced to be weak to headshot damage and have a revamped armor system headshots deal a lot of damage and many higher caliber weapons will one shot enemies even on higher difficulties bodyshotting will not be nearly as effective as aiming for headshots but there are skills that will reduce or ignore a portion of the cops armor making the gunplay a little more forgiving the further you get in the progression and speaking of progression it s a mixed bag of good and bad the player level or as known in game infamy level is tied to completing challenges and playing heists like in pd th on top of that you get experience from playing the heists be it successful or unsuccessful attempts for the weapons you have equipped leveling weapons will award you attachments to further fit them to your builds i really like that even failed heists will award you experience so you will not waste time even if you fail a heist over and over again but while pd3 is pretty good experience in terms of gameplay it unfortunately has few quite ugly design choices which i won t take too long to talk about as you can pretty much read any other review and get the picture from them but to put it shortly making the game always online was the stupidest decision ever made for a game like this you simply can t play solo or offline making each and every match rely on your ping the servers are also still quite unreliable having blackouts here and there there s also problems with missing content having pre ordered the game i still can t access some of my bonus cosmetics and on top of that i can t purchase new appearance items the game is buggy at times but the biggest bugs are in the backend side of the game payday 3 is pretty damn fun now that it works at least most of the time and given the base game price of the game i d say it s not too terrible of a game but it s still a humongous letdown given the development time and hype surrounding the game i really can t recommend the game with good consciousness as pd3 clearly wasn t suitable for a final release edit 1 november 7th 2023 the first patch fixed quite a lot of things masks and customization is working better yet still missing weapon charms bug fixes here and there and the matchmaking feels more stable now resulting in more filled lobbies than before step in the right direction but still doesn t improve the experience enough to warrant a recommendation edit 2 december 1st 2023 major update better and bigger than the first major one for sure two returning and revamped heists from pd2 and skill tweaks as well as new skill line bug fixes added animations and better progression has been added you now accumulate infamy points profile level experience though the challenges and completing heists but once again this update kinda makes it feel like there still are major things missing from the base game like come on they added first person animations in this patch that s something that should be in the base game at launch overall a major step in the right direction
