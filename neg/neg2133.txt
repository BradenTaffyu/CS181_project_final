2018 i would rather a bag of pressure sensitive explosives i would rather put toothpicks under my toe nails and kick every wall in my house i would rather bite down on a brick and get tyson fury to uppercut me the game used to be enjoyable with friends now it is such a flustercluck of who can use the most op vehicle possible the grind is not my favourite part but acceptable but the p2w aspect just irritates me to no end not because they re able to boost accounts quickly but because for the vast majority of times this is still a team game when you re relying on a team you don t want to find out that a good portion never learned how to play properly at higher levels just because they bought their way into the top tiers tanks are just getting infuriating constantly breaking my will to continue with things like ricochets off of exposed crew members in aaa vehicles or getting shot from the other end of the map 10 seconds after spawning the average game is totally one sided often getting matched against people several ratings higher or against squads that swarm arcade mode looking for that easy stomp planes aren t much better either admittedly i do enjoy this aspect slightly more than the former though generally because if you re good enough you can overcome the bugs and russian bias i am not good enough 8 10 matches end with either a spawn camp or devolve into a deathmatch instead of people actually doing what the mission requires the community isn t the worst i ve ever seen but there is a lot of toxicity no one seems to ever be in a good mood whilst talking in chat and prepare your anus for the ramming you ll almost inevitably recieve from team mates gaijin studios is the least approachable developer ever constantly upsetting the community with balance tweaks that conveniently never seem to impact the power of the russians kv 1 i 16 t34 57 etc whilst simulatenously ignoring all of the feedback and insisting that they know best despite overwhelming disagreement from the community graphics are pretty nice i guess but if thats how you judge a game i imagine you re not going to understand the big words in this anyway s realistic and simulator battles are alright if you re into that kind of thing but that seems to be what this game boils down to just okay it is a free game so i d never say avoid it completely but be aware that going into this game will probably have you contemplating your own mortality and wishing that it would all just be over by playing 5 10 hours of this game you will have experienced almost every gameplay aspect this game has to offer with the only benefit from more time being a larger variety of vehicles to die in
