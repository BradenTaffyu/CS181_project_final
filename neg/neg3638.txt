2018 early access review i have put 124 hours into this game and am writing this review now on the alpha 17 newest update to the game that is not yet out in a stable release the negative recommendation has nothing to do with glitches or bugs but on the new gameplay loop proposed by the developers 7 days to die as per alpha 17 is a game which the only thing you should be doing is killing zombies until you get to end game talking 20 hours of just hunting zombies before getting into the rest of the game every advancement is attached to new perk system once you get enough xp you level get a point to put into the perk system and repeat problem is many things required to actually start playing the game past just killing zombies require you to be level 20 and in many cases much higher zombies offer lots of experience and is relatively easy to do while everything else you do offers barley any most crafting is locked behind this perk system discouraging players from exploring the enviroment for schematics just kill enough zombies and eventually the rest of the game will start they also changed the way weapons worked and many other things which i do not agree with but will not get into here the new leveling system alone is enough for me never to touch the game again it should be about exploration crafting working together with other players and killing zombies not 20 30 hours of zombie grind before you can build a decent base or weapons alpha 16 progression was very different the more you do something the better you got at it rewarding people for specializing in certain areas which was great when you were playing with your friends and made you feel unique and important there were roles you could all fill that were slightly different from one another you could actually gain levels by doing stuff other than killing zombies tldr version alpha 17 in order to level you must kill zombies and do nothing else exploration and other actions espeically base building discouraged big thumbs down alpha 16 encouages exploration and many different ways to earn experience leveling system was not perfect and needs more but it is getting there gameplay loop offers many options other than just killing zombies for xp crafting and trading is encouraged to get better quality items big thumbs up
