2022 early access review bannerlord is genuinely a fun game with that being said there are a ton of goofy or just straight up unfun things that ruin that goofy things range from armour looking way too big with helmets sitting inches off your head to everyone looking inbred i can deal with those it just looks really stupid now for things i can t deal with no choice in siege weapons defending ctd on executing certain lords randoms across the planet getting mad over executions spending hours crafting without getting the part i want no control over clan parties no control over caravans very little control over workshops caravans are a waste of money the loyalty system melee and cav specifically being somehow inaccurate random ctd autoresolve looters killing cataphractii certain common items never appearing in shops and that s all i can really care to remember i ve got a lot of hope that most if not all of this will be fixed but updates are really really slow right now so it ll be a while enjoy playing the game regardless but honestly you should just wait
