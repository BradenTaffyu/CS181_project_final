2023 i will update this review in about a month and hopefully by then it will be an upvote not a downvote anymore i managed to play a few hours of the game during the 3 early access days and i really love the game the stealth has been built upon a lot it s a lot more interesting with the new phases puzzles etc loud heisting is to me a lot like in payday2 but more grounded and just feels really good excellent gunplay imo graphics are beautiful ditching diesel for unreal was the best move i was amazed by some of the details for instance when you look at your phone you see the glassy plastic display with fingerprints scratches etc these kinds of details are all over the visuals and the maps speaking of which i ve played 7 out of 8 maps so far they are all great looking with an immersive atmosphere my only issue would be the map on the bridge where you have to escort a hijacked armored transporter the heist itself is just waaaaay too short and it s over in 10 minutes i wanted more from that map which is only loud something else i ve noticed is the ui and ux in general it s very obvious that it s targeted towards consoles and while i don t see it as a huge issue it s still a bit annoying to navigate on pc for instance when you want to select a heist you have this long horizontal scrollbar which will reset if you select and then de select a heist which is extremely bad user experience these small things happens multiple places in the different menues other small ui things needs changing such as the statistics of guns which is really hard to read it also seems like most attachments has little to no effect on the gun stats which imo is very bad game design you want to be able to customize your weapon in a way that has impact on how the gun functions the biggest issue and dissapointment is obviously the choice of making the game only online which these first 2 days of the launch clearly has demonstrated was a terrible mistake besides the fact that you can t play the game at all currently it also just feels stupid that you have to sit and wait for the matchmaking system to find you a lobby when you just want to go in solo i am sure a lot of these things will be changed for the better in future updates and patches but for now i can t recommend buying a product which you can t access i also hope and expect that we as customers will be compensated for this terrible display of unprofessionalism in some way considering some of us payed a lot of money to support the game i bought the gold edition
