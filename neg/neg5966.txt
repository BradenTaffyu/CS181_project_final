2018 dear paradox 850 hours this is the steam game i ve spent most time with would i recommend it to other players no this may seem paradox but the reason is really simple the dlc s you seriously expect people to pay more than 250 euros as of q1 2018 for a complete version of the game euiv is a great game but not that great you may argue that no one needs to buy those dlc true but who is satisfied with a game that feels like half of it is missing even if it ain t and the updates that follow the pricy new content have wrecked more than one of my playthroughs i m no cash cow
