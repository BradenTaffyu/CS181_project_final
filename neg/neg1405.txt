almost every aspect of it is much worse than warband bannerlord stuff doesn t make any sense lacks alternative experiences and there s bunch of hidden and annoying mechanics basically the only option you have is to recruit useless and stupid vassals who does nothing other than providing low level troops without mods this game is stupid and feel unfinished from vassals combats diplomacy marriage to garrison troops and balance of power let s talk about vassals first in warband you have the option to conquer the entire continent without recruiting any vassal as long as you have enough garrison troops in your fiefs although it would be a lot harder than having more helpers in warband it is playable and possible option however in bannerlord without vassals you would be greatly outnumbered like 400 vs 2000 troops in addition to that your garrison troops will always be starved to death since they only take food from settlements stock but not your party inventory nor the settlement stash the game tells nothing about this until you find your garrison all starved to death also there s zero way to directly increase settlement food stock so the only and forced option you have is to have more vassals to waste enemy armies time by basically suicidal attacks to let your settlement food stock grow on its own you might think oh i could avoid these just by having more vassals but remember vassals are bunch of fools both your vassals and enemy vassals are all crazy about besieging fiefs they would constantly lead huge armies with troop count anywhere from 1000 to 2000 and waste all of them on some useless castles which only gives about 500 denars a day in profit for comparison troop wage for 1000 troops is roughly 6000 to 8000 a day not an economical choice at all and they would probably waste around 1000 troops on this castle and still couldn t take it then what happens next is the rest of army of around 400 to 600 troops would be attacked by the enemy army who s been waiting around the besieged settlement and the vassals would all be captured the war is basically a repetition of infinite besiege half of army died half of army meets an enemy full army full enemy army won full enemy army besiege loop almost zero army would think about eliminating enemy armies first and without strategical objectives the war is just wasting lives on besieging useless settlements the ai of an army would always prioritize closer targets let s say vlandians and aserains are at war and my kingdom is at the middle vlandians would always create an army thinking about taking back settlements from aserai at first and on the half way they would see my castles and start besieging mine instead in such a stupid fashion the game would always create giant forces with 12000 strengths like vlandians and aserai with rest of forces all at around 6000 strengths simply because they are farthest from anyone else and besieged less often the rest fight each other only to weaken each other to prepare themselves to be taken by vlandians aserai and khuzaits as a matter of fact under such a stupid game design for these stupid kings and vassals the best option is actually not join any war that would prevent any town or castle from starving thus more prosperity and profits but they are just stupid enough to always propose war for more fiefs forgetting what they already have at hand even if you re the king of a kingdom there s zero definite way to have a nominate in settlement owner vote i know it would be affected by bunch of hidden mechanics such as number of fiefs you already have fief proximity or relation with other vassals but you just can t tell how much they influence the nomination it is not a problem in warband since as king you could ve just give it to yourself at the cost of vassal relations and tax rates but again there s no such option in bannerlord even if you are willing to give considerable expenses in bannerlord there s no such option even if i want to reserve some vassals for farther fiefs they would always be one of three nominee as long as they have a closer castle or some of them have no fiefs i would be willing to reward them denars or influences or my old fiefs instead but in this game i don t have such an option every nominee is a forced choice of this game looking through online sources i found the solution to be a well designed route of expansion you have to design a route of your owned fiefs and fiefs to be taken by you for you to have your desired fiefs again even if you re the king you have zero right to nominate yourself in one of the only three nominees of a fief vote i don t think it s a democratic senate considering the fact that i don t even have the right to nominate myself basically the outcome is that no one is happy with the in game senate the kings are not happy because they can t take the fiefs they want and the vassals are not happy because only those who won the hidden mechanics would make themselves to nominations troop transfer is again stupid if you want to give troops to a vassal in warband you simply move troops from your party to theirs but in bannerlord there s again no direct way to do that you can only donate troops to their settlement garrisons and pray that they would take the high level troops you trained to battlefield even as a king you have zero way to command the stupid ai armies or parties even if party leaders are your clan members which causes them to always be captured by enemy parties and exhaust you by constantly having to change party leaders and saving your clan members as a comparison in warband if you re the marshal you could ask other vassals to scout defend in settlements besiege settlements even if you re not the marshal you could ask your friend vassals if they are willing to perform the above operations what all of the vassal junks add up is a simple result is that this game becomes a game about whoever have more troop count wins whoever have more vassals wins whoever stays away from wars wins this eliminates the joy of defeating an enemy army with fewer troops take the towns you want to take or command armies and parties for strategical moves what has left is that you can control nothing strategical in this game even if you re the king most of the time wars feels like watching two idiot soccer teams kicking balls into their own goals if there s anything better for bannerlord when compared to warband it should be the game graphics and combat movements but these things deteriorate in later gaming when you worry more about strategical factors over combat factors it shouldn t be called mount blade it should be called spam vassals troops only warband deserve the title mount blade
