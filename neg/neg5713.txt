2018 heyo just so you know keep politics out of my games women generals didn t really exist in this time frame all too often so ea a company that focuses on historical games should focus on making historical games not pc politics shocking i know we don t need women inserted everywhere just because their feelings are hurt don t have to agree with it but that s the way it was 2 000 years ago if women want a game where they are generals make thier own game do not co opt already running historical titles with your views on gender politics sincerelya person who was already on the fringe about total war games btw i hope ella does not speak for ca thanks
