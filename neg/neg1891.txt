2015 i m a professional pilot with more warthunder hours then i have real flight hours and after all these almost 800 hours of warthunder i cannot recommend this game don t get me wrong i ve had fun in this game in the past playing with friends and so on but i have now reached the higher tiers of this game and i can tell you one thing it is not worth it the devs went full and they will end up destroying what could ve been an awesome game i have 3 huge problems with the devs of this game and i will outline them below 1 lack of balance yes i like realism in games but to a certain extent games need to be fun and to be fun they need to be balanced if you love playing with russian tanks and airplanes you will have a great time playing this game if you prefer german or american and british units go ahead and buy yourself a lot of lube because they will sodomize the living s out of you 2 ridiculous matchmaking in soviet russia you do not choose match match chooses you that s right folks the matchmaking on this game is ridiculous you can not choose which map you wanna play in you don t even get to choose which theater of war you play in so if you take for example the tbf avenger medium bomber used in the pacific 95 of the time matchmaking takes you to the battle of the bulge and that s after you select realistic battles on the matchmaking and that s when you re lucky and they don t put you on a realistic mixed battle against overpowered russians 3 bombers i ve had a lot of fun with bombing missions in the lower tiers so once i got around tier 3 with the brits i decided i wanted to unlock one of my fav bombers the lancaster so after like 700 hours of playing this game without putting money into it i decided it was maybe time to spend some money and save some time so i spent about 30 euros on golden eagles and insta unlocked the lancaster what i can tell you now is that next time i ll just go outside and hand the 30 euros to someone and tell them to spit in my face and laugh out loud and call me stupid in russian because this is what gaijin did to me the lancaster and any other high tier bomber for that matter is a great choice if you like to pleasure men thats what i ve done on any mission i ve flown with these bombers you spend like 10 minutes flying to a bomb target only to get intercepted by a jet fighter with enough armament that it prematurely ejaculates 1000 pounds of lead on you before your gunners even smell him 13 10 if you didn t hate russians before playing this game you will now
