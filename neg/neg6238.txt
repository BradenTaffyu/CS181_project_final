this was a really fun game to discover i certainly get all the hype around it but it also turns out to be very superficial contrary to most deckbuilding deckbuilding adjacent roguelikes where you have to make concessions and constant adaptations to an imperfect build in order to win balatro rewards you for being single minded you only need a little flexibility in the beginning until you figure out what hand and or couple jokers will carry you at which point the best and only move is to tunnel vision really hard into it and just play the same hand over and over again until you win a process which starts very very early in a run basically it lacks a whole layer of complexity to keep it fresh in the long run that and endgames are super redundant worse the formula for a winning run rarely ever changes at least a joker that gives chips at least a joker that gives mult ideally a joker that gives xmult at least one of which has to be a strong scaling one and then whatever you can fit in how little space you have left that can complement it it doesn t matter what kind of hand you play as long as it fits your joker line up and you manage to make it spammable and despite timid steps having been taken in the last update high card still is the most reliable hand by far so it feels to me that not only you play the same hand over and over you actually play the same run over and over barring edge cases you always need the same couple of things and there just isn t that much variety in how you can gather them somehow it makes sense after all you rarely get to make really game changing tweaks to your deck and even then most of the work comes from the jokers which you only get to carry 5 of and whose effects very rarely reach beyond a will reward you x for playing x type of hand level of complexity kind of feels like playing slay the spire with only common cards and a hard cap on relics on top difficulty while smart thinking obviously does help the game is primarily won by finding something worth committing to early enough and then getting lucky enough to find stuff that complements it or the other way around and if you re doing decently but didn t get offered the boss reroll item you might still end up losing at the very end to one of the 5 possible final bosses that takes 3 times as many points to defeat 3 mostly uneventful bosses one that can occasionally be a challenge and then one that will automatically end most runs and i mean most runs do the math 1 2 million really takes a lot of luck to be theoretically doable that s some fine design right there the game also suffers from a lot of pointless content that doesn t add much to the experience but makes completion more grindy than it needs to be like 5 ish starting decks the equivalent of playable characters making somewhat significant changes to the gameplay and another 10 that pretty much all play the same way finally some minor nitpicking at least one mechanic feels like it was just copied from other popular games without understanding why it belonged there and not here the interest system while it made a ton of sense in tft for instance it brings a false sense of depth to the game and turns out to do the exact opposite of that as it further incentivizes you to think in black and white if this isn t a perfect fit for my build and i don t need it to survive right now here s another excuse to dismiss it essentially a way to take away some liberty from the player while tricking them into thinking they re getting more of it and again rewarding single mindedness i suppose certain folks will be happy with it as it does very much have that power trip aspect that i ve seen lots of people complain is missing in sts lbal other similar games as far as i m concerned though having to make concessions to make an imperfect build work is what keeps me entertained and occasionally surprised in the long run as opposed to just dismissing everything that isn t a perfect fit there s a certain kind of magic in these games that i don t see in balatro on a sidenote there s a lot of micro managing to do so if you don t like that by all means stay away edit after 40 more hours i waited a few months before playing it again and having little recollection of some things made it enjoyable for a while i tried to keep an open mind but really i stand comforted in my views the game promotes dichotomous thinking and the impact of strategy vs rng strict sense not a comment on difficulty is much lesser than standard in this genre it s not bad or stupid or wrong but if you like digging into games even a little there are much better options out there edit after another 80 hours since i was getting close to all achievements i gave it more time done with that now unfortunately it only threw light on more issues which i added to the review
