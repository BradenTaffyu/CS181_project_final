early access review this is one of the most un optimized games i have ever played every update patch requires you to reinstall patch the entire 116 gbs constant server crashes roll you back multiple hours so you have to complete everything you accomplished over that period again and mesh issues present since ark s e are a reoccurring issue that has made their way into the most important aspects of the game just find an ascendent crossbow blueprint in a red drop server resets and you load back into the game having died from fall damage on the way to the drop finally have good enough gear tames to complete the ice cave game lags you die and your items that took you hours to collect are stuck underneath the map on your dead body and are unable to be retrieved for a revamped version of the original game having been put on a newer engine with added dinos it leaves a lot to be desired
