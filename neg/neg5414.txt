2023 sound design has a lot less oomf than previous games the open campaign was a great concept but it is a steam roll the whole time even on expert the north african campaign feels more like a tutorial it has been 7 months and the game feels unfinished the only content added are just army skins the available commanders feel stale and boring not much going on in this game and chances are they will kill support like other games
