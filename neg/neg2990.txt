2023 quite frankly their dlc policy is vicious you could even say anti consumer heck might even be illegal in several countries i would even put it above loot boxes and gacha if you are paying 3 times the amount of cash as the base game to get the actual game then something is wrong stellaris is closer to 6 times the base price update so decided to update the review to elaborate further on the dlc policy and update policy overall paradox is now pumping out dlc and forcing content into the vanilla game in a half state this leaves those without dlc with a game full of half implemented features requiring dlc to essentially complete them not to mention essentially overhauling the game 1 2 times a year in conjunction with said dlc and free updates quite honestly i would say this counts as deceptive business practice in australia almost tempted to report this to accc along with several other players
