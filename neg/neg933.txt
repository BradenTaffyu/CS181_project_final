2018 this is a hard thumb to give i enjoyed most if this game most of the way through a lot i played a ton when it first came out just building up the starting settlement which is a huge charm of this game though many people say it s not important and boring i think it s one of those things that you ll love or hate and i loved it until i got bored with it this game shouldn t be compared to other fallout games or else it s damned on its own it can be pretty fun it was hugely intensive on my old pc 2009 and my 2017 rig had trouble loading some aspects of it and i got the bottlenecking i hated the story i can t tell you much about it without spoiling it but you are shoehorned into playing a specific archetype and the choices available to you the results of your choices and the dialogue therein did not match the character you re forced to play as i hated the ending even more so much so that it made me physically ill upon completion reaching the big reveal upset me a lot and it only got worse from there as my friend put it in the end the game suffers from asking us complex questions about the human condition while being stuck in an antiquated system that couldn t handle giving us proper consequences the only thing human about this game is dogmeat s whimper when he s ko d in a fight he s a crybaby combat can be fun but difficulty levels only increase the amount of health enemies have and decrease the damage you do rather than so many alternatives that would make a more difficult game more enjoyable voice acting is a ambient sound is a music is a visuals are a controls are b city building is b combat is c story is c ending s are f writing fail far harbor dlc is great solid a machinist is a great addition as well i didn t get the other dlc s
