2016 i have loved playing paradox games since 2004 where i played hearts of iron i it pains me to admit that this game in its current form is not a finished product i can not recommend this game in its current state it has a whole lot of potential but it has massive issues with the ai as well as design decisions that negatively impact the game i ve lost the will to play the game until the game resembles a finished product what is wrong hollowness the game feels hollow a lot of features from previous hoi titles have been removed completely additionally the game has been dumbed down substantially hearts of iron iv the not historical simulator you can not play this game historically the current ai is too drastic and makes very bad decisions in example if you start in 1936 and want to play historically then you can forget it anything can happen and anything will happen it s fun if you like an unpredictable ai but paradox has given you the oppertunity to turn on off historical ai in this case the ai is never historical world war 2 never happened world war 2 has changed name to the german polish war in the game no matter who is axis and who is allied or where the battles are fought when ww2 sorry the german polish war starts japan italy or germany will declare war on random countries from time to time which it never will invade nor has any interest in invading i e germany dow ing peru and peru automatically joins the allies in the german polish war generic tech tree and leader portraits if you want a ww2 feeling you should stick to playing only the major powers in the game every other country has the same generic tech tree and same generic leader portraits nuclear bombs any country even ethiopia can have nukes in 1945 nuclear bombs part two nukes are useless they only inflict damage to a units organisation nothing else looking for a challenge as a minor nation forget it there is no challenge you start off being behind germany and other major nations but you catch up technologywise in less than 2 3 years do you want to play yugoslavia but you re afraid that italy and germany will invade you no problem just change your entire country to a facist yugoslavia in less than a year and wupti you are now a part of the axis and can do whatever the hell you want spreading idealogies and starting civil wars in every country no matter the size afraid mighty usa or mighty germany will invade you no worries just spread an enemy idealogy in their country for 0 5 political and they will erupt into a civil war in about a year i played nat china and got dragged into a war with the axis and allies because of my ai ally sinkiang no worries i just started civil wars in all major countries and neighbouring countries to weaken the enemies japan won vs china and was now huge being a clever little i simply started a communist civil war in their beijing province and soon after declared war on japan and took all of their southeren provinces without any resistance due to them being occupied by the civil war afterwards they were too weak to fight back i did the same to usa germany italy uk france and various other small nations in the way of my glorious civil war spreading nationalist china not recommended in its current form
