2017 the animals are equipped with passive array radar and can hear you a light year away i have only been smelt 3 times seen 30 times and be heard for a freaking 1000 times the animals can hear you even when there is a damn hill in between and start to run without even looking at your direction the worst hunter in the world who can t even jog i can t even call it a run for 50m without losing his her breath and can not held it for 5s when aiming and the frustrating toy rifle which cause only flesh wound and very slow bleeding when i shoot them in the face conclusion a hunter who is worse than myself dealing with terminator animals update i acknowledge people who want to object my opinion but for a bunch of people who may know a little bit then pretend to know everything and call others kid just becasue of disagreement i have something to say the review tries to point out some of the problems in a funny way if you can t get it i seriously doubt your comprehension skills yet i decide to put it in another way 1 the hearing of animals is clearly overpowered comparing to other senses for example the boar and deer should have the smell as their strongest sense yet i got heard by them way more frequently than smelt by them in some circumstances myself can t even hear my footstep clearly yet the animals can hear them with ease the propagation of sound does not seem to be affected by factors such as hills and existence of trees so i suspect that they just programmed it only related to the distance it is extremely frustating when you are hunting a high value target since they have stronger sense 2 the movement system of the game is problematic as well the fast travel randomly reset your continuous hunting score can t figure out when the score is reset so you have to walk a lot if you aim high scores the speed of walking and jogging is too slow which makes your sweeping very tedious and boring unless you buy the shiny avt warning to new buyers walking in this game ramble in real life runing walking in a hurry for those who keep mentioning the burden of equippment i did not see the hunter going any faster when he is carrying just one rifle at the first place 3 there are also problems with the damage system for the smart zzabur dude who asks me to shoot the chest i seriously doubt whether he has played the game through shooting the lung in this game as i can remember never gives a 100 score unless you use a larger bullet which devastates your integrity score shooting spine and head remain the most reliable instant kill to me compared to heart however he can be a master who can hit the heart everytime then that is my fault the frustrating thing is than when you slightly miss the brain the animal literally runs away like nothing happened clearly you can see they have been hit to the ground by the impact of bullet the cerebral concussion should make them barely able to move yet they run as normal these are problems i found they are not so obvious when you just shoot random animals and have fun but when you are aiming for high socre or trying to complete some missions such problems will pop out for those who repeatly empathize on so called realistic simulator i do not recall there is such a footstep highlighting threat dedecting and automatic tracking smart device in real life in conclusion a lot of simulator games today use reality as gimmick yet the so called reality is not so easily simulated if not dealt well it will compromise both so called reality and game experience at the same time that is the reason why such game is still such a minority in the game world wondering which format do you favor more
