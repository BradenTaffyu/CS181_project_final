2017 early access review i am sorry for this game but at the current state it is not recommandable the base features are unfinished or not well executed fluid simulation is too slow and lacks depth and farming food is confusing although the idea of this game is great updates are released too slow and it looks like there is no real plan for the finished product i hope that this will be fixed not by adding new confusing content like germs but by creating a good idea of how the finished product should look like and streamlining the existing content and then adding new concepts and more buildings
