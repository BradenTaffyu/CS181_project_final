2018 honestly i love the total war series i enjoy their games and playing them very much but i hate what it has become really i wish this was a good review but on principle i can t recommend this game not at full price of 71 99 cad i got it on sale and some might even say i was still ripped off but whats done is done the dlc luring in this game is as bad as it was in the previous release total war atilla you get like a handful of factions most of which aren t even that interesting that are available to you to play but realistically there s only five races you can actually play empire dwarves bretonnia vampires and orcs everything other faction race is pretty much locked unless you pau for it what kind of money grabbing is this the game is only as enjoyable until the faction s you play with get boring after awhile what happened to the old total war days where if you wanted to unlock another faction you needed to destroy that faction in campaign for them to be available to you sure there was some dlc in medieval 2 but at least those were completely new campaign experiences now they re basically selling you a game at full price and giving you half the factions available you need to pay almsot double the games normal price to have all content available its just not worth it at that point shame on you ca i may have bought this game and do enjoy the little i do receive from it but i m hell bent on bringing their ratings down if it means making a damn difference to their appraoch
