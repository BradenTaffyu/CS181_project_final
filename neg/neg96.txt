2021 early access review i bought this game for 20 dollars back in 2011ish before steam when pz was on desura i think it s been almost 10 years later and not much has changed truthfully project zomboid was one of the first games i ever played when i got into pc gaming it s great to see steady focused and continued work but its sour in my mouth when you consider the times its taken to get to the state it s in now i ve not recommended this game for a very simple reason it s not good enough it has every element that draws a hardcore survivalist in it has complex systems and features that make the world feel real and it does a fantastic job of putting you in the shoes of a survivor in a zombie outbreak but it s just not enough to draw attention to the disappointment i feel let me illustrate how long it has taken the devs to do anything of note there are no npc s which is slated for build 43 and developments currently in 41 build 40 was stable in oct 2018 and v41 started in october 2019 where it remains now it s utterly unacceptable in my opinion to ride the flow of early access in order to develop things that should take half the time it s not like pz has funding issues the game has been heavily respected for years now with a good playerbase and i imagine equally solid sales it s just unfortunate to see something that could ve been the defining game of a sub genre merely be a back marker whats ironic about this is that if they just didn t take years to implement game changing and game enchancing systems i would wholeheartedly recommend this game yet where pz is right now is where it should have been years ago update 4 23 2022 so by the jester awards you can tell things did change multiplayer is now a feature in b41 and works really well npc s are now in development ableit will take a bit for tis to get right the new foraging system is also here too the only thing that still remains as a negative criticism is the long development cycles yes it is indeed true we have multiplayer and a lot of the long awaited content however do note that probably one of the only reasons the development cycle sped up was because of pz becoming the new thing for a couple months tis still takes such a long time to implement the content they seek to bring to players as an avid follower of the thursdoids i recognize a lot of setbacks have occurred but if we even take that into account i would not be surprised if we got npc s either in q4 2022 or in 2023 so again it s frustrating how long it all takes months are fine years not so much does this change that this should have been pz 5 years ago nope not at all game is almost 12 years old btw
