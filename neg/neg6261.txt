marvel snap is a 12 card deck building game pitting your favorite or most hated leech marvel characters against each other in a best 2 out of 3 lane scenario lead by former hearthstone maestro ben brode seconddinner has crafted a terrific gameplay experience that is somewhat marred by questionable pricing the game is f2p however with weekly card releases monthly season pass cards you will find yourself needing to spend money if you want to keep pace with the current meta questionable balancing sometimes very frustrating meta a large issue i find with the game is the consistent release of overpowered cards which are then heavily nerfed sometimes to the point of total uselessness this has become the norm for most season pass cards which inspires a feeling of good card rental it feels very much like a bait switch situation and at 10 while maybe not a pocket breaker is still 10 that can feel totally wasted seconddinner is a relatively small development team as such each patch to address rampant meta ends up being 2 or so months after many people have already built decks with or around these meta defining cards it should be expected at least to some degree that buffs nerfs will happen however i d argue seconddinner has yet to figure out a solid way to manage them as it comes to card acquisition once you ve completed series 3 you are effectively thrown into the big play pool with everybody else getting s3 complete isn t too terribly long a process however after that you will never be card complete again which the devs have specified they do not want unless you decide to spend a lot of money series 4 series 5 cards are available through spotlight caches or tokens which are incredibly hard to come by can take a very long time to gather which according to seconddinner provides the best opportunity to get new cards is nothing more than a roulette wheel it will take you many collection levels which are gained by upgrading cards not their abilities but whether the art is 3d animated etc to gather multiple keys this costs another type of currency which is much easier to come by as daily challenges provide them but the distance between each spotlight key can be demanding when a spotlight cache does come around with a card or card s you want you are not guaranteed to get it each week the spotlight cache provides 4 options a brand new card to everyone 2 card variants for previously released cards a random card that turns to spotlight tokens if you get a duplicate of a card you already have so for each spotlight you will need at least 4 keys to guarantee the brand new card some weeks you might get that new card immediately some weeks it may take every key you have other weeks if you don t have enough keys you may not get it at all the variant art for the cards just like every other type of art is incredibly subjective from artists like skottie young peach momoko to dan hipp rian gonzales ymmv and while it can feel fantastic to nail that new card with the first key it s always a gamble it s even harder to want to spend the keys if you re treated to other cards you a don t use b don t like the variant for or c have been nerfed so hard it s not worth the risk the overall gameplay is absolutely solid the modes ladder conquest are fine but at the end of the day this game does want access to your wallet it s f2p friendly to a degree but i don t personally see it holding attention for too long after you ve hit series 3 complete are languishing without some of the newer cards there are plenty of examples with people succeeding claiming to be f2p so it s very possible however it also seems much much harder if you re a die hard marvel fan you ll want to play this if you like card battlers you ll want to play this it is fun but boy can it get to be a frustration
