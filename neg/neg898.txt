2016 fallout 4 ain t terrible game but it is the worst mainline fallout game quest design is mostly trash dialogue design is pure diarrhea dialogues themselves range from verbal diarrhea to decent depending on what writer handled what character but basically there are almost no actual choices to be made the main questline is poor with no sense of closure or interesting resolution that would reflect anything the player does nice atmosphere and music though anyway go read rpgcodex net review it is the most comprehensive analysis of this game go read it especially if you work for bethesda
