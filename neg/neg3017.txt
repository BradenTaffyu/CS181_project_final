2018 the 2 0 update has ruined the game the game now revolves around chores and frustrating mechanics want to attack and take another empires systems sure you just need to fill out this system claim form 2b1 oh you dont have the influence to do that well thats too bad oh i see you now have the infleance great did you grind out the fleet and navy capacity techs to wage the war with no well more waiting for you ok ok i see you have the navy fleet cap and influence lets get this war started looks you you did pretty well and smashed the enemy but theres just one little thing you forgot to occupy one listed claim system under form 2b1 add the war timer ran out looks like we have to force you into a white peace now because reasons the game is a lesson in frustration now and flat out boring gone is the sense of exploration and finding cool story events its just a mess of busy work and bureaucracy came back to check out nemesis game in general is even more of a bureaucratic slog after all the updates with menus upon menus of micromanagement and convoluted systems playing determined exterminator or devouring swarm instantly cuts half the terrible systems in half as those empires dont need them and the game is enjoyable then but if thats not your play style well look elsewhere because you are not going to have fun
