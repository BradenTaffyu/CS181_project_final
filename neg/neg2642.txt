pay to win would be a kind term for this game their premium tanks are 2 steps over any tanks that can be researched worst matchmaking in history of pvp games ever you have a personal rating that is used for absolutely nothing where people with 2k rating can be in the same match as people with 8k and if you sum the score of the teams there will be a huge difference the tanks that can be researched are totally unbalanced same tier same category the differences between them are huge one having less damage less armor and less speed than the other one bottom line is a game that was developed by some ancient form of human being because i refuse to believe that someone actually used his brain to design and code for this
