2023 product received for free edit as of august 23rd 2023 under construction original reviewedit i was a bit heated at the time and have deleted a paragraph the review should still make sense i think everything i left is still relevant making this edit on 4 17 2023 with a lot more hours in the game review should also be more steam friendly and with less assumptions multiple other edits fixing some formatting and spelling i m actually still fixing stuff and i m gonna stop with all the unnecessary edit s will try to make a major update again soon summary of the current pc state of hogwarts legacy short version1 denuvo anti temper is in the game without any confirmation that it will be removed despite it already being cracked 2 currently as of this review nvidia has not released a proper game ready driver for hogwarts legacy still relevant as of 4 17 2023 3 most recent patch notes on steam february 25th 2023 are for the day one patch 10 feb 2023 sidenote the last update posted march 8th 2023 right now should be relevant 4 optimization is horrid performance is all over the place the game can be virtually unplayable for some despite their hardware being top of the line and great for people with much worse hardware tons of bugs confusing menus control issues controller issues pc binding issues in game bugs etc 5 april 18th 2023 less horrible and confusing marketing communication support for all versions especially pc with multiple accounts and account links being required to redeem things there are a lot of exclusive items quests that are or are going to be unavailable soon as of february 26th including ps exclusive quest twitch cosmetic drops pre order bonuses etc 8 graphics art style atmosphere music sound is absolutely top notch truly amazing 7 gameplay is very hard to describe some might love it some might hate it it s a mishmash of mechanics from many genres with a harry potter theme slapped onto it i personally think it s great as for me it ticks all the boxes long versioni received this as a gift from a friend and meanwhile i like the game itself let me walk you through the current state of what s going on from a somewhat objective point of view so you can make an informed decision about this product before buying it the game has severe performance problems anyone who says it runs fine on their pc without implementing additional workarounds is incredibly lucky there is no universal workaround because of how it hugely varies depending on your system programs overclock settings bios settings windows version update version for windows etc there are people with 4090s getting 50fps people with 1080ti s getting 60 constant people with rtx3070ti cards getting 30 on low while others with those same cards have the roles completely reversed some can t even launch the game rtx suite features are mostly absolutely botched on pc this includes dlss ray tracing scaling dlaa etc in summary it s an incredibly poor pc release port warner avalanche wizarding world portkey games have delved into some very intentionally misleading practices or they are absolutely incompetent there are a million different people managing this game on social media and the various platforms and currently the state of the game is absolutely a little less horrible on pc despite the very positive rating on steam the community is completely split by hardcore harry potter fans who defend it with every tooth and nail and say that it s a 10 10 game of the year people who are trying to boycott it because of some political issues with jk rowling on twitter over things she said a long while ago others who don t understand how pc s work are saying that you should just upgrade your pc if it runs badly meanwhile some are calling everything a conspiracy theory and disregarding factual evidence you can easily find online and so on i would personally recommend not buying this until it s 20 bucks with all content put in the game and fixed on pc if it ever gets fixed also if you re thinking of trying it out to see if it runs well do know that the majority of pc problems happen after the several hour long intro and tutorial and even if that runs well who s to say that when you get to places like hogsmead it wouldn t suddenly choke itself point is that you may not be able to refund it on steam because the refund policy is 2 hours or less playtime game purchased less than 2 weeks ago
