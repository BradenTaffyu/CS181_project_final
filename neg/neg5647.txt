2015 it s a solid game it has its moments it s competent you see i was searching to express the good parts of rome 2 and i can t quite reach the words it s awesome get it now like i would about most other total war titles that must mean that i m mixed about rome 2 and after some pondering i don t think i ll recommend it to my friends rome 2 is in itself a solidly designed strategy and if it weren t for the other titles in the series i d probably like it more it certainly has a few things going for it it s different and modernised enough so that you don t feel like it s the same as its predecessors the battles are mostly entertaining modern graphics and there are some nice design additions they ve introduced a system where armies level up and gain traits even though they need to stock up on new recruits they retain their unit tradition a good addition that mimics the way real life legions retained their own unit s traditions stories habits and in jokes over time case in point legio ix hispana the ninth about which a few novels and films where made agents and generals matter a lot now and you can level them up in different ways which makes you pay much more attention to individuals some design decisions are a bit wonky they ve done away with the family tree which removes immersion from your lineage the political system is good in theory but fairly annoying in practice everyone hates you anyway you now have a limit to the number of your armies which takes away a lot of the fun of managing your empire the building system is convoluted and ultimately not engaging ultimately my biggest gripe with r2 is that i feel it lacks in flair and immersion the little things add up from the interface the music and the unit cards and limited rosters to the fact that it all feels game y from the weird build tech trees to the general abilities and the all too many unit stats there s no real passion for the ancient era flowing from r2 it could just as easily be a heroes title or some other decent strategy game it s not a bad game it s just the other total wars are better so why play this one
