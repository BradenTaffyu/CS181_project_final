2020 i m sorry but splitting the game into chunks only to later sell it for waaaay over 60 is something we shouldn t support i bought this game before all the dlcs started coming out so let s see i paid 60 to get the game then dlcs started coming out for 10 30 a piece so i need to pay more than 60 to get the full experience if you the reader buy a bundle on sale for less than 60 you are in a better spot why am i being punished for buying the game earlier should i have waited a year until the game is a complete product and buy it on sale good to know conclusion for civ vii don t buy the game until a few years after it launches and all the stripped game mechanics aka dlcs are out and sold on a cheap bundle on some black friday deal
