2021 early access review this game used to be fun but honestly after spending over 100 hours in it i can finally say it s been ruined by the dev s intent to make the player mad i get that there s no pause function because it would break the physics not like it s been done with so many other titles my guy what a excuse and that the jerky broken physics are a feature but what s the point in spending time playing this if the end result is just being pissed off it genuinely feels like the last year of development has just been a desperate plea to youtubers to make more videos on it no one s doing a lets play lets add a new feature where you die randomly still no views lets make the car overheat and explode more often still no views how about another buggy character that pays less money than the fuel costs to complete a task i m not saying i want an easy game i just don t want to be on for no reason when i m trying to enjoy myselfi guess if you like getting on it s a great gameedit forgot to mention it s exactly the kind of game where you d expect the dev to give up halfway through development and guess what he s announced the sequel whilst my summer car is still in early access this game isn t finished and he s started on the next game don t spend your money expecting him to finish this game i m sure he s gonna drop it like hot and start charging you even more money for my winter car which lets be honest highly likely to be exactly the same game but with different textures
