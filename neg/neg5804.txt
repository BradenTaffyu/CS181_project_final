2018 update a problem that has literally bricked the game launcher triggered my anti virus no reason for it and it was eventually fixed via a work around i refuse to compromise my computer s security because the developers are too lazy to fix their own launchers still very buggy things the fan base asked for i e better diplomacy e g trade regions has not been included and in its stead lots of pointless dlc have been added i e blood and gore for 1 99 all the while not really doing anything to fix the bugs
