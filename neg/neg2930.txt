2016 stellaris lacks something to me replayability while indeed you can customise your civilisation to your liking and each small change can affect your game and how you play this still leaves a very similar experience what the likes of euiv has is that each country is unique and will drastically alter how you play in stellaris everyone starts off in nearly the exact same position and you ll be undertaking nearly the exact same actions each time you play and the map is bland and has no meaning or history obviously but it has no significance outside of resources i have an honest 70 hours or so the other 100 was spent on the main menu i believe and while that can be considered good value for money to many people considering i have over 600 hours on euiv and will undoubtedly keep going back to it this leaves stellaris to my mind a bit lacking i feel it lacks personality it s bland as a side note inter state diplomacy is annoyingly sparse in options and scope and the sector management is pitiful committing an entire sector to either energy credits minerals or science forgive me if this has since been added but there should be an option to maximise each planets resources within that sector based on what s present you can respect tile resources but i don t believe that means the ai will prioritise what s there it may instead turn to those tiles last and as a result many sectors run out of minerals or credits and you have to continually feed them those resources and if they build up thousands of spare resources they aren t using and you want them tough luck you can t get your mitts on them in essence it gets boring quite quickly again quickly for a paradox grand strategy if you want something akin to ck ii victoria ii or eu iv this is not it however if you want something like those games but more accessible this could be for you but stellaris last i played was severaly lacking in common sense tools for empire management and any kind of attraction for replaying
