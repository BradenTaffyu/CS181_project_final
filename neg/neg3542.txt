early access review this game makes you have no life 633 hours sunk in some weeks i have 60 hours of ark logged and that is low compared to some tribes i mostly played smalltribes pvp and it was active and fun at the beginning so many client crashes low server stability that eventually got better the main issue is the player base we had to compete against against tribes that had an advantages we didn t have speed hacking ghost mode auto flak equip auto aim and various account sharing tribes it eventually becomes to much it wears you down we eventually retreated and rebuilt in an underwater rat hole that requires you to have a vacuum chamber to crouch and get in it s below a pearl cave most know the spot well we were winding down due to inactivity and low pop it s almost been 4 months and still no server transfers enabled and probably will be 6 months till a map comes out well we discovered today that we were dev wiped and all global banned from all official servers for violating code of conduct specifically unintended build location well that was the final nail in the coffin in a totally legit non cheating tribe it s a gray area and we had no idea as it s a fairly popular youtube base location i actually feel relief that i can have a life thank you wildcard you
