2022 hot trash x com wannabe anime game pros it has a decent animesque mini stories and characters the anime drawings look good it allows you to replay all missions and aparently nothing is missable there s a gear and skill system for each character there s some rudimentary crafting which can be usefull if you can find the materials to use it there s a food buff system you can build small robots for one of your characters one of your characters can tame monsters and use themsome things are real deal breakers character graphics are super ugly and don t match the anime portraits it takes forever to farm enough gear and masteries no respect whatsoever for the players time skills are very limited and most items basic attacks are locked behind stamina and cooldown system this is so stupid you d thing someone would make it up difficulty is all accross the board you can wipe a mission and then into the next one and get hammered baddly there s tons of loadings all and even in a good pc it s going to take a while missions can take more than an hour to go throughit s cool to have a masteries and gears but you shouldn t gate the gameplay around these blocking dodge armor get absolutely ridiculous by mid game it becomes an all or nothing system magic can be blocked enemies can block and dodge even if they are stunned the consumable system makes no sense it gives you charges to use items and even if you use a single charge the item gets deleted after the mission this is especially eggregious with devices that instead of being recharged have to be bought or crafter again dude why item sets are trash it s a huge chore to farm items to do crafting bestiary doesn t work properly crafting system feels like it s from a cheap mmo the whole game feels like an alpha build instead of a finished product the story goes nowhere and it s made with dlc and sequels in mind there s few images in late game and often the story told doesn t match the image game crashes and disconnects very often in late game there s a multiplayer hub that makes no sense and they put the shops there if you want to go shop you need to wait for the loading screen then again to go back around mission lv50 every enemy can easily kill any of your guys in a single turn if the rng is not in your favor and 50 vs 11 always drags out battles and a couple bad rolls are enough to fail the mission or having to the reload the lack checkpoint very little makes sense in the gameplay design and you ll end up feeling like you control a party of weaklings against enemies with higher stats and better abilities across the board especially when get to face clowns in the dlcthe worst of it all is that you re going to spend most of the time either preparing for missions or inside missions watching enemies moving around the time you actually spend controlling your characters is less than 10 of the game you 11 guys against like 50 to a 100 enemies each taking their time to take their turn i really feel like a jackass looking at this nonsense and this is on max speed which they even warn you breaks the game sound
