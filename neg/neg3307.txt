2017 hearts of iron 4i ve been a long time fan of paradox their games cover most european and worldwide history from roman times in eu rome to modern times with the hearts of iron series passing by the medieval times with crusader kings the renaissance and the birth of world spanning empires in europa universalis to the industrial revolution and its social and economical consequences with the victoria series entering in the paradox fold with europa universalis 3 in nomine and soon after the divine wind expansion i started buying most of their games and playing them unto oblivion their modding policy became a haven for those with the will and wits to create enormous game changing mods and their constant dedication to their games with patches and expansions was refreshing even if it generated much debate in the company s forums due to pricing policy but this video concerns hearts of iron so let me talk about my time with the series hearts of iron 3 was not to my liking due to its very much in depth handling of the war and the boring and stale peace time but i did have experience with darkest hour a hearts of iron game an awesome standalone expansion for hearts of iron 2 it is quite an old engine with features that are very rough around the edges but the modding scene for it saw the rise of awesome alternate history mods such as new world order kaiserreich legacy of the weltkrieg and many others these mods handled the possible outcomes of their alternate scenarios through the very moddable events and decisions which allowed revolutions elections wars and the many incurring changes in world politics that these might entail and to get further into the point i d like to reach in this video i d like to talk about hearts of iron 4 the newest entry to one of paradox s most beloved franchises i have a love hate relationship with this game it is very much accessible to wider audiences something that hearts of iron 3 failed to deliver but it simply lacks the defining characteristic of paradox games immersion i can guarantee you that i am easily immersed even civilization games can fully immerse me into the world i m playing i forget that i m playing a video game and rather feel like a god controlling the fate of the little civilization which is represented on the maps by numbers and a bunch of 3d models yet to me look like sprawling cities and whole armies crusader kings 2 and europa universalis 4 were supremely immersive games ck2 s character and trait system brought a sense of life throughout the whole world i was playing while you re out uniting ireland under the rule of your petty clan the byzantine empire may be fighting sunnis in the holy land the petty dukes of italy may be scheming against each other the reconquista brings all manner of petty wars between lords of differing faith in the iberian peninsula while when i struggled to unite italy in eu4 i knew that france and england were fighting over the control of the french mainland that the spanish empire colonized and conquered the new world that muscowy struggled to unite russia that the ottomans were on their way to create their sprawling empire that the holy roman empire fought its religious wars in the struggle to keep itself united i believe you know where i m going with this even while you played in one section of the world the rest of it was alive there were competitors who fought for land cultures being converted religions being spread empires rose and fell technology advanced new nations were formed every game felt like an adventure to the unknown some things usually always happen like spain having a huge colonial empire but what if this time it s france that s gonna get this empire or what if you re now competing with spain for the juicy colonies you both now desire all of this gave a sense of life to the game as if countries and characters had their own objectives and ambitions undefined by linear paths but rather pushed towards it thanks to their countries or traits modifiers this is what i call a sandbox game nothing is forced to take one shape or the other it is pushed towards the shape but events and rng can throw this off the rails and lead to completely crazy situations this is what i find loveable in paradox games which is why i was very much hype for hearts of iron 4 the developers publicized it being a sandbox instead of a linear game like hearts of iron 3 sadly hearts of iron 4 s sandbox is no sandbox at all it is a mere collection of linear paths that constantly clash with each other and lead to stupid and very much unlikeable situations hearts of iron 4 feels dead and stale you build buildings you recruit armies which are inane numbers on a screen and nothing else goes on nothing is organic like it was in eu4 and ck2 and let me explain why states and provinces their only defining characteristic is population and buildings no culture no ideology everyone in it is equal and when you conquer it their population will not even define your political compass at all it s just more numbers to add up to your senseless war machine you don t feel like you have a reason to do most what you re doing you only do so because you need x resource or because the focus tree tells you to do so why can t i save my communist brothers trapped in that dirty fascist country why can t i unite an ethnic group under one banner to stand against the world together why doesn t a population of another culture or with another prominent ideology revolt or give me trouble why can t i convert a state s population to my ideology in order to give trouble to other countries conquering it i sometimes found a reason to fight against another country thanks to the claim system you could claim that a state rightfully belongs to you then core it which means its culture and ideology drifted towards your country s own and i do this with much imagination because the game provides me no reason to believe this what coring is nations they have no identity only their ideology which is a supremely abstract cheese wheel germany is not german it just has more brown in its pie chart than blue or red or grey this pie chart is only modified through propaganda from other countries and a minister who can apparently convince the whole country to believe in fascism color me surprised i mean brown otherwise nations are a collection of buildings and manpower and their boundaries are strictly bound to their cores which can only be increased through events and the like so germany is a collection of cores in central europe nothing else to distinguish it from the rest of the world focus trees this is where the sandbox goes out the window the big dog nations are not sandboxy they merely have a collection of linear paths to follow that barely take into account the world stage so communist germany might go to war with communist france over alsace lorraine because of a focus ussr would go to war with red germany because a focus says so everything that happens is bound to focus trees remove the focus trees and absolutely nothing would happen focus trees should be what pushes a nation towards one action or the other but not a strict definition of all that should happen but enough rambling from me i think i ve thrown my point across and far beyond hoi4 is not a sandbox it s a collection of linear paths that clash and mash with each other with little regards to authenticity and to the way a sandbox is supposed to work i may have blurted a whole lot of bad words about hoi4 but i do so because i believe in its potential as i ve believed in the potential of all pdox games before it s a collection of neat ideas that need much much refining to become a fully fledged singleplayer game worthy of entering paradox s hall of fame
