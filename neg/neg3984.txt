2017 an alright game far from a simulator by any means lacks on graphics and physics compared to other games out there also missing a lot of wanted features that iracing has been saying will come for years most servers you can t even race on because there are no players joining it about 75 of the servers are completely empty and iracing just keeps making it better by putting more series in which then spreads the dwindling poulation out even more so then you get even more empty servers out of the 5 years i have been here the daily membership count just keeps going down and down in 2013 it wasn t abnormal to have 5 6 thousand people online at one time now you re lucky if you can get on with 3 thousand people online but normal these days is 1 5 thousand protest system is a joke and the moderators are completely bias unless you have a high irating or a popular name within the iracing community you will be at fault for everything you get protested for if you have a high irating or a popular name you can wreck whoever and whatever you wan t and not even get a slap on the wrist so you better hope you re a popular driver otherwise you re probably gonna get banned ridiculously overpriced compared to other racing games assetto corsa 29 99 one time fee rfactor2 31 99 one time fee iracing 149 per year 14 95 for every car and track like it s a borderline cashgrab that right there should tell you not to support such a greedy company they also just recently upped their membership prices a few months ago too and honestly after time you realize that iracing is just another game out there and there really is no need for spending so much money on it when assetto corsa is just as good for a fraction of the price and you wanna know the best part you will get banned for getting into accident s on the track yepp all those dollars you handed over to iracing and they ban you so you can t use any of it makes sense right hell i ve seen people get banned indefinetely for not even getting into accident s but saying something a moderator didn t like yepp hundreds of dollars and hours down the drain because a mod didn t like what you said that s what iracing is
