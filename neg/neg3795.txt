2019 early access review seriously flawed and possibly never going to be ready or even half decent 7 days to die is seriously fun survival game with minecraft type building a very fun ground morphing and eroding system universal block health system and myriad of very fun ideas for a game like this but it is also marred by technical issues the game needs way too much gpu power for what it looks like it eats any gpu to 100 even at moderate settings and pushes fps of 40 at times when you need good fps the most almost everything works like morrowind 40 of fifty percent of the time combat is bad game hitching is bad server hitching is bad trying to track zombies for melee or shooting is hard when they have tendency to shift around thanks to laggy netcode and such almost nothing related to actual gameplay works alpha 17 birds die with their alive flying animation for ding s sake to enjoy 7 days to die you have to enjoy it s crafting gathering and building because exploration is a must that comes with fighting zombies and you have to really ignore how bad that part of the gameplay is to enjoy the rest i like this game for building and gathering but the pile of problems that is everything gameplay and such i cannot ignore anymore i broken enough things out of extreme frustration this game induces through sheer non functionality as far as things look only one or two developers working actively on the game early access money that probably ran out a long time ago and one person employed to work on ps4 version that should not exist when the game is in such state it is i cannot recommend this game except for building and even then i hope you dodged it s current full price as low as you could get
