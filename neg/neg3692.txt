2021 early access review this post review has been deleted before spread the message tfp does not want you to know stole this from another review but i agree 100 so re posting it tl dr devs make money hand over fist on this game so stop defending them for spending seven years in alpha and hold them accountableper the fun pimps 7dtd sold over 11 million copies the game sells on pc for 24 99 and on console for 29 99 console outsold pc to overcompensate for sales let s drop that to 7 per copy and pretend the game sold only 11 million copies exactly steam takes 30 of every sale and physical stores and digital retailers do too according to a 2019 report by ign so we ll reduce that accordingly to 53 900 000 over 7 years federal income tax in the us for corporations used to be 35 at the top bracket that dropped in 2018 but we ll be generous texas has no state corporate income tax ignoring any possible deductions to maximize tax payment that leaves 35 035 000 over 7 years the company said they had 25 team members on their web page from 2017 they started with only three the average software developer according to the bureau of labor statistics makes 106 000 a year the median is lower software developer is the highest paid job in its category we will assume every member of their team is an average earning software developer working full time from day one even though we know that isn t true that s 18 550 000 in wages over 7 years so let s chop that out too leaving 16 485 000 in profit over 7 years there was also a 506 000 kickstarter being generous let s say kickstarter takes 10 and round down that s 450 000 but hey that s chump change so let s say that entire cash influx went into the pledge rewards and not even count it so ultra conservatively tfp makes net 2 mil in profit a year rounded down as a company calculated by maximizing every cost while slashing the value of every sale by 72 realistically they probably more than double that tell me more about how this small company needs more money and time to finish their project and how patient players should be and how after seven years it s unreasonable to expect the game to even enter beta
