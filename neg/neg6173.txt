2023 here s the thing i love this game i think it s an awesome game but i cannot recommend it for the moment because game breaking bugs are frequent and bad they are doing a good job of patching but without the toybox mod i would have encountered completely game breaking bugs in both chapter 2 and 3 and several companion events could not be completed due to game breaking bugs that prevent progress i am currently dead stopped in chapter 4 as i have enountered yet another game breaking bug but toybox can t fix it as it s a quest progress issue every time i try to launch the last remaining quest in my log i instead am treated to a replay of the very first event that happens in chapter 4 i m then dumped into the captains quarters with no progress i can go back out to space try again happens again validating files doesn t fix it reloading from an earlier save doesn t fix it leaving the system and coming back doesn t fix it relaunching the game doesn t fix it reinstall doesn t fix it nothing i can conceivably do has fixed the issue this is the fourth or fifth time the game has left me at a dead stop with nothing to do but rely on a mod to port me out of locked areas you can t move on from or sit and wait for the devs to fix it i definitely want to recommend this game because the content is fantastic but in its current state it is far too likely to break and leave you stuck
