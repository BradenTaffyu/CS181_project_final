2018 2 0 broke the game if you have the chance to play on 1 9 do it it s far superior in every regard reasoning the new hyperlane system is horrendously slow and grinds this already very time consuming game to a near standstill the announced space terrain is hardly noticable and if you happen to notice anything it s 99 a black hole making your ships even slower the new pirates make no sense at all if you snuff them out they shouldn t return 3 months later with a 30 bigger fleet and in a system you are surveying atm paradox also has proven themselves unable to fix the enigmatic fortress which has been in the game for over a year there is only 1 ftl tech left jump drives and psi jump drives are jump drives only in name what they actually are is just slightly better hyperdrives expansion is only possible by spamming starbases no more border bloat which in essence would be good if it weren t for the fact that you buy this little improvement with so much tedium the visual noise is also about 90 worse than ever before since there are an approximately 20 new icons that all have to be displayed at every moment along with the annoying hyperlane network itself epic long lasting wars no longer exist since war exhaustion mechanic causes the warring factions to curl up and cry after about 2 3 fleet combats which doesn t make sense at all if you still have tons of ships left and are swimming in minerals basically paradox took away lots of gameplay and content the little content they added is broken and yes i will delete this review if they fix this blunder
