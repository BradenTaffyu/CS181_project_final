2022 don t starve would be a good game if it didn t also have a horrendous lack of tutorialization i can understand and respect the way it expects you to learn certain things on your own but certain mechanics are far too obtuse to be found on one s own in a reasonable capacity it s the kind of game that is overwhelmingly praised by people who were either obsessive enough to repeatedly play through the exact same routine until they unwittingly stumbled upon some obscure poorly conveyed mechanic or people who cave and resort to using the wiki or some other community sourced information whether they admit to it or not while i find the former bizarre i m glad they enjoyed the game i empathise more with the latter but only because the game so hideously fails to provide essential information to the player that they cannot be expected to glean such information as far as i can tell don t starve intends to create a situation of trial and error where the player is able to glean useful information through experimentation as embodied by its main character wilson the wannabe scientist where this falls apart is that with science in the real world you have the means of working with the full potential of reality to elucidate yourself by gathering precise and workable information don t starve is not the real world it is a simulated game world and as such it needs to give concessions to the player in regards to relaying the potential possibilities that exist in its simulated world what a simulated world has that the real world does not is a massive void of logical dead ends potentially anything could be possible but reasonably only a very limited amount of potential possibilities could be properly embodied by a simulation these voids need to be filled through the game in some manner i don t even think it necessarily needs to be easy it just needs to be intuitive enough that the player can reach solutions logically rather than by grasping at straws in the dark don t starve is also very punishing the world is very harsh and unforgiving and any wrong step leads the player to being unceremoniously killed sometimes players need not even make a wrong turn and trouble will arbitrarily come down on them by nature of the game s mechanics thus leaving them unable to even glean a useful lesson from their failure compound this with its somewhat awkward controls and you have a very punishing game what you are left with is a world that is a very obtuse requiring you to experiment to gain new information and only successfully providing useful output a proportionally small amount of the timeandb very challenging incentivising you to play it safe and avoid toeing the line if you fail to see the issue here i ll spell it out for you don t starve severely wastes your time it deliberately creates a situation in which it is unreasonably difficult to glean useful information on the purpose of resources at your disposal while at the same time punishing you for going off the beaten path and trying new things the vast majority of time due to the vast glut of logical dead ends it arrays before you it punishes far more than it rewards and it does so in a severe way this is somewhat offset by a somewhat engaging gameplay but it is ultimately not enough especially once the repetition starts to become tedious as you struggle to push into the game s later mechanics if your time is suitably worthless or no other games appeal to you then you ll love this game because despite having no respect for your time it s rather charming and has a fairly satisfying progression otherwise don t bother
