this game is 80 dlc and now they are doing this subscription bs paradox are hopelessly addicted to money and are trying to squeeze water from a rock with all the ways they monetize everything the subscription was the final straw for me all good faith with this company is gone and will not come back unless they take back the subscription and admit to their money hungry ways which are harming this games development they have put much more care into ensuring their game is profitable as possible while neglecting the actual quality of the content they push out this game and all its dlc is very easy to find for free online but you shouldn t do that bc thats illegal
