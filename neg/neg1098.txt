2018 writing story and world building take a back seat to brand recognition and flashy graphics which aren t that good mind you the world is fairly interesting to explore which is the only thing the game is really good for considering most of the quests in the game are unsatisfying fallout 4 strips away everything you like about a fallout game chucks in some one dimensional characters and some guns and leaves it at that the world s boring the areas genuinely seem like they were made as replicas to real life counterparts rather than focusing on story depth and good gameplay stats barely matter and there is no player choice
