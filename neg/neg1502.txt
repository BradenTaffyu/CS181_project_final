2020 early access review alrighty i honestly don t get why the there are so many positive reviews i think people are just happy that bannerlord is playable after all these years of waiting however this gives the wrong message to taleworlds we need to give honest feedback to get better results anyway back to the review i can describe the game in a couple words it s simply garbage why do i think this way stability of the empire bannerlord well first of all just a manner of pr taleworlds described an early access version itself as stable to play ironically the game is not stable and u can t hide this behind a level 3 city wall you can say of course yeah but they are fixing and are patching everyday yeah sure but then u can ask yourself if they did enough testing and if these things could not have been prevented the basics in my opinion bannerlords needs to build on the basic of the previous versions sadly these are lacking basics like questing building relation and kingdom management i m not revering to bugs with these one more like in game mechanics that are essential to play the game engaging in diplomacy feels clunky example convincing an in game lord to fight for your side and succeeding at this that would have been useful if i don t have to barter afterwards for his allegiances also unreasonable request what s the point in having social skills then and the first dialogue where he agrees with you another example can be managing a kingdom hooray i have a kingdom let s declare war on those filthy desert rats oh wait u can t i m very disappointed in the kingdom management balancing i m bit shocked that there is no balancing hotfix the game is not balanced at all first of all the cultures are a disgrace the one is clearly stronger than the other and some of advantages are so incredibly boring more exp for troops more movement speed in this bio this is a shame the cultures need way more identity if i was from a culture that are distinctive as fast snow walkers or tree hugger i would probably genocide my own people lol give more meaning to these advantages also i don t see why it must be restricted with only one advantage per cultures make it interesting to pick units well about the units of each faction is hard to tell by only my observations so i m going to leave that part feel free to add opinions about that if u known more however is it only me or do looters have an expert accuracy with stones if throw a stone i would be happy if i hit a large truck instead of the small cat that i was aiming for at 50m for some reason they hit 80 headshots at a ridiculous range this is a bit unrealistic trading it does feel really unbalanced i get the feeling that the one faction has much more resources and thus more trade options than the other this is a map based balance of town productions it would be a gameplay asset if the player had more to say about this like an event maybe that your villagers have found a gold mine or something and that u can turn the production of this village shops are just a joke really lacking lot of management and is of course unbalanced it s just not done and u can see it this is also a basic from warband story the story feels like the cultures that they add it fast in the last couple weeks of release i mean 10 years and u come with talk to some lords and kill some bandits the story content is missing hard and the current state of the game does just look like a reskin if i put the content next to it general bugs there are lot of bugs who can be frustrating i m not going to judge the game by these bugs however there are tons of them examples random teleporting in the mapbandit camp skip straight to bossunit glitching siege equipmentunits spawn on roofs during a quest battle weapon bugs performance this is also a really shame aspect the game needs way more optimising sometimes due bugs the performances drop during sieges or battles try to optimise the game more so we enjoy the large scale battles because currently it s only a dream for those who have a wooden pc
