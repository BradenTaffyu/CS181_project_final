i d love to recommend f76 i just can t hidden beneath all the terrible design decisions of the past years all the grind all the endless parasitic game systems the atomic shop nickel n diming is a return to the fallout universe that can be great fun and is a delight to sink into it s just that all of those obscure the interesting content and make actually playing the game incredibly tiresome worse still bethesda have broken the contract of the tradeoffs between time and money if you have time grind stuff for free if you have money you trade that to reduce the grind and introduced everything from pay to win options like over the top broken weapons to grind that everyone has to engage in no matter how little free time you as a player might have the fallout 1st subscription is a waste of money it does nothing to alleviate the difficulties you will hit in the game after you ve played for a while there are so many artificial caps on the game s systems that everything becomes a chore it also becomes pretty clear that a number of them aren t even there because bethesda want to screw you over as a player though they re happy to do that but because their underlying database and game engine can t even begin to cope a lot of the structural design flaws of the game can be traced to the clunky attempts to force the fallout engine to run multiplayer lag in inventory lag in opening the pipboy lag in opening containers lag in moving lag in firing or using vats an initial design focus on pvp and survival mechanics that essentially got thrown out and a camp system that can t decide if it wants you build a fun set of buildings or reduce the load on the servers by limiting you as much as possible why bother buying all the items in the atomic shop when in practice it s mind numbingly difficult to even get them placed in the game world the camp systems in the game just don t work properly period trading directly to from players is a nightmare of minute long lag try capturing all the workshops in the game world you will crash the server because it s spawning too many events too quickly the list goes on but in case all of those structural issues aren t enough the season system is assured to make you truly feel a special milked cash cow in bethesda s latest attempt at player extortion every few months a season comes out you have to complete truly arbitrary objectives every day and every week to earn tickets if you aren t subscribed or buy a season pass forget about the top tier grind you won t make it at some point without much announcement those tickets will become worthless when the new season comes along what do we get as rewards maybe one or two high tier items that are worth it and everything else is cheap reskins to add insult to injury to unlock the maximum tier you must first spend enough tickets on all the low tier items you don t actually want or need most of these will turn up in an increasingly impossible to navigate ui so you can t even find what you bought starting to see a picture develop this could have been a well designed system like the original atom unlocks that just reward you for having fun and playing the game instead taken as a whole the game now has enough dailies arbitrary junk you must do garbage user interfaces and event systems that you ll be lucky if you get near actually playing the game s content nearly 500 hours in i still haven t completed the wastelanders quest line which was one of the first pieces of new content introduced post launch that s how insanely grindy and distracting the entire game structure now is i haven t even mentioned the way you ll end up caught in loops of i need caps to fast travel or buy things from player vendors but i have a weight limit which means i must walk back to traders to sell stuff but that has a caps limit on what i can sell per day so i have all this loot that i can t sell and my storage has a limit which means i can t put the loot in so why did the game give me all this crap to start with the event system means you might well run a few events but then run out of some arbitrary space in one of the game s many parasitic systems which makes running the events pointless everything has a limit everything has arbitrary guiderails preventing you from simply playing everything is built to have you the player spend more time messing about with inconvenient laggy interfaces and walking back and forth than actually having fun player engagement has become a joke where you watch a bunch of high level players face roll content and tag everything with overpowered weapons and they are often happy to let the event fail because they aren t grinding the event they re just grinding xp you re lucky if you meet a player in the world because most of them are fast travelling to the next location to grind out the daily quotas as quickly as possible competing over e g the ten gulpers in the game when it says kill 3 gulpers as a daily i do feel obliged to state that despite all the pvp and turret base nonsense that the game permits the vast majority of the community i have managed to interact with have been truly lovely helpful people hats off to all of you this isn t a game it s a money and time extortion factory and players rightly should demand better just because the skinner box is a possible game design does not make it a good choice for a game design just because some people have no addiction control and find themselves lost in this mess does not make it a good game design when players are creating alternative economies or exploiting camp glitches with destroyed items to get things where they actually want you have failed at game design when you want to create an mmo but have to artificially limit absolutely everything about people interacting you have failed at game design when you are more interested in making game structures that pull money from people than whether they have fun playing your game you might well please your shareholders for a bit but you ve still failed at game design just the longer term version when you create pay to win weapons that produce so many explosions so fast it crashes the client you have failed at game design i think bethesda could actually turn this game around and make it a quality entry in the fallout universe i just don t see any evidence that they want to
