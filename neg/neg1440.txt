2022 i want to open this review with an acknowledgement the game is fun for what it is and if you buy it you will almost certainly get your money s worth of enjoyment and then some however i cannot in good conscience recommend anyone support this absolute sham of a dev studio bannerlord released into early access eight years after its announcement in a state that looked like it had been worked on for maybe three years taleworlds is not a small indie studio with a single digit number of employees they are of a respectable size and they made a lot of money from warband yet the game was not only missing several features that had been shown off years prior but it was also in many areas a straight down grade from its predecessor while the core combat and visuals are indeed noticeably improved over warband anything to do with interacting with the world and the characters in it has suffered in the transition the devs tried to take inspiration from crusader kings and make the game into a big historical experience spanning multiple generations of procedurally generated characters but they completely half assed it and the product falls flat on its face in that area so back to the game s history the devs released the game into early access in a poor state as discussed and then proceeded to sit on their asses for the next two years making only a couple of actually significant mechanical changes amidst a sea of pointless back and forth balance patches that no one cared about except to the extent that having all of their mods broken constantly pissed them off this brings us to today launch day wherein taleworlds have exited early access entirely for marketing reasons and released an unfinished game after what we re to believe is a decade of hard work without even the excuse that early access represents it s a ridiculous farce and on principle i regret having ever purchased this game returning to my opening sentence the game is enjoyable a one hundred hour playtime speaks for itself to some extent and i have no doubt that if and when some of the major overhaul mods get off the ground i will happily if reluctantly put in hundreds more hours of playtime but as a matter of principle taleworlds for being an absolute joke of a studio and no i cannot recommend giving them money for this product honestly just go play warband instead
