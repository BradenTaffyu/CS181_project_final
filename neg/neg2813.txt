2020 so here is the deal i absolutely love this game it is one of the best strategy games i ever played and one that i am actually good at and paradox i should admit you have been doing a great job that is until 2 5 1 update where you decided to everything up with a new launcher you guys decided to take all the progress you did pack them in a pile of launcher and throw it off a cliff i must be honest singleplayer still works as intended but when a clever guy from your friends throw the idea of playing stellaris together it s just the time when ptsd kicks in the multiplayer with mods is a mess right now i was told it is a mess even without mods and dlcs alone for example today me and two of my friends spent nearly 5 hours trying to find an explanation why we have different checksums even after controlling load order and every other detail 5 times mods are essential part of this game and even though i know devs are working hard to put on the best experience out there for us they aren t enough so we need mods to make the game more immersive more aesthetic and mods are fun when they are played together too so please give us a proper launcher proper checksum system and proper multiplayer experience with mods like you used to do like you do with ck2 i really love paradox and i spent so many hours in their games from ck2 to cities skylines to stellaris i don t want to part my ways with this masterpiece of a game so as a devoted dlc slave who buys and even pre orders dlcs when he can please please give us a proper launcher
