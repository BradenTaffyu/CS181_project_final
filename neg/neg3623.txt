2023 early access review pros progression feels rewarding upkeep is necessary but not overwhelming decent crafting system partial base automationcons gameplay loop is repetitive at max trader rank tasks are limited by the type of poi in the area missions have no variance zombies have fixed spawn locations migrating to new areas traders means starting from rank 1 again progress loss vehicle progression is barely worth it everything is slow currently able to modify config files to fix this manually crafting can be harshly limited by rng went 50 hours before finding a beaker to build a chemistry station zombie ai is predictable and easily abused see killing corridor for details game has been in open alpha since 2013i need to hit that last point again it is built on a 10 year old engine it would require a full rebuild to migrate to a more capable engine at this stage further development is a sunk cost fallacy despite how much i want this game to succeed i don t expect this game to ever leave alpha last i saw the company claims to have 80 employees but it s been 8 months since the last update progress is much slower than i would anticipate for a team of that size
