kind of a how dare you feeling coming over me i supported you on launch it was awful it still is you ve not fixed the game yet but trying to sucker others in with a sale which is wrong for at least 2 reasons 1 people paid full price for your awful game and still don t have a working game give them a working game or give them a partial refund i ve even had to go back to skylines 1 2 you re selling a game to new unsuspecting people by luring them in with a discount shame on you p s the game is so so bad please don t buy it yet they ve barely made any improvements and only hackers and crackers without any tools from paradox collosal order have made the game not break after playing for an hour it s still bad and awful but without their work the game would lose all rico demand and your city would die
