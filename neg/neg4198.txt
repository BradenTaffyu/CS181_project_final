2020 great game it s really fun the graphics are amazing the mods and servers people create really bring the game to life all of that makes the game worth buying but there s one major problem and i m surprised more people don t complain about this tbh and it s the way bohemia deal with dlc control it s horrendous let me walk you through a very common scenario for me someone who s fortunate enough to own 3 dlc but not all of them i join a multiplayer game something like arma 3 king of the hill i buy my guns get into the battle and work my way towards the objective i see an enemy running across the road in the distance so i pull my gun up to take a shot my crosshair sits on the target and just as i m ready to pull the trigger boom a huge popup appears asking me to buy the dlc for the gun i m using not only does this break immersion it constantly gets me killed i m sure when people hear about this type of dlc control they just think well don t be such a loser then and pay for the dlc or wow you re lucky they even let you use guns available in dlcs isn t it worth the popup to be able to use content others had to pay for my answer is no when i paid 40 for this early access title back in 2013 it was because i believed in the product i don t know when or why it s now become okay to bombard users on websites or players in games with annoying intrusive ads until they pledge more money than they already have the world used to be simple give the game to the user that paid for it maybe offer a very good incentive to pledge more it never used to be about making the experience for existing players and normal for players who pledge more money if you want to encourage people to buy the dlc make them more fun more packed and more affordable i m sorry but 20 for a sniper and some skins is ridiculous thanks for coming to my ted talk
