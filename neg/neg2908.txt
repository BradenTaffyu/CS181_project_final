2021 the year is 2464 23 days pass every 30 seconds on the fastest setting i will win in approximately 6 uninterrupted hours if nothing forces the game to autopause oh no an event the game freezes phew it was just the results of a survey of one of the few remaining unexplored systems and not a crash to desktop the galaxy has been divided into two federations i have been insulting the strongest member of the other federation for years and they finally broke their treaties with me once the the non aggression period ends approximately 1 hour of real time on the fastest setting maybe the ais in my federation will allow me to declare war on our rivals probably not stellaris is a fantastic addictive and deeply flawed game i wish there was a maybe button for recommending it to others clearly i ve found something within it to engage me for 292 hours of gameplay early game exploration and discovery is fun managing early events and choices are fun choosing how to develop a world is fun designing new species is fun choosing the loadout on ships is fun in theory ultimately however the design choices do not feel too impactful all species regardless of origin or ethics have access to the same modes of travel and identical technology options and so they all basically play the same the rock paper scissors dynamic of kinetic energy or missile weapons preferences was patched out years ago so the ai builds the same units regardless and i cannot see attempting multi player for a game that literally takes several days of time to resolve so your design choices are basically forced into general purpose ships that are good at everything and great at nothing midgame crises can be interesting they certainly has forced me to restart many times when i failed to tech rush fast enough to counter the grey tempest or the great khan s expanding territory endgame crises were once upon a time another hard reset early after the game launch however in their current state they are meaningless speed bumps that occur too late to have any impact yes there are sliders to pick when these crises fire offthe real challenge comes from the game entering an unwinnable lag state where no empire threatens you the endgame crisis has been pacified and you basically spend hours waiting for the game to clock to the end something about populations checking for available jobs and each check just drags the processing out so by having a large population you end up too laggy to play except without a large population you cannot field a large enough fleet to reach the endgame nor would you have enough researchers to tech rush hard enough to have the necessary tools to fight in the endgame there are many other reviews and posts that document the specifics and unfortunately they are true i have never won or finished a game of stellaris once upon a time that was because it was genuinely challenging now that i can handle the intended challenges within the game the problem is stellaris itself this game has much potential again the early game is fantastic and diverse the developers appear to love the game and keep updating it and creating new content for it the modding community is huge and creative however until the intolerable laggy endgame performance is corrected i cannot honestly recommend stellaris
