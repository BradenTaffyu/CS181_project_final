annnd they re doing it again making another update that will probably set back mods that make the game worth bothering to play on a community that s largely tired of bethesda updating and ruining all their hard work instead of constantly trying to necro dead properties bethesda needs to remember why they had our support in the first place instead of pissing all over the people who s dedication and hard work is a major contributing factor to their success they need to move the eff on and make new games though at this point i m no longer sure they should even bother with that
