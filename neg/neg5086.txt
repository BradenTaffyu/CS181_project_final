2019 great game dlc attics chaos as dlc are you kidding me chaos of all things it s like making the empire a dlc what were you even thinking you greedy i can t believe we have gone from dozens of factions to cutting already limited content making things that should have been there at the launch a piecemeal dlcs i like this game i really do but i cannot condone this no way it s like purchasing a car without rearview mirrors sure you can drive but your ability to reverse properly is severely inhibited much like yeah i can play this game but my ability to enjoy it is severely limited by disgusting showcase of greed ca you have gone full and sunk even lower than ea an incredible yet incredibly undesireable achievement words cannot even explain how disappointed i am with this practice
