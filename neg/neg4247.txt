2020 one of those games that has an extremely strong start because it s fun to explore and learn the game at first but once you re over that you re just managing over complicated and tedious systems and questioning whether you re actually having fun want to know how to make a farm using all these seeds you have get ready to spend an hour watching tutorial videos in general the game design is that by keeping things simple you will have less problems to deal with but if you want to add a heater to make it so your showers and bedrooms aren t cold you will be dealing with an ever expanding to do list which makes you wonder why you even bothered in the first place there s very little joy in the mid and late game because of this games like rimworld and dwarf fortress are more interesting colony management games because the threat is external whereas the real threat in oxygen not included is playing the game and creating problems that you can t solve without knowledge from hundreds of hours of play aka repeated failure and watching tutorials
