2017 early access review so riding the wave of negative reviews i ll drop my 5 cents on one of my favourite genres of all time project zomboid is a fantastic game at it s core it s immersive fun tactical well designed it has pleasant graphics that don t compromise mechanics of the game the ai is smart the feeling of progress is present as well as reaching late stages of the game after all this is how you died and if it isn t one of the best survival zombie simulators out there however with a heavy heart i can not reccomend this game i absolutely love the zombie genre and anything with it naturally project zomboid came about in 2013 and i had to have this game i loved it at first sight but after seeing limited progression i quickly dropped it waiting for updates fast forward 3 years after the release downloaded it with a friend and had a blast playing co op together building up actual zombie forts with renewable sources of food water and wood far away from any civilization and zombies but there was something else creeping in that was boredom don t get me wrong game is fantastic in it s own right has everything it needs but it s still lacking in many areas developers are very spares with updates hyping up things that come out year after or even later if at all last time i played this in september 2016 now we have june 2017 and there was maybe 1 or 2 updates since then promised animation overhaul promised blood effects clothes zombie decay cars none of that has been implemented the game is saved by an active modding community actually adding things that the game is severly missing and more however due to limited tools and a small fanbase those mods are also quite rare and sparsely updated nevertheless if you love zombies and sims pick it up at a discount have a blast for 20 hours and just let it sit in your inventory for the moment when the devs realize that this game is a goldmine if you are not wait for official release
