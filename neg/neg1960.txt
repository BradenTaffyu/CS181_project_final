cons insanely sharky business model this game shakes its players out of every cent 75 real money only vehicles monthly premium time battle pass everything has to be unlocked but is purchasable with premium currency you would have to spend thousands thousands of to unlock everything non paying players will have to play for hours and hours with worst performing tanks and crews to match paying players unlocking modules slower reload slower repair less survivable crews etc when premium tanks aren t straight up p2w it makes gacha games look generous some of the worst map design i ve seen in any game many spawns are exposed to half the map if not directly exposed to the enemy spawn spawn camping from a safe snipy position is extremely common the reworks of maps often make them worst by just cutting entire parts of them out inexplicably players can purchase pay to win bushes the same models as the map prop to hide their vehicle in realistic ground mode the gameplay of which is entirely based on visually recognizing tanks there s no reason this should exist it goes directly against the skill and gameplay of ground combat if you want to play the ground vehicle mode get ready to get bombed by planes regardless of how skilled you are there s nothing you can do about it you can spawn spaa after planes cheaply killed you sure but low tier spaa is terribly low power compared to bombs and planes and spawning spaa right away is a risk what if no planes are in the game the dynamic between air and tanks is horrible and ruins the ground mode this compounds the spawn camping issue gigantic bombs dropped on spawns can wipe out a whole respawn wave for no effort every era has its pay to win tanks and abysmal balancing major nation vehicles have often straight upgrades on minor nations tanks matched together for no valid reason realism used as a reason to ignore basic balancing principles and unevenly applied to different nations the official forums dance of asking for sources when players ask for updates to tanks just to ignore them when valid sources are posted is sad just stop pretending to care about being accurate to reality if it s done arbitrarily and with very different scrutiny for different nations just balance a tank for the sake of balance pros the tank models are pretty the 3d artists hired do a good job i d say the damage model is fun and unique if it was consistent and devs prioritized game balance over realism there are fun moments there are fun mechanics the kills are satisfying or i wouldnt have played it for hundreds of hours but the game design is too affected by greed and too inconsistent with balancing anything stay far away
