2019 early access review alpha 18 is a relative improvement over alpha 17 while i still prefer 16 there are enjoyable new features weapons and so on i do wish quests didn t just repeatedly send you to the same 2 3 buildings with no real option to pick a different one ah yes all of my tier 5 quests are apartment building 03 or whatever they decide to call it optimization is horrendous 16 ran a mostly stable 60 on my machine but 18 runs at an often choppy sub 60 even with reduced settings was forced to downscale resolution play in windowed which is far from preferable especially given the rather unimpressive 2010 esque visuals of the game leaving little to excuse the performance for a game being sold
