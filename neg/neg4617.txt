2018 i bought the delux edition under the impression that all dlc s would come included after much anticipated wait for the rise and fall dlc to my suprize i have to buy it for 30 i have played every civ game there was but i think i will have to draw the line here i feel like you guys are taking a page from ea and are milking it to the max at this point the price of this dlc is just insane i gave this a negative review because of the rise and fall dlc overall i love the game but i think you just lost a core supporter for future games because now i know that i will have to fork out 200 for basically one full copy of civilization
