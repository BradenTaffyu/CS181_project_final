2019 super good game before the 2 0 update now everything is buggy laggy and down right looks bad this game is pretty much a drift sandbox and with the recent update i feel as if it is trying to look like need for speed they ruined the gameplay for graphics i have been recommending this game like crazy to my friends lately and now i would say its best left alone bc devs ruined it before update 10 10after update 2 10edit 8 15 19 game is still apparently now everyone who went to 2 0 lost all of their bodywork and now there is a paywall for decals ruined this game within a month and lost majority of their old fans it wouldnt be too bad if they added more settings to fix graphical settings but nope motion blur is on always and if you try to lower the settings all it does make rendering not appear until you are closer to it no light changing no shadows nothing at all devs do not care about the community at all the discord is filled with just random stuff and the devs will not reply if you ask them anything despite it being a small game and a small company good job at ruining a game tiny ea ubisoftbefore update supraafter update prius possibly even smart car edit 10 20 20 game is ok now not great not bad just ok crossplatform is kinda lame alot of the console players just suck tbh before update priusafter update v6 mustang still sh t but what can u do
