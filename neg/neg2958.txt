the latest dlc replaces assets which could have been fully made with real artistry and voice acting with ai generated slop if publishers think it is acceptable to employ generative ai in games to skip making something worthwhile and good then they will start to lay off writers artists and voice actors this was bad enough from a developer like stardock but paradox clearly can afford to hire people to make things which are genuinely creative and actually complete their games alongside their predatory dlc pricing this is just another way of exploiting you as a customer and selling you as little content as you will tolerate for as much money as possible
