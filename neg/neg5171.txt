2017 so i will open this by stating that i obtained this game through the humble bundle for 12 good deal never considered buying until that deal presented itself mainly because i got burned by my rome 2 pre order still salty and frankly my intrest and loyalty with this company have been waining over the past years but with that being said a 60 game for 12 just seemed too good to pass up so here we are if you are someone who has been holding off because of the bad reviews i would absolutely say buy this game off of the humble bundle go get a 5 pizza from little cesars drop 12 grind it out and see what you think worst case scenario is you are out 12 no big deal there best case is you like the game and now you can figure out what dlc you want which leads us into the dlc talk it seems like it has become common practice for games to offer a bunch of dlc mostly bad either upon release or within just a couple of months afterwords and warhammer is no acception most of the negative reviews are going to target the terrible dlc model as their reasoning why the game is garbo and they really arnt wrong to feel that way dlc is part of the game if you dont buy any of it the dlc factions still appear in your game to get my point across i want to go back to a previous title in rome 2 upon release of rome 2 came the very first dlc for said game being the greek states pack why is said dlc bs well for one the 3 factions present where already present in the game had been anounced before release and are some of the most commonly well known factions of the ancient world everyone knows who sparta and athens is we all learned about athens in grade school and sparta has become more of a wide known civilization thanks to the 300 movies you cant make a ancient times game without the greeks having some kind of precense so why am i bringing this up i would argue that the greeks are as essential to a ancient times game as the chaos faction is to the warhammer universe and sure enough if you pre ordered the game you received this faction for free if you didnt open up your wallet i have seen some people claim that creative assembly came out and said chaos is a dlc faction because they where never intended to be a play faction or something along those lines and look if you want to believe that go ahead all im going to say is go look at cas previous titles look at rome 2 shogun 2 look at the dlc offered in those games now look where warhammer is at its not good dlc its almost like if you went to mc donalds and bought a combo meal for idk lets say 5 bucks then the register lady says btw its going to be a extra 1 for the patty and an extra 50c for the ketchup blood and gore pack now in this current situation we have two kind of reactions the guy that laughs his butt off leaves and walks to the burger king next door or the customer who says its only 1 50 extra who cares these are the two types of people when it comes to dlc the problem being the guy who puts forth that 1 50 is encouraging mc donalds to continue to charge for every single thing before you know it they are charging you for every single aspect of the burger along with the initial price the same thing has been happening with our games why wouldnt they chop up the game and sell it back to us in parts people are dumb enough to buy it all stop buying the bad dlc you are the customer you have the power stop giving them money and they will start selling us full completed games instead of rushing stuff out to hit a rediculous deadline then selling what is left in dlc all these companies understand is money and just like with my mc donalds reference when i buy a game i dont expect to have to also end up paying for things already included so with that out of the way how is the actual game well honestly i am not too sure yet i think i am coming around 30 hours currently played and i cant really get a good feel for this title the fantasy aspect of warhammer is awesome the unit design the uniqueness of the factions it all looks good but i find myself rolling my eyes as i run into the same problems i have dealt with in previous total war games on legendary difficulty a i armies go into heatseeker mode and charge through your empire looking for the settlement with no garrision in it the second your army approaches they bail and stay just out of range of your pursuing force while they do circles around your empire capturing weak settlements and raiding anyone who has played rome 2 remembers the agent spam welp its back and funner than ever i found myself constantly being more frustrated with these situations then having fun on higher difficulties the a i has always had to cheat to be challenging which is understandable the day we have an actual a i that can go toe to toe with us in total war is the day the terminators take over but jesus this has to be the most over the top cheating the a i has ever done in a total war game to date 10 turns in and i have two full stacked dwarf armies entering my orc land and i have nothing that can stand up to it i find that i am constantly saying how in the world do they have those units already at my computer screen apart from the a i being frustrating battles and sieges have just been completely dumbed down units no longer have special formation options quick example spartan hoplites from rome 2 have phalanx formation what you end up doing is just playing rock paper scissors and sending the right unit against what it counters granted all total war games have a rock paper scissors element to them these special formations allowed for a little bit of flexability in certain situations not so much here the huge glorious siege battles total war players have become accustomned too have transformed into a single wall the enemy must charge at go on youtube and watch some of the med 2 siege battles then look at what this game is offering maybe i am not enjoying this game because of the fact i have been playing the other titles all my life and i have come to hold this franchise to a certain standard and im not trying to be little new people just entering the franchise with that statement im just simply saying the franchise has had a certain bar to it i guess to close if you can get this title on humble bundle or anywhere around the price of 12 i would reccomend it 60 for 12 is a win if you end up liking it you can get all the faction dlc with a total price of somewhere around what 60 or 70 essentially the price of a new game anyways if you are someone who is a veteran of the franchise dont buy stay away unless something like the above deal presents itself i hate using the world casual but i would say warhammer is a dumbed down casual version of what the total war franchise is warhammer fan get it you will probably enjoy this just because of the fact it is warhammer someone new to the franchise i would advise to stay away just because of how ca has been trending with their dlc policies and whatnot these games are getting more and more stripped apart and i dont think it would be a very hot take to suggest that whatever game ca adds to the tw franchise after warhammer will suffer from what the previous titles have suffered from bad dlc and a extremely bi polar good then bad a i if you are looking to check out the franchise i would highly recommend med total war 2 you can probably get this one for under 10 and if you can stomach the old look to the game its worth it shogun 2 has been the franchises golden child none of the dlc is nessecary except blood and gore and even though i hate to say it rome 2 stands above rome 1 tw vets kill me now although with rome 2 you are going to need to dip into that steam workshop and customize ur game how you see fit
