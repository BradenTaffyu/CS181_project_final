2016 product received for free tired of playing this game now only due to the fact that the developers may be doing a great job of coming forward with more tanks to add to the collection more planes too including different missions but why havent they fixed the problems that need to be fixed have needed to be fixed for a long time i load up every day start off with getting the bonus now why is itthat every day i get the bonus i seem to get either 10 or 15 of whatever wasnt this suppose to increase as you load up every day as a loyalty player well day 262 now yet all i still get is either 10 or 15 of lions bonus or if im really lucky a discount of 30 on some kind of plane or tank ummm seems to me like this is a dis because im not a premium member yes war thunder is a great game but if only if you are a premium member then only then the red carpet is rolled out for you the old saying goes the rich get richer the poor get poorer thats certanly the case in this game ive lost the will to live playing now only due to being hacked soo many time loosing either golden eagles to lions why should i have a second authorative check on my account the game should more secure i aggree but using a second security post shouldnt be the way its a shame that when firstly seeing war thunder on steam was a jolly because this game was different at the time it only went downhill i honestly dont think there are enough staff in the bug fixing game play trial department as i seem to still pass certain areas on a map that still have the same bugs its like reminiscing old times lolto concludeyeah great game if your a newcommer but as the days go on you start to see pick the holes also get frustrated why you dont feel like you deserve a crappy bonus award for what you ve been through to get it it s like your boss at work asking you to do overtime after you ve just compleated a double shift up your loyalty respect to the players gaijin make us feel you want us to play
