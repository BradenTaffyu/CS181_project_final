copy and pasting somewhat from a comment i made on a recent patch i will update this if things are corrected as of 3 23 2024 the game is still quite buggy and honestly still kind of a mess getting real tired of owlcat releasing bugged out games and then slowly spoon feeding us fixes little by little knock the crap off act like grownups and do the job right the first time yes i know some bugs are inevitable doesn t excuse the state the game was released in if it was simply a case of t posing servitors which was kinda funny given the in universe stuff going on and the occasional crash or forced reloading of an encounter it d be one thing but that s not what we re dealing with many people can t finish the game due to quest bugs half the companion quests are bugged and unbeatable dialogue is missing from quests many talents are bugged and not working at all this is genuinely pathetic there is no excuse for this nonsense the fact that the ultimate editions of both of owlcat s previous games are still loaded with bugs that will now never be fixed really only adds to the current problem none of this even comes close to touching on the issues regarding balance that s an entirely separate can of worms that honestly i was prepared to give owlcat the benefit of the doubt until i got to act 3 and realized that they apparently got bitter about halfway through the game in regard to how powerful they made the player in act 1 and 2 oops we gave the players the tools to make their characters immortal better make the next boss immortal too this was a major complaint of mine in their last two games in order to beat the bosses you needed to min max your character so much that every other fight besides the handful of tough ones was silly easy in rogue trader they made it turn based only so now the game can t play itself though it has the same problems with balance had they not made those stupidly difficult fights i was going to let the balance thing go considering how many difficulty options there are in the menus the hardcore people had the tools needed to make themselves suffer just fine and the rest of us could just enjoy the game here s hoping owlcat actually learn to adjust to criticism and fix this issue as well as the multitude of broken quests talents dialogue talents encounters etc in terms of story it s okay lots of fun if you are a wh40k fan but still with issues like for instance a major plot point being forgotten about don t want to spoil things but it s a major plot point introduced at the end of the prologue and has a couple of lines of easily miss able dialogue that reveal what the deal is and no one comments on it and there is no resolution the entirety of act 3 is that irritating trope where they take all your equipment and make you fight naked for a while yes some of your equipment can be lost forever some of that is bugs but your shoes get stolen and a random npc in the area has them they have no special name and the other npcs in the area don t have dialogue so there s no reason to believe that talking to that one in particular would do anything and no way of knowing that your boots specifically would be there the game does not tell you that your boots were stolen it makes it seem like they would be with the rest of your equipment and by the time you find out that they aren t it s too late and then after act 3 it s basically just fights there s no more space exploration i was hoping new warp paths would open up and reveal more sections of the map to explore no dice i am a wh40k fan so i will play around with the game a while waiting for fixes but i can t recommend it it s honestly more disappointing than fun at this stage don t be like me wait until the game is actually done before buying to the people on steam who believe that high playtime automatically guarantees the person enjoyed the game i d like to mention that i did try to like the game i played it a lot and with different builds to see if my issues with the game were based on not playing enough or knowing enough about game mechanics also it is possible to look back on your time doing something and decide that it wasn t worth it and reflect that you weren t having fun as often as you should have while doing something meant entirely for fun and enjoyment
