2020 omfg i cannot express just how mad the community for this game makes me i have never in my life met such hatefull hackers and counter hackers ever let me put in better perception my experience with this trash heep of a game s community so originally i had owned this game for ps3 and thought to myself after 100s of hours wow this game would be awesome if it could be modded so i had bought it for pc and knew nothing of the ban system as a side note omfg why does this game ban people so easily but never touches the grieffing hackers wtf instantly i get in the game alter my stats so pretty much go through the game in a day because i was not there for the base game i was there for the modding of the game tues comes around and in the same instant i modded my stats i get banned ok no worries i clearly caused it so i learn about family share nice make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats bannable and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be amazing so i make one myself do a few matches in a high pvp area get all around well reception 3 but then the salty hackers comes online i had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the void lord causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game every effect and every change must be manually imputed every time you launch the game this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting i start my walk through the city not hiding that the hacks are in place i also want to point out that my boss character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy but no a hacker who s character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse but stormy you say you were hacking you deserve this i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the pvp element to the game so i think to myself ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this log off and try again tomorrow so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun as the whole thing was supposed to be but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also hacks the family share account to forcefully disable the family share on the game so yes if you ask is the game worth it on pc hell no the publisher is to ignorant to figure out how to appropriately make a proper ban system and allows constant griefers to run rampant in the game
