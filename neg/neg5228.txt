2016 i ve followed the series since the original shogun the core gameplay of warhammer is the best since shogun 2 but it is severely lacking in the number of factions which will subsequently be unlocked via dlcs given the pricing of some of the latest dlcs chaos warriors and beastmen a fully fleshed out game is too expensive for all but the most devoted series fans if you want the same level of enjoyment for much cheaper prices pick up a copy of shogun 2 or medieval 2
