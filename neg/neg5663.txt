2014 so here s a quick review for total war rome ii i ll try to sum it up for any casual gamers like myself out there although i ll ultimately be comparing it to the original sorry for that if you two haven t met pros as of the moment i write this as playable as any other total war game i ve played rome medieval ii and empire don t know about the issues other people are talking about stunning graphics satisfactory sound effects voice acting and soundtrack in all honesty doesn t stand out from any other strategy game i have cons the price if you really really want it i d recommend waiting for another sale the fast forward option during battles is painfully slow and does not appear to be much faster than the normal option of play so if you re moving an army into position be prepared for some comparatively long waits gameplay mechanics feel a little dumbed down shall we say compared to the original i mean they cut quite a few features i liked from the original the family tree the ability to recruit units without a general no limitation on generals etc and added only a handful of features i do like the random family events for one the ability to fight naval battles on the map for another the verdict total war rome ii is a playable and okay rts but i believe the graphics are really the only major feature it has in its favor honestly if you re into strategy games i think you d be better off just buying playing the original total war rome it may not be as visually stunning but it feels more fluid and in my opinion is the better of the two plus you save a handful of cash and who doesn t like that
