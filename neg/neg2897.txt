2019 edit for some reason launching the game via steam opens a launcher now one that needs to be closed via task manager and then immediately pops up again but luckily only that once they also no longer allow you to change the game s language unless you use that useless launcher many good ideas but many poor executions i d expect something better for 40 especially with this many dlcs though i do recommend it if it s on discount some examples war exhaustion if you take too many losses or the war simply lasts too long the enemy can force a status quo peace usually boils down to you keep any system you occupy and have a claim on gives you a chance to survive wars against far stronger empires and prevents empires getting completely overrun in just one war usually at least however if you fight alongside an ally you share that war exhaustion and the ai isn t exactly known to keep its units alive or to put it differently if you advertise the game with advanced diplomacy i expect military alliances to help you win wars and a forced status quo at the wrong time can steam s lovely hearts you over quite bad randomised tech you don t get the same options every playthrough which helps prevent optimal strategies you never stray from however it s not a randomised tech tree it s a random draw of 3 or more options and you aren t guaranteed to get the same options again any time soon which is quite silly and means you ll regularly have to pray to rngesus disengaging from combat hooray for games that assume your units have common sense and or a self preservation instinct if heavily damaged ships will have a chance to disengage and rejoin the fleet after the battle unless using the no retreat war doctrine if that happens to your entire fleet or you order to use emergency ftl they ll go missing for a while before showing up at a friendly station the thing is that emergency ftl missing for some months is the only way to disengage attacking a station shooting some unarmed troop transports you can t just fly away if you had enough troop transports you could lock a hostile fleet in place just by sending them to their deaths oh and imagine you re in one of those troop transports getting shot by a hostile station you know what to do fly in a circle until the entire fleet is destroyed even if that takes months on top of that the ai is mediocre at best the automisation for your own planets and sectors is terrible 3 possible mining districts 6 possible agriculture districts must be the perfect mining world other empires seem to do ok though they need cheats for it but have absolutely no clue about combat i ve seen troop transports fly past undefended planets instead flying into another sector with a hostile station rip vastly superiour fleets entering a sector only for some of them to leave and letting the rest die huge fleets sitting idle while neighbouring sectors get captured the list goes on if the ai would just keep its fleets together and in combat i m quite sure i d be in deep steam s lovely hearts at the difficulty i play on
