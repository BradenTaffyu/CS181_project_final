2017 i made a tl dr video youtube video curb your creation club views 1 115 on august 29th the bethesda creation club went live normally i would just ignore it like i did with the rest of the bethesda mod crap however bethesda made a rather critical mistake today the creation club went live it s a 2 1gb patch normally i would just ignore it like i did with the bethesda mods crap let me make something clear right now steam requires you to update and download new cc mods everytime a new cc mod is released how can i tell because they packaged all the new cc mods into this update this means that optional mods are now essentially required dlc isn t the whole point of mods is to be optional why are you forcing us to have them when we can t even use them oh and the cc mods they released today are accesable using a bsa archiver which will allow people to just unpackage and use the mods for free anyway so gg bethesda oh and the game is actually pretty fun not as good as nv buy it on sale edit oh boy bethesda did it again
