the complete version of this game will set you back 300 cad at 50 off rather than shifting the effort towards a sequel the devs at paradox seem to roll out new dlcs with aaa price tags every year literally averaging 75 of content annually since 2016 it s clear that enough wallets are still being thrown at them to justify this high cost minimal effort development cycle stellaris was a fantastic immersive experience until about four years ago since then it has been watered down with so much bloated content and tedious micromanagement systems that it is a shade of its former self worst of all the ai gets dumber every time they add new features so even on the hardest difficulty it feels like you re playing against a toddler using cheats it also severely lacks optimization in the late game these are all reasons why a stellaris 2 is already years overdue it was one of the best foundations for a game i ve ever played unfortunately they built a paper house over it
