2023 early access review horrible launch as predicted game looks and feels like a mobile game most of the servers released are now crashed and have been crashed for hours already exploits resulting in network wide rewipe fun not gonna be surprised if people move back to ase it s really bad update i ve put in more time not much because i don t have time to play much the game is getting better but it s still worse than its predecessor servers still crash it still looks bad unless you re running a 5000 setup still wouldn t be surprised if people revert back to ase after the official servers become stale
