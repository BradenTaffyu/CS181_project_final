2018 i really liked this game back when it first came out it had a few major problems that stood out though managing end game empires ai behavior and combat the charm of the game made it easy for me to overlook these problems since i was more interested in exploring and discovering the game i used to play this game up until mid game enjoying the nice in game event flavor and randomized nature of a new universe to explore before rinsing and repeating i was especially glad to hear that they wanted to fix the combat and make it more strategic though they intended to make drastic changes that would affect the entire game first off they streamlined ftl travel i preferred that customizeable and flavor design of having different ftl types like warp gate travel mass effect style or having hyperlane travel or just simple sublight travel some of them had distinct advantages especially in multiplayer and the developers wanted to make sure that it didn t interfere with their combat overhaul so they removed it no asymmetrical designs were done to balance them just straight up gutted this was to make room for the new hyperlane chokepoint system the design of this was to make the layout of your empire s borders more strategic so you could plan defensives against invaders to make that work they needed ships to physically travel to the border of the local map so that you could block off a specific hyperlane this made hyperlane travel very slow especially early on it now took a long time for your ships to travel across your empire conduct actions or reach war targets games take much longer to play now ship combat remained the same to fix combat they made a dlc addition adding a new ship class and new megastructure weapons they also changed the way fleets are handled to try and reduce doomstack fleets and integrated starbases and defensive platforms into outposts to complement their hyperlane chokepoint system ship combat remained the same long range weapons have targetting issues and ship combat ratings were still all or nothing the development team also wanted to make sure that ugly border gore did not occur to your empire to do this they decided to penalize players who would snake around the galaxy claiming systems disconnected from your capitol system the penalty was a new and updated piracy system pirates would now show up at your border in unclaimed systems increasing in occurrence for every unclaimed system neighboring you people still rushed expansion snaked around the galaxy and exploited the mechanic by ensuring they show up at a guaranteed gap early game now requires you to maintain a fleet to deal with pirates you can no longer wait until mid game to build up a strong fleet defensives are mandatory whether or not you have hostile neighbors early game pirates can now out class you in strength with recurring appearances being progressively stronger and destroying your early game resource stations pirates can wreck your empire during a war due to how long the hyperlane system takes for your fleets to travel across your empire to deal with pirates in the midst of a war the stellaris developers are now planning to re haul the economy system and potentially do away with tile based colonial management replaced with a copy of master of orion s population management design the ai was bad at managing tiles so they got rid of tiles instead of improving ai this is how stellaris development works now why make improvements to the game when you can just cut it out completely and remove the game s unique features why fix ai when we can make the game simpler and barebones why fix ftl balancing when we can make the game dull and uninspired this game has been losing its flavor charm and originality the game now takes much longer with the slog of an ftl system your playstyles are now much more limited to either heavily exploiting the game s one sided economy or strictly defending your borders from constant annoying pirate attacks instead of improving ship combat ai or end game management the game has become more sterile and barren as original features are trimmed down to the roots instead of improving upon empire uniqueness and design development has focused on taking away the game s personality and making it a slog to play i used to play this game a lot trying out new species and empires and seeing new events and galactic neighbors now i can barely stand playing it past early game and find each new game to be a frustrating restart it is very fair to say that the recent reviews as of this moment reflect the game s current state accurately there s a serious mix of people who hate the changes and people who like the changes it s up to you to determine whether you think these changes worked out
