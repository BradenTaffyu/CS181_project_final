2017 bethesda s introducing creation club or paid mods microtransactions under a different name which will be available for fallout 4 skyrim special edition in this summer i suggest everyone do not support this idea for some reasons in history bethesda release their games in a broken state and wait for modders to fix them however with this idea users now have to pay every single mods to patch their games moreover right now you can see what happened to fallout 4 with lack of everything and it s waiting for modders to add more contents which should be in this game from the first place i love fallout series and especially fallout new vegas because of the story and options it gave me even dlcs but when i played fallout 4 i fell weak story and roleplaying then i hope mods can fix this without it i can finish this game less than 50hrs but now i have over 300hrs on record if this continue i recommend bethesda just release tools for people to make their own games
