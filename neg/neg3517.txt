2023 this is a nice enough game and you get to see some good dinosaurs but it suffers from not really being very good at anything it s not a fun game as most of the challenge is just slowly ticking through things at a set rate waiting for tasks to complete etc really the game part is just a tax on your time to me the fun would be from making a really cool park and being able to walk around it but here the game falls down badly you get severely limited styling options to your park i mean 6 different ground textures and about 6 types of rock that s it no extra little things to put around no lighting no standalone trees they ve been removed since the first game path customisations consist of 3 different colours and widths water is just a flat surface you can add you can put a few things in it but really that s it there are just 3 shop types and those are very dull while you can tweak the appearance of those you cannot really customise the feel of your park overall as a park simulator it s just not there the screenshots you see that look really neat are not the result of careful design it s the generic and only thing you build i really tried to make some nice looking parks but there s just not enough variety in this
