like coh2 started of badly it s quite a bit better since then but still very subpar vs coh2 which i ve got 1400 hours in on all aspects performance graphics content gameplay balance fluidity pathfinding vehicles and even playercount gamebreaking online experience with absurd illogical non existent balance regarding vehicles or rangers potential resource not within margin of 20 but rather 200 for instance dingo or humber spam cannot be properly countered given the same resources or even 1 3 less in 1v1 100 win rate even in 4v4 and only when you play with 3 incompetent teamplayers will it not work if they get at least 2x the resources you get same for chaffee light tank can easily win vs any other medium or heavy tank in 1v1 at the fraction of the cost even winning 1v1 vs p4 medium tank in frontal attack when vetted wtf this is highly unrealistic totally unbalanced and ruins immersion why not let a conscript with a revolver kill a tiger tank if we go in this same spirit of nonsense likewise vs tiger tank by circling around it moves faster than barrel of most tanks steel division 1 or 2 is so much superior to this fantasy in that you can not penetrate thick armor of king tiger or other heavy tanks with such small caliber final huge gamebreaker are gameruiners and they come in all kind of forms from maphackers to chinese playing with double accounts where one account sits afk in your team afkers absolute imbeciles spamming snipers only toxic flamers etc so you want to surrender to go to the next game only for them either not to vote or vote no then you quit and you get penalized by relic not able to find a match for n minutes then you start next game and guess what the same ffing gameruiner is loading in your team again you quit again and then you have to wait one hour for leaving match you get penalized not the gameruiner good job like coh2 only legit players get penalized and nothing is done against gameruiners like i ve said i played that game for 1400h made with friends numerous reports of same cheaters and they always came in for over a year week after week so i know for a fact relic does nothing against them compared to sd2 this game is like sc2 little brains required to play but need to be high on energy drink to get most clicks as possible to win this is not rts but tactics game sd2 requires deep thinking is slower paced is massive and actually way more realistic only downside is many chinese cheaters playing with double accounts where they afk on one but sd2 devs actually banned a few of them after reporting them on discord maybe i m getting too old for high rpm clickfest games though maybe 1 10 of coh3 matches are actually good and if it wasn t for me growing up with coh good game nostalgia i probably would have uninstalled permanentely already favored ww2 is still hoi4 followed by sd2 followed by coh2 i might change review if they address aforementioned issues but i doubt it got burned once by same team with dow3 bought it at full price day 1 only for them to ditch the game very soon while dow2 was even better than coh2 amazing but now sega ditched relic let s see if they can survive now they have to stand on two feet nothing personal is written here just self evident experiences for anyone playing this and aforementioned games long enough to know this is my opinion based on hundreds of hours of coh3 and collectively over thousands in the other games edit after 40 more hours doing 4v4 with randoms only only to express my extreme discontent far worse exceeding coh2 also forgotten to mention some big issues dropped from 1300 elo to 900 with british in no time again started to drop with afker in team at this level most likely cheater from other team as they had full fow awareness with arty getting ganked vs premade teams expected same as coh2 you need friends with mic 1200 1330 were pretty good matches like 3 10 matches once you drop below 1k the toxicness starts to kick in afkers instaquitters ragequitters teamkillers and had like 1 out of 20 good games then at 900 it s completely impossible to find competent players not even 1 good game out of 40 yes i ve noted the games i ve played in notepad the drop hack is still very present at 1200 1300 elo happened several times always vs chinese players and never happened on lower elo this was very common with coh1 and coh2 and i can confirm is still present in coh3 imagine the need to cheat and hack in not even a professional competitive game too much wasted time when a match is decided your noob team does not want to surrender wasting either additional 10 30 min or get punished for leaving no fuel game over why don t people understand this is beyond me no mapcontrol is definitely a game over to add insult to injuty devs decided to have manpower sectors that can be upgraded to gain more resources while in coh2 you could make epic comebacks when you lost fuel with buffed manpower totally absent in coh3 in fact you get punished totally impossible to come back especially with current balance that is so wack when fighting as axis vs allies almost all games at 1k you fight against a player ranger spamming with over 60 games as allies vs axis guess how many times just once matchmaking is a joke how the hell is this possible rangers are op af as they are very cost efficient hard to kill and have huge damage and viable to endgame with reinforced tank destroyers it s easy to win but yeah such players don t join my team only as my enemies almost always semi continuing on matchmaking nice job having a team of 1k elo vs 1 2 1 3k elo over half the time how is this possible i never encountered it the other way around needless to say enemies are usually premade so you get ganked 2v1 and then it s matter of time getting sweeped over edit2 after getting 34 a few times i m finally at 800 elo after a 10 loss streak as british this is the bottom of the barrel trailerpark experience you will get 800 900 elo this is the place you want to uninstall this crap camper afkers behind vp while enemy is owning it just sitting afk while you play 2 vs 1 when there is nobody at their position for an incredible 15 min plus just doing nothing even easy ai caps sectors and is way more useful incredible robotic chinese style noob teammates blobbing in to same mg over and over again only retreating to base and are of no use losing all sectors their side out of 10 matches nobody plays ranger the most blob noob friendly op tactics one can use requires no brains running with 6 inf blob no at in to few p4 over and over again only to get 50 200 inf k d ratio end of game almost impossible to climb your way up if you are such low elo you cap vp go to the next only for the noobs still afk camp behind vp and not in front or at vp and even if 2 defend mid sector they cannot hold vs 1 guy with just 1 tiger i played 3 matches in row with same guy totally useless camper near base it s better to note names in spreadsheet and alt f4 during loading waitor just quit for the day because you will definitely lose unless enemy has same granny in team who never moves otherwise you play 3v4 which is actually worse than easy ai in the end if you got no competent friends to play 4v4 with randoms going to be hell ironically in the lower elo ranges edit3 i m done with 4v4 randoms 5 matches in a row vs premade 3 players 200 300 elo and 1 random 800 elo vs my team 800 elo that are worse than easy ai getting stomped and no surrender waste of time game is most likely dead as steamcharts prove always 50 players than coh2 because friends don t play coh3 anymore no more point only farming points for future battlegroups at best edit4 final uninstalled this crap played about 10 matches in a row with afker
