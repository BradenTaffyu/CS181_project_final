2017 don t get me wrong this is actually a really good game its just a really bad fallout paid mods are not the way to go and please bethesda let obsidian do the development for tomorrows fallout games fallout is an rpg set in the post apocalyptic world of the us this game is not an rpg albeit it is a good post apocalyptic shooter i wont lie i had tons of fun the first three playthroughs but the reason why i dont recommend it is because of paid mods and to send a message in hopes for that the next installments take another turn than this one
