2023 this is really pathetic not recommanded 1 pay for convinience is pay to win even more so in this game as you get considerable boons for beeing a subscriber half those features should have been included in the base game aside from that you get more scoreboard progression which is pay to win you can even pay to straight up unlock the entire scoreboard which includes card packs and points to make you stronger in a game that allows pvp 2 in no way shape or form is this game worth a purchase to play subscription and pay to win businessmodel you have going here 3 the story this game provides is a joke the combat is stiff and clunky the graphics are somehow worse then your previous title fallout 4 how it is the exact same engine as your previous title isnt it 4 it is also riddled with either cheaters or dupers pvp should be avoided entirely as it is unbalanced and consists of only one valid strategy to actually win 5 once you finish the story and side quests you re done i managed to get to lvl 260 or something there is barely any replayability as the endgame consists of i m not even sure strike missions and events thats it you can t store more then 40 or 50k bottlecaps new content as far as i m aware consists of new cosmetics in the shop and a new scoreboard to unlock more cosmetics if you have nothing against all that by all means go ahed and have fun with friends it was kind of fun playing it with friends but lets be real here every game can be fun with friends
