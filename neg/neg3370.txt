2016 whatever else the merits may be the game in it s current state is unbelievably easy a completely braindead ai will declare wars they are not prepared for because they took a national focus that gave them a war goalnot secure their borders even when about to declare warthrow their airforce awaythrow the navy awaynot research better equipmentnot build proper divisionsthe game also shows complete disregard for the geopolitical situation at the time not only regarding the military capabilities of many minors but also everybodies complete indifference to them starting to conquer all their neighbouring countries this even counts for majors in the early years and overall makes the game useless as a alt history sandbox even slight alterations from the course of history will lead to a complete breakdown of any believable course of events
