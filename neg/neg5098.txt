2018 it s a good game i ve played around 90hrs at the time of writing game runs very smoothly graphics are pretty good for a game that came out a couple of years ago sound design is also well done love the voice acting but i expected blood no blood in warhammer please oh wait it has blood but it costs more hahahahahahahahahaha the game is already full price but the dlc just feels like the devs ripped a f00k ton of stuff out of the main game and charged more money for it total rip off the game is good but not worth 100 for all the content just seems a bit greedy wait for a sale
