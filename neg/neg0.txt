2017 early access review very cool game for the first couple days i played now i find it s true that as you spend more time in game you begin to experience awful skipping lagging poor fps and downright crashes to the point i can no longer play more than a few minutes at a time without a crash initially i had flawless gameplay and framerate if they fix this issue i will say that i would recommend it but as it is i cannot recommend sadly other than that the game runs great looks fantastic and has massive potential i just hope they correct this well documented and frequently complained about issue of crashing a word of warning to anyone looking to buy the game this fps crashing issue seems to affect most people as time goes by regardless of their pc build and specs there are supposed workarounds but they have their own problems and shortcomings
