2016 early access review this game seems to be getting less fun with each update it went from being interesting and easy to understand to more complex and a chore just to get started not that complexity in a game is a bad thing but it comes down to just not being fun to play i can t recommend this game in it s current state hopefully the devs will remember how the earlier versions played and bring some of that back to future updates
