2018 would take 2 not have taken over bought squad and therefore the license of ksp this review would have been an outstanding one but even after such a short period of time since this happened it s already obvious that the licence and also the already released game will go downhill after having bought squad t2 enforced new terms of use for all users without any possibilty to refuse such changes in terms of service the released dlc is buggy beyond any imagination and also impacts performance deeply while the core game itself was fine in every aspect if you ve net explicitly tried to call the kraken the released dlc was mentioned to be free for early adopters this does not mean for people backing via early access but only for people who bought it in april 12 during which time no media coverage was was given of the title so if steam didnt mention it to you and you bought it a bit later after learning about ksp you re out no dlc the money made from the sold dlc will not profit the people actually developing the game and or will develope it in the future it will go right into the new owners pocket take 2 which has had nothing to do with the game the studio the ip or the actual work do not buythis is a prime example of a bigger company jjust preying on the work of others as good as a game ksp itself might be consider your responsibility as a consumer
