2019 early access review i loved this game but they have been very slow in this new update 17 the performance is still really bad i m playing on low settings and still only manage a max of 40fps when i can play high on gta 5 60fps i honestly would have thought they would have improved this after 2 years the old skill system was good and realistic you had to look for some skills from books with the new system you learn stuff out of thin air which isn t realistic anymore but i don t mind as much though it removes some of the realisitc feel the thing i don t like is how every house is an ambush now you can t just simply explore houses and such anymore you re forced to kill loads of zombies everytime i wouldn t mind if it was like a 20 chance of having such a house filled with 20 zombies and i find it stupid how zombies litterally spawn on weird places just to drop down like in real life there wouldn t have been a zombie there since there s no access to said places i hope they fix these weird balances and i really hope they optimize the game so it doesn t run so bad anymore
