2016 can t recommend this game with clear conscience not yet it starts out great the race creator is great the galaxy is beautiful as is the music exploring planets and discovering things is really fun it looks and plays like a great game then it grinds to a screeching halt plenty of promised features are absolute bare bones there are for example very few diplomatic options compared to other paradox games mostly standard 4x stuff like declaring war trading for resources border access etc it could have been enough if half of this stuff wasn t broken for example you can t ask for civilian or military access if your borders don t touch which means you can get blocked off by the ai and can t even remedy this short of going to war it s still better than the state of some other features sectors they barely build anything don t clear tile blockers destroy strategic resources to build a hydroponic farm federations just a super alliance witht he ability to build an additional fleet which counts towards the presidents naval limit so the ai will disband it as soon as it takes over internal politics for 53 years i didn t even see a faction appearing let alone a rebellion the ai also isn t anything to write home about it used to have problem with expanding though this seems to have been fixed in a beta patch still it s pretty passive and content to leave you alone in your corner of the galaxy unless it s some hyperaggressive personality sometimes it definitely has problems with waging war when my enemy finally decided to crush me they just flew their ships through all my systems then disappeared somewhere and didn t react as i bombarded one of their worlds into oblivion your allies and vassals just follow your main fleet not even defending their core worlds when attacked and the lack of polish is glaring i already wrote about broken sectors which is compounded by the fact the game won t let you micromanage them and wants you to pay influence just for taking a planet out when the ai demands a planet as a wargoal and someone else takes it it will never end the war there is no automatic survey you re supposed to click on every star you want to check out at least one late game crisis is impossible to be resolved because of broken triggers there are plenty of examples where the game could have used more testing don t expect another ck2 currently it s more like sengoku
