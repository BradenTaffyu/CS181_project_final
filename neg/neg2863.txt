2023 i have tried so very very hard to like this game and there is allot to like but after not playing it for a while i reinstalled it and gave it another go and rediscovered why i had stopped playing it in the first place fun fact you can have an enemy empire declare war on you totally defeat them occupy all of their systems destroy all of their fleets and they still wont can t surrender due to the idiotic way the war system works i understand why this system was put into place but it needs to acknowledge when an empire has been totally defeated and should surrender
