currently war thunder at top tier modern tanks and jets is a russian cope simulator i will be keeping this review as negative until trickzzter is removed from his position or bug reports of nato tanks are processsed properly gaijin is either handicapping nato vehicles on purpose or are incompetent why haven t these vehicles been fixed when the community has time and time again provided documents and info on how to fix them recently they made a blog post where they said regarding the newest top of the line m1a2 sepv3 abrams having the same even less armor in some places than the original m1 abrams released in the 1980s we believe that hull armor was not reinforced on production vehicles this is blatantly false what did the americans upgrade over 30 years where did the weight increase come from the crew getting fatter they ask for more accurate sources but when presented just close the forum post without any explanation the way that gaijin picks and chooses only the sources they like and make balance changes based on them must stop russians get their vehicles jacked up based on made up unreliable at best sources we want balance not propaganda
