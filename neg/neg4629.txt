2018 multiplayer of this game is borderline unplayable due to endless loading time turn loading crashes disconnects none of them gets any fixing and can t be really helped establishing the multiplayer game itself is a pain in the ass because it is quite common to stuck on stage where you connect to the party get a sudden disconnect from lobby or encounter error which claims you don t have appropriate dlcs for the match which you have all of this is endurable to some extent especially if you choose to play smaller maps and lesser number of players but it s not really worth it anymore future patches and dlcs have some chance to fix most of the issues or so people hope as i d hoped that beyond earth would have been a brilliant installment of series but i am probably to miss that change riot games you let me down on this one pls refund me this season pass costed me my liver
