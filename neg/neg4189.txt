2021 i ve played a few hundred hours over the years i ve expect performance improvements and for a minute i thought they had been done when they release the launcher with all those nice options they do nothing the game will still run on a single core no matter what and that will just strangle any fps you might want running a i9900k at 5 0ghz paired with a rtx 2080 and you can t get past 50fps on high settings could play this game with any graphics card you want really the cpu will always bottleneck the performance my gpu usage never goes above 15 the game needs multicore support to become playable it s been years now
