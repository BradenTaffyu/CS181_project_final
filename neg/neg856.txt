2015 to be or not to be ru and english versions are availible i wanted to write this point few days ago but i decided to finish the campaign because i was hoping that at least this part will be fine i am not going to write a lot but will mention all important parts i am a great fan of fallout universe so i will analyze this game as a part of the universe things that i liked really nice graphic despite the fact that fallout is using old engine the picture is nice by itself and as a fan of the universe i like it we were not expecting great graphic this game is not about it guns i really enjoyed the process of upgrading my guns it was interesting and each gamer can create his unique gun which will perfectly fit his style of game gunfights bethesda did great work on improving the gunfights each fight with different enemies was interesting nice locations despite the fact that there are not a lot of unique and big locations they are in general nice full of colors and people who do their job unfortunately there are no more big positive aspects of this game things that i dislike dialogs omg bethesda why you did this awful step back if you are a new one and fallout 4 is your first fallout series game than it is fine but if you have played fo 1 2 3 and nv than you will see that the dialog system in fallout 4 is bull t really bad we don t need the voices of main characters we were ok with silence main characters you sacrificed the option to communicate and make real choice just to hear what your character say it is so awful that i can speak with 1 of commonwealth yes no sarcasm maybe answers do not fulfill our needs to tell the truth it is the worst thing in game a lot of npcs cannot be killed minor thing armor system is useless a lot of similar parts nothing unique like the ranger armor in nv major thing pipboy very strange menu took a lot of time to get used to it after perfect fallout 3 nv pipboy npc spawn are you serious i was playing destiny or fallout 4 it is nice that yoy improved the process of gunfights but omg why you created a spawn maaajor thing small map you added a lot of similar locations and there was nothing interesting even diamond city like the biggest location looked like megaton lol awful missions almost all side missions are stupid they are like go and kill what were you thinking about bethesda not interesting at all conclusion if you haven t played fallout before than after playing fallout 4 you will give this game 8 9 10 if you are a fan of fallout series than you will give 5 10 why 5 play fallout new vegas and you will understand why it was much better i think that obsidian the company which created fallout new vegas and in which worked people that created original fallouts knows how to make fallout games better than bethesda don t judge me strictly i am a great fan of fallout and i am deeply upset with the fourth part but for new people this game is perfect it has everything to attract person which is unfamiliar with fallout universe sorry for my bad english fallout 4 3 4 3 3 8 9 10 5 10 5 fallout new vegas
