2023 a gacha on the face of an otherwise good series autopilot gameplay that never really evolves from win rate start after you beat dungeon 2 or 3 or wherever you get access to exp ticket farming i kid you not i ve beat the entirety of canto 4 by winrating with the same party including donbaek the stage miniboss and dongrang the actual boss i have out of spite not read what a single enemy passive or active does and i have not been punished in any way for it so the difficulty just isn t there outside of the railway which can only be called difficult if you think that resetting 20 times to get a speed 6 qs on turn 1 is difficulty maybe the battles are fun well no in 90 of the content you have barely any input outside of choose skill 3 if available if not then choose skill 2 if not then complain and choose skill one due to 90 of the id not being balanced to demand any input and having one best skill and one worst when the game offers you gtg and qs there is no questing before you you pick qs even if the enemy takes only 20 damage from envy just because the damage can t compare so the gameplay is nonexistant and almost always just autopilot this game suffers severly from being gacha trash and it shows from the plot becoming drawn out and boring to account for the games as a service system where you need to out endless cantos to the gameplay being dumbed down to choose the absurdly broken 000 ids and beat any story enemy by pressing winrate shame on you director also i have donated like 120 dollars i m expecting my complimentary hamhampangpang park tickets and korean visa will arrive on time the music is nice as is the art and the story is good yet slowly getting worse already it s like an artist given the task of enchanting an actual pile of dog turds no amount of polish and work will hide the fact that this is a brainless money vacuum
