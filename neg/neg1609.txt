2020 early access review well gentlemen and ladies after waiting a long time like fellow fans and have having played the game for a bit now i can clearly say this is a slap in the face of fans like me and a sad excuse for over 5 years of development frankly i feel disenfranchised but let me say if your new and interested you will probably enjoy it you got a blank state and no expectations but honestly i d say wait i got hitched on the hype train watching videos reminiscing about warband and the memories i had and bought it and it s clearly not worth it especially for 49 it would maybe be worth it at 30 it s honestly a aesthetically pleasing upgraded warband with mod features that s it it s still a grind it s still a mess and it s empty in all most every regard there are other reviews that reiterate my views much better but overall the potential is there and i wish taleworlds would step up as they ve grown as a studio and are no longer indie i get it s early access but come on man 49 bucks at this state what are you the new paradox interactive i didn t pay this much for a half baked traveling simulator
