2017 product received for free fallout 4 is an above average sandbox shooter fallout 4 is not a good rpg fallout 4 is an awful fallout game it seems that bethesda has an entirely different vision for the franchise than obsidian does and black isle studios interplay did fallout 4 is like skyrim with guns or far cry in the post apocalypse in that it is a mountain of content with the depth of a puddle what suffered the most was what fallout prided itself on at least in the non bethesda titles the writing stories start strong making you invested at first then the payoff comes and it s nothing more than kill everyone in sight mercilessly without any other option except for a select few cases with little to no character development or real progression this is in part due to the extremely restrictive 4 choice dialogue system you can never have more than four choices in speech nor can you have less than four most non bartering choices are either yes yes sarcastic and tell me more speech checks for different stats like intelligence and perks are also gone with charisma being literally the only thing that matters in conversation even for intimidation your strength means nothing when you re trying to get some raider to put his gun down most of the time all you really get for passing these charisma checks are just slightly more information and some exp anyway so you aren t missing out on much a big part of why this is a thing is that your character is fully voiced you cannot disable this without mods your character also has a heavily pre established backstory as being either a retired soldier or a lawyer who had a kid with whichever gender you didn t pick is a pre war relic that was cryogenically frozen while your spouse is murdered and your kid stolen for stupid reasons as you ll eventually find out if you play through this stupid story and has a robot butler this isn t spoilers because this happens all in the first 5 10 minutes as you can probably imagine voice acting is expensive to begin with having two different actors for the same basic role having to voice thousands if not millions of lines adds up bethesda is extremely and possibly suspiciously secretive about fallout 4 s development budget and costs but i can guarantee you just from paying attention to the industry that the va work took out a huge chunk of it according to bethesda themselves the voiceovers were being worked on quite early on in the game s development for about four years the game also reuses a lot of the same actors the most prominent being brandon keener of garrus vakarian fame the majority of male npcs you ll meet are voiced by him especially unnamed ones the four main factions you ll meet throughout the game are fairly flat and uninteresting the minutemen likely the first faction you ll meet and probably accidentally join are literally the good guys all they want to do is beat up the bad guys and protect the weak that s their whole gimmick the institute the main antagonist force of the game makes literally no sense their motives are completely backwards wanting to help and advance mankind yet all they do is sit in their bunkers making semi sapient death machines replacing humans with synthetic clones and releasing super mutants into the commonwealth there s literally nothing there for you to think twice about them they re just mad scientists the brotherhood of steel are pretty much also the good guys but they re xenophobic against super mutants and ghouls for some reason synths understandably so the railroad are similar to the minutemen but they re isolationist have very black white views and only care about synths instead of the entire commonwealth even if those synths go on to become dangerous raider bosses the companions are all fairly onedimensional too even the ones i actually do like for example nick valentine is just a detective with a shady and unfortunate past that he wants to clear up his personality is literally just i m the synth detective strong a super mutant is dumber than a rock and takes the shakespeare quote of the milk of human kindness too literally his character is just i want yo meat and hating almost every single thing you do that isn t killing someone the only character that has any sort of real depth that i ve played with is john hancock a slightly unstable somewhat egotistical druggie ghoul that staged a hostile takeover of the town of goodneighbor to provide a safe haven for the outcasts and drifters of the commonwealth the lore is also extremely inconsistent with not only the previous games but with itself as well such as the t 51b t 60 x 01 power armor issues the kid in a fridge quest in spite of ghouls requiring food and water in your settlements the drug jet being pre war in spite of being made out of brahmin mutated bovine feces and countless others as fun and improved as the shooting and fighting mechanics in this game are though it s also become far too much of the focus there isn t a single unjoinable faction in this game that won t shoot you on sight the gunners a group of mercenaries have no real reason to attack you nor are you ever given a hint that you have a bounty on your head yet still shoot you on sight and are often described as just being better trained raiders or something they took the town of quincy from the minutemen and do nothing with it the children of atom also attack you on sight for no real reason except for in the crater of atom aka the nuke s impact crater this is even if you join them in the far harbor dlc too they just keep trying to kill you for absolutely no reason even radstags become hostile and aggro d if you get too close to them crafting really bogs down the game after a while and i say this because of how important it actually is to actually making any progress in the game as the game outright forces you to use the settlement building system at least once in order to proceed in the main story you also can t upgrade your current gear without junk otherwise you re forced to scavenge for entirely new items and there s no guarantee you ll find something you ll like just by killing someone for it so i hope you enjoy filling your inventory with things like desk fans because you ll need those screws it s strange too because the only items that have any form of degredation are power armor pieces which do break but not permanently so all you ll be using junk for is to repair those build settlements and upgrade your equipment you don t even get special ammo types like in new vegas without mods now that i ve finished the game far harbor and nuka world admittedly not very much of that though because i m now burnt out i just don t have the motivation to keep going the endgame really is just collecting junk to continue crafting and building settlements one of my friends has over 2 100 hours because of settlements astonishingly or just wandering with no real purpose other than to kill things with your toy collection as engaging as the improved combat might be and as well designed and detailed the world is it all just falls flat when it has nothing else to stand on that the franchise has for almost two decades like above average storytelling and dialogue or the ability to actually play your own role instead at the end of the day fallout 4 is less of an rpg and more of an open world sandbox shooter with skill points in the vein of far cry honestly if a post apocalyptic far cry is what you want you ve come to the right place hopefully fallout cascadia www falloutcascadia com is going to be what fallout 4 should have been marked as product recieved for free due to family sharing
