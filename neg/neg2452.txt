the game itself is well made and has some cool customization but the game of yugioh isnt what it was when you first started it all those years ago expect to surrunder the matches before you even have a turn because your opponent has summoned 10 different monsters all level 8 that cant be targeted and cant be killed and just come back endlessly great game
