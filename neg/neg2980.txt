2016 i am a big fan of 4x space games and also of paradox grand strategy titles and i really want to love and recommend this game but i just can t it s promising i like the pausable real time aspects graphics are nice and i like the various missions and events but as it stands right now the game is just not living up to paradox standards most of the issues i have with the game are pretty well documented sector ai is very poor doesn t seem to matter what you tell them to focus on you end up with a pile of minerals of credits instead of the desired military or research plus the ai seems to build colony installations that exceed available strategic resources balthorian power plants that don t have access to ore being common there is no diplomacy for all intents and purposes there is no real strategy to fleet building or ship design because all the ships simply form up and attack in one big blob once you design the best mix of weapons on the largest hull size available you only need to build that ship there is no funtional difference between ship sizes so no need to design escorts once you get battleships no commerce which eliminates a whole bunch of opportunity for interesting game dynamics the galactic crisis events are way over powered and can t even be turned off in the game settings i expect these will all be addressed over time through patches and dlc but until i see some real improvement i ll go try other games for a while and check back here in 6 months
