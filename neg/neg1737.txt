2016 i have played this game since i was first introduced to it by jingles jan 5 2013 when i first started playing i was in love it was the only thing i ever did all day the thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time the game was great then the updates started to come at first it was just harder to make money and xp people hated it but i kind of liked it then the br system came and balance left matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad then the russian bias got real im not one of those people that complain that i died to x russian plane tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying planes putting out fires t 34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side ext but even this wasnt what made me quit this game it s the company they are absolutly terrible constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs they threaten to ruin rb if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters and even steam isn t safe they constantly have people downvote any review that is negative i can forgive russian bias i can forgive the terrible br system i cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community to anton yudintsev you made a game that was amazing i loved it so much and always will but what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end listen to the community let them help you make the game better if you do that this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness
