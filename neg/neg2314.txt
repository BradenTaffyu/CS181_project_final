2017 even though this is an amazing game the reason i can not recommend it is that the game has been out over a year and only has 3 3 of the united states the game came out in febuary and they added 1 more state in june modders have already created the whole us some of mexico and canada it feels like to me that the game creators are slacking so much my first scs game was 18 wheels of steel across america and they made that series up to american long haul another issue is that as of now there are only 4 trucks that is it four the game is a full release but feels like a awful early access in american long haul driving as fast as you can it takes you about 2 hours real life time to cross the map in american truck sim post large rescale it takes you about 35 min to cross the map i love the game don t get me wrong but they are really slacking lack of trucks states and so on this is not american truck sim it is just nevada california arizona truck simreview update they will be adding more states but for a cost review update 5 18 2019 they added 1 more state a while back it costs 11 99 and they added 1 new truck way to go
