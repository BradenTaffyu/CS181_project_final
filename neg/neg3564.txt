early access review wtf i thought things were supposed to be different wild card i thought all those stupid bugs and crashes were supposed to be fixed cleaned up a thing of the past the new version on a new engine with new nothing aside from some tweeks to the terrain and it being a little prettier this game is ass i want to love it i do i forced myself at times to like ase i would joke around like everyone that the bugs and crashes were part of the game and if asa was free instead of you mf s snail fleecing us for another 40 bucks i might have the same opinion i took the charge as a sign that maybe they actually fixed it that they were ballsy enough to charge us again told me they must have fixed it right well was i wrong this is some dude i made a game in my basement right here how can you not make a quality product with all your resources and all your brain power how how do you f k up a do over now backed by millions of game sales all i was hoping for was ark but without all the crashing over water crashing over rexes crashing in my gd base requiring a quantum pc to play the game is also just more of the same as before how did they get this far without figuring out optimisation i don t usually write reviews but after loading into the game only for it to crash and boot me three times within 5 minutes wild card get i feel like they are laughing at us they knew this was the same pig but with some lipstick and they released it and charged us for it anyways worse part is i can t even sell this to a game stop since it s digital
