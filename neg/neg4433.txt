2017 i have played the civ franhise since the original and most have been great but this newest installment leaves a bitter taste in my mouth the uncomfortable truth is that civ 6 is designd only for multiplayer and as a dlc distribution platform single player is no longer a priority or even a noteable goal for fraxis and 2k games
