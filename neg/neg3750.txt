2019 early access review if you re wondering why there s always so much chaos in the reviews for this game it s pretty simple you see awhile back like alpha 6 this game was pretty casual 4 years ago it looked like crap but by god there was a shotgun in every purse and a horde of gps zombies who knew exactly where you were every night they were fully capable of ripping out a building from underneath you but couldn t figure out how to get to you if you simply knocked out a few blocks of a staircase and for quite awhile things stayed largely the same hell some of that sh t is still the same now suppose you were working on a game of your own with a team it was your project your job your hopes and dreams you played it day in and day out you knew everything about it and when changes were made you knew about those too at some point after hundreds and then thousands of hours it wouldn t matter how you modified the game it was never going to be a challenge but you d try anyway in a feverish desperate attempt to make the game interesting you delved into the black arts of mathematical sorcery questionable tilted mechanics pure nonsense and even verifiable cheapness and soon as other people played your mangled masterpiece some arose who knew almost as much about it as you did certainly they would know where to go from here after all some communal back and forth is what early access is all about and who better to get it from than those who may or may not even play any other games besides yours many versions passed by at some point the playerbase was split into two camps people like the above who continually thought the game was too easy and y know non masochists who bought the game for a good time one group who as an incorrect assumption would make the game invariably better and the other group who actually represented continued economic appeal and so the war started for this little title and still rages to this day you have people with hundreds and thousands of hours into this game who wonder why it s always too easy in a painfully oblivious manner and newbies who wander in get slammed complain and get shoved out the door as casuals you also have a tertiary group who although correct cannot help but smugly point out usually to the casuals that you can edit the game s files yourself with it never really occurring to them that needing to do so is asymptomatic of the game s many problems my two cents the fun pimps spent way too many versions in the diehard camps and have been trying to balance the game the other way while adding content ever since versions tend to lean back and forth to one camp or the other sometimes even alternating new material gets added gets exploited by old pros gets weird asynchronous fluff attached to it to make it more difficult and then either rots as part of an archaic system or is just removed altogether while the doe eyed newbies never know what the f ck is going on the diehards or newbies who would become as such are most of the people who still play so they hold the greater statistical relevance are the most vocal with a moblike presence on the forums have the most things of relevancy to say and should not for developmental reasons be forgotten everyone else who tries to break into the game represents all new players who know nothing about it have very little that s relevant to say beyond initial impressions as an unbiased base of opinion and therefore cannot for economic reasons be forgotten the ironic part of all of this is the game has never had true difficulty there have been pieces here and there some are still in it some are gone this is what keeps diehards from ever being satisfied with the game and the garbage artificial difficulty thrown into it that seems like actual difficulty is what prevents a lot of new players from falling in love with it adapting to the game isn t so much about learning an honest and progressive difficulty as it is getting used to and accepting its weird little nonsensical proclivities that have spewed forth from the rotted corpse of millenia of hours lost draw a circle of blood around the goat s head or gtfo noob and that s it i m not going to say this game should have been finished by now or nearly so game development is hard i m not going to say which group in the playerbase i lean towards more i won t say anything about where i think the game should go other than i m a big fan of options and slider bars mostly because i think this back and forth will just keep going i will say though that all i ve really wanted is for zombies to stop f cking spawning on top of me for at least two years now and i still don t have it make of that what you will
