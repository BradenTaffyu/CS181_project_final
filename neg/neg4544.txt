2017 in general after several rounds you end up just playing by yourself like playing a tabletop game against your parents who always lose because they don t understand what they have to do and gets boring real quick the motivation to keep playing or end defeat the game dies cons getting spammed with leader screens just to say trivial things is very annoying performance past turn 200 goes downhill a i is the worst denounced and suprise declaration of war of friends all the time for no apparent reason resources scattered in a non reasonable unfun way districts are something new and works good but meh not really a good idea civic cards is the most pointless feature in the game they don t really add anything notieceable in game again annoying prompting advanced options when starting a game are really mediocre i am a single player so i m not interested in multiplayer after 30 hours i don t think i can refund this game i hated the worker mechanics you can only use them 3 times and then they dissapear religion doesn t seem to work for me i don t know i just ignore religion completelypro first hours are interestingi like the graphics and leader animations nice wonder mechanicsnice trade route mechanics although its annoying it keeps asking for new routes automatization would be great this game is not good and not really bad but broken not recommended i ll wait for some time maybe it gets better like civ v and will try it again for now i just wasted money don t buy even on sale you are not missing anything
