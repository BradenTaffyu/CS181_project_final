2017 sadly this game is broken the community decided to do something about it like with every single bethesda game and released mods to help other users some of those mods have been removed from steam several years ago action initiated by bethesda because on their own webpages mod creators proposed donations if people wanted to those creators decided to make a gesture and stop asking for donation in any obvious way every work merit to be paid that s why bethesda proposed to create a paid mod system that is the official declaration if every work merit to be paid why asking mod creators to remove donations propositions since mods are the only reason why bethesda games hold it together why bethesda is trying to milk on mods again why is there even a debate about this bethesda will release a new version of this game soon for vr and i suppose there will be again paid dlc paid mods and paid fix for this broken game why people are still giving their money to b is beyond me this game is not worth the price you will be outdated soon and will have to buy it again and again and again don t bother there are other means to have fun fallout is dead bethesda is dying and they are asking people to pay to heal them lamentable p s from 2020 this game doesn t even support ultra wide screens generally you got two side bars that limits your screen to 16 9 here it s juste 800x600 and no way to change it the menu forces windowed borderless mode and removes the resolution settings this game is broken
