2020 early access review the pathing and targeting of the ai in this game absolutly sucks a shield wall of top level characters can be destroyed by two peasents walking behind them because nobody will turn around and fight back you can lose a 400 man army to a 80 man garrison because the 400 man army will all try to go up one ladder one at a time i admit i like this game but sieges are broken and so are formations this takes a huge chunk out of the game these are all super easy fixes that i learned in 9th grade coming from paradox really guys you guys out a half baked game after teasing it for years i would expect much better from you and feel embarressed that i wasted my money on garbage like this when these things get fixed ill change my review until then i m ashamed that i even wanted this abortion bucket spawn of a game yes this game is playable yes it is funno it does not work wellno the graphics have not been fixedno the ai was not fixedyes you will have to start a new game every week or two because they come out with patches that fix tiny things fixed the horses hair flowing in correct direction cool maybe instead of fixing my horses hair you should fix the 200 vegetables that i have to leadanother fun thing i advise if you buy the game if you challenge a large army with your own they will fall back into the corner of the map where sure you think they are trapped kill them and then turn around and see all your archers being slaughtered by their reinforcments that spawned directly behind you i spit at this game i played many many hours to try to see if some of these things would be fixed because it is in ealy access nope just little tiny fixes here and there they most likely wont fix the ai
