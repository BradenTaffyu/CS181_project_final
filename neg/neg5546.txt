2014 i do not recommend this game since it was released it took 15 patches to make the game remotely playable it still isn t a good product why i was shocked by ca s policy switch in making total wars in the recent years the whole switch to arcadey styles rushing questionable and enraging dlc policy closing mod development support and more when rome 2 came out it was a mess unplayable buggy awkward in all aspects then all that mess about listening to player feedback staunchly defending the obvious issues and ignoring them after 15 patches here we are and i gave the game another shot still disappointed with the game mechanics and polish and then they announce attila a reskin barbarian invasion anyone which any modder could make if they actually released proper modding tools and unlocked all aspects all in all the total war series is dumbed down and in my opinion not worth buying until ca gets their bussiness together and stop charging reskins after reskins with overpriced dlc which should be in the base game anyway
