2020 early access review let me start this by saying that i used to love this game and have over 300 hours on it just in my pc and that doesn t count the time i ve put into it on xbox as well this game has been in early access for almost a full seven years now many of the bugs and glitches could be written off easily as the game is still in development but that s been seven years of development i ve stuck with 7dtd through most of the changes both good and bad and the one thing that was always an issue was the leveling system it was a bit unbalanced before but simple tweaks to single player or server settings could easily compensate for that that was before the last major update the last major update removed all random loot options and locked all loot options behind level gates that wouldn t be too bad except that the leveling system was not adjusted to compensate for this new balancing change what it instead has achieved is to lock all useful items behind a level gate that you cannot reach without hours and hours of time invested in leveling just to get the most basic of self defense weapons the simple solution for this has been to increase the experience gain this seems like a no brainer until you actually put it into practice with a group of inexperienced players all of a sudden they re gaining levels to have access to decent tools and basic firearms but they re also dealing with radioactive zombies way before they ve got the experience levels or gear to deal with them this change is game breaking for the first time in seven years i cannot recommend 7 days all other aspects of the game have remained fairly consistent balancing has always been a bit of an issue in 7dtd and the leveling system was always a tiny bit off but that was easily compensated for before by simple blind luck sometimes you were lucky enough to find a shotgun sometimes you were stuck with a hunting knife and a pistol but the important part is that it was interesting each round played differently because you never knew what loot you would find while exploring it added both a sense of frustration when you worked hard and the loot sucked but also a great sense of reward when you clear a building and find a particularly useful item what do we have now oh you spent an hour to get to level 15 sorry you have to attack people with sticks and use rocks as tools this change was horrible it is the single worst choice that development has made through this entire journey bring back the random loot system even if it s just an optional server toggle that can be turned on or off for the people who want it the game is unenjoyable and virtually unplayable in its current state so this is it i ve finally written a review for 7 days to die a game i have enjoyed immensely for years and recommended to a great many players but now i have to tell those players and others to avoid this game like the plague what was once fun and challenging is now nothing but an endless grind i am sorely disappointed in you the fun pimps it s time to start listening to your players before you don t have any left alright for those of you still here let s do this the good nice variety of buildings map generation has been severely improved over the years fairly simple crafting system most recipes are not overly complex great group game fun when played with friends and voice chat wait is that it huh shame this category is usually a lot longer but i guess now it s time for the bad seven years in early access seriously you guys stop using early access as an excuse and actually fix things you ve had seven bloody years to work on 7 days to die and it s virtually the same now as it was in 2013 loot system this is a big one the random loot was the only thing that made this game playable and now you ve taken that from your players do you simply not like money do you not like having people buy your game fix this leveling system is completely broken on default settings it s virtually impossible to level up and get even half the skills you need to survive especially as a solo player zombies are often too smart there is almost no way to set up a reliable defense from them without cheesing the system and using extreme terrain as your only viable defensive strategy optimisation needs a lot of work map generation can take quite literally hours and should something fail during that time you have to start it all over again locking out your server or single player experience while it works resources can be troublesome some are overly common leaving you with a huge surplus of items you will never use while other often used resources are virtually impossible to find loot system yes i know i already said this one but i feel it s extremely important for me to hammer in this point nice and hard the loot system is broken now you have broken your game fix it before you don t have any players left conclusion i have spent the better part of seven years and hundreds of hours on this game while there have always been issues there were ways to fix them in the server settings both for single player and dedicated servers the recent changes have given a very clear middle finger to all of 7dtd s players and now i find myself looking at games like unturned to try and fill the void that i have been left with shame on you the fun pimps you clearly do not care about your players or the experience they have with your game it s becoming abundantly clear that you only want people s money and do not care about their enjoyment once they are actually in the game i wish that i could continue to recommend this game but after seven years in early access and this latest balance change you ve made i m afraid i have to place 7 days to die firmly in the avoid category perhaps they ll realise how bad this change is for the game and fix it and hey perhaps they ll finally make the game a full release but if you re holding your breathe you might want to start breathing before you pass out much like an abusive relationship it s time to finally break ties with the fun pimps until they can learn to start caring about their players so with a heavy heart i leave this review and bid farewell to one of my most beloved games perhaps one day they will prove me wrong but i fear that is a day i will never see edit if you don t like my review too bloody bad go be butthurt somewhere else people just trying to fanboy over the game will not be tolerated
