early access review this game is a sore point for me it s fun for a while with buddies but this game has been in development for far too long and by the time this game is even out of alpha state there will be and are better games that do the same thing at this point the only thing 7dtd has going for it is the destructible environments system which i like but is really just a health bar over a minecraft block system the developers have wasted too much time implementing minor changes that are widely seen by the player base as unnecessary and anti fun for example there was an update that changed the skill trees into a horrible hunt for magazines has ruined the lovely balance the game held before prior to this each player could select a role for their team cook scavenger fighter mechanic etc there was a reason to pick a specific play style now every single player has to find magazines to be able to access key skills and crafting options it s so bad that players are actually setting the difficulty to low and turning zombie spawning off to go hunt magazines just so they can stand a chance in normal play i ve sunk over 180 hours into this and i don t have any intention of adding many more without mods to make the game feel actually completed at this point modders have effectively created everything you would need for a fully fleshed out game which shows how little the developers are putting into this game now i acknowledge that many player love these new changes but i feel it s made the game feel like a dated slog rather than fun exploration of a post apocalyptic world
