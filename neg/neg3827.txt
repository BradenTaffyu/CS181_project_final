2014 early access review this game is just like rust it was made by very innovative people and exhibits a truly remarkable game concept however the shear amount of bugs and hackers ruins this game the community is clearly not always a good aspect especially in the case of this game the game has no realy security to prevent a player from obtaining hacks and using them freely therefore i do not recomend investing any time in this games multiplayer whatsoever the community is terrible the amount of hackers are terrible and you will likely loose any time you put in in a matter of seconds due to said hacker or the game bugging out
