2020 great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently fromsoft namco bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game this only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time also this means that anyone using legit mods as in mods not made for cheating in pvp but changing the game itself adding more challenge e c t now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so this was a poor choice and really makes me think less of fromsoft namco bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like elden ring
