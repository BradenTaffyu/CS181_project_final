2017 much like the first game divinity original sin 2 is a fun game that seems to only be fun purely by accident there s so much to unpack here that i genuinely suspect that the developers were just randomly throwing darts at a board to decide game elements at best at worst they were being intentionally lazy possibly even intentionally provocative at points a lot of the major problems have been harped on about to the point where i don t feel the need to mention them but for the sake of the uninformed the armor system in this game is entirely pass fail you either have armor and you resist everything or you don t and you resist nothing the turn order is mindbogglingly terrible working on a round robin enemy goes then you go then enemy goes and repeat system that seems to heavily favor the enemy the game is literally unfinished act 4 was shuffled together out of planks of wood and has blatant cut corners in the form of poor scripting low effort dialogue low effort area design pointless quests and voice acting that varies from being poor to simply not existing act 3 is not much better inventory management is somehow worse than the first game i think the best way i could describe the act of playing dos2 is that if it feels like you are gaming the system you are probably playing the game the way the developers intended in someways this is what makes the game fun i had a very similar experience with new vegas where playing the game on the yellowbrick road was boring as sin but intentionally breaking the quests in ways that favored me was extremely satisfying what makes dos2 less satisfying than new vegas however is that in dos2 the things that break the game are things that the developers knew full well would break it it is an intentionally asymmetrical experience things like teleporting enemies away from their allies and ganking them planting explosive barrels around enemies before triggering a fight stacking up on a certain resistance to the point where you heal from an element these things are how the game is designed to be played this of course means that certain abilities are comparatively bad because they don t do key things like strip armor reposition allies enemies heal apply surfaces etc the top three non source abilities in dos2 which are probably teleportation shackles of pain invisibility with special mentions to summon bone widow and rain are so unbelievably powerful that you are gimping yourself to an extreme degree if you do not use them the game is obsessed with it s all encompassing armor and surface mechanics and any ability not related to them is uniformly awful on tactician mode cheese strats like the ones i mentioned are so ubiquitious that i legitimately do not understand how the developers intended certain encounters to be beaten of particular note is one instance where i needed to save a lizardwoman from the gallows who was being hung by a single tough guard and her slave easy enough just kill two people the problem was as soon as you instigate the fight the guard summons four equally strong guards from thin air all of which are right next to her so repositioning her is useless this by itself would be a very challenging encounter but it gets better the woman had a permanent aura on her that increased her dodging abilities and those of her allies to ludicrous degrees meaning i basically could not hit her or anyone around her the way i beat this encounter was no joke teleporting her three times in a row at max range into another encounter entirely with some evil bug things and the bugs killed her the encounter i just spoke about could have been talked about with the same words but in an entirely positive tone because technically i just teleported a woman three blocks away and had bugs rip her apart and that s awesome truth be told it actually was somewhat fun the crux of the issue is this the rational person inside of me is screaming in agony when i play divinity while the fun loving idiot inside of me is very satisfied i know for a fact that this encounter was unbelivably poor but because i beat it in a special way i m almost tricked into believing blatant disregard for sensibility produced something cool it s like junk food it s a momentary rush that quickly wears off when you work your tongue around it and realize it s a concoction of food coloring set up to hide a complete lack of substance a lot of the encounters are like that except some are even worse in that the trick to the fight is the literal one way to proceed there s a witch that will set up a massive fire resistance debuff on your party and then cast a fire spell instantly killing the entire group the only way to beat this fight without losing a party member is to bless the flames underneath her so you get fire immunity before she casts her debuff once you do that the fight is a cakewalk it is an actual puzzle with one solution there are other encounters that are just laughably bad if i played a tabletop rpg where a dm pit me against 15 slow moving clay soldiers that respawn indefinitely until one of them is killed where each of them gets their own turn and they only have one attack i would quit that game on the spot there s another fight that s such a literal waste of your time it s unreal you start out with dozens of oil slugs which turn into more slugs which turn into fire slugs which ignites the oil and causes the whole area to be lit on fire which heals the slugs and hurts you that fight took me fifty five minutes but only took me one try the final fight i audibly laughed when i realized the final battle is just an immense battle royale between three factions where both the magisters and the antagonist s forces have 5 people and each of them gets at least three actions per turn i seriously just played dead with my undead characters and watched the fight happen until only one enemy remained with a tiny amount of hp this sort of should not be the optimal strategy in the climax of the game still somehow was not worse than the last fight of dos1 in my dos1 review i said the game was flawed to an unbelievable extent but that i had fun so i gave it a thumbs up why does that not apply here because the context behind the game makes the state of the product totally unforgivable to begin dos2 was a kickstarter project after dos1 had already gotten kickstarted and been the most successful game for larian in ever additionally dos2 was in early access for almost a year and a half supposedly to gain feedback to improve the product larian got feedback and they ignored it changes to the armor system were heavily requested changes to the initiative system were heavily requested changes to the stat system were heavily requested none of these things happened as far as i can tell larian did not make a single change to the game during early access that actually made the game better with the sole exception of adding full voice acting which was probably planned anyway but only carried out during the pre release hype the best part dos2 came out unfinished after years of early access and a huge crowdfunding campaign even ignoring the fact that act 4 is rushed out trite i cannot understand that a game with a budget in the tens of millions was released with multiple game breaking bugs and i do mean game breaking about 25 of the quests i played were bugged to some extent some of them were literally unfinishable when i played dos1 i kind of got the picture that larian knew what they were doing but were being intentionally transgressive for the sake of being different now that i ve finished dos2 i see things in a different light it really does feel like they just winged the entire game and it almost worked i admire their luck
