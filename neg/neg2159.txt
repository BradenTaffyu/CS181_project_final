2022 this game has problems war thunder has very nice visuals faithful historic vehicle designs and potentially fun gameplay however if you haven t been playing this game or games like it for years then stay away let me give a rough breakdown of how any given match of realistic ground battles goes you pick your tank which is made even because you have to grind upgrades for every single vehicle in the game it takes 2 5 minutes to even get to the map objectives because the maps are big and most tanks are painfully slow after the grueling trek you are instantaneously killed in a single shot by a guy so far away and hidden in the terrain that even if you took an extra 1 2 minutes to scope out the battlefield prior to pushing up you still wouldn t have seen him alternatively you think oh alright i ll flank far to the side and hopefully get around these heavier tanks and then hopefully attack them in their weaker side or rear armor this time it takes 5 8 minutes to get to where you re going because of the alternate route even though you managed to sneak behind unseen which is a rare occasion on its own you proceed to fire at the heavy tank thats been camping for most of the match unfortunately for you you didn t kill the tank in one hit and in the time it takes for you to reload you ll either be killed in one hit by the tank you just shot or you ll be killed by all the enemies around him that you ve alerted by shooting or maybe you managed to beat the odds get a few kills and then push up to point and begin taking it it is very likely that an enemy bomber will fly past and drop a bomb which will instantly kill or cripple you it s not even uncommon for your team to get stomped early on and then spawncamped the invincibility timer after spawning is usually only long enough to allow you 1 or 2 shots which makes it very easy for experienced players to surround and kill you as soon as you spawn in ultimately your fate is to die and serve as fodder for the players who have experience if you don t know the maps intimately if you don t know the best tanks for your tier if you don t know what ammo to use if you don t where to shoot at every individual tank for its weakest points if you can t rely on the randoms on your team if you aren t constantly scanning everywhere around you for enemies etc then you will die the worst part is you won t even die and accomplish anything if you get sniped from very far away you literally do no benefit to your team and if you exchange shots and die then your opponent will just repair the damage making your encounter with them null outside of gameplay you should be aware that this game is a grindfest i ve probably played war thunder off and on since 2014 and i still have yet to unlock any jets or high tier vehicles i understand that the game is free to play and the devs have to make their money somehow but the impressive vehicle roster is undercut by the fact that you likely won t even get experience a 1 3rd of them because of the insane time required to unlock any vehicle past br 4 0 also as i mentioned earlier you don t just need to grind to unlock the vehicle you need to grind to make the vehicle decent to use for example vehicles don t come equipped with parts or fire prevention this means that if you take any damage mid match on any vehicle you wont be able to repair or if you plane tank boat catches fire for any reason then that vehicle will likely be destroyed as there is no way to extinguish it further you also need to grind to improve the crews within the vehicles themselves crew level is seriously important and someone with a better crew has an absolute and noticeable advantage over someone who doesn t for example the rate at which one passes out from high g turns and the likelihood of a pilot being instantly killed are tied to crew level this means that if me and opponent had the exact same vehicle but he had a higher crew level then he could turn better take more hits and fire more accurately than me crew level also becomes insane when you take vehicles like boats or bombers into account for these larger vehicles you re able to upgrade the the pilots the gunners and anyone else fully upgraded turret operators are absurdly accurate and give a noticeable advantage hopefully these points help to illustrate that war thunder is a game where experience and money are very important and if you don t have both then you will be playing at a significant disadvantage vehicle unlocks crew levels vehicle upgrades etc can all be sped up or instantly purchased with money and the benefits that they provide are very impactful take this review with a grain of salt though because i just lost like 5 matches in a row and i am pissed currently
