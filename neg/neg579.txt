2020 it s a monumental rpg achievement to be sure a modern day take on an old school tactical rpg with lots of down to earth elements like rummaging through every box bag and barrel you come across looking for loot metal scraps gold coins mushroom caps salted fish bits of string you name it just about anything and everything is usable craftable edible or at the very least saleable wrapped in an over arching story with lofty ambitions for a truly epic world saving adventure although it never quite rises to the greatness of ultima iv vii parts 1 and 2 it certainly builds on the success of the first divinity original sin and expands the breadth and scope of that game in every conceivable way including its flaws it s safe to say that the developers larian studios have an interesting design philosophy when it comes to certain elements of their rpgs that design philosophy is beyond player challenge it is beyond difficulty at times you will feel like the developers are outright trolling you there s a meta quality infused into dos2 that you can tell the developers put there to give the game a lightheartedness and a don t take it so seriously it s only a game vibe but the result is some fantasy ruining fourth wall breaks and some truly baffling choices by the developers which are not funny ironic or clever inasmuch as they re confounding annoying time wasting unfair utterly enigmatic poorly thought through and more and it s not like these cases are few and far between they re par for the course in dos2 if it was an ad d campaign it would have a dm who was just an utterly pretentious pr ck high on power having a lark at the players expense too often that s what it felt like playing the game you would be going along just fine and then you d encounter a fight puzzle quest which was just there to troll you to remind you that this is larian s game not yours and they re gonna remind you that no you re not an experienced player of rpg s for over 30 years and that they can challenge you no they can make completely insane design decisions that no sane person could ever figure out except by sheer dumb accident thank god for the internet and forums you will need them not being a quitter and after so many hours invested i was going to see this game through to the end no matter how annoying it got and in the end the most satisfying aspect of dos2 was finally being able to put this life sink behind me and uninstall it from my computer i didn t care one iota about the characters the world my relationship with them none of it i can say i finished it but by the time i finish this review i will have completely forgotten the plot story whereas i can still tell you the names of the characters and the plot from all the ultima games i played over 30 years ago finishing this game doesn t provide you with a sense of accomplishment insomuch as a sense of relief a thank god that s over with and i can get on with the rest of my life moment sure there were fun aspects of the game and there is lots of potential replay value but why perhaps second time around it s not so annoying but there s no way i m sinking another 100 hours into this game to find out like many i wasn t too keen on the final act although i didn t expect too much from the ending the ending i chose was chosen by only 7 of players so with so many complaining about the ending i can only assume they picked the wrong one can t say i didn t pick the one they did most likely and i m not going to play through the ridiculous final fight to see what the other endings are i frankly just don t care this game never managed to make me care about anything not the world not the characters not the npcs nor the story technically excellent but not brilliant many systems are flawed counter intuitive and outright broken even after years of patches to fix bugs and such an ambitious game which sought to reach too high and ended up falling flat as a result dos 1 did a better job overall reached lower and hit its mark a good lesson for devs better to release a game which is less ambitious that hits the mark than one which is more ambitious and misses steam needs a better rating system than thumbs up thumbs down in truth i cannot really not recommend this game because it is a stunning achievement in so many ways and if you ve never played the ultima games you won t have them to compare dos2 to but it s also flawed in many many ways i felt there needed to be a counterpoint to all those glowing reviews touting dos2 as the greatest rpg of all time do not believe the perfect 10 scores on here those players are looking past all the times they found themselves cursing out the game and or the devs loading a save game for the tenth time because they kept getting cheesed in a fight or looking up the solution to a puzzle or quest because the design was so completely arbitrary and random only blind dumb luck could have produced the correct solution don t get me wrong it s an impressive accomplishment in game development in the same way avatar was an impressive achievement in digital filmmaking but a truly great film it isn t and neither is dos2 a truly great rpg it s a huge impressive at times enjoyable and at other times an utterly infuriating way to spend over 100 hours of your life buy it on sale if you have nothing else to do during lockdown this one can literally eat up hundreds of hours of your life
