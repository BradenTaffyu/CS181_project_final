2019 early access review this game used to be an enjoyable game prior to a17 as it stands the fun that it used to bring has been sacrificed for difficulty in an attempt to stop people from cheesing the game as part of the new update they reworked the skill system to be less involved with specific skills opting more for a mmo esque stat system with strength perception agility fortitude and intelligence each action nets you an amount of experience which has diminishing returns as you perform a task unless you re killing zombies more on that later each level you gain a single skill point which you can use to purchase a perk or to raise a chosen stat by 1 with costs to increase base stats rising as you increase them to a max of 5 skill points to 1 increase this in itself is an issue as levels become tedious to gain at later levels and spending 5 points is an enormous investment pairing this with the new perk system however is where it becomes truly horrible perks vary wildly in power out of the 45 perks which each have 5 ranks 6 of the 9 intelligence perks are required to at least half of their max rank in order to play the game creating a forge and working with iron cooking even the most basic foods making bullets making vehicles and making modifiers for your weapons the forge perks specifically are required to play the game past the first few days to repair and assemble scavenged iron weapons this is made difficult by the fact that many of the intelligence based perks require high levels to access you must be at 20th level to make iron weapons for example on the other end of this spectrum however are the fortitude perks which are by and large useless increasing your resistance to the weather is purposeless as is increasing your damage resistance a zombie s bleed will still cause a great deal of damage and you can still be stunned harvesting perks belong to this stat for whatever reason but food is so plentiful in shops that they are rendered irrelevent regardless you need to put points into fortitude in order to survive for very long as each point in fortitude also increased your maximum health by 10 starting from a base of 100 at the base health it s easy to die in only a few strikes playing at the base difficulity following a bleed or a stun bleeding is a serious issue in this game it lowers your maximum health deals a great deal of damage and is absurdly common basic zombies dogs vultures and bears all have a chance 50 to cause the bleed condition which can be stopped with bandages bandages will also restore your maximum health up to its cap but not replinish any health making it difficult to recover from one unlucky hit vultures are everywhere they re fast they make a great deal of noise they cause bleeding they cause infection they don t work with the stealth system everywhere you go you see the vultures sometimes circling about but more often waiting at quest locations to swarm you and deal free damage to you damage which is hard to recover vultures spawn most often in the wasteland an area which no player should ever be given the chance dogs feral wights zombies which always run and are tough to kill boomer esque police zombies and bears all reside in the waste as well as randomly placed mines should you begin your game in the waselands you may a well give up as the game spawns a trader not far from your original spawnpoint and it s the only one you ll see for a while trading is now nearly purposeless with the exception of food guns sell for a pitiful amount and everything costs a fortune a bowl of hobo soup tier 2 food cooking costs the same as a tier 3 gun 150 coins this can be mitigated to an extent by putting points into the intellect skill for trading but those skill points need to be used to stay alive by fighting zombies and getting better loot and learning how to cook potatos the game is impossible intelligence will make up the entirety of initial perk points leaving you with base stamina health and resource gathering this will remain true until level 20 or higher which i have found to be well past the 7 day mark even with friends the game is still unforgiving in its night hordes which appear at all times of night seemingly just to damage your base and set you back as multiple people generate more noise than a single one this game was good if a little easy at its roots the zombies would be trivial during the day and at night they seemed to be blind leaving you to actually strike them down without them even responding truly late game structures where untouchable to zombies as they could exploit pathing to lead them in circles or down pits regardless the amount of settings which were available made it such that the game could be truly unforgiving and difficult if that were the desired game this is not the first time that the developers have produced an update like this one and i doubt it will be the last rather than improving these mechanics the developers reworked the game itself making it an entirely different gaming experience one which is not necessarily better as it stands i would not recommend this game at 25 nor even for free should it be reopened as such it simply isn t worth the frustration of playing let alone the berth of graphical gameplay and system errors which i neglected to mention as the game runs differently on each system should they fix this game instead of remaking it for the fourth time i ll come back and leave a more positive review
