2017 since the summer patch this game was beyond bad none of my favorite mods that made the game playable are working anymore worst patch ever and absolutely no communication from them also the mini map is horrible the big square city icons will eventually cover the entire map and you wont be able to see anything if your playing on a bigger map and the civ border colors bleed out past the coastlines so you can even tell what is water and what is land it is hands down the worst mini map ever in the entire 40 plus year history of video games completely and utterly useless don t even get me started on the horrible ai complete lack of meanful diplomacy or the balance issues because we would be here all night i have gone back to civ 5 and really enjoying it i honestly regret buying this game and that s something i never thought i would say about a civ game conclusion this is the simcity5 of the civilization series firaxis games has become the new ea maxis a company that puts money before quality games at the expense of the customer shame bell ring shame bell ring shame bell ring shame bell ring
