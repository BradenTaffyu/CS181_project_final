2022 i m finally done i played this game to relax and just enjoy something a little slower paced but the raw incompetence of the devs has finally done me in a 24 gig update and for what a dlc menu that s it that s literally it they added a menu and they re so incompetent as a dev team that they can t do it without pushing a 24 gig download to their customers absolutely taking the piss what next you fix a spelling mistake in a hunting stand and make us download 24 gigs for that too i like hunting games i don t like being around and right now the amount of time i m spending being around is more than the amount of time i get to play the game i don t want to have to download 20 gig updates every time you do a tiny minor bugfix every single other company can fix in 200mb you can have my upthumb when you learn how to code
