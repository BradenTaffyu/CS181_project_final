2018 gp s office design studio with a regular mini game of forcibly discharge half of your patients on a serious note this is 90 v1 04 93 of an awesome game and once the major issues see below are fixed i ll happily adjust my review the first third or so of the game works reasonably well the first three hospitals offer very little challenge and the next two are good fun after that however major balance concerns mean it mostly feels like you re fighting poor game design rather than being immersed in the actual challenges the game is trying to present edited as of v 1 04 thanks for the copy room button it looks like the devs are starting to fix some of the major issues though patient population is still a major gripe because it scales so much with hopsital size it s invariably better to make the smallest sensible hospital each time also for each of the last half dozen levels i had everything running fine by the time i got my first star then it s just a case of sitting and waiting with minimal effort most i just got bored of and moved on as there s so much repetition for the key objective i m looking at you blighton on the final level the intro to which boasts of a massive local pop pop cap is still just based on hospital size rating and no different to every other hospital well before my first star i had a complete hospital across just two buildings with 5 gp surgeries for stars 2 and 3 i e the final challenge all i have to do is train staff on promotion periodically send some patients home to cure when gps queues get too big and just sit for some hours on fast forward waiting for nearly 2000 cures it s a massive bore and a real letdown to end on current issues in decreasing priority 1 patients hold up queues by disappearing to the bathroom video game cafe for months 2 building extra rooms just attracts more patients rather than reducing queues even raising prices doesn t deter patients it just makes them grumpy and less likely to pay3 patients all die quite quickly as 80 of income comes from final treatment bankruptcy soon follows after the first queues form4 diagnosis priority feels broken gd cardio are obsolete once fluids is researched x ray is pointless scanner is worse than pointless as some docs come with the specialism wish i d never unlocked it if you have one dna room you need at least 3 or 45 there are still quite a few bugs in the game most aren t game breaking but dealing with them takes a fair fraction of your time in later levels wards fracture ward in particular are very glitchy and even when working normally have oddly low to variable patient throughput despite many nurses also why will the game not auto delete doubled up internal windows between rooms it works with everything else you can however just delete a machine that s on fire 6 room prestige is broken once you realise that adding a dozen gold star awards to every room is far more effective than a plant a bin some windows a few ornaments etc things get a bit dull and due to issues 1 4 any motivation for avoiding such min max cheese on aesthetic grounds wears thin pretty quickly everyone gives in before long 7 having waited two decades from first playing th for a cafe now we finally have one it s game breaking this makes me a little bit sad 8 epidemics the first two or three are fun after that they re just awful now unless my hospital is still tiny i just take the reputation hit and don t bother a few more bugbears to add to the list 9 staff challenges are too random year 1 mid game make 400k year 10 end game make 100k it s a distraction and not very helpful 10 emergencies aren t really reputation drop from failing is meaningless if not actually helpful and patents don t die when the timer s up so they re just nearly free money early in the level or just more patients once you have pleny of cash 11 i still don t like research also by the time i reached the train lots of researchers level i had nothing left to research seriously i just had to micromanage research another 20k every two minutes where are the new late game clinics i want my aliens back once the above are sorted this will be a pretty awesome game and a worthy successor to th let s just hope the devs can get there before the majority of players reach the later stages until then we ll be spending most of our effort towards a second and third star on each level manually turning away most of our patients one by one
