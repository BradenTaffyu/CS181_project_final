2018 early access review it seems like game devs have nothing left for 7dtd anymore recent videos which tease a17 are terrible unethusiastic and changes are strange graphics get better gameplay gets worse and not really in touch with what the community wants i have the feeling this game will not come out of alpha stage ever i had great moments with friends in 7dtd so it was worth my 15 back then but considering latest changes or lack of it i want to warn anybody who might have an eye out for 7dtd to either wait for a full release or to accept the fun pimps politics which contains game developmend in the speed of a snail if you dont have friends to play this with you should really not care about this one until a full release
