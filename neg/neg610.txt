2020 i recommend this game highly but i made the mistake of playing divinity original sin enhanced edition first and was spoiled by how freely i could do anything dosee ii is like playing a watered down version and it hurts because everything about this game is wonderful except the build path due to the armour system i wish i played this game first because without the armour system this game would have been 11 10
