2019 not sure how to feel about this one on one hand it s seen as a huge improvement in regards to previous bloons td titles with fancy looking 3d graphics new units and more refined upgrades but there s way more bad than good in this game for me before you read this review i want to make it perfectly clear you can play this game from start to finish and enjoy everything as intended without paying a penny more than what you ve paid to own the game and that s where the praise ends for me on a pure gameplay functionality aspect the game is flawed as well the music consists of an 8 bar loop and not much else the graphics although pretty definitely scream bad mobile port with the huge claustrophobic ui however the worst offender for this game is that it contains in app purchases for unit lootboxes purchasing upgrade and xp progress and coin doublers the pricing for these is egregious and misclicking one of the many buy all upgrades buttons will immediately with no confirmation or warning open the steam overlay to charge you upwards of 5 bucks almost half the game s price you still need to authorize the purchase on the overlay but it jumps right at you the cheapest of the microtransactions is xp for each individual unit which will cost you a buck unlocking every upgrade will cost you 5 bucks per unit you can also boost your hero for the duration of one 1 game for a buck as well you can farm all these incredibly fast without paying a penny including the premium currency monkey money which rains down on you through normal gameplay rendering the p2w useless and honestly it s baffling why it even exists just add a donate button if that s your excuse and don t charge 10 bucks full price for the game leaves a sour taste in the player s mouth and forces them back to td5 or other games i find it very disappointing that a 10 year old nintendo dsiware port of td5 feels better and safer to play than a new release on pc 4 10 functional and with great potential but just depressing
