2023 the boys in blue you waited 6 months for a very mediocre heist rats day 1 cook off a few months ago released as a free content shows you how tone death starbreeze are people played cook off to leech off cheaters and to farm exp not because people actually liked the heist so far the only thing that is shown is that starbreeze has a small skeleton crew working on the promised content to prevent themselves from being sued for false advertisement first paid content update i was leeching off a friend to try the 1st dlc heist i feel scammed and i didnt even pay any money literally got disconnected by the servers 18 minutes into the heist there are only 3000 players on steam i think we see where this is going with starbreezes incompetence somehow this is a worse launch then payday 2 launch and it is missing basic features like voice chat server browser and the ability to play solo the ui is straight out of nightmare subscription streaming service which makes the overall ux bad navigating between menus is unintuitive and makes pd th and pd 2 ui look innovative somehow this new game has regressed instead of improving on the existing ui on pd2 we told overkill their stat bars on weapons and stat names were in pd2 they fixed and now we see the same bs mistakes again overkill appears to be allergic to numbers servers are broken right now it cant seem to handle the matchmaking load
