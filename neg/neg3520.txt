2021 how can game devs make a game like this and then lock away content and gameplay behind grinding gameplay barriers just let us play the game on top of that they added in more chores for you to do to actually get dinosaurs and play the game so now you have to sit there listening to the sickeningly sweet elevator music they have while your scientists go on break like literally this is the gameplay you have to grind through to unlock stuff for sandbox and have fun it feels like a prank but its actually what they thought would make for addictive gameplay oh and they also added in a petrol upkeep feature so now you have to go around and make sure your little power generators have enough petrol to keep the power going fun also they removed the no combat option from sandbox add that back in and this review will switch to yes for now though just gotta spend several hours of my life grinding away and doing chores in this game before i can actually enjoy it
