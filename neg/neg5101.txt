2016 i am a loyal total war fan all the way from rome 1 it in fact was the first pc game i ever bought and i have had great times over the years on other total war games even empire and napolean but sadly warhammer just leaves a stale taste in my mouth the gameplay is great and the interface is amazing as well the real issue here is the content the game has almost zero replayablity i have 35 hours into the game and i feel like have done everything already for instance my dwarf campgains are almost played the exact same way every game becuase if you dont play it a certian way you get defeated you can t really take over the entire world you can just raze your mortal enemies lands and keeping going further into enemy territory and 5 turns after you raze that city guess what someone else made a new one there making everything seem pointless and boring over all the balancing of units was great and so was their design its just that as i am sitting here typing this review i can literally think of nothing more i can do in the game second this dlc whoring has to stop like angry joe said the game costs 60 like most big title games the last couples of years so the price is going up and you also want us to buy a 20 dlc for a horde faction literally the most annoying thing in the world i get that they are trying to make money but stuff likes this is turning the older fans like myself away from the game and towards other strategy games like hearts of iron 4 which in my opinion was a way better game then warhammer i already have 250 hours into it and still feal like there is alot of playability left there
