2019 i have mixed feelings about this game i ve played quite a lot of it and in the beginning genuinely enjoyed it but i ve gotten increasingly frustrated with how incomplete it still feels if you just want to play to clean up and redecorate some houses you may enjoy it however all the houses are extremely similar in layout and you are fairly limited in what you can do internally you can build new walls and put in new bathroom fixtures but can t change the placement of windows external doors stairs or small things like outlets the furniture and decorations get stale after a short time and you wind up using the same colors floors furniture over and over because half of them look terrible or don t match with other furniture and sometimes furniture that has the same color like venge or cherry wood looks completely different from one another when placed making it difficult to match furniture if you want to actually try to sell to each of the buyers it is almost impossible the same 2 3 buyers will always be in the top even if you put everything they hate in the house and nothing they like sometimes adding removing one decorative element makes the difference between buyers there is no consideration of color choices or furniture placement which kind of defeats the purpose of a house decorating game the auction system is also faulty imo you have one chance to ask for more money and even with all the upgrades it often fails and you don t get to negotiate anymore there is pretty much no indication of how much you can potentially ask for from each buyer except the one guy whose profile says he is a scrooge if you restart the game or quit the auction you lose money and still have to sell to the top buyer the recently updated menu looks better but is still difficult to use many items are named very similar things so the search feature isn t always useful you also can t just search for plant or something because all of the plants have specific names so you have to navigate through the menus to get to what you want not a huge deal but definitely something that could be improved it also occasionally bugs out so you can t click on any of the objects that you have to scroll down to get to and have to reset the game to fix the color swatches on most of the objects are broken and show placeholder images also the day night system makes no sense in this game it only makes it so you can t work on a house continuously without restarting the game because it is impossible to see at night and the flashlight just whites everything out you can t even put lighting everywhere because the lights go off if you are not standing in a room tl dr it s fun for a while and can be a good mindless thing to play if you re bored but it still needs a lot of work
