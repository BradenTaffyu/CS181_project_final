2019 i hate the new meta after the cv rework having cv around makes the decisions and gameplay of both sides terribly boring delete them already or just have a random mode that allows cv participation and separate it from the non cv randoms i don t play cv but i think rts is how cvs should be played altho those games were too dependent on the ability of cv players edit 1 just so u know other from that i couldn t think of any better warships games i hope wg don t mess their work upedit 2 i have this weird feeling that wg has been testing the patience and tolerance of us players recently fxp premiums becomes more expensive the upcoming apparently balanced ussr battleship lines and attempting to up tier an exclusive premium ship not very reassuring however the new space battles looks good i d say it is worth a try mar 12 edit 3 no wows really need a more professional english chinese translator who is familiar with all the navy business and this game after the incorrect translation of mutsu the chinese name of this t6 ijn bb is the same as mutsuki we now have alldestroyer as our april fools come on we all know that name is more destroys everything than everyone playing destroyer xd april 5 edit 4 great now people generally don t know what to do in a match without cv june 13 edit 5 just a side note tho something didn t feel right about this game anymore i used to really enjoy this game all day alone or with friends i m not a unicum but definitely not a newbie anymore with a 1418 pr and 55 wr anyone interested may reassure yourself with id lancer 10km sea server outdated this is before i gave my account to another bro of mine got another on na though iokmiles y maybe it was the staled ranked battles or the clan battles the dominate ships are obvious and the lineups almost never change within a considerable range of time it was the most enjoyable mode imo as my clanmates were very good we work as a team and we battled only for the win the community is also extremely poisonous it felt like everyone looks up your record and only judge based on that and i was among them too it was a good thing that i had a decent record but not everyone would enjoy their records being searched up by strangers you cannot purely play for fun because once you are playing outside a given role everyone just starts talking trash of you because most people are just out there seeking a win you have to play the way they want i wouldn t say that s totally wrong but you have to admit that something has to be wrong when a game become like this even in non competitive modes too many people take this game too seriously and i was one of them i used to play with one of my best bros but after some time i stopped calling him when i go online and gradually stopped teaming up with him simply he was just trolling around and having fun and didn t do as good as i would like him to that made me pretty mad from time to time i feel sorry for myself other than that i still quite like this game all those good times were real italian cruisers looks really cool would like to keep this game in library and keep going online every now and then but seems the steam version no longer allows wants players to go on their wg accounts so i guess this is it oct 31 edit 6 how to ruin your day simply launch world of warships and let the matchmaking decide your fate i hate myself for touching this game why do i keep returning anyway i knew i will be screwed may 14 2020 edit 7 i wasn t having a good day on edit 6 in retrospect for now though i would like to buy the jean bart collab commander if i can just buy a commander jean bart pack i am a fan of her voice actress i despise the risk of spending money and not getting what i want i just hope that later collabs would give players an option to buy a specific collab item directly similar to how they sell ships
