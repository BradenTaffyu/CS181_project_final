2019 instead of fixing the issues the game has the devs keep drastically changing the rules adding new features is great but overhauling all the mechanics of the game repeatedly without any easy to keep the mechanics in a state you like is absolute garbage it can be a fun game don t get me wrong but having to essentially relearn the game due to changes with every update is really annoying
