2018 early access review i had a lot of fun playing this with friends back in 2014 now that it s been 5 years since it s been released on steam i come back occasionally thinking it s got to be done by now right but no apparently not even close what s scary too is that we were playing alpha 10 back then and it s only at alpha 16 almost a full four years after we last played i m sorry but this is just the quintessential example of everything that s wrong with early access
