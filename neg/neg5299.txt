by the time you all read my review i will be dead wizards of the coast will be sending their chinese cia pinkerton black israelite private pmc death squad to my house to silence the truth magic the gathering used to be hands down my favorite card game of all time but unless you re willing to spend two grand on every single product they crap out which is basically every couple of weeks at this point hasbro does not care about you in the slightest they want the competitive whales arena seems very good at first glance it s technically the best magic simulator out there but if you sit down and play for more than 3 matches skill based matchmaking rears its ugly head because every multiplayer game has to keep your win loss rate at a perfect 50 50 or else the shareholders might not be able to afford their fifth vacation homes you ll play for two matches and get absolutely bodied by a man who weighs at minimum 400 pounds the game will detect oh this guy sucks let s put him up against a toddler who somehow opened arena while watching cocomelon you ll defeat a few players who can barely play the game then sbmm will put you back against the guy who spends money that could be used to get out of his mother s basement on virtual cards rinse and repeat until you whip out your or your mother s credit card or ragequit you can try to grind but with how often new sets are released there s no way you could ever keep up you will always be behind this isn t even getting into the state of magic in 2024 the card design has become bland all interesting ideas have been shaved away in favor of the same handful of mechanics copy pasted with slightly different names the art has fallen off wizards opting to use ai art awful looking limited time premium cards and generic looking digital art the story is a joke going from a decades long ongoing saga to a cheap avengers knock off where characters will change personality settings are completely flanderized and the mechanics of the 30 year old setting will randomly change on the whims of the cheap freelance writers or due to corporate demands which are usually just chasing pop culture trends heaven forbid entertainment stand their ground not turn into ip slop
