2017 the game has been out for the better part of a year and it still has massive bugs the ai is shoddy since it declares war on you in a moment s notice worse yet the game seems to cheat once i was i was attacked with 5 warriors on the tenth turn in ten turns i couldn t turn out more than one warrior they cost too much to make that fast the only way the computer could have gotten them is if they given the units free same thing goes with barbarians they will send out a scout once the scout sees you it returns to base if it gets back the barbarians will ramp up production and attack on the surface it seems like a great system that the barbarians won t attack until its scout reports on you unfortunately as with all other ais it will be given free units and easily outnumber you within the first 10 turns if you like playing a warmongering civ you might be able enjoy this game but if you stop making units for moment just to make a simple granary you will be outmatched and surrounded and unfortunately this is just the most glaring of several dozen bugs that this game still has it s a shame too with the districts the customizable governments the civics tree and so many other features it could have been a great game if they took the time to polish it properly unfortunately in its current state i would say save your money and buy civ v instead it is much more polished and refined than civ vi and i don t see that changing in the forseeable future
