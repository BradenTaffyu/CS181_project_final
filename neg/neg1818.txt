2023 miserable in every way shape and form never in my life or in my span of living have i found a genuine waste of my time like this was for 270 hours you would think i d enjoy the game if i stuck around that long and in truth there s times where you actually enjoy this game but for the 190 that i didn t it s a slog for every minute i wasted grinding i ve spent a few dollars to get premiums and all they do is lessen the time of the grind and make it feel like you re genuinely earning something without premium or a premium vehicle you feel none of the above top tier is not as good as it sounds and frankly enjoy the bias that trickzzter embellishes onto western vehicles there s a lot of fingers thrown around at the cause of the bias and instead of being gaijin entertainment s team it s more so focused on the people who want nothing but the worst for certain nations that being not fully exclusive to the west i have never in my life written a review for a game but this game is so passionate at being the worst and most dis loving to it s own community i genuinely needed to write this for the newcomers and for the people who want to sit and relax after a long exhausting shift this game is not for the casuals it s for the wallet burners and for the people who want to waste time doing something they think they will love in full covering the general scope of what this game has to offer already i want to leave it as general as possible so even if you are a returning player or someone who outright plays everyday you hear it from somebody else who was only thinking the same thing you were for however many minutes hours and days you ve put into war thunder this is not the game for you if you want a game with genuine vehicular combat i ll list below some alternative choices in which you might spark some interest in gunner heat pc hell let loose ww2 combat rising storm 2arma 3 moddeddcs world for people with a stronger pc just some extremely preferred suggestions i understand the modern and ww2 combat seems very intriguing but there is zero satisfaction when you reach them and i m speaking outside of just a few good games i am speaking from the 100 of time you play you will not leave with anymore satisfaction than you came in with understand that when you re playing you will always have the choice of playing something better and with more love put into it war thunder is a waste of time money patience and grinding do not make the mistake i did
