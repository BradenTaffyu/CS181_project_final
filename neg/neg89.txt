2017 early access review fourth edit it s now been a full year since this review was first posted and no progress whatsoever has been made vehicles are still deep in testing at least 2 months longer in development animations are nowhere to be seen not even info on them and the npcs are still non existent this will be the last time i update this review as i gave tis a full year to make progress after making this review they ve made practically none at all and it saddens me to see the game stagnate like it is i m giving up on this game as of today and the only thing that will make me update this again is actual progress by the dev team which seems unlikely third edit it s been ten months since i initially wrote this review and nothing appears to have changed so far animations are still around the corner and the dev s focus has once again shifted this time they ve decided to focus on vehicles which are also always around the corner npcs haven t been mentioned in this whole time as much as it pains me to say it i don t think the game will be finished anytime soon second edit another two months have passed and they ve made no progress whatsoever on animations let alone npcs don t ask about them on the forums anyone who isn t a moderator will jump on you in an instant they seem to be focused on making food realistic instead edit it s been about four months since i wrote my original review it seems as though nothing has changed so far which is unfourtunate it doesn t seem like the game is progressing at a reasonable rate i ve had this game for a very long time around 4 years and many others have had it for even longer almost 8 years the general consensus among non fanboys is that the development time is overly slow and the dev s it s finished when it s finished policy is detrimental to their standing anyone asking about npcs vehicles etc has their thread locked and are sometimes banned however the game is still very good one of the best zombie survival games out there the problem is that without npcs single player gets extremely lonely and tedious and in multiplayer some features can t be properly used because you can t time skip ie farming once you get farther into the game you pretty much just sit in your fort and eat sleep or in multiplayer you do the same but without sleeping when the game is finished 2 years from now at least i ll give this game a wholehearted recommendation until then i ll not support tis until they deliver on years old promises pros large maps to explore great atmosphere good injury system comparable to rimworld but not quite as in depth good graphics for a top down gamecons boring combat shallow end game content sitting in an invincible safehouse with unlimited food water until you kill your character out of boredom distinct lack of variety of weapons and clothing guns are completely worthless a single shot is liable to bring half the zombies in the town to your location this wouldn t be a problem if you could find more than ten bullets in the entire town no npcs no etas whatsoever any questions regarding undelivered content is met with it s done when it s done and a lock edit your thread won t be locked anymore but you will receive passive aggressive responses from some of the mods and aggressive responses by fans of the game
