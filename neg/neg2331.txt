2018 coming from 18 wheels of steel this game was very promising the thought of having all contiguous states 18 wheels of steel never included all states and many cities within them besides major and capital cities and having more detailed trucks and realistic driving dynamics was a seller for me the concept of this game is perfect a truck driving simulator based around america the way this game is developed is where it all goes downhill when this game was released only two states were released california and nevada arizona soon followed after however each additional state that is coming out is payware dlc let me repeat that each additional state not like each additional section of the map no one state at a time so far and the dlc in this game is not cheap either the whole idea of selling dlc this way just ruins the feel of this game since there are only three states free which makes everything very repetitive keep in mind when euro truck simulator 2 was released the whole map was available the whole map and if you wanted more you could purchase the scandinavian region or the going east expansion which was reasonable this however is not reasonable whatsoever and will end up making this game cost way more than it really should and as far as trucks go it has been two years since this game came out and we still have the same four trucks and two makes very stupid it s quite obvious they rushed this game to be released early and have everyone continuously pay to continuously complete the game and keep in mind canada and mexico are planned to be included which will most likely be payware very very expensive and honestly a worse concept of distribution i don t understand why they went a different path than euro truck simulator 2 i would much rather have them finish the development of all or most if you absolutely have to have dlc contiguous states then later on add canada and mexico as expansions that would be more reasonable but instead we get this shame overall the concept of this game is great i like that they are returning to america after a long time and after the completely disasterous 18 wheels of steel extreme trucker and extreme trucker 2 releases however the development of this game and the insane dlc concept they are using just ruins this game as a result i really do not recommend this game the dlc turns this game from a great concept into big dollar sign just like what most dlc does to other games too
