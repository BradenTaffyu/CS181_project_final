2018 even ignoring the controversy around this game recently i can t recommend it in good faith siege battles with actual walls are still buggy to a point where it s better to not even put archers on the battlements anymore cause the troops up there will bug out anyways bugs like that should have been fixed ages ago the only real reason to play the game at this point is divide et impera
