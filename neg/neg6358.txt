2023 i wish i could give this game a better review after 100 hours performance at launch was terrible couldn t play it for a week because it kept crashing during the shader compilation stutters worse than a pissed off 2 year old before bed time came back to play in october 23 and still having performance issues and crashes can t play for more than 20 minutes without crashing to the desktop playing on a 4080 i9 12900k these companies that release terrible pc ports need some kind of accountability
