2016 for me fallout 4 is a decent game at best but it s a horrible fallout game so i can t recommend the game as a fallout game if this is the direction that bethesda is taking the brand then the brand would have been better of going with some other company or even just being left alone other than it failing to live up to the series the story is shallow there s very limited choice character development is flat and the dialogue and reasoning behind issues always falls short but the combat is pretty fun so there s that hopefully obsidian will be given another shot at making a game like they did with new vegas so that we can get a game that at least tries to live up to its predecessors
