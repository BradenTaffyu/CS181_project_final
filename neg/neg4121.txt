2018 avoid avoid avoid there has been a new eula that was revised this year 2018 that allows data mining and if you have uninstalled previously you will not be able to reinstall the game without accepting this data mining agreement i am very annoyed at this as i did not consent to data mining when i originally bought the game in very early access and loved the game for a number of years but this move by the devs i feel they have tarnished an otherwise great game so sad for this after years of playing this game they throw this crap at us basically adding allowed spyware to the game and forcing long time players to agree or dont play a game you have already paid for
