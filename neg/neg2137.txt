2015 the game has been going down hill at a constant rate for about a year now the russian bias is growing more and more with each patch they send out the game used to be ballanced and fun now its oh look i m in a tank from 1944 fighting tanks from the mids 60 s driving a german heavy is like riding around ina car with a gas tank thats painted with the words please shoot me they have no armor as far as i can tell if you try to fight a russian tank one on one you will lose 9 out of 10 times also as far as i can tell russian players seem to have some sort of buff when they play their armor gets thicker and their guns hit harder one last thing the russian pay for tanks are massively overpowered they out class every tank they fight by a huge gap this was a good game but not any more thumbs down
