2022 this used to be my go to game for all star wars needs i could use a lightsaber fly a ship smack around some companions go through a compelling story line as a sith or a boring one as a jedi i have purchased well over 1 000 00 in cartel market coins for various outfits unlocks etc i loved to support this game in the years i have played it no longer the last patch is terrible the ui is so bad it gives you a headache they downgraded the graphics in multiple places made the gear grind insanely long and boring not omg this is gonna take a while but it will take weeks months to get yourself sorted they effectively made any alt you have useless with the gear grinds and skills changes they also nerfed gutted a lot of skills the expansion is about 2 hours long 4 if you are a casual player it is a buggy mess it literally looks like they got some high school kids in remedial art class to intern and redesign the ui i like many others have cancelled my account stay far away until they fix this mess it is not worth your money to come back right now maybe ever
