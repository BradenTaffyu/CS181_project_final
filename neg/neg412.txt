honestly if you can t take grinding and inventory hell don t play it most of the writing in the game is okay but not up to bethesda quality that they are known for wastlanders quests are worth playing and it s pretty much one of the only redeeming quest lines the only real reason to play this game is multiplayer i can honestly say this is the worst fallout game so far
