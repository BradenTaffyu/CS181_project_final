2018 felt like gordon ramsay while playing it it s f ing raw when you try any cool feature the game is indeed better 3 years after release although its optimisation still sucks terrible it s just bland and tasteless whenever you have to follow main quest the game failed to make a bond between me and any character in it why should i feel anything about my son if i have no memory of him other than spinning rockets above his craddle why should i care for my companions if they are immortal titanfall 2 did great job at making me friends with the ai transistor made me drop a tear because of some stranger in the sword and fallout 4 can t make me feel anything other than pure rage due to getting corrupted saves however i must note that bethesda worked a lot on companions they react to things around and your actions which is a noticeable and quite nice feature horrible what were you thinking when you made that whenever you have to listen to dialogues you can t rp your only options are question about the quest negative response which doesn t always work positive response sarcastic oh wow what a mess because it barely runs in 60 fps on lowest settings i admit i don t have the up to date gpu but it can handle battlefield 3 4 titanfall 1 2 and they definitely look better it s open world you say but no game actually lags harder inside small buildings you serve this for 60 dollars no comment do i recommend it no should you buy it if it s on sale and you enjoy mindlessly killing enemies with legendary freezing firey wide narrow scary nice grandma s machine gun of doom 1 damage against humans at night maybe
