2016 i really wanted to give this game a positive review i put in a ton of hours playing it and i love some of paradox s other games i love strategy games in general over 500 hours on crusader kings over a month worth of hours on the total war franchise i ve played and loved strategy since getting my hands on age of empires as a kid i even play dota therefore it pains me to write this negative review for a game that i really wanted to love but here it is there are too many things broken with the base game to justify spending money on it lets go through how a player would normally play the game and go over everything i ve found that led to this review imagine it in mr plinkett s voice if it helps get you through the wall of text that is to come oh and there will be spoilers you ve been warned part one everyone hates racistsspecies designing is an awesome idea collecting the atributes that make your race unique lets you play the game your way but there are traits that are just not beneficial and cost the same amount of trait points as other clearly superior ones the best example of this is the xenphobes trait if you want to play with efficiency in mind there s only a few viable paths to do down this becomes extremely evident on harder difficulties part two no building queue electric boogalooso you colonized a new planet good for you now you get to set up the colony and get to work building buildings but wait did you research a bunch of upgrades for your generators and what not good you ll get to remind yourself of that every time you upgrade each farm by a teir and your power plants and your mines and all your other buildings without the ability to queue up multiple upgrades for the same building you ll get to go back to it each time and pat yourself on the back for what an amazing job you did in researching that upgrade this is across every planet you directly control all of which have between 10 and 19 building slots i think i saw a planet once with 23 oh and none of the upgrade chains branch out at all so you just get to click upgrade a bunch of times an ai could do it but not this ai which brings me to part three artificial intelligence real stupiditythe ai in this game is like a brain damaged 3 year old this is going to be the longest section so buckle down grab some popcorn and put away your wallets i ll start with the first toddler in these computerized special olympics settlement ai so you have an arbitrary cap on how many planets you can manage this cap is pretty reasonable since it also happens to be around the point where it becomes increadibly teadious to micro all your systems the game s solution to this is to add extra systems you acquire into ai governed sectors that automate the building and upgrading for you this is a good idea in theory you put initial supplies into their stockpiles and they develop based on a selected focus eventually they theoretically grow into self sustaining states that pay you a portion of their resources you can even assign governors to give all the systems in a sector a nice bonus but the problem is that often times the ai will not build anything on some tiles on the planets you give them the population keeps growing and eventually can start starving if the ai didn t build enough farms you can t order any building projects on those planets either and revoking them from the ai costs 25 of a certain resource that you only get 0 3 of every month that resource is also used for stuff like colonizing building outposts and certain improvements and establishing protection pacts and certain other diplomatic treaties and more also the sectors can only give you 75 of their montly resources and the rest they put into their stockpiles these become full and the 25 that gets put into them is lost you cannot remove anything from the stockpiles either ai in space spacespace space combat so in this game you get to design ships to counter the designs of your enemy its a step up from rock paper scissors combat and is a pretty cool feature of course its ruined by the ai not being able to design ships for their ships are horrible frankensteinian creations inefficient and are not in any way designed to work alone or together as a fleet you ll begin to notice this when you re fighitng enemy ships but it becomes really obvious when you are either engaged against the big bad engame threat or are in a shudder federation i ll devote a section to each since its that bad part four i don t want to live anymorethe end game is broken i faced the hive mind tyranid invasion and i was stoked oh man i thought here comes someone that finally can challenge my fleets better than my punching bag neighbors even if it was just sheer numbers i didn t care they entered the galaxy from the north took a few systems from some poor sod and i saw their fleets starting to spread across the region i was ready to kick some hive minded ass but then they all stopped they decided to start siegning and bombarding planets and waiting waiting for what it took me a while to find out and after i did i stopped playing at first i thought the rest of the galaxy finally started fighting back but after a while i went out to explore and i saw this i imgur com and this i imgur com i was so sad that i made this i imgur com its a frowny face made of corpses the other two pictures are of a bunch of colony ships just floating not colonizing they didn t try to escape when i attacked them either they just sat there maybe when they arrived the tyranids saw how badly designed the game was and just wanted to die who knows then i saw the other reason their fleets were just hovering in orbit i followed an invasion fleet from one of their worlds to the capital planet of the empire their pre generated forces kicked the snot out of what you are about to see is the terrible legion of the end game ai happened several times before and continued for another hour before i saved the galaxy by shutting of the game part five federations are the most dissapointing thing since no man s skyai in federations are a mess like so much else in this game they design terrible ships for the federation fleet and then the game decides that that their designs are superior when determining what gets upgraded into what ai that start wars sometimes never end them even at 100 warscore i m sure this is a bug but its so damn annoying i m mentioning it here there is no way to influence the ai to vote in on your measures if they don t already agree there was so much potential for diplomacy here but nope part six when will this review end already the game ends when you have taken control of around half of the galaxy s habitable planets or taken the capital of every enemy empire this becomes a problem when you re playing as a pacifist or you just don t want to take the time to conquer the galaxy 3 planets at a time yep when you declare a war no matter who its against or how badly you win you can only take at most 3 possibly 4 planets at a time and then get forced into peace i actually hit the limit on the length of this review so de ded ded dat s all folks if you are the kind of guy or gal that likes to spend hours on the mod page and doesn t care about playing on ironman then you might find some solace in the amazing amount of workshop support for this game but i can t recommend a broken game where the developers don t bother to fix issues that have been there since launch
