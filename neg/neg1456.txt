2022 early access review i would not recommend buying this game until it leaves early access at which point i may re evaluate it good after many years in development the game engine has been vastly improved running both smooth and stable on modern pcs the graphics and ui have undergone a much needed modernization bad content has been neglected throughout the early access process the game has added more in a haphazard and inefficient manner there are more quest givers but none of them surpass the function of the warband guild master or village chief there are more factions but still the same number of culture troop trees there are more ai nobles but less ways to interact with them there are a lot of dialogue trees that are still empty modding conflicting signalling from the dev team on modding in theory this is the main reason for a custom engine and all the development time is being spent to make it versatile and moddable in practice the modding community had to make their own tools for managing compatibility and supporting moddability butterlib and harmony there is no guarantee that the game will live up to its promise of surpassing the module system of warband post early access yeah the game didn t get better
