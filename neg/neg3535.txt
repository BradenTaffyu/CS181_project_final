2020 overall while i appreciate that anyone would produce a spiritual successor to theme hospital this is not a fun or enjoyable game at first i thought this was a carbon copy of bullfrog s theme hospital as i progressed through the game i realized just how wrong i was as the game began to demand heavy micro management of all staff and patients while removing a lot of the fun reward incentives that theme hospital offered back in the day poor priority handling horrible pathing and generally bad ai mean that the player needs to step in and manually sort through queues setup doctor s schedules manage the gp offices and try to mentally juggle the needs and actions of 100 actors at any given time to get any degree of efficiency out of your hospital i cannot emphasize enough that past the first few hospitals no matter how well trained your doctors are and how conveniently your gp offices are placed next to your diagnostic rooms you will witness an absolute mess as patients die waiting to cycle through the gp offices it got to the point where after 180 days 0 patients had finished going through my gp offices so i had to manually send them for treatment or home some of the fun little activities in theme hospital are still present in two point hospital like the annual awards and shooting rats but now they offer no rewards or benefits and are strictly there to waste your time also i don t like the shared research it s not really fun or interactive to hope that someone from your friend s list will hop on and assist with your research project so that you can unlock a treatment maybe there s merit to this that i m not seeing but i don t like it
