2018 it s probably my favorite racing game and i really love playing it but there s that gigantic drawback that keeps me away from spending day by day driving the multiplayer or what they call multiplayer the problem is that a friend can t join a server with a car he has when it also contains cars he doesn t have and i totally don t get this srsly i bought this game and all dlc and bought that game again for my friend just to find out that we nearly can t play together i spent ages to get a server running due to the fact that theserversoftware doesn t run on linux and the setup is a pain in the arse if you have to figure out which cars you can add when you re finally there your friend can t join with a car he has because somebody else is using a car he s not even allowed to see i can t hate more about how bad this is i mean it s ok he can t drive cars he doesn t have and can t joins circuits he doesn t have but that he can t even play with someone who s riding a car he doesn t have is so i have to set up a server with this pain in the arse server setup tool where it s so annoying adding cars and additionally find out which cars he s allowed to see so that we can play together i bought tons of dlc that i do not play cause my friends are not allowed to see my cars great anyway ui is absolutely on 4k and everything but intuitiv beside that multiplayer drawback it s an awsome racing game which i d love to play all day long so i ended up spending ton s of money for a great game with huge decrease in multiplayer fun recommended only for solo players update edited some parts to make them more clear and decreased the number of misspellings etc additionally i wanna add that the dlc s are often in sale we now went over to get them from time to time which in my opinion is a bad company policy to force your customers to that i wanna add some more things on the dedicated server software side for those who are interested in that also note that this negativ review is not focused on the physics sounds etc because there are probably some good reviews out there for that this is about informing you what you may consider before buying i played now some hours with my friends in the multiplayer and if you finally get what you were looking for it s pure fun dedicated server software as mentioned it is not intended to run on linux which was a problem for me because i got a dedicated server with linux we tried run it on wine which was problematic with the port forwarding the server software requires ports 9600 and 8081 there might be some ways to get it running on wine but you should look those up first if you consider running the software on a dedicated linux server note that the server software is in the gamefolder also there s a tool for configuring it which i mentioned is not so good you can only use it if you have the game installed and adding cars is a lot of work it has some ftp functionallity which you can use to remotely edit config files i guess at least if you have to figure out first which cars all of you got you may also ask why i didn t run the server software on the pc i m playing with which is possible this is due to some port forwarding issues and the fact that i have a shared ipv4 and can t open ports i also have a second internetprovider here with another internet access and an ipv4 and i m now running may laptop as a server when needed with that internetaccess and it works just fine somehow if you wanna run it on the same pc you may google first because i read about some issues running the game and the server on the same pc but it s probably fixable
