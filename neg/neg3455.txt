who wasn t happy when skyline 1 arrived after the downfall of simcity but now paradox slips into the same shoes like ea before by destroying their own powerful franchise they are obsessive with short term profit stock value and investor happiness that both investors as well as paradox management fail to understand the basic rule of business keep customers happy skyline 2 isn t worth a single cent i cannot recommend it at all i would rather spend that money to short paradox shares instead there are so many issues old and new alike it s simply insane to release such an incomplete game without remorse let me list up just a few of the experienced issues no kill button to wipe clean the entire city even simcity had it already symmetrical zoning is more complicated than before traffic rules are completely ignored by cars and pedestrian waterways generally make bridge building nearly impossible lack of proper compatibility tunnel entrance a visual mess and bug rail stations only attach to existing roads but not to existing railways natural disasters and traffic accidents require complete overhaul complete mess jets fly through tornado like it doesn t matter planes land on occupied runways and they just pass through each other no option to disable sidewalks or to stop pedestrians from entering tunnels or other off limit areas hydro plant provides a street on it but cannot change traffic mode oneway twoway hydro plant doesn t have emergency empty feature removal means flooding operating range of many buildings unclear not visible upgraded buildings cannot be adjusted requires to bulldoze and rebuy from scratch agriculture looks all the same regardless of grain vegetables animals or whatever mods disabled community cannot fix issues on their own new issues outnumber new features old issues outnumber few featuresand i could continue the list of issues for much longer but it s a complete waste of time since paradox doesn t listen to their consumers at all proof check early access date release date and how many fixes were added until today i wouldn t even mind to buy dozens of valuable dlcs but skyline 1 proved to be critical in that matter too at least half of the offered dlcs were not worth community mods did a better job it would be smarter to hire such creators and make a win win for all do yourself and all others a favor by boycotting paradox until they learned their lesson and resume their business properly it s not like we wouldn t pay a good price for the game but we want a completed game which we can enjoy from start and with reliable support steam says i officially played 168 hours probably half of it afk timer but regardless i did my part to check the game thoroughly to make this feedback it s very unfortunate that both skyline as well as simcity are now dead to me i never expected paradox to be such a stupid company comparable to ea it s a cancer to the game industry
