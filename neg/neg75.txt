2017 early access review game will never be finished don t buy unless you want a solid 90s walking simulator without content if you want to be bored and run around senseless and enjoy an empty world without opportunities but with hordes of zombies at least this game absolutely is for you don t be fooled by the earlier positive reviews the game once started promissing but as often it s in early access since 6 years now in other words the game will never be finished it s just another eternal project of rookie coders too bad because the concept itself was quite good
