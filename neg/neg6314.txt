2023 unfortunately despite the fact that i completed the game to 100 with all achievements i have to say that despite the initial enthusiasm and absolute euphoria from the wonderful hogwarts and its surroundings there was a big disappointment once the apparent tinsel wears off huge flaws begin to emerge the main story line is flatter and flatter from task to task the secondary characters are bland and unsavory and there is absolutely no reason to develop a relationship with them they are just npc characters that you do a few tasks for dark arts and forbidden curses are a stupid joke and no fun because you have to use them only within the limits of the law never against the innocent besides all other active spells kill too absolutely useless thing but i understand why they are there all the time you feel like you are the only and most experienced and gifted person in the school everything revolves around you the closing ceremony in the great hall was incredibly awkward for god s sake why wasn t it possible to actually actively participate in school lessons but just suffer through an unnecessary cutscene after all it is the school year at hogwarts disappointment there is a huge collection of things in the game to get achievements but unfortunately a lot of them are full of bugs they cannot be collected until you restart the game or there is nothing in the place it took me over fifty hours of game time and a lot of grays to complete even after patching the game is full of bugs constantly crashes and is very poorly optimized constantly repeating locations that look the same over and over also get boring quickly this is the best harry potter themed game since the old arcade days but unfortunately it s just an inflated bubble that quickly deflates the game itself is not bad but i recommend waiting for a big discount i consider myself a huge fan and connoisseur of the world of harry potter so i am very sorry for my review but hopefully it will help someone
