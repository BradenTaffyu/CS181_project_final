2020 let me start by saying i was a long term fan of stellaris and have played since the first versions a very different creature tldr stellaris has gone from a game about imperial galactic expansion to worrying about your shopping list as others have said before me 2 2 has continued a dark trajectory that saw stellaris go from a grand galactic strategy game focussed on interesting problems like colonial expansion technological improvements and military strategy to an internally focussed sim style micromanagement game where the majority of your focus in on tediums like fluctuating resources market deviations and sector balancing when in addition to energy credits cash and minerals materials it was decided to add alloys and consumer goods and tradable special resources i recognised pretty much straight away that the main function of these new metrics is just to cap the player s ability to advance too quickly which stellaris already does through the ever annoying and meaningless political influence metric anyway still after a while i decided to see if maybe in addition to these annoying aspects there were some new elements to the gameplay that would make it more fun if only you can be bothered with the extra resources to manage the answer to that is no the market that was introduced in 2 2 is clunky and the economic system means instead of energy and mineral balance being an early struggle a developing empire eventually gets large enough to overcome it s the perpetual struggle and main point of the whole game worrying about sudden inexplicable energy deficits and or mineral shortages or consumer goods crashes when you control an empire of dozens of worlds is beyond insane this is without going into all the other ways the game needlessly creates obstacles to your expansion that just feel like they are ways to slow you down rather than creating a game that is challenging enough that even good players could still be stopped in their tracks by unfolding political or stochastic events stellaris has really disappeared up the wormhole and what it is now is just not that fun to play
