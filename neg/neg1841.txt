2014 this game was good at one point the game was mostly balenced and playable mostly it was one of my most loved games and now its just horrible grindy repetetive and all round boring gaming experiance even at low tiers it is obvious what planes dominate the sky cough russians cough and you cant really argue with planes such as the yak 9 t k exsisting which have really only been made more overpowered after nerf the problem is that it appears that they have made the grind to long to keep interest in playing and they have made it clear that they have a biased towards planes and nations i do no t recomend playing this game untill one of either things happen 1 matchmaker redesigned2 they listen to the players who are playing the game and giving constructive criticism to help move the game forward but i highly doubt that this will happen update 2 08 16yup its got worse much worse
