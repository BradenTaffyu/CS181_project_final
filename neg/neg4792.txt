2022 i wish i could recommend this game as it s fun for anyone who likes interior design but i have a few points i d like to comment on first the game will give you missions by emails basic things change furniture change environments among others after some time you can renovate houses from scratch everything that is expected from the base game done in a good way however with these dlcs being released farm pets and who knows what else in the future it seems that the game is getting more and more content but the base itself is not being optimized for this things that seem to be disconnected from the game purpose for example pets bathe animals do we really need this and the farm dlc that will add crops and more animals why would i want to plant things i m playing a game focused on renovating houses period another point would be that the base game is dated for example the customers interested in buying the houses they are images of very ugly 3d characters while in the new dlcs the customers are better made with digital art representing them and narrations the problem is that both are present in the game why you can t commission the artist who made the drawings of the new dlcs to draw the bad models of the base it seems that as the releases went on they weren t sure where to go first the 3d models then the hgtv dlc with 3d models that moved then out of nowhere drawings also the game is poorly optimized it seems that no matter what computer you have you will always have performance problems at some point and in this case this point will be when you have 5 lights on in the house and i m not sure if they do intend to improve the performance of the game as i said it seems that they are focused on just adding content and making a sequel to the game after all why fix it if we can profit from a sequel that will be poorly optimized like the first one right in my view this seems to me to be carelessness lack of commitment and passion for the ideal of the game
