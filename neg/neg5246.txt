2022 i have mixed feelings about this title there are many positive things to say about it but also many negative ones that folow tw series from quite a while siege battles are a joke they might have been deleted from this game and very little would change walls are more of an annoyance than a real problem and even the biggest garrisons have hard time defending against a single army no naval battles i have no idea if there are any naval battles in wh universe so maybe that s the reason anyway they are crap as they are land battles gun powder this one is not even a joke it s an entire circus rifle bullets fire in an arc gunners can shoot even if they are in the 10th row and there is no reload animation empire tw from 2009 has much better gunpowder mechanics than this game no unit formations whis is my biggest problem with the game why they removed something so crucial there is not even a phalanx formation i have no idea why devs made this decision no units gear upgrades in previous tws blacksmith could improve the quality of soldiers gear in this game it gives them xp instead it seems that soldiers learn how to fight better by staring at blacksmith i have no idea why make this change either no banners nor officers it s a visual detail but i don t see why remove it especially when one of the first technologies of the empire is literally a banner soldiers bump into each other when units are moving through each other it may seem like a small detail but it makes your units slowed down considerably and is annoying especially because it wasn t the case in some older wt games over all it seems to be a downgrade in some aspects in comparason to older games i mean yeah the game is pretty and nice but for this price i d expect at least good gunpowder ballistics
