2022 looks like a fun game played it once for about 20 minutes looked promising next time i tried to start it up however nothing again i press play nothing look up on google to find out this is a common problem with the ubisoft launcher isn t great how all these game companies need their own launcher now apparently i have to go into the files and do some adjustments which to me means get a refund damn shame looked like a fun one
