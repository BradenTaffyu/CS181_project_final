2018 i have spent quite a while on this game and although it has some excellent content and beautiful sceneries i cannot recommend it as is let me explain the game is absolutely beautiful even on a average spec machine you will find yourself immersed in these highly detailed and foliaged landscapes full of amazing sounds you will walk and continue walking and walking aaaaaaand walking that is something you will be doing a lot of this in itself isn t the bad part as you do enjoy this quite a lot unfortunately the devs thought it would be wise to hide quite a bit of content which would make the game much more user friendly behind a paywall to be specific i m talking about tents bivies and the all terrain vehicle atvs a game mechanic which is annoying is the fact that you can t save your progress anywhere you are unless you have a bivy which is only available as paid dlc given that the maps are quite large and the points at which you can actually spawn few and far between it means you could find yourself walking for 30 minutes only to log out of the game and be re spawned at a central location nowhere near where you were unless you have a bivy tent additionally the fact that the only way to get around faster than walking is to use an atv makes it extremely annoying so overall these are my pros and cons pros amazingly detailed sceneries great soundscape to maps some good game mechanics such as tracking and bullet entry diagrams following a killcons no way to save progress unless you own dlc or are at one of the cabins you can stay overnight once you own a bivy you still have to spend in game money to stay in it and you also have to spend money in a cabin extremely slow map to get around unless you buy additional dlc in the form of an atv quite expensive game given the above issues
