2016 tl dr shiny casual galaxy sim with features thrown in so people look at them and get excited then the game devolves into grindy unbalanced poorly optimized mess it was a promising game great visuals some stories but 1 frustrating and fiddly ui subspecies management fleet splitting army management for example to build a proper army you have to manually click every unit and add an attachment which is very low cost and has no drawback only problem is clicking a lot 2 no real depth to the game no supply mechanics just build anywhere only viable strategy for war is doomstacking fortificating is useless because even top tier space defense station can be easily overcome by contemporary fleet most it can do is shoot down unarmed transports being carelessly sent by ai 3 events are interesting deep and varied but all scripted and you get the same ones every game mostly gets boring after first time 4 performance gets awful from mid into late game game gets choppy and frustrating to look at with anything but five ships on the screen only one cpu core is ever used expect fps death 5 ai is dumb sending numerous unarmed fleets to their death only way it can win is via cheating which is called difficulty setting 6 most of the game is spent micromanaging your planets ensuring the best positioning of buildings you have to process each planet manually to achieve good returns but you can t keep them all under manual control so you have to give them out to sectors having only small pool of planets to manage yourself results in frustrating fiddling with sectors otherwise you have at best sub par performing planets at worst ai management causes happiness to drop and sectors revolt a lot of research is useless a lot is must have and clearly they didn t think about balancing it much just threw a ton of tech with x percent to something in free updates are ongoing but while fixing stuff they kinda break game even further they tack the shiny stuff like perks quests and carbon copy of civ 5 culture perks on top without fixing basic stuff only year after release they finally are contemplating adding drawing resources from sectors which everybody have been suggesting on forums from day 1 certain overpowered ship parts were fixed by dramatically restricting your option for ships every ship size is locked into its role and has very restricted options for weapons there s still no any signs about adding some kind of espionage system will probably be in dlc two years from now stay away unless in far future they patch this mess up unlikely they will never abandon the sinking engine like bethesda
