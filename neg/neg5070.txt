2019 okay great game but uhm what the hell is up with payed dlc s so the game offers 8 factions you can play for free and 9 in payed dlc s what the is that normal now the king and the warlord 7 49 realm of the wood elves 17 49 call of the beastmen 17 49 chaos warriors 7 49 norsca 9 99 so if you would like to play all races that would cost you just 59 95 extra on top of 59 99 game cost that oh and by the way blood for the blood god 2 49 what this actually is a gore filter off gore costs money now
