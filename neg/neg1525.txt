2022 early access review yeah yeah 97 hours at time of posting i love m b i love sandboxes but this isn t better than warband in most aspects this game is lacking features for its price tag i could spend those 97 hours on warband for the exact same experience the only thing you re going to experience differently is the dissapointment you will play through it thinking oh why is trading between lords so useless and they can only do it with the player wow i can own only 4 workshops fine my clan is still small but why are they so boring i can visit them surely the developers intended for it be bigger are you really supposed to buy them and pray for good rng aight not only is executing lords censored so i don t even get to bathe in the blood of my enemies let alone see the full animation of the chop chop but also everyone hates me and i get nothing since these bastards suddenly reproduce faster than cockroaches bruh i make 50k by destroying an army in 2 seconds by selling their loot and ransoming their prisoners but my 6 workshops that pretty much produce all the olive oil in this desert region are barely making any money would be nice if monopolies were profitable lol oh i forgot i married that lady since the game bugged her out and i cannot visit her even though she s governing my city guess i m a medieval incel now so i got 4 castles and other than being besieged all the time they are literally useless they barely make profits the villages are annoying since they are always getting raided while i m on the other side of the map and honestly what is the function of those castles in the game world it s not like they create any problems for enemies to pass literally 2 metres infront of the gates on their way to besiege my capital so what the f i pre ordered this game i played it and this was my experience back then after a period of 2 years that i didn t bother to try it again i did it yes i spent a lot of time on it but if i had instead installed warband i wouldn t feel any difference it s the same game not even re skinned it looks the same for the most part the map s different which also serves no function you can literally put all the kingdoms and such on a randomly generated map that includes 4 biomes and you would have the same experience everything is useless and a disapointment do not buy this buy warband or don t even bother paying for any of them
