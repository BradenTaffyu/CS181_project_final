2017 i bought this hoping it would be the hunter 2 it s more like the hunter lite it s a shooting gallery with pretty graphics the difficult hunts that made the original so appealing are replaced with animals everywhere with no sense of self preservation they call constantly and let you walk right up to them before they run and they even call several times specifically to warn you that they are about to run so you can just run around at a full sprint and wait for the warning calls then stop and shoot them often times a shot doesn t even spook near by animals so you can lay waste to entire herds in a short time the leveling grind also promotes this style of gameplay needing to both earn ridiculous amounts of cash to buy new equipment as well as needing a ton of xp to unlock the ability to even purchase it on the plus side its pretty the landscapes are massive the draw distance has nearly doubled and the shooting feels a lot better than classic the game has a lot of potential but this isn t early access this is a full release and they have no obligation to change anything this combined with the history of primal leaves one with doubts about the future of this title hopeful doubts but doubts nonetheless
