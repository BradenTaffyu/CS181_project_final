2018 3 years 600 hours player i have to admit i love this game but i feel uncomfortable with recent updates it feels like paradox is trying to take my fun away from me i don t want old things back i agree with your idea of balancing but you may consider a way that encourages players instead of creating frustration in their way of playing it s even worse in later updates
