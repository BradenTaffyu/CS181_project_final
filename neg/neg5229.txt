2016 so i have played every single total war available there are good and bad to each game i was great excited about this game unfortunately it has let me down big time the lore and story line of the game is great it seems this time around the dev s focused on the story and lore of the game the main focus for me is the battles so i was very disappointed when they took out all the individual unit commands and formations i loved in like napolean how you could take your unit and put them in a square formation to hold off being surrounded among other things this game allows you to do the basics of point and click and little manuevering it really let me down on the differnt kind of formations and such i remember when you could put your calavry in a a wedge or diamond formation for more of in impact all that is gone sad sad days if your in it just for the lore and story you will nnot be disappointed if your more battle focused as i was you will be sadly disappointed
