putting all the graphics glitches and bugs the game was fun for 20 h then you realise than none of the things you do does matter in the game public transportation moving sliders it s almost impossible to lose at some point it s more of a challenge to go bankrupt than ran a successful city it feels more like a puzzle than a game don t regret spending money but it s so boring and lacking of challenges that playing just doesn t make sense
