2023 between this game and stellaris i will never buy a paradox game again constant updates remove game features and add them into dlc currently the ultimate bundle which includes all dlc is over 300 i have been playing paradox games since the original hearts of iron but no more the game on it s own is a decent 4x strategy game but i can not support the scummy practices of paradox
