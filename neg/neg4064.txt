2018 you might be wondering why the score is in the negatives and why there has been such criticism of the game as of last here are the basic reasons why and also why i am giving this a thumbs down as well this game was one of the best when it was an indie game and had a lot of community support many youtubes such as myself helped this game grow over the years and used to for both education and recreation then the first bad news started to trickly in first the bad press about squad underpaying and treating poorly its employees despite making millions in profit this was followed by the acquisiting by take2 a sale that nobody expected and something that made the community fear the worst a video game giant turning this game into a cash grab it of course took a few months to happen but it happened as expected it s still the same game at its core but you are now forced to agree to newly revised eula that essentially limits modding bread and butter of the game limits the use of unauthorized editting or other versions of the game and in essence gives take2 many reasons to sue people if they end up breaking one of many vague regulations on top of this one of the first things that take2 did is released a paid dlc which really angered the community and not because it was a cash grab but because it was a mediocre mod based on a lot of free stuff that was available already a few historic missions that could have been downloaded via a modding tool lastly stories of excessive censorship on the forum and basically big company mentality that suddenly became the standard added to the fury of the fans luckily for many of older players we still have older files on our drives and or can access pre take2 version of the game but for the new players it will never really be the same so all in all the game was great then got ruined by new administration which also means squad as a company lost a huge loyal fan base and any other project they decide to do will most likely be met with a lot of skepticism tl dr not really worth it anymore as it turned into a cash cow
