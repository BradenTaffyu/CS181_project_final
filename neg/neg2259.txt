2013 do not touch this game until they redo the progression system once again as of update 1 37 the progression system is as grindy as it is going to be and even if you did pay you would have to pay an absolutely ridiculous amount of money to even get close to being competitive it is an abomination of pay to win at the moment otherwise if you can get over these things the gameplay core is amazing it has a really good flight model and damage model making it possible to accurately slice and dice enemy planes
