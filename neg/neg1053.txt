2023 i really wanted to enjoy this game especially after how much i loved skyrim and fallout new vegas and for a good while i actually did but the bad aspects just kept piling up the entire settlement building aspect of the game is just a wasted opportunity at doing something more akin to survival craft games in the fallout universe there s no real shortage of resources or difficulty behind it to make acquiring them challenging the does do a decent job of providing building flexibility especially with the dlc add ons but ultimately it s also all for naught the settlements just aren t integrated into the game s storyline and progression beyond the first build a single one to unlock the next questline the settlements grow food and water sure but that has absolutely no impact on the game unless you play on survival mode which also disables fast travel not to mention the settlements constantly demanding that you stop whatever you re currently doing to advance to rush back and defend them even if you set them up with enough defense to handle themselves you still lose happiness in the settlement if you don t rush back so it s only a penalty to progression on top of that some of the settlements are just critically bugged if you actually let them grow to the full extent they re able then certain settlements just cause the entire game to crash whenever you approach their radius making entire sections of the map around them unplayable and breaking other questlines in the process which brings me back to the real issue here the massive game breaking bugs that still persist in game even now many years after its initial launch i know bethesda is known for buggy games at launch but in others like skyrim and nv they at least fixed them well enough that the core game was playable not so here there are numerous game breaking bugs that make the game crash when trying to progress the main plotline in both the nuka world and machinist dlc i was met with bugs that would crash the game and the only way to progress around them was to utilize console commands to complete that quest phase in order to skip over the bugged out section of the quest even worse this level of game breaking bug is also present in the main story questline as well do not play this game it s not worth the frustration of the bugs and the constant crashing in the end
