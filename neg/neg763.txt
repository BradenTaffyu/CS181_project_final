2016 by far the worst fallout game every recent release by bethesda has removed core rpg elements and features i tried to look past the dumbing down of tes with the release of skyrim however bethesda has crossed the line with fo4 i preordered this game and after all these months i have less than 100 hours comparing this game to fo1 is an injustice this is an open world shooter with no available choices i encourage anyone who reads this to search youtube for the choices in the first two games regarding dialogue fallout was a masterpiece with its beautifully crafted dialogue which made it possible to replay and discover something maybe a year later fallout nv is the closest you will get to the real fallout bethesda makes beautiful open worlds but they sure as hell are unable to make good rpgs as of late if you have never played fallout before you will probably enjoy this game
