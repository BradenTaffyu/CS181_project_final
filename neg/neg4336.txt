2016 i wouldn t recommend this game at the moment i played on prince difficulty standard for my first playthrough while i got used to the new systems etc i focused on science output and found myself 27 technologies ahead of my nearest rival more than double i conquered the civs that were on my continent then spent a bit of time sorting out the empire while i decided whether to go for science or domination victory i destroyed another civ then before i know it i win a culture victory i d hardly gone for any culture the whole game i ve started again on a higher difficulty but i really don t like the civ method of making it harder i want to play against a smarter opponent not one that just has lower costs etc than me it seems like the ai is still playing civ5 totally unaware of all the boosts to technology and civics that are available it also seems to have a problem upgrading troops meaning it often just has a mass of slingers and warriers while you roll through it with a few tanks and artillery in the late game while the systems all feel improved the ai doesn t seem capable of using them which makes much of it pretty pointless i m pretty sure civ6 will be a really great civ game but they need to put a lot of work into the ai to make it happen if it does i ll happily change my review edit 02 11 16 minor edit regarding ai capabilities
