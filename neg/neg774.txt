2021 tl dr if you don t care about a well written story world characters go ahead if you do it ll be extremely disappointing and a wasted potential rant version below before you dismiss this by saying urr durr we know you like f nv yes it s a past entry in the franchise how the hell shouldn t i mention it i m not trashing fallout 4 because you like it i m ranting my own feelings over it back when i first played fallout 4 i dropped it because i felt bored bethesda went out of its way to contradict multiple things in the already established lore and in all of its laziness decided to have a dialogue system so basic it made every character a puppet in past games you had a ton of dialogue options you could explore and observe and learn about someone you had to be tested you had to be in very specific circumstances to be part of a faction but here oh you re the main character do you want to join us yes yes but later yes but sarcastic question this doesn t help the characters at all since they become so limited in the way they act and exist and they have to go along the linear story just the bit where you become a member of the brotherhood of steel in this game you actually feel yourself being forced into it are you really escaping reality experiencing a story in a fictional world or are you just going through the chores of some lazy or overworked development staff just getting it done before launch is this game truly written or is it just taped itself into a release date notice how in b o s and in the railroad you instantly enter because a third character you barely know vouches for you could it be because they took the whole immersion out the window to appeal to the general masses who liked the shooting portion better this compared to the previous two games where you could witness how truly depressing and brutal the wasteland is you could get inside a ruin and see skeletons actual human beings who long existed witnessing the end of civilization often alone or as part of a mob just trying to survive with their family in the immediate aftermath it was grim yet in fallout 4 you ll find no shortage of corpses with party hats lying dead next to mannequins or teddy bears with knives or being a decorative piece in a diner where a mother and a son actually live inside everyday because humans in this game are physically incapable of cleaning things fallout always balanced bleak environments and morbid comedy fallout 4 doesn t everything has to be a joke which is something odd that has been happening with the movie industry as well the way they reverted the brotherhood of steel from what we helped build in fallout 3 was a slap in the face talk about subverting expectations which are often made as well written as a pre teen s fan fiction such a try hard plot that made me from admiring the group in fo3 understanding its original purpose and ideals in f nv to completely wanting to erase it from the face of the planet in fo4 just because some kid killed a deathclaw at age 3 or some overpowered bs to make him a messiah and what to say about the minutemen the most interesting faction by far in the game yet only playing like a personal army and a sidequest vending machine preston s entire possible backstory character development and personality thrown into a burning pit so he can just order you around despite you being his superior just to provide an endless gameplay that is as deep and as enjoyable as washing the dishes of a family of four i ll say more nuka cola world dlc it s bethesda s realization that they f ed up so bad in this game when taking away the choices and wishes of the playerbase that they made a dlc just for you to be an evil d k and only being an evil d k while you have the entirety of the game forcing you to be good power armors this is about the only good thing i can think of they feel good like actual powered armor unlike the power armors of fo3 and fnv that only felt like common clothing with a metal 3d model texture and medieval chain mail noises when you walked for some reason but bethesda f ed up in this as well by giving a freebie to the player first thing in the campaign because they were too lazy to rewrite that thing off the beginning of the script and instead of scripting the destruction of the power armor after that introduction which would be way more rational they just decided to make a ridiculous gameplay choice called fusion cores even inserting this into the lore and contradicting even more stuff about power armors now power armors instead of walking tanks that survived 200 years of neglect because they were built to be used in the event of nuclear warfare are just cars that go out of gas every 2 hours i m convinced that most people hated having to park the power armor and get out to do things like typing in consoles and the like because this was an issue that popped up during development and they were too lazy to fix which made people hate the actual cool mechanic they came up with yay you ll have fun in this game when you re doing stuff you want like exploring the world map and using modded weapons but it ll tire you out as well after a while and when you go back to the quests and see how empty they are how shallow and smug you ll just drop it again like i did a second time i for a while thought this was a great game but only not deserving of being called fallout this latest playthrough however made me question even that if you like the shooting and the action sure you ll have fun but if you care about something well written for a single player play fallout new vegas fallout 3 is fine despite being somewhat similar in concept to fallout 4 but they wrote it better than fo4
