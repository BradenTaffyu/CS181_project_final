2017 this is the first time i have felt compelled to write a bad review of a sid meier civilization game what compels me now is that firaxis has had almost a year to fix some pretty egregious bugs in the game instead they have released patch after patch that includes paid downloadable content sure these patches also include some bug fixes and ai adjustments but there are some pretty major bugs in the ai and ux that haven t been touched and have existed since the initial release of the game i won t list them all again here there are already many reviews that list the details but it is time for firaxis to prove to their loyal customers that they care about them and take a break from their content updates and concentrate on a patch that just includes bug fixes they should also take some time to work with aspyr to resolve the cross platform issues that stop the mac and pc communities from playing the game together i fear they are doing irreparable harm to the reputation of sid meier s civilization franchise i know it is a business but stop putting out paid content updates to take time and fix the issues my guess is that we won t see a true bug fix release until there is a paid expansion pack released
