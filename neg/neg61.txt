2018 early access review fantasic game until it isn t love everything about it the world the combat and avoiding it the endless tactical looting it feels good to make wise decisions clearing buildings and findng rare resorces and weapons however the thing that killed my experience with the game is its infection mechanic the mechanic that makes the entierty of the game a really pointless experience now imagine you ve restarted enough to know that to really survive you need to spend the entire game turtling for resources you need to play so safely you never let yourself get too sick never make any stupid accidents by cutting yourself on glass or jumping out a window you spend hours training up relevant skills you build yourself a nice farm a nice base built a protected home you ve neatly organized your storage kept all your food fresh as possible your working your way to the end game now imagine after all that you re making rounds in a part of town you ve already cleared decide to pick up some stuff from an old safe house that is completely barricaded to find that the game spawned 3 zombies in a bedroom now you bitten but survived but you are bitten no way to heal yourself through it with all the organized boxes of medical supplies and food no way to stop the fever from killing you no way to immolate your corpse so you don t need to bare the shame and anger of some stupid rng system decided that the 30 hours you pumped into your best survivor should come to an end now all the food you saved up will spoil when you launch a new character in the same world the base you build and maintained will be rundown and broken by the time you get back to it or possibly on fire with zombies everything just is complete and total ruin then you spend the next 10 hours repairing everything retraining your new survivor for it all just to happen again that is my expreince with the game here is the crux of the game it will never ever reward you it will only ever punish you for mistakes on your part or when the game decides it want to fire a random gun near you or send a helecopter flying over your base everything you work hard to achive is done through your own efforts you need to go out and search and put yourself in danger that already challenging enough but mechaniclly the game will almost always be constantly harassing you its not that the game world is already hard to survive in but the was programmed to be activly trying to ruin your survival expereince for the fact that even if you put all the effort into having the most well managed home absolutly filled to the brim with resources a single mistake or a lighting bug or the game putting a zombie in a place where a zomibe literally could not be and your bitten and the entire game is over its really really stupid it really is super fun until it isn t
