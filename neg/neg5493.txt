2017 rome ii the launch was a blind date with broken gameplay and buggy traversty riddled with so many errors and balancing issue that it s infamy will never live down now somewhat below average i m sorry to say the good i ll be brief the good things about the game is the things you would expect from a total war game the campaign map is great and works the strategy overview of your empire you decide where armies go what you build in what settlements how you manage your economy diplomacy and so on some things are streamlined and dumbed down but there is enough flavor to make it a game about the antiquity it s trying to represent i like the new cultural system and the effect it has it s a nice new touch and makes more sense than once again having to garrison the castle you just took because somehow the peasants give a damn about what authoritarian japanese feudal lord squeeze them for more rice sacks or not tactical battles work as you may expect and it s still not terribly hard to either turn a losing battle around through simple skills or to make it at costly to the enemy as possible beyond this the modding scene has to be mentioned radious mod is the most known and widely used because it s one of the most complete balanced and able one out there adding considerably more units to various factions and helping to balance things out more as well as graphical improvements etc other mods enhance the graphics more if you wish improve blood effects add units to specific factions that are lacking and so on honestly messalia for instance can not train any archer type troops on their own this is a big deal there are mods that help deal with this it s weird to have to mention the mod scene as a good about the game itself but here it is mods greatly help you enjoy this game more depending on what mods you get the bad i wish i could be brief but there is so much here that s a major concern for me and the reasons obviously i can t recommend this game only buy this if you can live with or don t care much about the issues at hand here first of all the dlc whoring is obvious and widely documented just look at the list on steam and you will see what i mean luckily the only essential dlc to me is the blood pack because reasons and mods can seriously help you with this game in this area as well as so many others so you may find yourself not needing the official dlc to get what you want out of this this still don t justify or reedem the audacity it is to hide a sizable portion of the factions out there behind pay walls just as one example secondly the difficulty settings are completely bi polar and horrible easy difficulty is a massive joke everything is simple and way to easy your economy will never struggle unless you are completely incompetent your armies will hardly ever lose unless again you have personal problems your agents are easy to level up and meet with success almost all the time it s boring you win all the time there is no challenge at all normal difficulty is barely any better depending on what faction you play you may struggle a little in the beeginning period but once you have a couple provinces under your firm control you start to snowball out of control and by the time you have 5 the game is terribly boring agent actions are still easy to pull off and the economy is solid you will be rolling in money soon enough and your biggest problem is everyone around you turn into beggars asking you for hand outs everyone hard difficulty is where the suffering begins the game don t seem to understand how to increase difficulty a bit at a time and there is a massive leap between normal to easy and hard that is frustating as hell on hard difficulty any agent success chance lower than 80 is an automatic fail 4 out of 5 times above that it s basically 50 50 chance note the chances and the times you fail vs succeed you will not be pleased this turns agent actions into a gold sink that frustrates you far more than it should the economy is hard to handle and you will need to know what you are doing and how to manage your infrastructure how to make friends and keep them and this too is harder than ever with the ai sometimes blatantly refusing to trade with you even if they love you and you have been their finest and most loyal friend since forever this requires constant maintenence and you will only start getting a balanced and able economy around 4 provinces your armies had better be led by veteran and able generals and you will need to work together with muliple good stacks of troops because if you slip up the ai can and will obliterate you suddenly and without warning because the ai cheats like a when you understand how the economy works you understand exactly how your enemy has infinite money they always have the money to pay for agent actions and recruit armies and improve settlements and so on it does not matter how hard you crush them and limit their land the enemy can be down to one minor settlement with only one economy building that can t cover all the armies they have and only one military building that can t produce all the different types of troops they constantly get the ai will always have armies leave them to their devices and they will come for you with powerful and noumerous troops because the ai has infinite money their agents are always doing things so they level up quick ergo you will soon be harassed by super agents who can and will scuttle all your plans and cripple and dismantle your armies in contrast you have to pay for your agent with money you don t always have to spare and the odds of failure and thus wasting that money are very very high once you lose a few high end generals the green horn replacments are not nearly as good at resisting agent actions as the old ones leading to your armies being crippled a lot easier than before so even if you can replace your losses their effectiveness is being limited the longer the conflict goes on add to this some really absurd ideas about how sieges go cities for instance can have 3 different control points where it s a king of the hill style race to control the majority once you hold 2 the timer ticks down to victory you can lose a whole army without a single man dying because your carefully crafted kill zone only covers one flag and the enemy don t have to kill a single man to wipe out the whole army totally logical and a sound game mechanic i m sure on top of the imbalances the ai is very eager to make alliances and deals with other factions much more than what they did on easier difficulties so you can soon find yourself with a war on multiple fronts and seriously outnumbered by your new enemies even your long standing allies can become your enemies in this manner as the ai is much better at teaming up against you no matter what they have to do be on the ball with your diplomacy at all times or pay the price really soon all this said hard difficulty does provide a big challenge but it does so not by being harder in an organic way where the ai has the same limitations and rules as you but they do it by blatantly cheating and enjoying perks you will never have to some this is just a bigger challenge to others it s a massively frustrating experience that will leave you shouting curses at your monitor the short and simple is rome ii is a total war game in all ways you expect and that may be all you want however it also suffers from poor business decisions ai balancing that may frustrate you or bore you and a strategic system you may find to be intuitive and decently set up or needlessly dumbed down all things considered should you find yourself not caring or handling these factors it s a decent game and worth your time and money if not you may want to see if total war warhammer is better off
