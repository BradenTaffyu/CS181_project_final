2022 game is very pretty and runs well on my system i play a a variety of grand strategy wargames but paradox and i don t exactly agree on things i m not going to trash the product many people enjoy it i m just not one of them had far too many moments of feeling like i m just throwing my divisions against brick walls for seven years for no payout it s a great way to spend four or five hours planning your big offensive but i always found myself rage quitting after a decade of no progress i always avoided the multiplayer community because the videos i see of it from youtube make it seem extremely toxic even commenting on youtube videos asking questions is met by an overwhelming amount of toxicity don t let my review stop you from buying the game but maybe don t drop a hundred bucks on all the dlcs until you ve played a couple games and know what you re getting yourself into
