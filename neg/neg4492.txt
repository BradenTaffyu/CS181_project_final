2018 so yeah i really didn t knew if i should write a positive or negative review i decided to not recommend the game and that s why it s overpraised af the game itself maybe doesn t seem so but 30 for a dlc that adds so little to the game or the new expansion pack coming out soon 40 wtf 40 for an expansion pack who tf is responsible for the marketing 5 for a new civ and a scenario also i don t like the cartoony style i liked the one from civ v much better i see what they tried to do with that whole district thing make the cities bigger and make it feel more lived in but it doesn t really work and is rather annoying imo also the unexplored area is kinda beige colored while the area that is explored but not in the range of vision is a brighter beige with a little transparency and the overall game looks yellow orangy i don t know how many times i was sending my scouts to an already explored area cuz of that i had to download the civ v clouds mod to fix that that being said the mods feel much more stable then on civ v i had like 3 4 crashes on my 60h and that s not too bad i guess the rest of the game really just feels like civ v with brave new world and gods and kings already build in witch is not really a bad thing and after you get used to the district system it s actually quite fun the first 20h i was hating the game really much but now it feels enjoyable
