2016 early access review now let s get a couple of things straight as an alpha state game developer one of your major goals if not the major goal is to listen to your playerbase and see what they have to say you re developing a game with your community you re not polishing a finished piece the point of an alpha build is for the players to help create the game otherwise you would just launch it at beta with whatever features your little hearts desire this game was a major thing back when it came out in my opinion peaking at greatness in alpha 11 what happened from there you may ask fundamentally progressive development ceased and became redundant we re working with developers that are so far up their own asses pardon the expression that they don t really care what the players want or how they feel any sort of criticism be it positive or not is treated with censorship back in their forums i ve witnessed countless times whole threads being completely obliterated by overzealous mods who don t like it when they re told their favourite game is going the wrong way and yes this game is going the wrong way i remember getting my closest friends to buy the game back in a9 we pulled freaking all nighters playing that game it was so immersive and an overall amazing experience everyone had their roles during the day and rendezvous at night to defend the fort we really couldnt get enough of it whole days we d spend looking for the perfect safe haven from a11 forward it just became a redundant game at its core update after update with almost 6 months apart from each other which is pretty bad considering its an alpha and frequent updates are essential the game just got more and more simplified and less immersive as of a13 you can build solid concrete blocks out of decaying wood take that for immersion no more specific meats everything is just meat which means alot of recipes and farming went down the gutter so that shaved off alot more hours spent hunting for deer or any other specific animals and overall we waited 6 months for basically like i said previously a simplification of the game s core engine that was perfectly solid and a visual rework on zombies that completely shattered the overall game stability thats right a full hd remake that took 6 months to develop on an alpha build thats like dressing in your finest suit to go out later before you ve taken that shower you ve been putting off for a week not to mention that they pushed it out so badly optimized that it forced them to work on about 5 patches in 3 weeks in order to fix framerate issues server lags and other gamebreaking bugs no other relevant updates the game lacks content and removing it to reach an end game state quicker only affects it further everyone i played with got bored of the game and for good reasons i got bored myself and unfortunately i can no longer support developers that are working apart from their community it pains me to let the game go like this but i cant support something that s no longer what i payed for originally
