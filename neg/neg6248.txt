what was once a breath of fresh air in the mobile gaming world has fallen to greed like so many others early on in the game s history opportunities to get the resources needed to upgrade and acquire new cards were plentiful and the pacing of new content felt just about right if you played daily you could reasonably experience most of what the game offered as a f2p player or occasional spender as time has gone on however the developers at second dinner have ruthlessly monetized nearly every facet of the game new cards were moved away from a simple resource based purchasing system to a gacha style system where one player might spend a single rare key for a new card while another less lucky one must spend 4 the value of earnable in game premium currencies has also plummeted and the vast majority of new offerings are sold for cash only sometimes in bundles that cost upwards of 100 usd new cards are released weekly and their balancing suffers accordingly not only is it mathematically impossible to keep up without spending real money but cards are often released in an overtuned or downright broken state during their initial sale period and then scaled back afterwards even 100 cosmetic bundles have had their contents removed from player accounts and replaced at the developer s whim while the gameplay itself is genuinely fun i would not recommend this to any new players due to its relentless and pervasive pay to win game mechanics which seem to get worse with every update edit true to form the newest update brought even more p2w garbage deadpool s diner is an embarrassment designed to milk money from whales and gambling addicts shameful
