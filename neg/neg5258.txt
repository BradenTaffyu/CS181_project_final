2016 like many other reviewers i have played the total war series since shogun and find this game to be a huge disappointment fundamentally all the depth has gone from this game and the warhammer varnish wears thin pretty quickly there is little strategy either in the campaign map or battles the ai is not very good although a slight improvement on rome 2 and there is actually a relatively small amount of content in this game at least compared to previous titles it would seem all the money in this game went on the ip and art models maps animations etc with very little gone into basic mechanics or thought as to how the game should play pros models look good warhammer orkz game actually works on launch for a changecons lack of gameplay or stategic diversity simplfied campaign only 5 playable factions short replayability factor no semblance of balance between the factionsthis game is still worth playing but i would recommend waiting till you can pick it up for half price or at least till the modders make the game remotely interesting update 01 05 17with new content being added i have come back to warhammer recently and things have improved the free content is good and the dlc whilst overpriced is relatively good modding makes the game so much easier to play just removing forced march is a god send i still think that there are some fundametal issues that need fixing in total war games of late but the game is at least enjoyable now the game feels more complete than on launch with lots more variety and replayability this is just the modern trend in video games release a half finished game and either patch later or in some cases never or charge for the remaining content i would definitely recommended picking the base game up for 10 15 on sale and hopefully the rest of the dlc will be sale in the summer
