i spent most of my time in the game trying to work around the bugs but i give up in a city of 400 000 citizens only 1 or 2 use the international airport subways have thousands of citizens but only a few actually board the trains only 30 passengers use trains and half of the cargo trains transport 0 of the cargo load from nearby cities tourism is completely broken no visible tourists zero hotels and so on it s fun to start the game but once you reach a population of around 100 000 the bugs drain the joy from what could have been an amazing game
