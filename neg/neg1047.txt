2015 fallout 4 is such a haggard piece of i cant believe i wasted 10 hours collecting screws and pieces of wood better off playing miniheroes or some iphone where you pay 99 cents for 1000 rubies the dialogue sucks and was written by a f 99t it s not funny there are maybe three sarcastic options that are almost funny enough to have been from fallout 1 or 2 the rest of the dialogue is so sappy some dude crying about how he has to find his son it s unbelievable that anybody would find that emotionally compelling the voice acting is just plain bad the first time i met cowboy tom from the minutemen i almost shut my computer off also pickatinny tom the scientist from the railroad is worse than jar jar binks they were high on stevia when they thought of the girl with the irish accent and also the newsie girl and while we re on that topic why am i looking at women in video games slender figures firm breasts but they re just as effective and smart as a man with testosterone sorry that s just not the way it is i liked femshep mainly because jennifer hale s voiceacting was savage lara croft was ok maybe back in 1995 other than that please get these women out of my face i don t want to be told that a woman can hold a laser rifle maybe she could hold a baby and bounce it up and down two at once over a hot stove because theyre good at multitasking but other than that get this out of my face bethesdas voice director needs to get a job bagging groceries the perfect and clean annunciation coming out of the mouth of an illiterate irradiated raider or scavenger makes so little sense it is physically jarring and will make you sit straight up in your seat if youre actually paying attention whichever black guy they got to do the black guy voice acting was so bad whenever cowboy tom or scientist skeeter opened their mouths i shut the game off and took a nap the weapon customization is fun for about five minutes until you realize youre playing farm simulator to get a marksmen s stock for your hardened pipe pistol they could ve done so many other cool things but intead chose this half assed mad max i like that i have to put ten skill points into luck and ammo scavenging to have enough bullets to kill anything also bartering is totally useless i guess if i put ten points into charisma presummably i d be able to afford something the overall aesthetic is garbage with fallout 1 and 2 they had the perfect plans to copy and they did a decent enough job with 3 and nv but with 4 it s just the most basic steampunk style the junk jet captures this failure perfectly the whole game is a junk jet the institute is kinda cool but the institute was an opportunity to create something really wild and interesting and look what they did with it straight 1960s andromeda strain facility only not sinister at all and i don t think there s a less interesting way to deal with ai plotwise the endings are just boring garbage tying up loose ends that the bad voice acting and tired plot couldnt make me care about reminds me of writing papers in high school two hours before they re due help the railroad help the minutemen help the brotherhood or help the institute which all basically boil down to whether or not you kill shaun shaun shaun i ve got to find my son damnit you can tell the male voice actor was getting ready to take his lunch break when he read those lines a massively open game that s sixty hours long and it all comes down to one ending which would be fine if the ending were interesting and not war never changes
