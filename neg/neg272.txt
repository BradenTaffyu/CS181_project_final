2023 i hate to give bad publicity but having 2 000 hours in pd2 and 200 hours in pd th which i still play i can t do otherwise generally i feel it more like a dowgrade from payday 2 and as an upgrade to payday the heist in general it feels more rushed and unfinished with every flaw i find every single map i play upon release i gave 90euros and i couldn t play upon release for over a week that s was a major issue for me and therefore i am not editing it out i had a few days off and i was waiting for the release with excitement only to receieve frustration they fixed the game but now i am working and can t spend much time on it the good few new game mechanics that are better than the older games civilians no longer run in the middle of gunfights unlimited tie wraps following civs are running at last no instant detects or back detects i like the new guard behaviour running while carrying stuff npcs gained hearing ability crouch running interacting carrying bags while in casing mode is awsome slide ability some of the new skills are cool to be honest many of these features are mods in pd2 so iy wasn t as much as a surprise to me as i had experienced them before in the series that s it for the good things the bad visualmany like the new graphics but that s expected people payday 2 was over 10 years ago still a few things are wrong with these new graphics game engine few nice funny graphical components are missing like the ability to destroy plant pots i also found many glass panels to be indestructable unoptimised game rtx4070 and i can t get 144 fps on first map even on lowest settings teamate carrying a body looks hilarious droped bodies clip through walls like in early 2000s joy s mask is a downgrade no messages like in pd2no singleplayer online only forces you to go into matchmaking even though you are alone in a lobby server connections still suffer from glitches after heists i get disconnected from friends lobby server disconections even playing sologameplay no ability of pausing the heist of course solo ing heists on higher difficulties is almost imposible even if you manage to reach the vault you can t get all the loot intact by yourself mostly speaking about dye pack timers which require at least 2 players to get all the cash intact for example difficulty in loud is broken unbalanced tried normal difficulty shot 3 bullets in the head to kill an enemy hard 3 headshots with the same weapon very hard guess what 3 shots again the enemy litterally has the same health pool in all those 3 difficulties also even on normal ai has aimbot a single enemy emptied his clip on me in a single second slicing a whole section of my armour just a single unit friendly ai still sucks for the 4th time in this franchise kinda expected tbh i also count raid ww2 civilians rescued by law enforcment are not re captured even if you shout or shoot at them killstreak rip off mechanic from call of duty try to point a guard or camera places a marker rng does not reset upon restart so every run has the same steps until you complete map or exit to main menu no dumbsters to hide bodies i miss that guards still see bodies in the water no bot commands menus ui menus are not user friendly in general no option to move weapons in different slot quit game button is hidden in a menu tab esc key doesn t work either what s more simple than that these days really menu pages no do not change with mouse roller like in that other game what was it called oh yeah payday 2 there are primary and secondary weapons in the game but there is no distinction between them in store pistols are secondary duh but wahat about smgs are they primary pd th or secondary pd2 still haven t got one they are primary weapon slot prices increase with every purchase making them cost more than weapons themselves weapon customization from call of duty again and i hate it broken currency weapon cost 75 000 a single modification for this weapon 100 000 oh and if you have 2 of these guns you need to re buy the mods for the 2nd very few weapon selection and weapon slots even on pd2 they recently added 10 pages of 16 slots total 320 weapon slots for more than 250 weapons there are only 1 single sniper rifle 2 shotguns buldozers gun is not available no machine guns no akimbos and many more and since we are not dumb we know they are gonna add them as microtransactions later as that is their intention even before launch they added infamy points for just completing the heists now so just playing the game actually means something now still grindy to level up weapons and unlock mods buying c stacks multiple times doesn t reload the vendor screen and prices are incorrect you see that you spend 90 000 but in reality it could be millions if you don t exit the screen and return in order to refresh the prices challenges do not count and some are not explained correctly challenges do count but the menu is not updating you need to restart the game to see progress progression systems is rubbish everything is locked behind stupid grinding bugged challenges with no describtion on how to unlock them no explaination in how most things work like skill points no search function in dozens of pages with mixed challenges strike challenges are now removed since they were bugged to infinity misc no lobbies screen so we can choose if we like stealth or loud only games no way to kick abusive player from lobby vote to restart the map instead of host having complete control over it will make host leave the game if the heist is not going like they wanted unlike yeah pd2 again 3 people playing 2 vote to restart the 3rd votes no or doesn t vote at all lobby doesn t restart no preplanning no choice where to place assets rewards in pd3 from nebula account event are still missing they finally fixed them new underleveled and underequiped players can jump into higher difficulties ruining the session no creativity in objectives get inside hack phones stand in spots enter codes open vault carry bags leave also maps feel the same as previous titles we have bank heist 2 0 green bridge v 2 jewlery store remake nightclub redux presented by vlad of course big bank remastered ukranian prisoner 2023 edition framing frame day 3 standalone mountain master revision bugs glitches in road rage truck drives on the air above potholes without the palyer placing the support equipment may be fixed now reviving ai is bugged even solo haven t seen that in a while stuck ais may revive you from the other side of the map exploits and bugs everywhere they fix 1 bug another 2 bugs appear i will edit it multiple times but positive review will only come if online only feature will be removed entirely as always this is my personal opinion sorry for long post thanks for reading this developers and players alike
