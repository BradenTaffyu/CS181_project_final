2016 even if the genre isn t exactly the same i like comparing this game to civ 5 the idea is that you should strive for the stars either diplomatically or martially so that you more or less become the ruler of the galaxy therefore you do the 4x es xplore xpand xploit xterminate you build buildings on your planets you can terraform them you can build stations around planets that gather resources or give research points you can trade or you can go to war either as the lone wolf or in an alliance sounds great doesn t it it does but the problem is the 5th x the xecution trading is even worse than in civ 5 where you had trade routes and instant trade here you don t have trade routes at all if you remember the piss poor trade menu in civ 5 with the tiny lines you had to click on and thought it was the worst system possible think again here you have a similar list structure that is bigger but you have to switch tabs between offerings and demands also the ai sometimes doesn t even accept presents depite being friendly however the ai does only do something when it is sure it will be accepted so the ai builds alliances at staggering speeds while you have to check every in game month whether any of the ai would accept an alliance invite diplomacy feel free to estabish vastly overpowered embassies ameliorating the standing with the other faction until you run of of them as you can maximally have 4 embassies also remember setting your scout to explore mode in civ 5 and never ever having to manage them again until they either get to the coast or the whole map was explored well be excited by this immersive gameplay decision stellaris has made get ready to manage every very single system survey by hand automatic exploration nope same goes for contruction ships the workers in civ 5 automation naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah it s even more tedious as your faction s borders expand with time and planets that you couldn t previously mine become available so if you have a chile style empire long and narrow get ready to check all few years whether you can exploit more systems reaseach is similar get ready to select research targets from 3 different sections society science and engineering which is fun until you run out of scientists and you get a 20 malus on the research speed the scientists themselves are leaders guys you need to buy for influence because civ 5 had a similar thing by being able to buy prophets and stuff for faith points but they were more or less optional in stellaris you don t get anywhere without research so far we ve established that the diplomacy lacks practically everything needed to be able to be a valuable way to go alright not what i would have hoped for in a strategy game like this but then again war can be entertaining as well right aaaand nope it all boils down to the simple rule steamroll everything or get steamrolled remember in civ 5 when you were furios about the tremendous defense strength a city had making it nearly impossible to conquer a city until you had catapults well this time your planets are about the weakest things in the game sure they can t be conquered in the first few minutes but as your empire grows it becomes impossible to defend every single planet big fleets are far better even for defense which is weird at best alliances do a job of defending you btw and the thankfully disablable empires starting with an advantage either love you or hate you from the first contact and then will steamroll you to death or leave you be seriously you don t even have to give them a reason to attack you they just do similar to civ 5 the only problem then is the ai does only do things when they are sure they can pull it off so if they declare war and you re in ironman mode exit the game and start a new one or give them half your empire just so they can attack you again after the peace period runs out it basically always is gg about the shipdesigning well you design ships is cool but as your fleets will be a blob anyways and you can t see what s going on in fights you basically just change some stat values i personally didn t find the ui too confusing but i can understand why some do too many tabs too many hidden options and too much scrolling to do without clear indicators that you can scroll in the end i d consider it as a realtime civ 5 in space without the hidious round times as it is an rts but with every single contra civ 5 had really it seems to me that paradox had a checklist of all the bad things about civ 5 to tick and none of the pros of balance trading and automations i d say pick it up when it s cheaper than 20 bucks maybe even as a package with the promised dlcs that should have been in the basegame so you get the game it should have been don t buy this barebone for 40 bucks tl dr buy it if you loved all things that were flawed in civ 5 don t buy it if you didn t love civ 5 liking doesn t seem sufficient to me edit so some patches after the game hasn t really gotten better there are still gamebreaking bugs like inability to leave federations and the lategame is basically a stall to any gameplay and yields to doing nothing you can now research auto exploration no not a default a research c mon man it s 2016 this game loves micromanaging to much it s literally not fun to play at all if you expect a game and not an excel simulator
