2021 early access review while bannerlord may at some point be a good game i really question the business practice of selling a game for full price while remaining in a beta state for an indeterminate amount of time it s been well over a year and the game still requires a lot of work early access should be used to fix small bugs and smooth out game play not finish half the game i feel like i ve been taken advantage of edit more than two years since early access and still no full release we have been told q2 2022 for the complete game q3 starts in ten days never ever buy early access edit 2 well it s the end of 2023 and i just don t play the game the last time was earlier in the year and i spent most of the time trying to improve it with mods i think if they ever make a good game out of it i ll just not care anymore
