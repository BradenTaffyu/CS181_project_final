2020 product received for free 30 hours in steam version around 100 in bethesda netas much as steam would leave you to believe this game doesn t warrant a mostly positive review the only reason it has this is because of the review bombing that the game deserved on launch that were subsequently deleted for being low effort and a lot of autistic screeching from the reddit community probably helped the game is a broken buggy mess after 2 years since release wastelanders has helped a little for the game but it s still honestly not worth picking up again if you own it and certainly not the price tag it s listed for on steam for starters there are a myriad of graphical errors in certain areas and a few newer quests have broken to the point where i had to restart from the beginning and even then it s a 50 50 split on whether it breaks the exact same way again the game is plagued with fps issues and server side problems to the point where it bugs out over every little interaction areas where very little is happening will see dips of up to 40 fps and this is coming from a modern pc with high specs not some low end laptop constant crashing is still a thing even now the only reason i m writing a review for the game is because i crashed mid fight with a scorchbeast queen a high level enemy that requires about an hour setup before you fight it i launched the damn nuke to set the thing up ai will break constantly this is a big one every fight takes a little while if your gear is underleveled and as a new player you ll be fighting enemies that will literally stand still or as a high level player an assaultron beam will melt you from the back of its head the only way to avoid it is to hide behind something but in an open area you re out of luck giant hermit crabs are also broken and it s pretty much a 5 minute shootout to get free weapons and supplies from a broken enemy the game isn t fun a constant grindfest with sub par quests a lot of fast travelling more loading screens than any other game i ve played and on top of this bethesda have actively lowered durability to entice you into using the atom shop for repair kits really convenient during a repair kit sale at the moment if you really want to try it the tutorial shouldn t take more than 2 hours and you ll be able to get your money back from a refund but i would steer clear altogether it isn t worth the risk nor the money if you re really desperate you could look into other avenues to purchase the game for a better price but it may be on the bethesda launcher since that s where i originally got my copy for cheap and eventually free on steam bethesda its reddit community it isn t worth the money edit just went back into the game if you re epileptic there s a bug which causes your game to flash like crazy if you have another monitor and it still displays contact your nearest funeral director if you plan on buying this
