2016 do you want to update your review after 300 more hours played well why not the game has only gotten worse massive dlc scam like all the other pdx games after 5 or 6 years or something they finally added a supply logic into the game which only works in europe but who the cares because it s completely ok that japan will never again be able to fight the chinese since there s 0 supplies in the whole continent and every unit will have 0 org after existing for over a week good stuff made me switch back to hoi3 and oh man that game is good it s incredible how many features they have dropped and replaced with the babbys first strategeeh game stuff that the average users enjoy like tank designer over fixing teleporting planes and ships original review well i have now drinked beer for 8 hours all together that s about the most exiting and compelling feature of this game as a hoi3 veteran not a world conqueror pro though this game feels like the game itself is missing the player handles research which is boring and simplified from hoi3 and production but the actual fighting is done by the absolutely garbage paradox style ai you draw a line on the map see random numbers which indicate how much penalties or sometimes bonuses you get for your battle plan and then you press a button and get your a kicked your units come and go and do some fighting now and then if you ask them but in the end they re suicidal idiots at best at worst it s the reason to quit playing and write a bitter review the best thing about the battle planning phase is that once the battle starts the ai messes up the plan and you get 100 effectiveness penalty this has applied to every test play and every battle i ve had with 6 different nations i ve tested which do not include germany or soviets the only word to describe the ui is awful if i want to assign my planes to do something or even see them doing whatever i have to click the continent i m sending them in not the planes or the airfield makes a whole lot of sense eh everything seems to be really really messy but still you don t have any useful information or tools anywhere finding the right window to do things is a pain and clicking anywhere pops up another window so you re constantly closing unnecessary windows that you never wanted to open in the first place all in all i haven t been able to really enjoy the game yet i believe that the stockholm syndrome will hit eventually around 50 hours like it did with eu4 and i ll be able to tolerate it but every time i quit playing i m glad i did so the good things being able to change your government going for communist or fascist usa for example is the thing that i always wanted to have in hoi3 and i really love the sandbox aspect of the game you can create new factions which is great especially for multiplayer and some parts of this game are well tought and funny the sad thing is it doesn t really matter are you democratic communist or fascist usa if the actual warfare is as pleasant as eating glass
