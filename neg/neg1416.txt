2022 so many well descriptive reviews about this game both positive and negative i would love to give this game a thumbs up but when you spend enough time in game you really start to see the faults the battles are amazing that thing they have done right and again people have described that in details in other posts what turns me off is mid to late game when you either have settlements or start your own kingdom empire the diplomacy system ai are incredibly flawed especially when you have to count in your own lords an example is my latest game where i have killed off two entire kingdoms they have no settlements left and just peasent armies when one kingdom declare war on you most others follow which results in your lords wanting to settle peace a kingdom with no settlements can claim thousands of denars to give you peace even though they pose no threat your lords being afraid of too many enemies forces you to settle a peace with them emptying your coffers basically for nothing of course you can vote no but the influence cost is so great even with policies making it much cheaper that you just cant oppose giving insignificant enemies all your daily gold income i hope to come back to this game when if they manage to fix it
