2022 tldr pros 1 incredible modding community2 interesting side quests here and there yes way better than the main quest 3 pretty good atmosphere i d say some of em are mind blowing4 pretty competitive dlc questscons note these are all patched by the incredible modding community cons listed below are about the base game itself 1 basically everything else i guess below average main quest crappy dialog options crappy npc interactions bs weapon balance basically everything 2 repetitive to the core jesus christ now i know why preston garvey was such a meme back when this was released my opinion this game well defines the phrase all quantity no quality if this is the standard for a good game these days no wonder the gaming industry is going down hill very positive really is average the new good in this generation i basically have to push myself too hard to play this crap and get this over with and get it uninstalled from my pc forever 81 hours in and i still haven t had any real satisfied game play except for some here and there the only thing that is saving this game is the modding community i bet all the positive reviews are only there because of the modding community jesus christ the amount of effort they have put into this game is absolutely insane they are the only reason i kept coming back to this game else i would have uninstalled this long time ago no one in their sane head would rate a positive for this crap base game and if they did then well people are really stupid i had a really hard time whether to give this game a positive or not i would be doing great injustice to the modding community if i did that 100 s of modders have to get together and make this game at least playable bethesda couldn t bother to fix the issues with the game themselves and they get all the credit all the time and effort they re not even getting payed for this not even recognized my first ever fallout game and such a great disappointment still haven t lost a lot of hope on this franchise yet my friends tell me that previous titles are really good worth giving a shot i guess without mods i d rate this game a 2 10 with mods it would be 5 10 okayish i d say my heart goes out to the modding community but i have to leave a negative review for this game bethesda is charging premium prices for a below average poor game play this is what corporate behavior looks like guys draining you wallet dry for virtually nothing modern gaming
