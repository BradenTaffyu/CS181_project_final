i m so disappointed i ve loved cities skylines and was really looking forward to cities skylines ii i did a pre release purchase as soon as i could i was looking forward to building bigger and more diverse cities but the game just can t run when you reach a certain population size no it s not your computer slowing the game it s the game the road tool is much improved like many have said and the graphics are pretty but paradox recommendation to the above issue is to reduce the graphics so you are left with a nice road tool and my partner has been playing around with making interesting roundabouts i ve let paradox have five months before this review and i don t really feel like any progress has been made i regret my purchase and recommend cities skylines the first you can get it at a great price now and it actually runs
