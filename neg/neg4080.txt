2018 there have been changes to the eula that read very poorly and make this a potential tool for gathering personal data is this actually happening i don t know but the wording is such that it would be entirely within their rights and legal take2 would then sell my data to companies who are going to call me at 5pm during dinner to sell me crap i dont need want or appreciate hell it won t even be a good deal i played long enough while this was owned by the original developer so now i will simply uninstall it don t buy the dlc either that s just a symptom of the sickness the eula is caused by companies being greedy
