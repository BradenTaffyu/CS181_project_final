2020 i spent 300 hrs on the game so i definitely do like something about it what puts me in not recommended bucket is one frustrating thing permadeath this bit me multiple times i m 20 hrs into a play building a base crafting planning then suddenly a new boss mechanics volcano shows up and wipes me off the map destroying all the work i put into it back at square one now raising this issue makes some folks annoyed some folks say death is part of the game this enrages me as i love survival games but can t mention any other crafting game where in basic playthrough you can loose tens of hours of gameplay don t starve is kinda like playing minecraft but on on hardcore only and with addition of dark souls like bosses others say i need to git gud and they have no trouble with dying at all these folks make me laugh as they seem to know it all and yet forget that discovering and experimenting with a crafting game should be part of the fun with permadeath i worry to take any big risk in the game and aside from memorizing wiki get no chance to really tune my skills tl dr please allow for permadeath to be optional pretty please
