2020 there should be a competing title in this genre so that ea won t keep cashing in on this community which has been more and more lenient and tried its best to put up with whatever bs dlc the devs have put together it s a shame that this franchise has fallen so far pros bunch of really nice quality of life features compared to the previous titlescon the game feels soulless and cutting corners at every possible opportunity to do so dlc price tag unjustified unlike the previous titles terrible and baffling game design decisions everywhere they re some of the most cored features too action queue is extremely buggy years after the game s release the amount of time for a sim to perform action idling is nonsensical removed sandbox design and put in the older scene lot system is such a backwards compromise that s almost certainly done for technical engine limits reason such a shame to see so much game design potential being thrown into the trash because they chose the easy way out as expected the decision here came back to bite them when they design some of the dlc content which feels really disrupted by the constant fast travelling
