2016 edit i m doing this review to help this game better i m aware ho3 is a little bit complicated in some cases so don t be offensive after a couple of games my updated review below first of all i want to say that i m not a perfectionist man regarding strategy games and this is my honest review i have been waiting this game for more than 2 years and a fan of all paradox titles but lately something happened to great paradox company stellaris and hoi4 has some problems especially hoi4 is a serious disappointment for me at this stage why please follow details below 1 game has a lineer logic and flow i have tried to play with turkey historically neutral country and romania historically axis side i aligned changed my goverment to communist to soviet side and some ai decisions were so stupid soviets don t call me to join faction i have applied and later soviet attacked allies and didn t call me i m a part of the commintern why update in my another game i go with turkey and communismi soviet union called me to join their faction strange update game s diplomatic logic fails in some cases there must be a balance between history ai and reality if i change a country to communism via espionage for example yu goslavia with its socialist leader tito should tend to align and join to commintern not allies same as romania tried to align alies some ai decisions were interesting i think diplomatic ai of that game is broken or has some issues in some situations maybe if you play with major countries germans or soviet you can t see that issues if you play with minor countries you will probably face with such illogical things 2 ai diplomatic decisions sometimes illogical for example i have changed france s goverment by supporting communist party to a france commune but france commune joined war with allies faction not joined to commintenrn interesting wtf in additon i m a small country how can i do that there must be a logic limit for that diplomatic actions update germany is failed but started a lot of illogical wars all over the europe and collapsed national spain get the africa but didn t defend its motherland and failed 3 if you play with a small country you can easily change 4 5 countries political system by time this is not realistic update with the points by gaining from national focus tree easily changing a goverment political system in some cases so easy i have already checked that game diplomacy ai does not use this method to create natural allies or not trying to blockade my espionage so i can change romania n political system and germany does not take any diplomatic action for that 4 trade system is not good and problematic you don t exchange oil with civilian factory power exchanging my goods without my approval is not realistic please check old hoi3 and work more update i don t like trade system 5 interface is good as visually but some functions or management of your troops like planes re deployment finding your trops etc not on the map and productions are problematic game interface ux is bad for some screens check eui4 and work more please 6 this is a political diplomacy and grand war game army organization is so easy in hoi4 because there is no army organization 7 if you research a new technology sometimes you need to upgrade your tanks guns etc but learning the upgrading process is a real pain not gamer friendly 8 there no ledger or any detailed statistic regarding on going wars except small world tension war tab 9 lack of espionage and diplomacywhat is good 1 visuals 2 organized and polished research tree 3 great national focus mechanic but it needs to be re worked i think 4 i couldn t see logical issues on war ai but some report that 5 battle plan is innovative but it may be a little bit easier to use 6 auto synchronizati n fix when playinng multiplayer if you had an issue regarding internet network etc 7 good combination of political and terrain map 8 funcionality of closing day night cycle 9 world tension mechanic 10 great musics and atmosphere 11 new turn based war result deplomacy screen 12 new production cyclesome part of the game is studied really well and great but some is sloppy i think paradox will check the issues and make this game better for strategy lovers and fans
