2017 a classic game with great graphics and gameplay after many patches and whatever mods you want online campaigns are epic and the diversity of civs and units is fantastic i have to say though i cannot recommend paying full price for this game in 2017 just because the devs released a new dlc that is an additional charge that is a very tacky move from a once great company i have seen this game for as cheap as 5 on steam something ridiculously low like that but now that dlc is out after what 5 years it is time to jack the price up again lol that is just disrespect to the consumers lower the price or put the game on sale and i fully recommend
