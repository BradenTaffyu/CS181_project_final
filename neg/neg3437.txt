one stupid ultimate edition owner here yes paradox you are sorry we can agree on that 3 creator packs and 3 radio stations might be worth 39 99 to you but they are worthless to me i watch twitch while i game i keep music turned off for all games not just cs2 so more radio stations that i m never going to listen to has no value to me and you re saying that s worth 20 bucks right not to me and i don t pay money for content creator packs whatever those are i pay money so developers can create content for me not the other way around so yeah thanks but no thanks for your apology you delivered utter crap dlc you kept my money and in return i get a sorry not sorry yet another blatant vaporware pitch priced at 39 99 and a slap in the face so you can feel good about yourself have i got that right i was going to let your crappy release get by without a review until you had a chance to fix it but your sorry not sorry email to me today has prompted me to do otherwise so yeah now i ll apologize to you for changing course here s your big fat negative i value this review at 39 99 and so should you are we good now
