2018 i like this game very much but i have to say its new eula is like the first is the privacy act today there are companies in the adoption of gdpr blatantly claimed to be users of personal privacy information uploaded to other countries without privacy protection agencies and individuals it also claims to contain phone numbers photos zip codes addresses and other information that seriously concerns personal privacy and the treatment of mod writers is disgusting eula stipulates that all mod authors do not have the right of authorship and distribution in other words any author without t2 permission without the release of mod and annotated sources are illegal modis one of the most important vitality of a game the game is more important to ksp so the treatment of mod author t2 dead mother mod the importance to me is more important than the components of the game itself without mod i can t think of any reason to play the gameso new player is had considered please buy this game again the game experience of pilfer edition is pretty good also
