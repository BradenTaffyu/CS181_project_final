2020 the game is fun to play i actually really enjoyed it i sunk 76 hours into my first play through and during the last part of the game you need to port into a place called the institute i tried many different fixes and the game just crashes with no warning during fast travel of course that is the only way to get to the area needed its a huge disappointment to cap off a fun game with an unfinishable story you would think bethesda would have figured this crap out by now since a quick google search would reveal its a huge problem this was a big waste of 76 hours maybe its a conspiracy since i crash at 76 hours and bethesda has a game called fallout 76 which was also a huge disappoint and waste of time
