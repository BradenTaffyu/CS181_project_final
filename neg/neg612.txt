2020 battle starts out of the blue then game autosaves with most recent save being several hours ago locking me into combat forever then enemy spawns like 6 other enemies from nowhere and shreds my crew before i can even act aside from the technical issues of having the game save over progress and lock you into a battle the main problem i have with this game is that the combat is just too much cheating dark souls has showed us that you can make a difficult game that does not cheat i don t mind difficult combat i mind the cheating if there s 5 enemies that suddenly appear then make it possible for me to see them lurking around the corner waiting in massive combats there s just so much explosion and chaos and noise that it s impossible to even see what s going on crocodiles can teleport dogs can shoot you from range with exploding fireballs it s just dumb
