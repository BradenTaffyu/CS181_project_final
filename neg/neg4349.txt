2023 i absolutely loved civ 5 and it is one of my favorite games of all time so i immediately purchased this game back in 2016 with very high hopes it would blow me away and be the next game i sunk 1000 hours into playing unfortunately i couldn t quite even get to the 100 hour mark with this game in the 6 years i ve owned it and found myself going back to civ 5 even to this day the game improves a lot in the features from civ 5 allowing more ways run your civilization with the unit improvements such as allowing attachment of civilian unites to military ones to protect them as well as allowing districts so that a city that was started surrounded by land could still access the ocean if it was at least a few tiles away but even with all of these improvements i couldn t get over a lot of the aesthetic choices they went with this game the cartoony and exaggerated expressions from the civ leaders and units didn t really click with me and kind of made the experience feel more cheap as compared to the more realistic and compelling aesthetic that civ 5 had i also did not like the change of workers expiring after improving a certain amount of tiles whereas 5 kept your workers to continually improve the agenda system also does dampen the experience a little for me as well as i often found leaders despising me just because i wouldn t fit what they prefer such as lacking in culture i m sure others would find this setting interesting as it adds another dynamic in relations but i found it very annoying as it didn t make a lot of sense to ruin relations just because my empire wasn t progressing in a way that the ai thought suitable it may be a fit unfair with how much i do compare this game to civ 5 but it is hard not to given this was the next step taken in the series given how i hold civ 5 in such high regard and how much of a let down this game was in comparison i honestly cannot recommend it to others if you did not like civ 5 this game might be a good change of pace to get into but if you are similar to me and love civ 5 i would recommend awaiting to see if civ 7 will be the next step that takes the series to a higher level as civ 6 failed to do so in my opinion
