2021 voting no because there is no maybe option the amazing cruelty simulatorrimworld is a 2d strategy simulator focusing on your ability to manage a semi living world centered around your colony ies which is inhabited by your workers called pawns the overall game is guided by difficulty settings and ai directors who determine what kind of challenges will spring up with these two elements you must navigate a number of specific problems that can each spiral into other more dangerous problems so it is rimworld becomes a balancing act of reactionary work and foresight into preparing for disasters coupled with an extensive modding community no two colonies will play exactly the same though they will eventually have very common themes on its surface rimworld is the sort of game that can be very addictive to me i enjoy simulation games where i can tinker with something as its alive having to balance all sorts of things to keep the show running this arguably originated from or was popularized by dwarf fortress the proverbial progenitor to this particular style of simulation game rimworld has studied much in this regard while also innovating in its own ways the game is ultimately brought low by a fairly critical flaw however it lacks a cohesive vision from start to end and principally lives in the beginning and middle with the end a wildcard this too is a common problem in simulation games as the ending portion of them is often a weak point for rimworld this has more dire consequences in many of its subsystems that make the game work for example the game s disasters range from fairly routine to ever escalating threats you may have a disease outbreak but this is solved by stockpiled medicine fail to stockpile and you get wiped out you may get attacked by raiders but their raids may be weak or apocalyptic depending on the director one is routine one is ever escalating it is impossible to solve the ever escalating threats and they will seemingly keep scaling until they are capable of wiping you out all this without remarking on different disasters happening simultaneously this has a warping effect on overall game play ultimately the game exists to see how you survive in spite of it actively trying to destroy you endlessly however it lacks the cohesion of say a tower defense model where that is the core running theme it is more a byproduct of how it chooses to simulate because violence is the only answer it accepts it is never possible to solve for a peaceful solution except in the barebones one or two ways i ever actually encountered in diplomacy that becomes the true theme of rimworld especially in its embrace of barbarism such as organ harvesting skinning humans for leather cannibalism and so on slaughter or be slaughtered exploit people to their fullest do whatever you want just don t pay attention to the lack of peaceful options the most the game offers is a barebones diplomacy model with other human factions but some of them are always hostile even if you make peace with who you can and eradicate the others it will keep spawning human raiding threats because there needs to be some as one plays rimworld there is a lopsided emphasis on benefiting dystopian principles over utopian sure you can always not skin humans or harvest their organs with vivisection but you are actively denying the benefits while only feeling marginally better as a player the game s punishments of these evil acts is a slap on the wrist and pursuing a good route is rarely more beneficial your pawns get upset for a few days then stop caring about a freezer full of human livestock you have it is this sort of half finished design that becomes exceedingly self evident throughout the game it starts with an idea lets it run in the wild but does not carry through to a fulfilling conclusion hence it is strongest in its early and mid game but its end game is more governed by when you are done than any actual objective the game wants you to reach for some this is fine enough i will admit i do notice how the gameplay is affected by the lack of guidance a fully closed loop can bring though conclusionwith a simplistic clean art style and thematic soundtrack rimworld is a fairly comfortable simulation game to step into it optimizes more for ease of player usage than greater complexity while maintaining options for more sophisticated designs in some areas an extremely active modding community allows for massive changes to the base game often within the limitations of what the game itself wants rimworld emphasizes survival and all your stories are set against that survival and it doesn t care for anything else this can make for a few interesting playthroughs but it is hard to shake the feeling of the game being actively hostile if you try something else easier or peaceful difficulties for example marginalize combat to the point it becomes very clear the game doesn t know what it wants to do without it the tea spoon deep social and diplomacy systems reflect how much the game focuses on its combat model over everything else in the end it is less simulating a human ecosystem than it is a pawn meat grinder who have names and random stats assigned to them
