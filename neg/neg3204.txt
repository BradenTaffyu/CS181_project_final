2020 cvs carriers are ruining the game for me i also heard they are trying to find a way to implement submarines into this game idea of it sounds really fun but despite the fact that cvs nerfed numerous times and still pub stomping the beginners like us makes me think that this will further drain the fun out of this game don t get me wrong the game is beautiful and i will still going to play but wg should listen to some concerns of the community
