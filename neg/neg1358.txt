2023 the game is quite fun in the first couple of hours after that poor game mechanics bugs and missing features become frustrating although the game has been already released it is far from finished siege mechanics are awful city management lacks depth and it doesn t bring any value ai is very bad diplomacy although it exists it s useless so many bugs i don t even remember you get spawned outside the map troops fall through the map in the middle of the battle especially sieges companions go missing there s a ton of missing qol features that should have been there probably the developer is counting on the modding community to do those this is just cheap no boats the battles are fun but they tend to become a grindfest in mid late game the game is far from finished should still be in early access
