2023 everything in this game is overshadowed by painful time consuming inventory management you can only store a small fraction of what you are expected to loot you can regularly find piles of legendary weapons armor dumped on the ground after events because people just can t store their rewards when you aren t having your gameplay sidetracked by hours of managing inventory you are likely encountering very serious bugs the inability to trade getting stuck getting in out of your power armor the ui doesn t even work consistently honestly there is a lot of very basic things that consistently don t work if you can get around those issues you will likely encounter very bad game play balancing and scaling i decided to use automatic rifles for my build and they were never able to keep up with anything else while also eating through significantly larger amounts of ammo with 3 different maxed out skills you can take 30 60 shots to kill moderate difficulty enemies and you ll get maybe 10 bullets in loot for it if you use a shotgun with no skills you can kill the same enemy with maybe 10 shots and you ll get 20 shells in loot i remember running totally out of ammo at one point picking up a random sledge hammer and immediately going oh wow this is way better the multiplayer elements in this game do not provide any meaningful interaction the most someone will interact with you under normal circumstances is maybe emote at you there is no text chat and generally no way to communicate outside of voicechat for local and group no one uses it under abnormal circumstances you will sometimes encounter people who are dead set on griefing harassing mic spaming you often will be competing for resources mobs when you encounter other players and will generally have your experience diminished in the process oh and the building is broken snap points refusing to snap stuff refusing to be placed when it s shown as placable walls not rotating and facing correctly invisible clipping issues preventing placement of objects it s the worst building i ve had to deal with since fo4 i think they actually made it work less i honestly think the story of fo76 is sad it s a game that has a lot of squandered potential that was crippled by bad monetization and mismanagement it s come a long way but it s still just not a fun experience it s a frustrating chaotic mess with frustratingly limited inventory frustratingly abundant and heavy items and riddled with frustrating bugs
