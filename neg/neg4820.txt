2020 in the past 133 hours i have spent playing this game at the time of review there are two words almost always on my lips as i play through the campaign fake difficulty total war warhammer ii is classified as a grand strategy game you would think without having any prior experience with of the total war series like myself that the challenge lies in outmaneuvering outplanning and generally outsmarting the game s ai while that is technically correct the problem is that the ai is dumb as a sack of hammers and the developers know this they build stupid armies with no synergy they pick fights that get them wiped away and even at the high battle difficulties all their units do is run straight into your frontline and beat their head against you so how do they offset the ai being lolrandum morons give them tons of cheats and let them ignore rules that binds the player they get massive economy steroids that let them maintain multiple armies on just one or two minor settlements with no money buildings so while you struggle to maintain one or two armies they can show up to the fight with three or four they always succeed at diplomacy and i ve seen the ai confederate much larger factions than them at turn five when the same thing takes the player dozens of turns they always know where the player is at all times and they will always prefer fighting you running past their other enemies and taking a dump on your front lawn the nanosecond you leave your settlements alone to play warhammer ii is to constantly be bumrushed by the ai who has nigh infinite resources to throw at you even at lower difficulties and that brings me to my point there is no strategy in a game so grossly lopsided toward the ai all your planning goes out the window when the ai s answer to everything is cheat a little cheese to challenge the player is all right when it s all under the radar but i am the kind of person that typically doesn t analyze games in depth and even i notice how blatant this is that doesn t mean there isn t fun to be had in the game again 133 hours and probably more as i try out mods that i hope fix these issues the above issues don t completely make it unplayable they just make it frusturating and harder to enjoy in my opinion a game stops being fun when you have to exploit the mechanics to keep up with the difficulty rather than use them
