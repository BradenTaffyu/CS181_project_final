2016 i feel that this game should have answered questions and helped to wrap up the series but instead the game is just littered with references to the other games which would be fine if it was done in moderation also the overall linearity of the game and lack of viable build variety is going to ruin replayability the only reason you d have to replay the game would be to attempt completing the finicky quests which are so asinine that there s almost no point other than achievement hunting if you re desperate for more souls i suppose you might enjoy this a little bit
