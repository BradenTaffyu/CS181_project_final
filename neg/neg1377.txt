2022 early access review the game was fine even great hell even better than warband until the 1 7 0 update then it became literally unplayable and now they re planning a full release in october after they ve managed to destroy the game heres what i mean before 1 7 0 you could separate your troops into 10 1 2 3 0 independent units and you could assign whichever troop you wanted to those numbers so if you wanted a separate unit of say cataphracts and only cataphracts and a unit of vlandian banner knights you could do that after 1 7 0 its just sliders of inf ranged inf cav ranged cav etc so guess what you want your first line of soldiers to be just imperial legionaries well f u c k you because theres 34 vlandian sergeants standing with them oh and guess what heres a khuzait footman as well because they re all infantry and they all have shields so theres literally no difference between them oh whats that you want your crossbowmen skirmishers and archers separate what you stupid or something they re clearly the same unit so they re gonna stand together stop bothering us we re working on a full release and a console port you want to send peasant recruits and not your elite guard into the fight because you a dont want casualties for your guard or b want your recruits to share all the xp well buddy they are both walking on feet so they are both infantry and thus the same group oh well you can manage all that with le sliders yes i forgot they added a really fun mini game so now you can sit hunched over at your table going sicko mode with your mouse and swinging a slider around until it just so happens to give you the troop composition you want also guess what if you want to be creative and have lets say the only 1 type of sturgians to be your shock troops and only 1 type of vlandians to be your crossbowmen and only 1 type of imperials backing your rear guard you know just to role play in this rpg game well you cant stop trying to whatever you want in this sandbox video game
