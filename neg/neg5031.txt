2021 was pretty into it at the start now not so much not enough variation in anything the generals all look the same unless you have mods the equipment all looks the same unless you have mods the units all look the same unless wait for it you have mods it all just comes across very very shallow especially after playing the warhammer total war games nothing is exciting and dare i say it the game doesn t actually feel like it s finished not worth paying full price for especially when it s the community that are the ones trying to give the game any kind of life
