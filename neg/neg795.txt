2018 dear bethesda i love you and your games to death the thing about fallout is you re wrecking it there s plenty right with fallout 4 updated mechanics weapon modifications taking the time to craft your own version of the mod wasteland settler into the game logic systems etc and it is a great game it s just not what fallout is supposed to be please for all that is holy in this universe give obsidian back what they created if anything you could really help them to produce their vision of what a true fallout game is bring back the karma system bring back meaningful choices bring back the ability to kill anyone you please even if that brings about your demise if you re going to have a voiced player character at least give us the option to customize our damn voice fallout is supposed to be an rpg where you decide what happens and each experience is different i ve modded the hell out of fo4 and i still feel like it just doesn t compare to new vegas even with the bugs i don t want my money back or anything in fact i want to buy every fallout game that comes out but if something doesn t change i might not ever buy one again i hate to say it but i look forward more to the mods like new california the frontier for new vegas than i do for fallout 76 it pains me to leave a thumbs down but i truely expect better from you please don t take it the wrong way just hear us true fans of the fallout universe
