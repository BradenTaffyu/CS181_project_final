early access review i have tried to like this game and revisited it twice but this game is not for me its in the same category as factorio and satisfactory and plenty others but its worse than both of them dsp has some really neat features and it does shine at times but i do not recommend it if you really want 3d spaghetti go play satisfactory but if you really want to travel to space in factorio then go play the space exploration mod or wait for the dlc if you want to play the game just buy it if you want a reason not to play the game read the rant below this is factorio except the buildings have a fixed size while the grid has a dynamic size this is an absolute nightmare the grid on which you place things slowly converges since in dsp you re building on a globe like super mario galaxy this is a neat and novel concept but it breaks the game in so many ways as you travel away from the equator the entire grid slowly shrinks but the buildings you place do not when placing buildings back to back either there could be enough space in between for an entire powerpole while sometimes there is not sometimes even an inserter tube wont fit and sometimes even the 2nd factory wont fit this reduced me to tears several times it is such a hassle to make nice orderly factoies in dsp blueprints cant be used everywhere blueprints can only be designed for and used on a certain gridsize if you have the perfect factory then there is very little chance of being able to reuse it because you can only really paste that blueprint on the same latitude don t expect to be able to use it in any other location this really defeats the purpose imo blueprinting doesn t work for conveyors inserters disclaimer this one could very well by my own fault my factories are mostly modular a chain of repeating segments need more throughput just paste another segment at the end when pasting a new segment but belts would never connect if the existing belts would overlap with the blueprint the game would complain unable to place blueprint and when force printing they would not connect the belts if you place all the belts beforehand and then just blueprint the buildings over that then the inserters wont get placed in my experience you would always have to fix your factories after you blueprint them that is not how its supposed to work the workflow should be design build copy paste paste paste instead in dsp it was always design build copy paste build paste build etc etc your character has a hunger meter i don t know why this exists but you have to fuel your mech or the game will pushing you and stop you from playing the game alarms go off the screen blinks red and you mech slows down and cant perform most actions trees count as earlygame fuel you can build fancy high density powercells later and you can build wireless charging spots so most of the time its fine there is no upside to this mechanic its completely trivial and if you run out of fuel while you re trying to deal with attackers your weapons switch off you die and its game over to me this is not a good game mechanic please just copy what valheim did you have less than 10 logistics request slots i mean come on you re gonna be handcrafting all day or flying back and forth to your mall the whole time both of these drain your energy etc etc
