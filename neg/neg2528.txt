2017 i am a fan of thehunter classic and invested a large amount of money into it so i was eager to play this new game they have the right idea but honestly it should have never been released in the current state there are bugs everywhere from clipping through the ground if you go prone to a graphical glitch with the scope to animals acting in total bizzare ways bugging out all together i regret the purchase my advice would be don t buy it and wait to see if they actually fix the game if everyone runs out and buys this it will only encourage the company to release unready games in the future as part of some sort of money grab if they take pride in their work they will fix these bugs it looks like the game need another month or two of work on it before it was ready for release the game may be worth picking up in the future but only if they fix these issues because its unacceptable when i come across several bugs within the first hour of play alone
