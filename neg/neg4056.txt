2018 eula allows the company that owns squad to my knowledge the eula before squad s purchase didn t have this to use your data as they see fit to quote it the information we collect may include personal information such as your first and or last name e mail address phone number photo mailing address geolocation or payment information in addition we may collect your age gender date of birth zip code hardware configuration console id software products played survey data purchases ip address and the systems you have played on we may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use great game if you don t mind an excessive amount of your data being used for any reason they deem edit 1 there is a possibility this might have connected to the supposed marketing software redshell and its removal however i still think that the company taking that step is disturbing and unless you aren t overly concerned about your data that you shouldn t purchase this game edit 2 squad and it s parent company don t seem to be actively and intrusively acquiring information but will instead will offer incentives in order to get said info for either sweepstakes or some online features i think this could ve been better seperated into information collection related to sweepstakes and online features so i d keep in mind a possibly foolish legal team and again good game if you aren t worried about your data thank you flame soulis and shylandro for the info in the edits 1 and 2 respectively
