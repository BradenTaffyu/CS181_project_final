2018 i ve been a fan of bethesda from morrowind a long time ago since then i played fallout 3 and it blew me away i got fallout new vegas on launch and enjoyed it even more and thought that overall it could be one of my favorite game experience set in an incredible world then fallout 4 came and it felt like a lesser fallout 3 and after a long wait i got all the dlc and am finishing them too feeling that i can now write a review even if i haven t finished them quite yet while i wasn t quite on the hate bandwagon like other fans as i still found the game still fun on a mechanical level and the world was just interesting enough to make me want to explore it if only a bit more there was always something that made me dislike it and i couldn t figure out what recently playing through the dlc for the first time i figured it out fallout 4 is too welcoming and lenient on newcomers to the wasteland the dlc doesn t fit into the main story either you can become the leader of opposing factions there s also a lack of real choice in the game sure the last few missions you can choose a faction and what to do with the city but other than that you can choose between good line or sarcastic line in all dialogue options everyone has mentioned the dumbing down of the rpg aspect to the point of it being nonexistent so i ll skip that and mention the lack of quest paths every quest is go here kill things get object almost every side quest is the same what happened as an action fps the mechanics are great i enjoyed the combat although it could become repetitive and the world looks incredible although i wish we were somewhere more recognizable than boston this isn t a good rpg though and i feel like that s how it was marketed targeted to the fans of a series that had been heavily influenced by rpg s for over a decade i wish steam had a neutral option because i don t feel like i can recommend it to fans of rpg s or of the fallout series but i do think i would recommend it to people who haven t enjoyed or tried either fallout 4 is as wide as an ocean deep as a puddle
