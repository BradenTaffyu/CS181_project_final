2018 should you buy it maybe i ve spent 42 hours in the game and have finished it i ve done all the jobs and have sold every house at least once if you like games where there isn t a clear goal and want something to simulate busy work it s not bad very much a chore simulator style of game it does have a lot of problems it s repetitive very repetitive you re going to be installing the same toilet sink shower bath washer radiator and air conditioner in every house that has one along with replacing any burnt out fuses electrical sockets and plastering over any damaged walls you can knock down and build walls except for the external walls or any wall with a mounting on it those are fixed and can t be moved you can paint tile or mount siding onto any walll but the choices are exceptionally limited as are the flooring and yet another game where the ceiling is just always white the decorating is fun but there are so few choices that you end up using the exact same thing over and over again the worst part being none of it matters in the end because putting nicer things in doesn t necessarily get you a better price nor does it guarantee the buyer you re going for and then we get to the buyers every house you buy will sell the buyers each have achievements tied to them so you have to try to sell to each buyer at least once however many of the buyers have requirements i say in quotes because they ignore them all the time to buying that overlap with other buyers you can have a buyer hit every check on his or her list and still not be the one to buy the property with the buggy aspect to the buyers the fact that your choices don t actually make a difference in the sale and sheer lack of content i d have to say i honestly don t recommend this game unless you get it for next to nothing 10 is better but it s definitely not worth the current 20 pricetag
