2020 product received for free this game makes you wish for a nuclear winter david donkleburg b76c i can t believe i ve put so many hours into this game a dear boobala gave it to me for free and i actually played it and to my surprise i liked some of it but that is no excuse for how much of a cash grab this game was and still is the beginning of the game is just as boring and tedious as it was when it first released the fetch quest after fetch quest approach didn t work well in fallout 4 and doubly so in fallout 76 the start of the game is so slow you ll want to replace your eyes with your ears like you were mr potato head but once you finally reach level 50 the game actually tricks you into thinking it is actually going to get good because you can do some cool like join the enclave and launch nukes on unsuspecting b e t a males or to spawn the scorch beast queen and wendigo colossus to farm legendary gear however once you ve done that twenty or so times to fun of it fades and the only reason you re even doing it is to get a legendary which may or may not be something of value 99 never anything of value speaking of legendaries which brain dead monkey at bethesda thought it was a good idea to have a completely random drop chance on weapons and their effects when there are so many weapons and armor pieces like seriously the amount of 1 star brass knuckles i ve gotten off of 3 star enemies is unbelievable if they actually cared i know they don t they would find a way to give you a guaranteed 3 star items other than a stupid rat that swindles you out of scrip the cardinal sin of this game is that bethesda is so desperate for people to play their game daily that they placed daily caps on the amount of in game currency ie scrip caps bullion reputation sort of so players are forced to come back daily if they want to maximize what they can earn the main problem is bullion while you can farm as many treasury notes as you want per day you can only turn in 20 a day which equates to 200 bullion making the progress toward the items you want to buy very slow but wait if you want to buy the coolest things like the gauss shotgun minigun or ammo machine you have to grind faction reputation this can only be done by completing daily missions which you only get one for each faction a day that really gives you any rep and a a secondary mission that rewards a small extra bit of rep other than those you have to grind random encounters which if you do good luck because the reputation gain is so small it would take hours of grinding to even equal to the dailies to sum up this rant while bethesda has fixed a lot of problems since the game released it still is a scummy broken cash grab at heart that somehow even after 2 years of bullshitting its way through it somehow still has a thriving player base of dumb dumbs including yours truly playing it i hope that bethesda releases a true fallout game again someday but as it looks now with the huge player base and probably thousands of dollars spent in the atom shop per day that wont be for a while or ever 2 steaming dumpaloos piles 10 p s if you see indiana ducky in game tell him his house looks like doodoo cheese
