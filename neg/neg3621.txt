early access review here s my review on the 1 0 version of the game it is awful and it tears my hearttfp are finishing the job of killing the last fun parts of the game that made it so good in earlier versions and that they slowly tore down piece by piecegoodbye customization and freedom get ready for extremely linear progression meeting the same npcs in the same order every run wearing armor sets made with pretty much the same componentsincreased health on all zombies you can forget about your favourite non meta builds stealth builds in highest difficulties and later stages of the game you ll now have to deal with damage sponges see how your bow build stands against 2 000 hp bikers or feral wightsoverall this is an absolute joke for a game being in dev for almost 12 years with its price about to double i wish this one was a joke
