2017 while fallout 4 fails to live up to core fallout standards it isn t bad as it s own game and it s pretty fun to mod mods basically did all the work bethesda couldn t with this game ranging from bug fixes to making the game more direct towards fallout 3 new vegas the pros fallout 4 is an outstanding upgrade in terms of graphics and some terms of voice acting characters look more human and it moves on from the dull singular pallette that s present in 3 and new vegas there s a more realistic feel to the environment and it directs more of the 50 s retro future theme nearly everywhere the story isn t bad but could ve had more directions unlike fallout 3 and new vegas your character s backstory is already defined and there s really only four paths throughout the story you re able to take the main 3 dlcs are also pretty fun though the workshop expansions feel more like free content than paid content the cons creation club this two gigabyte expansion is the bane of this game s existence while mods have been a way of expressing creative freedom amongst games bethesda seems persistent to capitalize on them even after their last blunder with steam worshop while fallout 4 still has much to be patched by them creation club is the true extent of them saying fine pay us five dollars if you re so damn smart putting bug fixes and content to potentially enhance the game the way it should ve been behind paywalls creation club is one of the worst business moves i ve seen made by a video game company second to none with nintendo s cease and desist against a fan game as much as it is a way to profit off of your content much like tf2 s steam workshop paid mods just dont work unlike items being accepted and profitted off of in games like cs go or tf2 mods are a loose cannon that could be a waste of money as they can potentially crash the game opens a backend to uploading other people s content from sites like nexus and allowing profits off of stolen content and overall a really bad move if you want my advice just use nexus the game s challenge threshold is also lowered as many rpg elements have been removed in exchange for shooter elements and perks can just make you op as hell now my conclusion a game beriddled with disappointment towards core fallout fans only enhanced by it s community the game itself isn t terrible but way too straightforward compared to previous fallout games my advice is get it on sale dont use creation club and use nexus if you want mods show bethesda we dont want their paid patches but legitimate delivered patches at least wolfenstein ii looks fun i loved the new order
