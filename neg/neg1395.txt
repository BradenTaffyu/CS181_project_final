2022 early access review the game has not managed to implement the promised core mechanics in a functional way within 2 years in early access the story is far too short and has almost no depth forging is broken diplomacy is almost non existent characters feel too generic there is no drunk guy in the tawern who wants to fistfight with you there is a companion cap no feasts and no sword sisters relationships are broken factions interaction with eachother is broken too the game feels way too empty and unfinished for a game which has been in early access for over 2 years games like satisfactory a game which is in early access too has accomplished more in it s first year of early access than bannerlord has in 2 years
