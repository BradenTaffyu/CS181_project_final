early access review this game has constantly refactored it s core loop often for the worst every major update this has resulted in 12 years of development with the end result being a repetitive game with an extremely shallow pool of content made worst as the devs are absolutely obsessed only with how quickly you progress through what little content is actually in the game most of the time the updates are focused on extending what little content the game has instead of actually expanding the game this leads to frustrating loops where you raid high difficulty locations for your current stage in the game and end up with tools that are either worse than what you came in with or slight upgrades at best historically the game has worked around several core mechanics the longest running one being a learn by doing system whereby using specific weapons and crafting items you gradually got more proficient in using and crafting said items allowing you to craft better weapons and use them more effectively this was removed in favor of a brand new leveling and perk system learn by skilling essentially where the player gains a level and may allocate a perk point anywhere they wish to gain small percentile bonuses in a specific task and unlock better quality items and new crafting recipes currently the game works on a learn by looting system which followed almost immediately after the learn by skilling update where the player needs to read a set number of magazines which they loot from pois or earn by doing trader quests the current core focus of the game is essentially a looter shooter where you raid points of interest for supplies in preparation for a horde night at the end of every 7th day the actual survival elements are slim with each subsequent update continuously paring them down being able to jar your own water was removed farming food was nerfed crafting better quality equipment was heavily restricted and gated behind looting pois even the cost of cooking recipes was increased to minimize the survival crafting element and cater the game more to looting and action the most recent update has at least temporarily removed weather effects to my knowledge to make way for the new armors the actual content in the game essentially revolves around roughly 10 or 11 different weapon categories and 4 tool categories each following a 3 tiered system of progression stone iron steel with each progressive tier being a statistical improvement on the last at the cost of increased stamina usage though a slim few of the weapons are unique within their category like the smg in the pistols category or crossbows and bows being grouped together this naturally leads to the game feeling extremely samey every play through as most skill trees are allocated 1 melee weapon and 1 firearm though a select few get 2 of either one or the other due to the loot progression dragging it s feet and being hyper focused about extending the 40 or so odd items that you can use as weapons or tools across the game you can often find neolithic stone spears and wooden clubs inside of a military base s armory if you make the mistake of looting it before you level is high enough to get you over the invisible loot stage hump which determines if you re even allowed to roll on a table featuring an item of a higher tier than you currently have with some luck you can progress decently through looting though often times most loot is basic food trash or raw resources making the majority of spins on the loot roulette immensely disappointing the bones of each update have carried over with each iteration often for the worst besides the perk system from the previous update which to this day is horrifically balanced with multiple useless perks jars remain in the game as dummied out code and a highly granular quality system separate from item tier from the earliest alphas persist to this day rolling random levels in 10 point range from 1 60 for each level of item you make quality 1 is 1 10 quality 2 is 11 20 and so on up until quality 6 ranging from 51 60 this is completely hidden from the player but has a major impact on stats you could craft a quality 4 item that rolls a 40 that out performs a quality 5 item that rolled a 41 the current 1 0 update which is just another alpha version being sold at full price with a 2 year road map has gutted the former armor and clothing system instead for fixed outfits with unique stats that scale with quality level significantly downsizing character customization and enforcing a strange metagame where you have to constantly hotswap pieces of your outfit to maximize productivity this is in addition to further slowing progression by essentially making trader rewards useless and adding zero new content to the game not even following up on the promised improved optimization which the game desperately lacks in short 7 days to die was an extremely promising game that has been jerked around by it s developers for 12 years as they gradually lost the vision they had and began instead trying to micromanage how their players play their singleplayer survival crafting game
