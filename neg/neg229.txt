2020 25 december 2020 i have had the subscription for 5 days it is not usable i have tried to talk to steam they say the problem is not of their creation and to contact help ea com when i try to message help ea com they will only speak to active subscribers the phone numbers they have listed do not work even though i am unable to use the subscription steam will not refund my money because i have had the potential to use the subscription update it is now 04 january 2021 finally after sending a copy of my receipt to support swotor com they replied and changed my status to subscriber they were also helpful in pointing out that people in the eu are entitled to a refund within 14 days of subscription even though steam says no they are are working to resolve the problem which kept me from subscribing with them originally i will continue to do it through them but not steam this will be only a platform for keeping a library of non mmo games which i own i have lost my faith in steam to maintain a balance between profitability and how to best serve the customer shame on you steam
