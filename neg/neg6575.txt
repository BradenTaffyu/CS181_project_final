2016 will remain a negative review until softban issue is resolved note i was banned during the first ban wave from claims that the system has been changed meanwhile but i have no way of verifying this one way or another i went through almost 4 complete game cycles to get all possible gear and achievements on one character one additional cycle because sirris quest line is made out of really thin paper and now i got penalised for i don t even know what corruption must have happened during ng as none of my save files i made a copy before starting each new cycle were able to remove the invalid game data warning edit in light of very recent evidence from coming down from their throne to impart some knowledge upon the unwashed masses it is clearer now why this approach didn t work even the complete removal of all game data after receiving the warning was no guarantee that you wouldn t get penalised by design from claims and contrary to everything the warning message said or implied while i had fun exploring and collecting everything i have absolutely no desire to do it again since let s face it this game isn t all that deep once you have seen everything at least once before the ng cycles are uninspired and unchanging pvp is the real endgame and i m barred from it as i write this i wouldn t have bothered if rebirth wasn t a thing if having a character with all gear to choose from didn t have a tangible benefit which is another gripe i have with the game only 5 rebirths per cycle no forgoing of sls you can t re roll the starting class but that is another issue and one i would begrudgingly accept if everything else worked as it should which currently it doesn t get your together from this is just disgraceful update 2016 05 02 do not bother with bandai namco support i finally got a reply out of them after a few emails it was a generic canned reply saying that i should be patient yes i am patient very patient you have to be if you are forced to do pvp on the shadow server talk about adding insult to injury update 2016 05 09 i opened a ticket to see if that works better than email i linked this review and received a reply within 24 hours asking me several questions i answered the questions but nothing has happened since then update 2016 05 13 i don t even care anymore praise steam family sharing update 2016 05 17 put in an edit about the warning ban system as some new information has surfaced from claims that the review system it is working now and that mistakes made previously will be rectified we shall see
