2021 product received for free early access review edit currently revising review based on late ea release versions over 10 years in development coming off warband s success for now and possibly the foreseeable future taleworlds sure failed to deliver warband was fun plagued by many issues but still fun not to mention quite innovative you d think that with the experience and time the devs had to perfect their formula bannerlord would be pretty good but that isn t the case the good features from warband are still good recent updates also added a basic form of diplomacy which is something you would expect to have been included in the first ea version however sieges combat ai lord ai it all still sucks and the leveling system on the main branch is completely busted the new features are either broken or mostly absent some cool systems like characters automatically gaining weight and muscle mass are just not balanced in a way that makes sense and the devs response to this they added the ability to access character creation at any point by pressing v just tweaking a couple of numbers or actually working on the game would have fixed this the fact that this fix was shipped contributed to me losing hope it s pathetic that brings me to the next point the rate at which development is proceeding okay so i work in software dev myself and i know for a fact that it s a lengthy process regardless of what you re doing especially if you want to get done in a way that maintainability isn t compromised i also know how much harder it is to collaborate and organize a team during the covid 19 pandemic but i assure you that despite this updates are rolled out way too slowly a single developer at taleworlds would ve been able to fix glaring issues like the level scaling and the aforementioned weight muscle gain loss balance in a matter of hours deployment is not an issue either because steam makes this process quite seamless for users at least i normally don t negatively review an ea game however i don t think this game will get much better and glaring issues that exist today like sieges not working properly will probably never be fixed and if they do it s not worth the wait they had over a decade to deliver at least something siege ai fix eta 2045 i would love nothing more than be proven wrong but until then no thanks
