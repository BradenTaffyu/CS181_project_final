2016 now before i start i have got to say i recommend this game more than i don t i don t recommend this as a fallout game and since it s marketed as one i say no i spent 230 hours on it i enjoy it but as a completely different game it is not fallout and here s why conversationsin previous fallout games you had much much more dialouge options than in this installment 4 options in each situation i understand that the voice actors had a lot to record as it is but i would have taken a silent protagonist with more choices i had no problems with the shortened versions although i prefer seeing all but what is unforgivable is that all dialouges are the same yes i am a kind personyes but youyes but i want moneyyes sarcastically character creation i will use nv as an example because i enjoyed that more than fo 3 you assign your special you make the face aaaand that s it no skill points nothing just a perk each level thus the use of your skills in conversations are absent here and that is a huge letdown i loved new vegas s system how you could use your strength barter speech or just sneak skill to get out of a sticky situation none of that here in new vegas i felt like i was really in control over my character in every way here it feels like a cod with a skill tree plus the usual perks like lockpicking hacking mysterious starnger etc karma and ways of playingwhen i discovered that my only options to be evil is to kill all that i can i was bummed in the previous installments you could pull off some of the most evil twisted i ever saw here the most evil thing i found is side quest spoiler to sell the kid from the fridge to a random dude you are always the good guy even if you do something against someone there is someone backing you up justifying what you did worldnow don t get me wrong it is a huge world with a lot to see but you see it all pretty quickly it feels empty after my first playthrough unlike skyrim which i have 700 hours in all things considered i don t bump into new stuff in every new playthrough a bit about bethesdayes we were all joking about how it s buggy and screws up your save but when after a week of playing enduring a bugfest wanting to start the game on a lazy morning corrupt save file not so funny then huh we shouldn t allow this to happen we buy these products we make the demand and we didn t want a buggy game did we so think about this when you are playing all in all i will continue to play this game all dlcs and see if it can turn me around this is a good game but not a good fallout sorry for the long text here s a potato potato
