2021 product received for free got it as a gift because i loved the first one and played it to death this one shows a lot of promise but just like the first one i think we are 3 4 dlc packs away from getting all the features that were promised and are supposed to be included give it at least a solid year for all the features to be released ps why in the hell would frontier not include a way for you to build a park from the ground up without restrictions that s the whole point of these simulator games even the first one let you build up through the challenge mode now you have all sorts of restrictions put on your park if you want to do a challenge like no carnivores or limiting it to 10 species give us something that allows us to build a park and progress our genome and research projects sandbox is a waste of time since there is no reward for managing your park
