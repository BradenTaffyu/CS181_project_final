2016 i want to love this game but what they basically did was give us unique units for once but then decided that instead of building up from previous games they would completely get rid of town battles get rid of what made siege battles great and give us a completely flat city with a random layout of streets and only one direction to attack from they also got rid of escalation and every siege battle is now a reskin of another city they also charge 19 for a dlc that actually only adds four new units and reskin all the others chaos was also a dlc all of these features are what made total war different from other games don t get me wrong it s a good average game but nothing really stands out about this title even though they add new units exteremly dissapointed will give thumbs up when dlc is lowered to 7 lowerbeastdlcto 7 everybody type this in your review lol
