2023 early access review ton of fun first couple of playthroughs don t get too excited it s been in alpha since 2013 with no sign of ever progressing to beta or full release so what you see is what you get they mostly do tiny tweaks and cater to streamers with updates edit don t be fooled by the 1 0 release it s been in the same state for a couple of years and judging by their own comments like don t see it ever being completed it won t be finished and will likely be abandoned soon
