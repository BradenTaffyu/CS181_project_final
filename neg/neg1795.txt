this game will seduce you initially with it s amazing detail and impressive most of the time physics engine however after you play a bit you ll realize how anti fun and extortionate the live service model they ve installed is you may feel pot committed to keep playing but hopefully you ll just choose to spend your time playing something more fun instead i can t recommend this game in good faith 1 out of 5 stars for long term play
