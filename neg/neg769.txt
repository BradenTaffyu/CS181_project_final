2015 edit july 2016i went back to fallout 4 a few times since modding support was officially released and since a few of the dlc packs which are just community mods repackaged as dlc are available now granted they gave me an extra 150 hours or so out of the game and many of you might consider fallout 4 a good time money ratio but my opinion of the game has not changed the time i spent in this game was not enjoyable or rewarding all too much of the time was spent trying to deal with the games shortcomings such as the never ending radiant quests the new improved survival mode having no fast travel and no quicksave despite the game being broken and crash happy the enemies with unlimited precision grenades that can kill you through walls the rubbish writing etc i stand by what i have said in my main review reviewso i sank nearly 200 hours into this and i feel like i finished everything that was worth doing around the 80 100 hour mark f4 certainly has not changed my opinion of bethesda games they re like junk food they taste good and sometimes you get a craving for them but they ultimately leave you feeling empty and unsatisfied i don t particularly want to rant about every detail i didn t like in this game but there are some things i feel i need to talk about the game has no challenge worth mentioning unless you consider chipping away at bullet sponges to be a rewarding experience similar to the super mutants of fallout 3 deathclaws have been downgraded from how they used to be and are now the new generic roaming tough guy enemy even though they shouldn t be roaming in the first place just like skyrim npc s dump meaningless and unwanted quests in your journal if you even so much as hear them whispering in the distance you re expected to do everything for everybody and it gets tiresome quickly example one of the most common side quests is to clear out a spot that would make a good new settlement generally the person giving you the quest will say something like i ve got some friends who want to move in there so you clear out the place report back and 2 settlers will move in to their new home however they do nothing when they arrive they won t set up a farm beds defences or even attempt to clean the place up despite being told that these settlers wanted to move in once this piece of land was cleared out they are perfectly happy to just sit there and starve to death until you come back and build up the place for them what exactly was their plan for the place they asked you to clear out for them i really can t stand how incompetent everybody is in bethesda games also these kinds of quests are pretty much unlimited so even if you do take the time to build up settlements for people there is no sense of progression because you re immediately bogged down with 3 or 4 more of the same quest literally as many of the quest givers have a nasty habit of giving you 3 or 4 more quests before they allow you to turn in the ones you ve already finished at the time of writing this review the geck is not available so mod support is limited and as of december 7th 2015 an update was added which removed what little mod support the game already had so long pre war house on that note i don t understand why rebuilding pre war stuff is not an option when it was revealed that you were a pre war survivor and military veteran i figured that you having pre war knowledge would become a big deal in the game in fnv i remember someone saying that mining machines are tricky to use because nobody alive has the knowledge to repair them or rebuild them if they ever completely break down not to mention helios 1 but no your characters status as a pre war survivor is meaningless he she rarely even mentions it he she can t even sweep the piles of leaves and rubble out of his her home but hey that s my fault for expecting more depth from a bethesda game i don t know why i keep trying please excuse the wall of text but i assure you that was the short list if you already got fallout 4 on release chances are you ve finished it and moved on so i m really just writing this review for anybody who s still undecided about getting f4 this is certainly not fallout new vegas it doesn t even have a hardcore mode despite carrying over skyrim s cooking system edit it now has a hardcore survival mode it sucks i ve been told that f4 started out as a mod for skyrim and it sure feels like it you really won t miss much by waiting for this game to go on sale maybe in the form of the goty edition when full modding support is available
