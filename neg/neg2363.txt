2019 so anno 1800 is coming back to steam after three years of absence the different editions of the game are discounted by quite a bit i can t get those though because i own the basegame from way back when you could still buy it on steam so by virtue of owning the base game i would have to buy the dlc for the undiscounted price for way more money this is such a fun game i wish ubisoft would stop screwing it over
