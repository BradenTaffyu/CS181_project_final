this game genuinely changed my life for the worse the moment i opened this game my mother was hit by a truck tire flying at 200km h after a brutal accident after she died it turned out that she misspelled my name in the will and everything she left me was sent to a random person after that i sat down and tried to play the game but my chair broke and i fell onto the floor in anger i threw my broken chair at a wall which made my entire house collapse because my house collapsed all my possessions were buried under the rubble and the only thing that remained was my pc setup i tried to calm down by playing some dark souls ill but my steam library glitched and now the only game i can play is skibidi backrooms while i was playing i got a phone call saying that i had been convicted for murder and was going to prison for life because when i collapsed my house the shock wave caused my neighbours cooking oil to tip onto his turned on gas stove which blew him up immediately when i got to prison they said i was being sentenced to death and asked for my last meal i wanted a big mac no pickles but mcdonalds got the order wrong and gave me a cold mcchicken with extra pickles don t trust the price tag on this game it seems cheap but the cost is really much higher than the actual price tag this game has ruined my life 6 10
