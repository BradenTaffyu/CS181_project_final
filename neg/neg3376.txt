2016 in its current state sunflower patch 1 2 hearts of iron iv is not enjoyable in singleplayer due to its broken ai you can annex whole major nations with barely any resistance when the ai decides not to use any troops to defend its own territory this may hopefully change in future builds in which case i will change this review the rest of the game is in my opinion enjoyable and well designed
