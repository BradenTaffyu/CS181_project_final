2023 while the custodian initiative was a great move and those guys really did us a solid with old dlc reworks the new dlcs are getting worse and worse with each new release imo first contact galactic paragons and their respective free updates are showing that the design philosophy for the whole game has changed significantly and not in a good way i think that the overlord was the last dlc that i bought and was reasonably content with even though it had a lot of problems at the start and still has some questionable design choices darn it paradox i want to throw my money at your dlcs but not only they are adding less and less content they are adding stuff that makes the game even worse
