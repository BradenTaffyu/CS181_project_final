2019 i want to give it a thumbs up because i should like it but the ai is just terrible i found myself bored each play through so much so that i often left the game on for hours taking breaks to watch television or do chores around the house here is a list of what i felt they improved on for those that already have played total war games 1 diplomacy is better than previous installments usually they keep this as a hollow mechanic but this time it feels like they are getting somewhere 2 the technology tree is very interesting and i feel is a step up from the more recent games 3 the spy system once you understand what is going on is more in depth than i initially realized i was very pleased to see they take a chance with more realistic spy system 4 i really enjoy duelsnow onto the bad 1 ai is a hot mess typical of their game this is something they need to eventually fix but i doubt they will until the cash cow goes dry 2 factions all are too similar this is more apparent after playing a game of such diversity like the warhammer total war series 3 ai cheating is too obvious you constantly see ai with no food and gold that they can t possibly have made but they are going around doing the same stuff as you this will become an issue once players reach a few hundred hours and realize how hollow the game really is 4 follow the story is often too difficult and when you do there is little to gain by it going through 5 enemies to destroy one enemy because your faction did that in real life doesn t show the truth of how the world worked at that time and they should have just done the similar instanced battle system they were doing 5 the map is often hectic and confusing and at least i did you have have to often go into the diplomacy screen just to figure out what is going on it eventually gets annoying 6 battle maps suck still as they put little to no effort in making maps this is a ongoing problem now for the series and it is ridiculous that we have to wait on modders to get real battle maps these are not complete lists but they are samples of my opinion of the game i recommend this game to the people that buy each total war game and dedicate hundreds of hours into each game i do not recommend this game to new players to the total war series or more casual total war players it is not a bad game but there are better titles that have had more work than this game by this company edit 1 i forgot to add this games loading screens are absolutely terrible i have a pretty nice computer and this game still had load screen issues not anthem bad but almost meme worthy in some situations
