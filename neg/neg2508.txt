this is not a game there are no choices no player agency imagine a chess match against a computer that always plays exactly the same move every turn and all you have to do is memorize the right counter that s what frost punk is it is an exercise in memorizing what you have to do next against a series of events that are always the same and have exactly one right answer in the beginning you have to amass 200 coal within the first day or people die so put 25 people on coal 5 on steel and the rest of crates that s your first move it is forced build eight tents as fast as you have wood or people die that s your second move it is forced as well next is a medical tent every single game people get sick at exactly the same point in time that s your third move and it too is forced moves four and five are hunting hut and kitchen move six is the workshop forced delay building it and you delay the beacon delay the beacon and the weather turns bad and the 50 people you have are not enough because you did not opt for the scouting party option which is not an option and it goes like that as long as you want it to the exact same move at the exact same time every time oh and as a bonus there are forced adds at game startup every time that cannot be bypassed now if that is your thing then more power to you
