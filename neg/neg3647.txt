2023 early access review disrespectful greedy tfpby making the twitch extension mandatory to use the game events they will now be funneling 20 of streamers donations to themselves i guess its time for me to dust off my old copy of twitch integration i made a year before they did and update it to work with the new version and let the parachute bears rain some more cause i ll be damned if i let them take 20 of the donations from me or my friends if i can help it now i am not saying its a bad thing to have the extension at all it can be a great way to expand the capabilities of the integration and add extra functionality that cant be done with the basic version but to make it mandatory is just plain greedy you should have left it as optional like it should be
