2017 when the game first came out i really enjoyed being a fighter pilot gradually ranking up my planes but now that i have retruned after numerous updates it seems that the grind to level up equipment is just to much i barely see the bar move after a good game with plenty of points i dont know who war thunder think they are but i dont have a life time to get to the end content of your game and for this i cant reconmend the game you will spend all your time grinding for one plane or tank
