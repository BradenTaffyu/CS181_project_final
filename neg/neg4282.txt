2021 early access review finally played dsp again after a long break so time to update this review a bit i think it s interesting to see how the game was back when it released vs how it is now so i ll keep the original review and just use brackets to add in updates where appropriate the bottom line is i really want to like this and will keep checking on it and possibly updating my review but i m still giving it a thumbs down for now 1 this game promises a lot from combat to orbital platforms but progress in terms of adding in features has been extremely slow and while i think something like orbital platforms will be achievable i m skeptical about more complex features like combat on the plus side they did a decent job of blueprints although the irregular grid certainly made that extremely challenging on the minus side it s almost a year since they released and that s the only notable feature they added 2 at the end of the day i ve played factorio about 10 times as much finished it multiple times and i m still much more excited to play another game of factorio than continue my run in dsp more or less the same goes for satisfactory even though blueprints made scaling up less of a chore the game still feels too slow for my taste and too shallow to be rewarding the flow is pretty crappy instead of the tech tree starting shallow and branching out it starts complex and ends up shallow the complexity is in the scaling but scaling is not nearly as much fun as designing new factories and designing factories in dsp is not the puzzle it is in factorio and it does not allow the level creativity of satisfactory original review below adnotated with updatesbeing a huge fan of both factorio and satisfactory this game caught my attention instantly and i bought it without much in terms of second thoughts having gone through quite a few cycles building up to mid late game i think the game is decently fun and replayable but does have some significant issues in its current state this review is negative mainly to provide a sensible counter point to all the fanboyish reviews out there i will update the review and the rating as the game develops if you are a fan of factorio and or satisfactory and own both i d say give it a go but i definitely recommend both over dsp in its current state and by quite a margin since you can find a lot of the positives in other reviews here s a summary of the downsides as far as i m concerned interface fixed no key rebinding some bad default binds like using wasd with up down arrows for conveyor height and for copy pasting recipes kinda fixed at least you have they hotkey list now undocumented or poorly documented keys like g for guide if you close all of the messages you need to look it up in settings or deleting inventory items had to google that too many windows and inconsistent layout and feel to them your inventory window sometimes has an auto sort button and sometimes doesn t when it s open by clicking on a building awful translation i find it funny but overall the interface reeks of sloppiness while this should easily get cleaned up having such a sloppy release does not send a very good message about the makers of an ea game how much are they still planning to invest in it if paying maybe 100 for decent translations wasn t in their budget for an initial release qol partly fixed you can now upgrade no upgrading or rotating placed buildings sorters conveyors works maybe you could do this back then but it s unintuitive can t clear conveyors manually mech is very slow and runs out of energy quickly especially when building building is very slow upgrades improve this significantly but i think it s bad design to make basic mechanics a chore only to justify some upgrades that make them less so you are building on a square grid on spheres to some extent this is genius but it causes a large number of inconsistencies based on latitude and on the tears between grid sections fixed with some limitations and bad ui no blueprints and i wouldn t take it as a given they will be added because of my point above layouts that work in one place on the map wouldn t in another or on another planet with a different radius tech tree progression techs are unintuitive and it s hard to figure out find what you re looking for unless you have experience with the game this made my first playthroughs a mix of waiting for research to finish while not doing anything and not having anything to research while scrambling to automate the next tier of science packs most techs provide only intermediates and nothing directly buildable useable many techs have hidden dependencies i e they unlock items you can t build because you lack another tech required to build the prerequisites this makes the tech tree much more linear than it looks at a glance lots of recipe reuse ex silicon ore pure silicon silicon crystal 2 1 1 0 5 item s coal graphite diamond 2 1 1 0 5 item s means there s a lot of stuff but much of it feels same ish mech upgrades are extremely boring and mainly solve qol issues you shouldn t have in the first place max blueprint size is a new offender here and one of the worst for that few truly optional techs for example i ve finished many runs in factorio but still have techs i ve never researched and things i ve never built like nuclear power did that one in the meantime artillery nukes and spidertron to mention a few no such thing here lots of blatant balance issues ex t2 assemblers cost twice the power and significantly more and higher tier resources but only provide a 33 speed boost you have a building that uses 12 mw to turn hydrogen into deuterium at a 2 1 rate at 1 unit sec meanwhile a lower tech 0 7mw building does the same at a 1 1 conversion rate 0 3 units sec can you tell at a glance which is better hint it s the one that recently got buffed to have double the output rate despite already being op you have a galaxy at your disposal but you only need to go to one remote planet in your solar system to find the 2 basic resources missing from your home planet the rare resource veins are a nice touch but they re just fluff with the sole purpose of cutting out sections of some builds and thus dumbing down the game i e fire ice smelts directly into graphene meaning you can obtain that w o having to make sulphuric acid and combine it with graphite compare that to satisfactory alts that require exploration and often allow you to trade productivity for complexity or vice versa overall the tech tree feels very thin given this is ea that may be perfectly fine but what i find worrying is there s a tech path there marked as not in the game yet i certainly hope that s not all they plan to add or this will definitely feel incomplete that tech path still isn t in the game almost a year later i m fairly sure zero techs were added aside from the blueprint limit upgrades the balancing is still awful and i find it worrying they don t seem to be trying to fix it in any way
