2021 i know this is a controversial negative review as everybody seems to love this game and that my review won t even make a dent in the sea of overwhelmingly positive reviews but i personally really didn t enjoy stardew valley it s repetitive with little reward and nothing much to aim for the social system relies on you grinding for gifts to reach favour with the npcs along with this not much is explained to you in the beginning also the days are short and cause you to rush to get everything done so you don t lose money i can agree that stardew valley definitely has character and a nice art style but if i m going to devote my time and spend my money on a game that i can only compliment through its art style then it s not worth the effort i ve played games like this and ones that are very similar to this so i know for sure that i can enjoy the genre but for me i found stardew didn t meet my expectations or fit any of the high praise i had heard edit let me just eat my words and say stardew valley is in fact enjoyable but my point still stands in that had i not been playing my most recent game in coop i still would ve found it incredibly draining i m just lucky to have a friend who enjoys farming whilst i go and fart about in the caves all day because farming is absolutely necessary to the game stardew is repetitive and i only actually like one or two aspects of the game and had i been forced to do everything in singleplayer my opinion of this game would absolutely still stand so i am going to leave this as a negative review
