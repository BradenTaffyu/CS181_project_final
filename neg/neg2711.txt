2023 later 2024 edit ah ai garbage they really must be starving over there in literally swimming in cash land pay your artists and maybe they d be inspired pay for voice actors you have the budget 2024 edit well it looks like they re deciding to nickle dime you forever and always do not pay them starve this greedy company until they understand how to make a game and not a skeletonuntil paradox realizes they need to set down the dlc pipe for a second and fix the performance issues i cannot recommend this nearly 350 400 onslaught of dlc masquerading as a game stop it get some help even after that in what universe is charging that much for the complete product even remotely okay also no a subscription service wouldn t fix it either make a complete game and charge for that or don t make a game at this rate guys paradox s current mission statement seems to be the dlc flood will continue until morale improves
