2017 this game is most certainly not worth 60 or even 50 at best it can be considered an expansion to total warhammer 1 but it doesn t offer enough to distinguish itself as a standalone experience at several points i forgot i was playing total warhammer 2 the overall experience is razor close in terms of gameplay there are a few bits and pieces shuffled on to make the game different but it s still pretty much the exact same thing new races a new map a couple of gameplay tweaks i can t help but think about the game soulstorm which likewise added few things to its predecessors while being sold as a new game the campaign ai is still absolutely r i e i t i a i r i d i e i d and the unit balance is still just silly at this point sega ca should just give units in all total wars submachineguns and handgrenades it would match the arcade combat much better there is little room for anything approaching tactical thought in this game much like its predecessor due to moshpit like combat if you enjoyed the first one there is fun to be had here but it s not worth full price at all wait until it s closer to the 20 range ca didn t put much effort in here for your money so don t let them rip you off performance wise i had no issues running the game on i7 5930k 32gb ram 1080ti sli and both gpus show they are being used i7 6820hk 32gb ram gtx 1070 laptop i7 960 12gb ram gtx 980ti i7 4770k16gb ram gtx 1080 i did not try dx12 mode because why bother really
