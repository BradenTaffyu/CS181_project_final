2020 with the new resistance dlc reworking politics into the game it removed boosting any ideology from the game regardless if you own the dlc or not a core feature of the game was removed and locked off behind a dlc paywall there was no need for this there was no reason for this to take place let me clarify the base game was downgraded with the arrival of a new dlc that forces you to pay money for a feature they removed from the game this is beyond the greed of ea
