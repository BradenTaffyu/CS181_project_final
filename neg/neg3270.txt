2023 i like the game itself but i cannot give it a positive review what you pay for is not the complete game some parts are visible in the user interface but you cannot use them unless you buy the dlc this means you get notifications about stuff missing in production that you simply cannot produce because it s added with a dlc the game doesn t give any explanation and you have to go scrape the internet to figure out things like why you can suddenly build self propelled artillery but not the missiles so if you start producing artillery you would soon realize you are creating division with 0 strenght trying to resupply your units by clicking the dedicated button and producing transport planes well you need the dlc to push that button and your transport planes are now almost completely useless very frustrating experience if a dlc adds completely new content to a game i still dislike the idea but i m ok with it trying to lure people into buying your additional content by locking parts of the game you paid for unless you pay more is not ok and feels like a scam
