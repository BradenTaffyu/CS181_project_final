2023 this game is great it allows you to control many empires has bigger depth than civs and wide variety of dlcs however what prompted me to post this review is that when you want to enjoy a chill long game that takes a month to finish you get hit by various updates that you cannot block and guess what your save game that you ve sunk solid 50 hours in is now unplayable because the devs made another change to the game and pushed it to players without ability to prevent it to apply to the currently live game session save game i was happy about this game but this has already occurred to me 2 times and it really pisses me off thanks for ruining my sessions
