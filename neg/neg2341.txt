2020 early access review generally speaking the game is fun there s lots to do and if you like craft survival build games then this will pique your interest however if you re going to commit time to this game you should know a few things first and foremost the save system is broken if you think you can just restore an old save when something goes wrong either at your hand or when the game bugs out you cannot the game offers the option to load one of several backup copies but this feature does not work properly second when you die there is no dropped backpack or any way to reclaim your items this is compounded by a below average combat mechanism which means the likelihood of this happening is high third the water and food consumption rate is ridiculously high you spend an abnormally high amount of time managing food and water this is not mitigated by improving character statistics as you progress either because there is no rpg element at all lastly there is no dev console or cheat commands to compensate for any of the games shortcomings if the game bugs all the hours you put into that world are for not if you make a mistake you ll likely be faced with the decision do i grind all over again to get all my important items back or do i write off the time i ve put in so far and walk away from the game i ve chosen the latter maybe i ll check back on the game in another six months to see if the devs have addressed these serious game breaking issues and give it another try for anyone who hasn t tried this game yet but is interested you ll enjoy the experience right up to the point when one of the scenarios above comes into play so just go in knowing this and hopefully this will prevent you from rage throwing your computer out the window
