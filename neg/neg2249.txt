2023 i ve only got 251 hours on the steam version but i like sticking to the launcher version where i ve got probably 3000 4000 hours this is a negative review on this game but more gaijin entertainment themselves however i do want to talk about some of the tings that i did do like about war thunder i love the fact that there is a huge selection of tanks and aircraft available in the game with most having their own unique stats and quirks the tanks and aircraft especially the newer models have really detailed models and look outstanding some of the maps mostly the medium age maps have a really nice layout and arent a grind in of itself to get around on and arent easy to spawn snipe looking at you karelia most of the vehicles are pretty accurate to how they performed in real life when you get into a good map with both teams being almost equally stacked its always super satisfying to watch the tickets go down almost neck and neck finally when one team wins either yours or the enemy s i always say that it was a truthfully good game however those matches are rare and its usually one team getting steamrolled by the other now onto the negatives when i first started i was flipping between this and wot finally i fully switched to this and i was enjoying it there were some god updates then bad but overall i had fun it felt like just before covid thats when war thunder hit it s peak and after that it became a downhill tumble these days the battle pass and crafting events are just such a long and difficult grind that for anyone who actually wants the vehicle they either stay up all night for nights on end or they spend eagles the way battle ratings are compessed is also another thing that frustrates me battle rating was a system designed to group tanks with certain capability so they can fight each other so now why is it that i can take my german king tiger and have it face a tank from the early 1960s that could still somewhat hold their own up until 1997 apparently it is so we can face shorter queue times i think i m right in saying that a vast majority of the player base would rather have a lightly longer queue time so they can get into a match with tanks that they stand a chance against onto more things about vehicles i want to talk about close air support cas cas is the airplanes used to deliver ordinance to the ground via bombs rockets missiles or gunfire cas in itself isnt bad it s annoying to get bombed or strafed yes but you can usually recover within a few seconds what makes me most upset about cas is how alarminglky easy it is to get into a fully loaded attacker all you need is a light tank with the airstrike modification installed a hill and a few enemy tanks scout those enemy tanks and maybe kill one of them leave your vehicle and you ll have enough spawn points to spawn in a bomber that you can use to wipe out a bunch of the enemy all everyone does in matches these days is rush for their favourite cas plane meaning your ground realistic battle match has turned into an air relistic battle witha couple tanks roaming around on the ground finally the single biggest reason why i m most upset with the game and refuse to play now gaijin themselves no it is not because they are a russian game developer i played war thunder until quite recently i m talking about how gaijin simply refuses to listen to their playerbase unless it is a way for them to get more money file a bug report stating that such and such premium tank actually has this slightly longer reload or less pen or post pen damage might as well talk to the brick wall behind you however file one that could potentially make the tank overpowered and they will look into it and see if perhaps changes can be made with valid sources they constantly make tank nerfs and economy changes that make the grind so painfully slow that it almost forces you to buy golden eagles and or premium time in order to actually progress gaijin entertainment has been trying to find any string possible to squeeze out even more money from the playerbase and it seems that now everyone has snapped and this is the consequence it s gotten to the point that gaijin doesnt want us making negative reviews on here but the only way to prevent that is to fix some of the biggest issues like the grinds and br compression and the playerbase will be so so much happier
