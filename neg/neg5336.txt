update 2024 06 17 i ll summarize as quick as possible positives you can legitimately build competitive decks without your credit card massive card library excellent for building theoretical decks virtually before buying physical cardsnegatives massively flawed card draw system players and opponents both consistently draw the same cards back to back lots of card rules are broken ex 1 some cards don t activate correctly in certain matches when they should such as vito thorn of the dusk rose ex 2 i ve also seen honden of infinite rage display and inflict an incorrect damage counter mtga player base is among the most toxic i have ever seen in any game if someone is clearly losing they will just ride out the turn timer until they are forced to play every single turn alternatively if someone is winning they will spam emotes until they final achieve wi condition fortunately there is an option to turn of emotes but it removes the ability to interact with other players i m glad there is no text or voice chat built into the game i think this game would benefit from some some sort of player tier system perhaps based on win rates for the player i m not sure what the best solution is here something else that i find more stupid than anything else they have a yes no system where they ask you if you re having fun right after you finish matches what kind of horrible rating system is that if you re winning you ll be inclined to say your having fun if you lose you ll be inclined to say you aren t having fun it s always going to encourage a biased input from it s players this way i hope they don t actually use this data to influence aspects of their game this company clearly doesn t care about it s players they only care about pushing players to purchase in game currency for random chance card packs and cosmetics for example every time you log into the game you ll have a notification that won t leave until you visit the store the store inventory holds mostly nothing of value there is no reason to spend money on the game in my opinion if players spending money is so important to the developers maybe consider offering something of value instead of pestering me with notifications endlessly a new hidden store has been added that you can win tickets through completing daily challenges however you can t spend those tickets until you unlock access to the new store of course it costs real money to spend your in game currency yet another example showing that players are only as good as their bank account to wotc i used to enjoy playing this game but not anymore it s more annoying to play than it is frustrating update 2024 06 17 i ll check in again in 6 months or so and update as needed
