2022 ksp used to be one of my favourite games the sheer joy of of finally not blowing up your craft after hundreds of failures the excitement of unlocking new parts or the sense of achievement as you touch down on a planet you ve never been before where the landing could have been disastrous in the blink of an eye then there were mods and oh my they were glorious it was like playing a new game you want to make ksp harder and be able to have your kerbals suffer in space sure there is a mod for that so many mods made a very good game great so when they pushed new bug fixes a few months ahead of the scheduled ksp 2 launch i was excited here is a company that was taken over made a few bad decisions but finally they were living up to their promises right no with the latest update they decided that after 11 years it is a good idea to push a launcher a launcher that now has to be permanently open while you play yes you kill it the process but that is besides the point a launcher just so that i can get news about ksp 2 a game which i was strongly contemplating buying now i m not so sure anymore remove the launcher tweet share or promote ksp 2 somewhere else we will hear about it and we might buy it but this shove it in your face kind of behaviour at least according to me is nonsense someone else summed it up perfectly which games need launchers when you launch them from steam none
