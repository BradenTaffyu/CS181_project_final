2023 it s like ca is trying to become worse with each new release i can t wait for another company to move into the turn based strategy market i m playing as amenmesse with everything set as default no changes and no map revealed half the hitties have declared war on me for no reason plus 5 or 6 egyptians all sending armies across the map and dessert for no logical reason marching through 12 different territories with no political side effects in addition to constant raiding from off map factions that can literally spawn armies inside my territory without notice there s no logic or reasoning to this game at all might as well be an elaborate game of solitaire it s a crime to label it as strategy it s not that the ai is dumb it s that it s nowhere near logical like the lead designer grew up in a locked closet and has no idea how to human or how to logic i don t care about logistics or local politics 4th century japan will sail all of it s troops to italy march across the alps and attack switzerland dammit and no china and korea will not take advantage of japan having zero troops to defend itself the player is in switzerland and didn t follow the diplomatic mini game mechanic we wanted them to in order to appease japan yeah let s go with that very exciting the players will love it
