2021 first hear me out i love this game i m a sucker for everything fallout ever since fallout 3 and there s some real fun to be had in this game i for one have almost 1000 hours of play time at the time of writing this review but there are some things that you should know if you haven t followed the mess of a progress this game have had through it s time first the negative stuffbugs a lot of bugs from not being able to simply fast travel at first try due to someone or even you having a mutation that s supposed to just heal you outside of battle to people read jerks being able to buy stuff that you re actually not selling this game is riddled with bugs to the point that i wonder if bethesda s team actually know what they re doing when they try to fix something and inevitably brake 5 other very unrelated things it gets messy real quick most of the worst bugs have been fixed by now but it s pretty common to read of new features let s call it that being added to the game every other week the game does not run very well on anything other than windows 10 os i suffered quite of problems namely stutter issues when i had a windows 7 install and then i moved to linux only to find that after a few weeks of perfectly good gameplay the issues started there too i think this is quite intentional by bethesda since they were aquired by microsoft which in by itself is well known of employing some really shady mob tactics to get it s products into more computers there s nothing in this game that should technically require windows 10 or any of its features and it even says on the recommended system requirements that it fully supports 7 8 and 10 equally well i can say that it does run fairly smooth on windows 10 but not on any of the others linux w proton included so consider yourself warned now the good stuffthe community this game has one of the nicest communities you ll find in a game especially with this low of a reputation servers are usually filled with people that are very noob friendly and will go out of their way to help you on your low level tasks i had some really good social experiences just by finding strangers and commenting on their camp trading this is where f76 really shines in my opinion when you re done with the main wastelanders enclave and brotherhood questlines you ll be fairly high leveled to start some trading with other high leveled players there are quite a lot of trading forums with a reputation system like reddit s market76 and the trading discord server you re bound to have some really good experiences the guns the last good point in this game is in my opinion the guns the vast majority of weapons have a very good feeling and are very fun to use the gunplay is most excellent for a game that is considered more of a rpg nature so if you re willing to accept its flaws f76 can be quite rewarding and fun to play but its good moments are not enough for me to recommend new players to get into only venture into this game if you like me really and i mean really like fallout
