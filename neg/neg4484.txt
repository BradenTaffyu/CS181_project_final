2023 tl dr the game is addicting but all of the win conditions feel empty and generally uninteresting to progress they also almost never intersect in and interesting or rewarding making game progression unrewarding unrewarding gameplay tied with an obnoxious amount of micro managing makes the game often feel like a chore after the first 50 or so turns dlc and civ 7 announcedconsidering this is the 6th game in the franchise you would expect some finely polished gameplay but most of what the game shows you is crap the game over complicates so many basic aspects by just adding more but the majority of content is so inconsequential to the outcome of your games after a while you ll start learning what few government policies that are actually worth looking at and the few important strategic resources worth hoarding the game has 4 technically 5 different victory conditions and honestly none is particularly well designed religion is so op brain dead and fast that i easily got my first win with it despite not knowing what i was doing culture is slow and exceptionally tedious forcing you to micro manage a bunch of units late game i assume because the devs thought more apm more depth both of these conditions have the same problem where they don t have any progression at all past round 50 once your religion is established and apostles unlocked circa round 50 religious gameplay remains the same for the next 300 500 turns science is technically the same as religion and culture where the strategy is just build as many fully maxed out building x while supplementing with the x government but it ends up 100x more enjoyable because it doesn t force you to brainlessly micro manage 15 different units letting you play with all the things on the tech tree also helps science games not feel like a drag certainly better than culture and religion but not great domination is by far the most interesting wincon as its the only one that actually has any real substantial progression which is a shame because the game does everything in its power to make a domination victory the most difficult and tedious experience possible the game rewards slow deliberate capture of territory over 100s of turns and makes extended combat a net negative for everyone involved this sounds like a good idea that lets everyone stay in the game while letting an aggressive player slowly get rewarded but in reality 99 of the time it just leads to one nation who got a lucky spawn away from any aggression getting the win because they were allowed to focus 100 on their goal whilst you and the guy playing rome besieging you end the game 1st and 2nd on domination lead while last in everything else honestly while the games problems aren t easy to ignore i still enjoy it quite a bit the big thing stopping my recommendation is the mountain of dlc required to get the true experience the external launcher and looming knowledge that development is finished to focus on civ 7 is just the nail in the coffin
