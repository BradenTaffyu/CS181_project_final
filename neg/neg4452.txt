2016 a little bit of background i ve played civ civ vi i ve played alpha centauri and civ be i m trying to like this game but as it is now i m thinking of uninstalling it the cons have been said ad naseum bad ai mid to late game slow down random unit selction ect so i ll add my two cents first no matter what size map and no matter the difficulty the game insists on putting a ton of ai civs directly next to you as i got sick of ai civs next to me my new strategy is to take their territories asap please note i don t want a domination victrory in the latest game by turn 21 i had an american scout russian scout and brazilian scout show up i kill off washington about 15 tiles away mind you on a huga map then russia and brazil declared war on me i take them both out by 860ad but norway has this huge army so i know how bad this game is for ai city spam and i ask them to stop settling near me they say ok then they spawn a city between two of my existing citites as china i was superior in technology against their warrior horde i had many promoted units but why keep playing domination isn t fun for me and yet i m being forced into that playstyle can we please stop having ai next to each other every game there are 5 ai civs next to me yet other parts of the world are largely empty no thanks second informtaion notifications need a bit of a overhaul i m having trouble seeing what ameneities and housing are needed we still have the issues of auto explore with units who will happliy walk into 3 ai units before calling my attention to it these same units will stop 3 tiles away fromt he goody huts make it so units within three tiles warn you of ai enemies i could go on but i think you get the drift bouns issues city states spam units and just move them around endlessly maybe give us some irl time per turn back by just having them fortify unless they have a need to move why the hell does the ai spam so many religious units they are ultra aggressive in spreading their religions also on the lowest levels they seem to be able to spam missionaries and apostles in mass quantites this needs to be fixed conclusion at this stage of the product i think you should hold off for a patch there are a few bright points but imo it s a ton of frustration right now
