2023 dropped a ball i ve put in a fair few hours now watched a bit of high end game play played with people who are good bad angry and somewhere in between there s a few small balance anomalies that may end up getting sorted in time but the issue with this game is that it s built around gotchas be it throwing a grenade dropping a smoke shell calling in an ability and on top of that there s raw micro if you re a 60apm person crack on this is the game for you relic openly admitted when they made this game they went straight to the top end of their community and asked what they wanted that community is filled with history buffs and starcraft esque pro s so what we got was this weird north africa italy thing 4 unpolished factions out of the gate a single player campaign that focuses on a part of the war that without reducing their importance to history is a niche within a niche a micro intensive meta the gives high dota style payoffs when you re looking at the other end of the map and an experience your average or casual strategy gamer does not associate with now you don t play 72 hours without getting some enjoyment and to be fair i did get some from it but most of the time i was just waiting for it to click and literally practising openings in single player but it feels empty there s a whole setup for coh2 style commanders and bulletins but its straight up missing rather than have a faction that you can play several different ways you end up with 2 factions that only really play 3 4 ways between them at any serious level at this price point it has no right to be this empty they should have slashed the factions in half fleshed them out properly skimmed 15 quid off the price point built up a playerbase and release new factions as dlc like they did before my email inbox has been spammed for the last 3 months about a console release i couldn t care less about the idea that this game could work on a console with its foundations of micro is absolutely laughable what a waste of developer effort it s 10 off at time of writing recommend waiting for 50 off
