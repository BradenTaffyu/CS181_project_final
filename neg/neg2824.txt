2021 this game eats your mind why do we play games i d say in order to experience through metaphor games use politics or racing or battlefields to make you feel something there should be an artistic idea behind the game some reaction it should provoke maybe executing complicated plans and foreseeing your opponent s every move chess maybe instinctive thrilling decisions any shooter maybe bluffing and calling bluff poker behind most popular games is an expressed idea stellaris on the other hand is creatively hollow it s lots of busywork that keeps you reaching for something in the future until it all just fizzles out but it sure weighs on your mind in the meantime example run that showcases the problems i created a world designed to be exciting and quick to see how the game works as a whole it s the tiniest map with 200 stars the maximum number of empires on it with maximum aggressiveness and all possible modifiers i set the difficulty to commodore moderate ai bonuses throughout the game i often wanted rationally to close the game and do something useful not work i put off things i would actually enjoy doing and yet i ploughed on gripped by the need to see what would happen next usually nothing much often i wondered how i would deal with some crisis an economy or war mistake an unexpected development only for it to fizzle out and not have much effect i would think of precarious and thrilling plans only for them to execute just as planned no panache no glory no epic fails i would welcome times of peace and prosperity only to see that it meant endless waiting for things to happen to be presented with yet another trivial decision for all the decisions are trivial next to none are dramatically significant in the early game there is an obvious way forward through expansion in random events with multiple choice sometimes you might not have any idea what either option does so you take whichever and it s fine having a lot of ships dragged down my economy so i instead invested almost everything in science combat usually means entity with the bigger number wins with very minor losses regardless of ship design details like shield armour hull considerations this makes defence trivial build a hugely upgraded starbase with military buildings and you have free large numbers science also gives your populated planets huge economies a well built planet outproduces a random star by two orders of magnitude ish so you can disregard everything but habitable planets a single big fleet can be used to get enemy stars one by one i played for 12 hours and got to the year 2315 the early middle game that s a problem of its own the emptiness in ideas is masked by lots of fluff technologies buildings etc if the game allowed shorter playthroughs you d see that you don t really have much choice that the underlying systems aren t interesting anyway by then i saw that despite some glaring mistakes i was on the way to conquer half the galaxy but the thought of actually going through that was too much so i uninstalled the game and tried to stop owning it alas not possible so here we have a working strategy it s not exactly genius it was stumbled into pretty much on first try what does it all mean does it reflect the value of science does it say something about coordination in military theory are the details there to min max it s just a big creative vacuum similarly for lore largely fluff nothing surprising or moving or even just wow so please don t play this game the money matters not what matters is time and a mind clear of bs play something else maybe something with an actual human opponent or read a book or take up sewing just anything at all with a point to it
