2022 devs got tired of updating this game so they push it to release to entice console players to buy it and anyone else who was holding out and just doesn t know still missing promised features late game has next to nothing to offer and you end up doing the same thing over and over again it s a shame because i genuinely love everything about the game but it falls incredibly short as a game it s more of the framework one that they expect modders to use to turn it into a playable game and still will fall short we waited they released a shell of a game this is pathetic for a release of a game that could have been a real beauty
