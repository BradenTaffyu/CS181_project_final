2016 ill cut to the chase and assume that most people reading this either know the previous fallout or skyrim ill focus on why i cant really recommend it to any fan of those or of the titles before that bethesda had several years to work on this and they apparently didnt do much quiet to the contrary and that infuriates me and yes i know the answer to most of the things here is mods ill get to that at the bottom of my review what you get is basically a version of fallout 3 that is dumped down in regards of choices both story wise and dialogue wise edit 7 jan 16 i have to mention this to be fair the game improved in three points though none of them ranks highly on my list you do get better graphics much better voiceovers and a larger map with more locations story dialoguesfor the story the only major game affecting choice is which factions you choose and which you destroy betray even the climatic scene is always the same no matter the faction just with different actors stitched in also the general choices the stories offer seem much more limited somehow i rarely felt that the choices available really made any difference that feeling was different with previous titles for the dialogues in previous installments of the series you could use your characters skills to make special dialogue options available a character that skilled toward science could offer a scientific solution ot a problem a strong character could intimidate others that has been dumped down to the charisma stat and a few charisma based perks you get 4 dialogue options that often result to the same reactions from the npcs atop of that whoever at bethesda thought it wise to set the dialogue choices up in a way that you cant read from them what your character is going to say deserves to be fired honestly how can anyone even consider this a good idea character building the character stats also haven been dumped down to attribute stats ranging from 1 to 10 11 and perks it allows for quiet a few builts but somehow it feels less flexible combat the first few hours in the game can be quiet tough but later on you rarely get in over your head the power of the character even without a power armor feels totally over the top supermutants no threat at all except for the occasional fat man launcher radscorpions easyly squished under your boots even deathclaws are dispatched easyly almost no matter how you skill your character as most of the perks are combat oriented and bolster your abilities the game also feels like it tries to be a fps but does so badly there are lots of invisible walls or rather rims around objects that block shots so an opponent standing behind a tree with parts of him peeking out or behind a railing sometimes cant be hit except via the v a t s system inventory they didnt change it they had years to fix it about everybody complained about it but they just didnt change it even worse as you need to pick up more items for resource and mod part harvesting it gets even more cluttered it is a total mess new things the two new things to the game are the settlement contruction management and the way they handle weapon and armor modifications settlement construction is a mess and hapazard at best you get verly little in the way of items you can build and placing them can be a real pain since they tend to snap to other items over quiet a bit of range or you cant place them because other non removeable items are in the way or because of even minor overlapping which makes combining certain wall pieces with other walls floors or roofs impossible what i mean by hapazard you can clear out quiet a bit of trash from the settlement areas to build things but some items that you should be able to remove because the exactly identical items that can be removed elsewhere just cant be removed in other spots like some car wrecks for example forcing you to painfully built around them the settlement management food water defences is totally unbalanced and also pointless once you get a certain kind of farmable fruit you only need that single one because it produces more that all the other food types with no drawbacks defences since your settlers cant die there really isnt much point in equipping them or setting up something like defensive walls and stuff the only harm attackers can do is twofold they can destroy items of the settlement but seriously protecting those by walls is more of a hassle than replacing them and steal items from the central item pool doesnt really matter if you store them in other containers the settlers themself will always get up again zombie like and continue the fight slowly eroding enemy forces weapon armor modificationwhat looked quiet good when i watched it at a friend playing it turned out to be basically just leveling up weapons so they are of use to you later on most of the upgrades are linear one more powerfull than the previous one there is a slight kind of calibration for special tasks possible but i wouldnt say its enough to make the system praiseworthy summary i am disapointed by the game overall and really angry about some of the overall design and gameplay choices made by bethesda it feels causal and not to mention lazy and shows no real step ahead rather it feels like it degenerated compared to the previous titles for me it does feel nowhere like a aaa title there are many indie games that might not be optically as good but offer tons more depth compared by what a company like cd project brought to the market with the witcher games this game is nowhere near deserving of a place among the top 5 games of the year lastly but mods yeah of course there are many many mods around already quiet good ones with which you can change the game to your likeing and i really love that but if i wanted a toolbox to create my own experience i would have gotten one and not something marketed as a game or i could have stuck to fallout 3 vegas and skyrim this game feels like the answer to something nobody asked for
