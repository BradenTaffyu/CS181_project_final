2015 i feel this game is a letdown for all those who have really come to love the fo series i sunk as one can tell by my stats a good amount of time into this game when i finally realized i just didn t have any genuine interest in playing it anymore the quest lines were simply kill cleanse repeat gone are all the storylines choices that matter and things that have made me love fo gone is the ability to make your unique specialized character basically it no longer even felt like an rpg just a fps a good fps but this isn t the game i wanted or fell in love with i didn t buy this game for a great settlement building experience or a fps experience i bought it for the experience i had in previous fo s where choices in my special attributes matter down to the choices i made in my quests this game just felt seriously empty to me i m actually disappointed i bought the dlcs blindly i have no interest in picking up the game again at least not for the near future after 70 hours i realized the game wasn t finally going to progress to a point where my actions mattered at all it would only ever be endless going to such and such to clear it out of insert raiders ghouls supermutants no complex characters no intriguing dilemmas nothing that made anything feel like they mattered to my character just the endless wastes reading most reviews i guess that s been enough for a lot of people though
