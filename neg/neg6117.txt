2021 after being very disappointed by aoe 3 i m glad to see them return to form and pump out a real aoe game there is a lot to like here but for now i have to give it a thumbs down pros nice graphics stable good pacing love the use of landmarks to access new ages and offer unique bonusescons they ruined campaign mode which is what i enjoyed most in aoe 2 the real world footage cinematics are super cringy and looks like it came straight from the history channel back when they actually did shows about history they use the same narrator for everything at least so far i ve only done english and french campaigns and it s that neutral vaguely british female voice you know the one the aoe 2 campaigns were often focused around a hero or leader like joan of arc or el cid and that s completely gone now joan makes a brief uninteresting appearance for part of the french campaign the main menu screen ui is a mess achievements and mastery progression do not always count when they should only 8 civs to pick from only 4 campaigns no scottish william wallace villagers are way too aggressive soldiers chase forever where are the unit stances at no patrol no defensive how does this game have less features then its predecessors
