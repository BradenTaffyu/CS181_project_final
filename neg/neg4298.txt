2017 imagine a situation you have 4 cities the other player has 3 will you get really upset with him and want to destroy him here s another situation you have 20 ships other player has 18 ships will you nuke him for this reason if you find my questions puzzling and confusing its because the ai in this game is puzzling and confusing you start the game meet the romans its the year 4000 boom they ll condemn you for not having alot of cities while you both just founded your first have less ships then norway you ll never be their allies have 1 more wonder then the chinese they ll hate you forever the ai in this game is so annoyingly childish that you ll end up most games wanting to destroy everyone while this isn t new with civilization the literal idiocracy of the existing ai is some of the worse ive seen in a strategy game
