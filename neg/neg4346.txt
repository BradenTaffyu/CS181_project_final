2019 civilization has been my favorite game series of all time since civilization ii came out in 96 i have really tried to like this game trying many different kind of game rules and strategies now that civ 6 got two expansions i feel it s fair to give my judgement about the game it is very likely that civ 6 is now in its final form there are two really great features that are huge improvements over other civilization games unique great people abilities and districts now great people gives you an opportunity to pick only the ones that fits to your game strategy and skip the ones that are not needed each of them now has their complete unique abilities districts finally makes your cities to expand outside the city center number of districts per city are limited so in end game you no longer see super mega cities like in previous civilizations that had every single building unfortunately those two steps forward don t save the game because there are way too many steps back the game has many new features that sure makes the game more complex like the governors loyalty grievances or tile appeal but really they really don t add any deep or make the game more fun to play you are constantly swapping governors from town to town in order to get some use out of them loyalty makes warfare total pain in the game as conquered cities often rebel before you have any change to do anything to make it more loyal civilizations are way less unique than they were in civilization v now almost every civilization is just x or x to something and one unique building unit warfare in general is way less engaging and fun than in previous civ games mainly because game mechanics are too complex for the ai it just sends few units here and there and seems to have no strategy at all in every game you see great generals and admirals wondering around the map alone doing nothing the general pace of wars is even more slower than in civ 5 because of loyalty system and slower health regeneration rates civilizations iv and v still offers far better game mechanics and they have also aged well i recommend buying iv or v if you want to jump into the civilization series
