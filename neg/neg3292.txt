2016 well yes and no as hoi3 was too difficult to manage this is too simple to be a paradox game the core gameplay is fun it is not as dumbed down as a mobile wwii game but i have to agree with the criticism there has to be a way to make a game both accessible and not dumb and too easy instead of making some clever design work they ripped the complex aspects out of it as i remember hoi and hoi2 they had also really dumb ai but it would b nice to not have them now the trade system is for me unnecessary constraining the research tree is dumbed down i really enjoy the game but just to voice support for the opinion that it was simplified too much i think they have a false image of the audience they are targeting people who will buy a wwii game are those who know that czechoslovakia had land forts on the whole border tank divisions what the battle of midway was that various equipment was not introduced in the year the game states and things like that the audience like that does not need this much dumbing down i really dont understand how hoi had a portrait for every general in every country equipment for every country while this does not have that with i suppose a bigger budget the game also makes it easy for fascists and hard for communists which is a disgrace
