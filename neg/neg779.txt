2019 the constant update and creation club is ruining this game for me and all the mods that i used and love is being outdated and is forced to be removed to run the game without breaking everything bethesda needs to just leave this game alone already this game has been out since 2015 stop the damn update leave it to modding community to fix your broken game and let us enjoy what fallout 4 can really be thank to the hard working people and the community modding this game to make it actually enjoyable keeping things up to date fixing the numerous crashing bugs and especially doing it for free this is the only reason why people are still coming back
