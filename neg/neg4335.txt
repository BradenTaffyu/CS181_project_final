2017 punishing your players for purchasing the game on release at the 60 price point you keep offering a 50 discount on deluxe but have yet to discount the individual civ scenario pack prices which are ridiculously high to begin with and there s no way to upgrade to deluxe once you already own the base game despite it being cheaper to rebuy then to buy each individual civ scenario pack literally makes no sense you re putting players who support the game earlier on at an objective disadvantage business model
