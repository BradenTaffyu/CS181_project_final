2019 early access review pros massive realistic open ended world multiplayer can be really fun levelling up is very rewarding variety of items and crafting easy to mod wide variety of mods to choose fromcons game has been in early access for 8 years now with no end in sight development moves at a snail s pace took over 7 years just to implement cars into the game only a couple types of firearms in the game you have to mod in realistic ones no end game or story progression at all you either die or get bored and quit extremely poor character customisation they are working on this in the next patch won t hold my breath no npcsstory you are immune from the airborne strain of the zombie virus that infected virtually everyone in rural kentucky beyond that there is no story you can hear on the tv radio as the virus progresses which is well written but when the save reloads the story restarts you ll hear on the radio its day 3 of the outbreak when you load in even if its actually been a year in game since you started the game maybe just a multiplayer bug gameplay loot take care of your basic needs and either build a base or find a remote location to stash your loot there are massive amounts of zombies everywhere its a gameplay mechanic obviously but its baffling to find hundreds of zombies roaming empty farms in rural kentucky or thousands of zombies infesting a tiny town with less than a hundred houses in it the story states that this is ground zero and the zombies are pushing the perimeter so are the zombies breeding or something you can adjust the number of zombies in sandbox however that can make the game very boring graphics the graphics are similar to the original sims which is about 20 years old the devs are in the process of implementing animations but right now they are extremely basic most animations are just a progress bar as you stand perfectly still things get done after 8 years of development this is unacceptable even if they are now finally getting to it sound something as simple as sound effects are completely forgotten in this game the devs implemented effects of non existent npcs screaming in the distance but watch as your character gets scratched bitten and eaten alive without making a single sound the game will play the same few tracks over and over again until you get tired of it and turn off the music all together epic heart racing music as if you are being swarmed by zombies will play when you are at home alone reading a book with no zombies even remotely nearby conclusion it s easy to say give the devs a break they are a small team and its made with love but that s totally unfair at this point proper sound effects can literally be added and coded into the game files in less than an hour its been 8 years the time it takes for anything to get done is comical the lack of end game means you ve wasted countless hours surviving just for nothing to happen any longer ultimately this is a dev team that had an amazing idea and then started raking money in and became extraordinarily lazy and complacent i would not recommend this game in its current state check back in another 8 years though it will still likely be in early access
