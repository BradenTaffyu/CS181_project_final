2023 this game is worse than payday 2 it has a good foundation but then they decided to make the walls and roof out of pure and utter the first problem is the progression there s absolutely no point in completing a heist anymore since xp is gained through challenges this means you just have to focus on completing the challenges and not the heist money is useless as all you can do with it is buy weapons and cosmetics but once you buy those then what you can buy c stacks but those just give you more cosmetics you ll very quickly hit a point where there s no point in completing the heist there s no more prestige system any more so why am i levelling up anyways the second problem are the heists each heist has the exact same layout the only thing that is different from run to run are the collectables when i spawn into the bank heist on pd2 there s a small amount of variation you can get a different vault door spawn but in pd3 the vault door is always in the same location likewise for every other heist in the game the last but certainly not the least problem is the matchmaking and it being always online no crime net or server browser really kills it cause how in the am i supposed to know if these people want to do a heist stealth or loud and i especially love having to wait to get into a lobby instead of looking at the server browser choosing a lobby and instantly connecting to it like i said at the start this game has a good foundation the core game play loop is mostly fun the gun play is amazing and the heists apart from variety are well designed but you can t just look away from the glaring issues this game has the replayability is really low compared to pd2 and you d think it d at least be on par if not better than it s predecessor but it s not
