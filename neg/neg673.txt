2022 ok so imagine a game where you have to roll dice you have to roll the dice 48 times before you re told what the win conditions are and on your 48th roll you get told if you rolled a 6 on your third roll you win otherwise thanks for wasting 45 minutes try again that s this game it doesn t matter how good you are you have to be that good and rnjesus must smile his blessings upon you and you don t know if he has until much much after the point where it has been decided and then if you win once with each of 4 different sets of dice you get the real game revealed to you if you manage to then play the game standing on your head without ever letting the dice fall off the table while you roll and still pass the win conditions from roll 3 when they re told to you at roll 48 you then get to roll the dice one more time and anything but a natural 20 loses the game is the ultimate time wasting bait and switch so if you like a game that will sometimes often make you lose through absolutely no fault of your own and have you start over from scratch this is the game for you
