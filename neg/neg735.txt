2017 i loved bethesda i love fallout my first hour into this game was great but now i already have the most powerful armor in the game and have already killed one of the most powerful monsters in the game with ease 6 hours into the game i started getting bored the dialogue wheel was extremely boring so i modded it so i could see what my real dialogue options were this made things marginally better so i continued to play the game 10 hours in i was bored again this is not what i expected since i have over 300 hours in new vegas and still love playing that game so i modded the game some more almost 12 hours into the game and stopped playing it for almost 2 months while i played some other games decided i would fire it up again and now there is a 50 gb download after checking reviews and websites i find that the creation club and a massive hd update are being downloaded cool about the hd update not so excited about the cc part after reading the reviews fired up the game after the update and my character is unplayable because of the mods i had installed this game took up over 80gb of space on my ssd so i uninstalled it to make lots of room for better games thanks a lot bethesda biggest waste of money i ever spent on steam
