2021 i was going to wait till after christmas to see if this was going to get better but with down right frustrating stuff going on here nah this needs to be done now this is abysmally annoying compared to the first i ll start off with the pros paleoboteny is now a part of paddock building itself very welcome very nice good step up automation on the park vehicles is a lot better now for the most part slightly bigger maps though it may not seem like it where 1 s were stretched out into long thin lines these are all compact and lumpy looks pretty good again the added colours are most welcome as 1 just had various shades of green and i m running it max settings on a legion 5 laptop at about 50 60 fps over 60 on some of the smaller maps some more customisation to the buildings love this that s about it and now onto the cons and this hurts because it outright proves they arn t listening to fans atall there are no cosmetic prop options now minus rocks and those rocks can be placed with some control but must have large gaps between them i am outright sick of this random placement mechanics bull crap on things too it s almost as if they think people have no imagination and can t do it themselves i know for a fact several posts have been begging for more trees fallen tree logs old busted ingen things did we get any of this no because the stars are the dinosaurs and you made the dinosaurs boring again edit there are some decorative props added to place around in the guests area of the park in chaos and sandbox modes however there is still absolutely nothing for the paddocks aside from some trees there are over 300 shrubs in the game and they gave 7 pointless needless stuff added into both ranger maintenance and dinosaur care dino ill tranq and send to vet broken leg send to vet grazed knee oop it might make the dino a little disgruntled off to the vet for you for a grazed knee also why oh why do i have to go look at the dino s every 5 minutes to know if they are ok i can see them yes hello one is waving their little claw at me but i have to send this guy in to get owned by you now i mean its not like the movie had movement sensors mics and cameras in the paddocks to keep tabs on that kind of thing no none of that not like you don t ever see muldoon on one in a park where they have spared no expense smacks head on desk frustrating fuel and food system now it s actually a bit harder to make money in this one fair play was far to easy to get in the first one to offset this they give you less while making you spend way more on keeping all the sub stations fueled up the vehicles the food prep its absolutely pathetic so many things are not explained until the last minute it s to late lets have an example unrest it does not tell you what this is it doesn t pop up with a little box when you hover over it there is no first level tutorial to help you through the new things when you are just about to hit a sabotage event then it tells you what unrest does then it tells you you need to keep resting them up and spending out more to keep your scientists happy too so more money time boring boring you are working with dinosaurs and you are complaining ill do it for free oh and you need to build a staff building before you can do that no ai or time spent on the dinosaurs outside making them look pretty again no personality quirks no random fights no actual logic just top trumps once more i even put this in my last review for 1 they are just for show and nothing more oh and don t expect to have fun putting different dinosaurs in with each other anymore they now absolutely hate each other and you have to make sure you don t gasp put a sauropod in with another sauropod i mean who d have ever thought 2 kinds of sauropod would like each other huh you know they outright knew they lived together right frontier i kid you not i used to love making a long neck paddock with all of them big huge one i can no longer do this because apparently diplodicus insulted brachiosaur many centuries ago and have a long lasting vegi hatred toward each other this is beyond stupid incredibly boring short campaign you no longer get 4 5 things to do per island anymore you no longer get any of the factions vying for your time what you do get is one thing to do per mission and most can be completed in 20 minutes mission 4 is an absolute joke build aviary make pteranadons happy you are done wooo you can breath in an out have a cookie that one takes 10 minutes bad callbacks to 1 all 3 of the department heads return for some reason they don t say hi they don t have a chat with all the people from the first its like it never happened poor entertainment dude just about gets to say oh yeah hi im alive and dua the worst one gets an entire mission devoted to her annoying contradictive hypocritical voice you ll find out when you play basically all her dialogue from 1 is a joke now horrible banter between claire and owen everyone hated finch i liked finch and he had some funny dad jokes i now miss those dad jokes because i have these 2 hollywood designed morons split apart again and smashed together again like an 8 year old girl playing with barbie and ken no thanks combining buildings i hate this i liked more buildings to use and play with not combining them up especially after you made me get used to one way of controlling them threw it all out and went backward nothing of worth is really unlocked in campaign or chaos modes that s right those dinos skins and pre order bonus you spent out for yeah all locked behind challenge mode and can only be used in sandbox no doing a little achievement to unlock a new skin in campaign or indeed anything else sandbox is where you get your customisation now challenge mode is where it s all at now the worst one out the lot so basically there is no point playing the actual game or chaos till that is done no thanks i actually hated challenge mode being forced to rush and do things quickly makes me tune out why oh why would you make a game that you have to spend time on quick to complete and then shove in timed challenges 1 s were more balanced weirdly enough are you afraid no one is going to play it unless it only lasts an hour now do you really think people s attention spans are that small oh look a compy hehehehehehh same thing happened with terraria really addendum i no longer feel guilty due to sheer frustration here is more chaos theory is boring and artificially extended to hair losingly frustrating point mission 1 and 2 jp and lost world acceptable though basically just a small grind mission 3 boringly quick and can be completed in about 15 minutes mission 4 outright it artificially made harder by everything being more expensive tornado s that glue to the most your park paths they can and finally mission 5 stare at some dinos sell everything from the old park and you are done thanks for the 60 pound idiot new edit they have been deleting comments left right and centre on their posts including a funny one i made getting way more points than their posts were getting they didn t like that they are also making sure the negative reviews don t show up because they have 3x the amount of up votes compared to the positive reviews which mostly consist of hurr hurr dino go burr so now i not only mark down the game but i m never buying another one of your products frontier you are truly disgusting if that s how low you have to stoop to make yourselves look better also if you are a 10 year old child coming here purely to say how much i need to die for not liking this game then your comment is gone and please stop adding me to try vent your frustration thanks
