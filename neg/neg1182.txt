2016 it s a great game don t get me wrong but as a fallout game it fails in all the categories that matter tl dr only buy it if it s heavily discounted like the game of the year version for instance otherwise you are far better off playing new vegas and fallout 3 with all the many mods available for them right now and now the wall of text the cons voiced protagonist dumbed down dialogue this is an understatement of course just imagine if your favorite rpg had 80 of the dialogue choices cut and you ll get an idea of how bad it is empty world with cardboard npcs barely any rpg elements to speak of disappointing main story because just like skyrim the factions have little real choice within them and you ll always feel like you are on rails when interacting with them even when you do something alternative which translates to a unfulfilling ending like ordering your most beloved burger only to get a bad version of it because the real cook was out of town extremely repetitive radiant queststhe meh the settlements normally this would be a strong plus but then you realize you don t really care about the world enough to invest the time building things not only that but because of how cardboard like npcs are your settlements feel even lonelier the more people there are in them when 10 settlers repeat the same lines over and over again and the interaction is shallower than in an rpg maker game you can t help but wonder why do you even bother companions they are interesting who doesn t like valentine or curie but the interaction with them is so extremeley shallow they ll go into repetitive mode way too fast the good power armor if there is one thing i ll remember about f4 is how good the power armor feels to use because it finally feels like a vehicle instead of just a thicker piece of plate armor better shotting feeling which is then promptly made irrelevent by how boring and repetitive quests are the way the institute looks i like star trek enough to let it slide the main story up to the point where you get your revenge and get outside the building in a scale from 1 to take it back i d give it a solid 8 but unfortunately that is the highest point in the story and it s free fall right after that conclusion i ve already sinked over 300 hours in the game so i can t say it s a bad game but because of how disappointing it is as a fallout game i cannot recommend it when the previous games are so much better if you can get it very cheap in a year or two then it will be worth the 10 bucks for the 100 hours you ll get of fun out of it but right now do yourself a favor and play replay 3 and nv instead heck you can also play the first 2 games as well they may be very retro but the still hold up to this day once you get used to playing in the 90 s
