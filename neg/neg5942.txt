2017 gotta say this is probably my favorite game ever paradox really did a good job in the design and features in the game then why the heck am i giving it a thumbs down because paradox is a broken company dlcs aren t worth a fraction of what they cost most of these features should be included with the base game look at the europa universalis iv collection bundle up there yes you re reading that right 193usd not to mention that most of that isn t even new features but rather reskins for different nations and their militaries which aren t even included with their respective major dlcs a few examples of paradox greed highlighting the best feature in their dlcs and cost 15 dollars to create custom nations in el dorado 10 dollars to look at the great powers in rights of man 14 dollars to watch a timelapse of your game in mare nostrum 20 dollars to transfer occupied lands to allies in art of war 15 dollars to improve city development using monarch power in common sense fix your policies paradox until then this review will be staying negative
