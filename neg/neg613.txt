2019 soooo disappointed in this game the dialogue is fun and obviously has a tongue in cheek approach to gaming which is fun but the combat is awful everything is about crowd control be prepared to have between 3 and 7 adverse effects on your character at any given moment stunned blinded on fire crippled poisoned addled everyone can cast multiple spells so it s just a round robin of watching everyone cast 2 3 spells per turn and the most important stat for every character is wit so that you can go first since the first one to crowd control usually wins every combat starts out with your characters bunched up and the enemy appear all spread out so if you can make it through the multiple aoe spells your first turn is spent moving so the enemy get a second round of attacks and you haven t even dealt any damage yet by now you re down to about health and are on fire and poisoned as well as being slowed and or crippled oh and don t try to counter the aoe effects as everyone has multiple aoes that reset pretty quickly so they can just chain them combat will take up about 90 of the game as the best thing to do is start combat see where the enemies appear then reload spending time reposition your team just outside of the encounter so you can be in the right spot swap around some armor and gear to maximize your armor types start combat realize your archer can t attack as there is a pillar in the way reload move archer 2 feet to the left start combat realize you put your physical damage dealer next to someone who has high physical armor and not the one with low physical and high magic reload move characters again start combat combat lasts 20 minutes spend 10 minutes exploring until you get to the next combat save rinse repeat
