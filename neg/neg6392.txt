2023 short disclaimer it s not a bad game but there is no middle option between recommend and not recommend for me to choose and i wanna at least give new people a bit of insight before they buy it now i have played this game probably for the longest time out of all the forza horizon installments however to me it still feels like a mixed bag heres why 1 it just feels like forza horizon 4 the previous games all had different improvements over the game before fh2 added a bigger open world fh3 added better car customization and even bigger open world fh4 added seasons that change the world in a quite unique way but what big and impactful feature got added with fh5 offroad tires on every car local weather events that rarely happens while it does have some smaller qol additions overall fh5 just seems like a sequel or spin off to fh4 and not a new installment of the main series 2 the carpark honestly feels pretty empty despite being massive if not bigger than the previous games some manufacturers are missing like lancia or abarth or sometimes just some stand alone cars like the 1966 chevrolet nova but on the other hand we got a bunch of super cars that all look similar and arent very unique so you essentially end up with a carpark that is bloated with generic vehicles and doesnt have many that stand out while this is mostly a personal gripe someone else might disagree with it still gets quite boring when you add new cars to the game you have either already seen in other games or are just an expensive trim of an existing car with a better engine speaking of adding cars 3 the new cars that get added with seasonal events once again probably just a personal gripe but it might still be orth mentioning every week the developers add new cars to the game however for the last few months those cars were a bit of a let down you got stuff like an amc javelin which was available in previous games then you got a cadillac limousine which was also in previous games theres also the rimac nevera which is just a rimac concept two that drives differently but hey theres also the cadillac ct5 v and the ct4 v in the same season which look similar you get the point the recent series rewards are kinda bland although it does look better with the current series may 11th 2023 so who knows what the future brings however its also important to remember that all the problems with the carpark and the series rewards could very well just be licensing issues the reason why there is no lancia or fiat isnt because the developers got bored of it but because the license ran out but i dont have behind the scenes information so thats just an assumption 4 the map ima be honest im not a big fan of the map does it look good yes does it feel good ehhh as big as the map is it honestly feels pretty empty overall there arent that many memorable places apart from a few towns and maybe a few natural formations another problem i have with the map is how small of an impact seasons actually make in forza horizon 4 theres actually a decently sized difference between seasons with winter being all snowy fall with the red leaves and wet streets but in fh5 you could show me an ingame screenshot of the environment and i couldnt tell you which season it might be even if you held me at gunpoint maybe the focus with the seasons was more the localized events like sandstorms or heavy rain but i feel like those barely happen and even then they are localized you wont notice them if you are on the opposite side of the map 5 i have heard from some people that the game also has some issues with the dlcs multiplayer lobbies performance and some other things but those are mostly things that i havent experienced yet or arent big issues for me if you wanna know more about those probably better to watch some videos about them or read some articles or something i cant give much input there with that being said why should you get fh5 then if it has so many issues well those gripes are honestly just things that i personally have issues with and some other people as well and it still has some nice qol and can get you some hours for the price if you dont care about the mentioned issues and you want more of fh4 or if you just wanna dip your toes into the franchise then you might enjoy the game otherwise you might wanna save your money for something else or buy fh4 instead tldr the game has issues no doubt the map feels pretty bland the carpark feels empty and the series rewards feel boring overall a pretty stale experience once you reach endgame and start to run out of things you can do do i still recommend it despite those issues ehhh its essentially more of forza horizon 4 if you enjoyed that one maybe buy forza horizon 5 when its 50 or more off otherwise just stick to fh4 instead
