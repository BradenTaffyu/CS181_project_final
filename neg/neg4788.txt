2022 house flipper is a lovely game one of my favourites until the devs get slap happy with updates i have experienced glitches and roll backs in the past with this game when i ve had to redo a house or two but this last time is over the top the last update cause me to lose all progress in the game dating back to november 2020 i write this in october 2022 many houses the castle the island home city lofts and boat completed and sold all gone 700k euros profit gone the five houses i kept because i loved visiting them too much to sell them gone right now i have 3 houses that i own and have access to in the game one i ve had to refinish a couple of times already but the game has 2 of them listed as sold because that makes sense the reality is none are completed even though i completed and sold them over a year ago others are saying they ve lost massive progress and there are all sorts of game breaking glitches going on it s a nice game but the devs really need to pay attention to testing their updates before throwing this stuff online without paying attention buy this game only if you re fine with starting over and over and over oh they are offering a fix to get your work back but they admit it may not work it didn t
