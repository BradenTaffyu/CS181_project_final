2022 as of right now i cannot recommend the game due to a security risk the developers recently added featured mods which downloads a zip file from their server which contains xml and image files this would be fine if the developers were using https for communication but at this point they are refusing to do that due to it being too complicated and requiring too many libraries this is 2022 it is unacceptable to use http for a public facing service that downloads content to a user s machine it leaves the door open for man in the middle attacks mitm they proposed doing zip signing instead but that will not do any good should a mitm attack occur resulting in a malicious file being downloaded recall that there were exploits in the past that only required you to download a file not interact with it but simply download it and the exploit relied on a vulnerability in the way windows explorer handled icons even if signing was used all it takes is a vulnerability to occur in the signing verification or even the extraction of the zip file or perhaps one in the xml image rendering library the game uses to pwn your machine should all this change and they actually switch to using https then i will remove this review but in the meantime if you do want to play the game do so at your own risk you ll likely be fine but the risk is always there edit 2022 12 16 the domain they use for promos still doesn t support https edit 2023 11 10 so i wanna address a few things because some of the folks commenting here seem to be misunderstanding loading the game up without any user interaction at all before the user even gets to the main menu a call to the following url is madehxxp promo teardowngame com promo php version commented out the replaced tt with xx so that no one accidentally clicks it what gets returned is a link to a zip file in plain text that the game then automatically downloads and extracts in this case it was hxxp promo teardowngame com 2023 11 01 zip again replaced tt with xx so no one clicks it without any interaction at all without even downloading a mod simply just launching the game it makes an unencrypted thus interceptable on unsecured networks such as public wifi networks and let s not forget that because of things like laptops and steam decks and whatnot that the possibility of this is greater than 0 because it s not unlikely that someone might decide to go to a coffee shop or something with their gaming device and play a bit of gaming while they wait for their order or whatnot request through http and i have confirmed this with wireshark all it takes is someone intercepting that request and sending a spoofed response with a different url or hell even running a rogue network that points the promo domain to a different server to send back a malicious zip file and this is possible because with http the client doesn t need to validate the server that is responding because it s unencrypted once again you literally do not even have to interact with mods the featured mods button on the menu or do anything at all besides launch the game if you don t believe me open up windows explorer navigate to localappdata teardown look for promo txt and a folder called promo delete both of them and then launch the game but don t do anything and then look at the folder again you ll see that it will have recreated the folder and file you just deleted without you ever doing anything to prompt it to redownload other than just launching the game hell if you open up promo txt you ll see the url and you ll see it is still using http i can understand how some people might think it s not a big deal but when a game gives you no control over disabling it from phoning home because that s what it is doing it s connecting to a server that is controlled by the developers to get information about featured mods and it s not even doing that over an encrypted connection it s a ticking time bomb just waiting for someone to get hacked it doesn t matter if the developers hand pick the mods themselves they feature that it isn t the problem the problem is the request is not secure and you ll never truly know if the response you got back was truly from the server owned by the developers or a malicious third party who did a mitm man in the middle attack on your connection and yes they still aren t using httpsedit 2023 11 19 checked the latest version and to the surprise of no one they still aren t using https you d think with all the extra money they re charging maybe they could afford to spend some time to actually implement secure communication in something that is automatic and can t be disabled by the end user
