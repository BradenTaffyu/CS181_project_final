2015 2024 we have returned by request due to new management for gaijin 8 years later with an apology and all returned missing items but we still chose world of tanks and world of warships as they are just cleaner and graphically better and the first to do it for many things so there is that we will still leave our review from 2015 2022 but good things come when trash is removed and a good company takes control abuse of people due to race has no place anywhere prior 2015 and 2022 review below when under prior ownership status from 2015 not current 2024 load of insert bad word here game is good but their customer service just ruined it and completly justified the complaints you read on the web it took them a year to mess up and for us to have our first brush with disaster after ignoring the many and i repeat many complaints reviews stating warthunder has no respect no effort blown off lack of responses without reading the initial complaint ect ect lest we abstained and still gave them a year of my money and time like always the review crew spends our time getting to the truth being fair to both sides of the coin but now the dragon rears its ugly head and we had our first problem in nearly a year 171 hours and you will be entertained more with our writings that follow than the game or customer service in short we are completly done with this company and anyone affiliated with it we begin our review as we now entirely agree with all complaints after giving them warthunder three 3 months to fix a legit screen shot proven paper trailing document provided complaint request for assistance could of not had this any more obvious or proven if written in blood on a wall with the killer standing there with a gun and a sign around his neck saying he did it no excuse for reundant pathetic abuse of people with proven and legit reasonable request s then to degrade us when they warthunder were out of options we thought ok its time to give back to us for being so helpful and devoted in providing everything and anything requested even if it had nothing to do with the request we provided it for months we tried to help warthunder to help us patient super nice people that just got screwed worse than a hooker at a five and dime could not believe the huge loads check my hands of money we have spent and sadly and then the comprehensible holy f ck what a word back to the story while away for a week with my son being born truly freaking exciting past the point of pee we returned as many do after many missed updates 9 to be exact in 2 weeks we return to find all our money gold and coin items planes and tanks gone along with all experience and funds just a blank account now to be fair there was a post saying some updates had data dumps ect just send us a screenshot and proof and we will do this and that ok so we did account not compromised black and white proof of purchases no acitivity on my end and they did nothing did not even bother to read the complaint responded with requesting this and that and then redundantly doing it over and over with nothing to resolve in the complaint so what was a legit complaint now has 8 more things piled on but now they expected us to go away so we asked and pleaded stated we had proof and sent it more times over than you see boobies on tv we received a reply that was for the lack of a better word s mother explative explative after all the pateince and respect fulfilling request after request for over a 3 months while unable to play listen people you can dress a turd and call it chocolate but its still sh t it was their warexplative turn to do for us three months enough i believe it is reasonable not to ask any more repititious questions and cater to them we said there is nothing more we can send you that we havent already a week later we were returned to an email bearing the surreal we dont care if you leave your a bumb ass american and we have a million users that spend money goodbye dumb american from sergi so now we research and got attorneys looking into things because of the email they reached dead end after dead end with the same name coming up as the sole person responsible located in russia explative few more dirty words and gestures and then sad face there is no need for that unprovoked bah mr karma we hope checks this review many times over and pays sergi and the team behind him something with anal beads super glue and oral suppositories should do it proved what we read from others and didnt believe for over a year being fair like we always are always two sides to the coin but in this case and thousands of others the complaints just keep mounting and are more turthful than oj simpson bloodsicle saying he didn t do it for hunger so we call all the numbers we could find to discover one person sergei stupid mother f cker for short handles all their usa complaints as the big man ok so nothing i can do or say but sorry i was born in a country you dont like here s a gun use it as a toothpick you racist pig in closing you would think on the business side here is a great repeat customer legit to our requests patient and proved they had all securities in place proven no activity on the account from anyplace on the globe and provided what we had and spent over the past year from their wtf own records so lets give these items back to him and figure out where they went but no not one reply had anything to do with our request but because he from the usa wow just no words while they have the loose one wont break the company mentality those who supported their game and company for a year and still giving them a chance i would chose to support my good loyal members wherever in the world they may be because they chose us no excuse for racism or worse business is business and proof that is black and white from their own servers and to deny that with stupidity is not even bad business it is intent sorry i am in the usa not all of us deserve to be treated stupid for trying to come here and build a better life for our families russia is not all bad but this dude yea one bad act do not judge them all just don t enable them by spending your
