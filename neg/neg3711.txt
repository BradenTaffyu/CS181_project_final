this is 85 the same game as it was in 2014 that 15 difference is significantly worse now than it was then the rest of the 85 was good in 2014 but it s not 2014 anymore they didn t finish the game my best guess is after a decade of clear mismanagement they finally ran out of money if you look at the update history you can see they just decided to release the game and renamed their alpha 22 release to 1 0 this isn t a case of omg they finally did it no no no this is a case of them finally saying it release the thing they are taking you for a sucker telling you this is a finished game worth 45
