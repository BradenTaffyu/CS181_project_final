2021 early access review 8 years of development and no player hosted servers that have been in warband since launch basically modding tools only for single player since you cant host a server you so why make mods for multiplayer who cares if thats what kept warband alive all these years and people still play to this daymultiplayer balance is to the point of if your not cav why even play a horse takes so much damage to kill that you shouldn t even bother trying to kill it just aim for the rider and hope the messed up hitbox of the riders sword spear misses youi can only play single player for so long because its the same game every time just a different faction why did you even bother making a new game if you didnt want to do anything with it
