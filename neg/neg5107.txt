2017 this review sucks to write because i have had fun in the game however ca needs to charge 134 92 tax usd for a completed game is unbelievable i have seen many reviewers attempt to defend ca by stating that they have put a lot of work into the game and work cost money and to this end i do agree that i do not mind paying for additions to the game such as expansions yet for tw warhammer instead we get three 8 addons that should have been part of the original game an example of this is that the elite units that you get with two of the dlc the ai can use if you just buy the base game this means that these units are already in the game you just must get past the pay wall this kind of thing needs to stop and thus i can no long support ca moving forward until this issue has been remedied other games that took much more time to make such as almost any rpg come out at 60 usd i m not saying that i don t want to pay for work but the work must be there for me to pay and in this game 134 92 tax is not there
