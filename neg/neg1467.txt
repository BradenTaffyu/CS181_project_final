2023 this game should be renamed non stop basic medieval warfare simulator with emphasis on the basic i ll try and just hit the bullet points the game had the rpg diplomacy system gutted shortly after early access started by making all character relations clan based so all of the actors they are proud of are hollow beyond what warband had even clan relations barely matter unless you are making your own kingdom or trying to marry someone within them forget making individual friends who would join you for battles or vote your way on councils its all empty their basic answer to the snowballing problem of previous games was to simply make war on the player s kingdom constantly and do away with peacetime activities rather than expand them to make a good ebb and flow to the game you will simply get bored with the constant fighting long before you ever see your kids come of age controlling your troops is akin to a babysitter simulator unless you use meta setups that exploit the ai aggression versus certain formations the addition of elite troops is poorly implemented and should have had real limitations put on it both for player and ai on map sieges make no sense with the way siege engines work so there is no point to waiting to build trebuchets and catapults the castle assaults are just two armies going at it but one has a wall to stand on it still doesn t play well the influence system doesn t give for influence within kingdom politics regardless of how big strong your clan gets and there are low hard limits on how much influence you can spend in decisions you also have no real ability to sway other clans to vote your way so kingdom decisions are trivial you can keep your army going almost indefinitely later in the game with decent influence generation and you ll need to since the fighting is non stop they pissed off their modding community so the game won t get half the love the previous game did i can t speak for the pvp of the game its maybe worth getting on sale if its below 15 if you want to swing at ai for a bit rather than real people so long as you don t have better games on your list to buy
