2017 i love this game i used to tell all my friends it was an example of f2p games done right recently however it s started running on windows startup without permission and without the option to stop it even using msconfig i uninstalled the game but the launcher is still hidden in my hard drive in several locations i have no idea why they ve suddenly decided to become malware but i won t be reinstalling any time soon
