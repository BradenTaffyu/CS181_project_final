2018 due to one sided decision of developers dictating that only one play style is right way to play that is only playing on limited area withing limited expansion with taking consideration what you take or playing tall as common saying goes i am not recommending this game at its current state i recommend rolling back by one step and waiting a patch before buying the latest expansion this is purely my personal opinion but while restricting blobbing snowballing expansion is absolutely right and necessarry thing to do making expanding either completely impossible or criplingly restrictive tl dr can you please make it so that we can some way either make every core territory a state with time and investment or make converting core territories possible even if it took bit more time signed player who likes to play wide
