2018 stellaris has a lot of potential could became a great game but after 2 years of release is a boring slow game and full of bugs strategy is minimal no strategy in battles and little strategy in whole game and ai is terribly dumb i am not against 2 0 revolution but i wish to have a bug free decent ai strattegy game stellaris in its current state is good only for paradox fanboys
