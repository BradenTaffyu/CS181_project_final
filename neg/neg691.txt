2018 i have a difficult relationship with fallout 4 i absolutely love this game modding it to no end fine tailoring the game to any playstyle i fancy at the time and going full ham on it but this here is the problem i ve spent 300 hours on this game and have enjoyed it mostly but we ll get to that and if you asked me a year ago i would reccommend it despite not meeting expectations of prior fallout fans and understandbly just for the insane amount you can mod this but now days fallout 4 is broken as hell and all because of one thing creation clubi m not going to focus on the controvercy of creation club there is plently to look if you want the full scoop on that but my main gripe is how creation club forcefully updates itself every month onto your fallout 4 that doesn t sound to bad right maybe a bit unexpected but hey it doesn t hurt right no no no it does and it s completely destroyed one of my oldest playthroughs firstly everytime creation club updates it breaks f4se a lot of people unfortunatly know and experience this fortunately f4se keeps itself up to date every month however you ll also need to update any mods that use the script extender thus it can be weeks before you can play your full modded game again and if the mod auther has stopped working or discontinued the mod you re out of luck and the cycle repeats every month second creation club clutters your load order this may sound like more of a nuesence but this is what royally screwed me up fallout 4 is only able to load a total of 255 mods including creation club and dlcs before it will start randomly knocking out mods and acting strange to keep that 255 because i wasn t prepared for this months update it lead me over the mod load and completely reset all my quests on my main character and also deleted all companions items and settlements as i had everything in the mechanist lair fallout 4 is a game made fun by modding it a year ago but now with creation club playing it has become a chore of maintence fixing it every month with time that i m gated out of the game until f4se updates and after enduring it for so long i have finally grown tired of it regardless if you agree with creation club or not these problems need to get fixed or the very least addressed as it s been months now and we re just repeating the same cycle of having our fallout 4 s broken by updates and being unable to play with mods
