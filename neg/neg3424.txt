i have a 4090rtx a 5800x3d and 32gb of ram at 30 000 population i have to turn graphics to medium to stop the screen from jumping at 58 000 population the game is no longer reasonably playable i jump across the screen when trying to move my traffic glitches down the road turning the graphics on low make this even worse for some reason i had to stop playing almost one year in it should not be this bad the game is enjoyable until it forces you to stop playing 9 8 2024 update with the new patch i came back to my 60 000 pop town with the entire map unlocked and have now increased its size to over 100 000 so maybe the patched helped my issue i also turned clouds off in the settings as of now no more jumping around just so i can complain about something i do have thousands of people walking around my sidewalks and they cause a lot of traffic jams at cross walks there is also what feels like a thousand taxis driving around very disproportional for a 100 000 town
