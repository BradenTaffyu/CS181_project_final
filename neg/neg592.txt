2018 i really wish that steam allowed us to rate games on a 1 10 scale rather than a pure thumbs up thumbs down rating i spent a lot of hours on this game but i didn t finish it to me that s the ultimate cut off if i grow tired of a game before actually completing it i m giving it a thumbs down i enjoyed divinity 1 and played the original divine divinity so expected to like this game there were some improvements over divinity 1 the inventory system is more streamlined you can look at all of your character s inventories in one big screen instead of having to swap between characters in addition you can use an item or equip an item with any character from any inventory i also somewhat liked the storylines of the pregenerated characters better than in divinity 1 but honestly other than that i liked the first game much better both games have an issue at least this is a problem for me others might not be bothered as much by it that if you go the wrong direction you end up facing enemies that are too hard in several areas you end up having to test out different battles to see if they are doable at your level i have mixed feelings about this it makes levelling feel meaningful but something like this feels more in line with a dark souls game than more of a standard rpg i don t particularly enjoy having to go back and see if i can do a fight yet 3 or 4 different times as i level up but as to specifics about divinity 2 to touch on my last point the areas felt really unbalanced as i mentioned already you have to test out battles in some areas to see if you can do them yet in others not so much for example act ii for me was a constant situation of trying to find the one area i could actually make progress on since everything else was too hard then act iii wasn t a problem at all i never ran into a fight i couldn t handle then act iv and this is the point that i just lost interest there s a part where you get ambushed in several different spots by monsters that are higher level than my level as well as the level of everything else in the area keep in mind i d been attempting to complete every quest along the way so i should have been at least close to the highest level i could have been at by that point i was also playing on normal difficulty and have a lot of experience playing these kinds of games i know how to use terrain split party etc i also disliked the change in how skills work from divinity 1 to divinity 2 divinity 1 had a novice adept master system for learning skills once raised your skill level to a certain point you could learn a certain amount of skills from each tier the higher level skills also had level reqs and had long cooldowns divinity 2 changes all of that instead it uses source points which are kind of like non regenerating mana points starting with the mid level skills all of the powerful skills require source points to cast some as many as 3 points from a rpg standpoint that does make sense that as a sourcerer you would need source points to cast skills however as a game mechanic i found it to be really annoying after each combat you basically have to either travel back to a place where you can refill source or cast a spell multiple times with each character out of combat to regain these points so that you can keep using these skills and in many cases these are the exact same skills arrow spray for example from divinity 1 that didn t require source then and in fact were used by your characters in that game who were source hunters so after even a bit of thought the whole concept that they are sourcerer skills kind of falls apart the divinity games utilize elemental combinations to create effects fire freezing electricity etc in combat divinity 1 did a good job of this but this is another area in which divinity 2 changed things for the worse in my opinion div 1 had a good amount of abilities that caused elemental effects but it wasn t everything and it was relatively controllable div 2 has so much that quite literally after almost every combat the entire area is just a giant lake of cursed fire it s not so much that this is deadly it s just not as clean of a system as in 1 where you could set certain areas on fire in a more controlled way in that game for example you could create an area where enemies would have to cross that would quite often significantly damage them before they got to you this game perhaps because it s so easy to just set everything on fire the actual fire damage doesn t really feel significant and really makes the whole thing kind of pointless this game also introduces magical and physical armor to the health system basically each character and enemy has a certain amount of magical and or physical armor most attacks are considered one or the other type and will hit that type of armor first before they will damage the health of the target there are two reasons why i found this system to really not be an improvement first a standard party will have a mix of damage i had a tank melee fighter a ranger and 2 wizards the wizards did almost exclusively magic damage and the other 2 did almost exclusively physical damage most enemies have both physical and magical armor this creates a situation where you are almost always having to knock out both types of armor on enemies or you have to split your damage to 2 different enemies which means you can t focus down anyone very fast in addition to this almost all secondary effects knockdown stun charm etc don t work at all until you ve broken through the type of armor that blocks them this made those effects much less useful than in divinity 1 where you could immediately crowd control someone in a tough battle in divinity 2 since you have to break through the armor first by the point where you could cc someone it s often almost as easy to just finish them off making that whole aspect of combat which was a big part of the first game much less useful in the end i got tired of continually having to reload because i stumbled upon something thrown in my path that was too hard bored by the inability to use skills without having to constantly refill my source points and just lost interest overall i m sure plenty of other people who aren t bothered as much by these mechanics would enjoy this game but it wasn t for me
