2019 do not buy this game if you are a long time fan of the franchise or even just someone who loved civ 5 you will only be disappointed and end up playing civ 5 instead i have sunk over 200 hours into this game just hoping that i could find a way to enjoy it like enjoyed previous civ games but it just plays like a different game many of the features that made civ 5 so much enjoyable are simply not in civ 6 unless you spend 60 on dlc and that still doesn t bring it up to par such as golden ages and world congress and i won t even go into the information collection and usage that you have probably already read in other reviews bottom line is civ 5 is a more fun more complete more visually pleasing game buying civ 6 is spending 60 to realize that all the negative comments were accurate and then leaving one of your own to warn everyone else from making your same mistake i speak from experience
