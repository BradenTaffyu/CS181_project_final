2020 this is the first game in the series and i have played them all that didn t leave me satisfied i am particularly off put by the absurdly priced dlc they continuously offer that adds virtually nothing to the core gameplay every game i play is the exactly same regardless of what new civilization or mechanic they add to the game so why would i pay the price of a full game for it and now they are charging 40 for a bunch of random civilizations they plan on adding over the next year i m sorry but if you are giving this company that much money for something that should be more in the range of 10 well you must be better off than i am that you don t mind throwing money away please stop supporting this company
