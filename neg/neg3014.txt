2018 i really liked this game in the beginning i bought it when it was released after watching some gameplay and thought it looked great i d binge this game and then not play it for a while however every time i came back to play it my previous saved game would no longer work there was a warning message saying my previous save was no longer compatable with the current version and i d have to start over because the developers had changed the game drastically this most recent update was a bridge too far for me the game is no longer what i paid for i normally love paradox games i really enjoyed stellaris too until this last update but they really dropped the ball on this game in my opinion there is little freedom in how you can play the game now with the hyperlanes you have to play the developer s formula for the game and not create your own it s space it should be an open environment to play in and do as you please i wish they would ve just released a sequel with the current changes that way we had a choice in whether or not buy it and play this new style i will be more cautious in buying paradox games in the future because how they have handled this game it s unfortunate what this game has become
