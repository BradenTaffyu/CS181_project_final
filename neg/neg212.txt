2022 the 7 0 legacy of the sith update is possibly the most player hostile update i ve ever experienced in any mmo i m not sure who ea bioware is trying to appeal to with this expansion here are some highlights one hour of new content eff you your effort and time are meaningless the amount of conquest xp needed has doubled from 50k to 100k but we ve removed a bunch of the ways to earn conquest because as previously stated eff you the only way to earn endgame gear is through the most boring unpopular quests raids although now that it s literally the only way to get lvl 80 gear maybe you ll actually be able to find raid groups with 7 0 we introduced a ton of bugs that people on the test servers have been complaining about for months and never bothered fixing btw eff you i m probably missing a bunch of stuff but i ve been drinking since the update went live and i m upset that one of my favorite games is dead rip swtor i ll miss you
