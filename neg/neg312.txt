someone once asked me what is your greatest defeat recently i had to update my answer to getting me and my friends to buy this trainwreck disaster of a game if i could refund it for us i would i ll never forget the dev clowns making posts on twitter about how the server stability is encountering issues and then saying they fixed it when the only fix was people not playing the game because they were sleeping and then they have the audacity to release dlc while the game is still half cooked don t be fooled by the playtime half of that is waiting for the servers to be fixed
