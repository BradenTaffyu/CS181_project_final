2021 warning don t buy the game is setup to force you to pay an additional 12 00 a month after 100 hours you have major weight issues with your stash even if you have everything optimized i enjoyed the time i played but it just got to the point to were the only stuff i could throw out my stash was my best legendaries but if you are okay with paying an additional 12 a month on top of what you already payed for the game then you should have no problems
