first and foremost a game is supposed to be fun right i m new to wt only 2 months or so but i ve been fascinated by it since it was released spent years watching youtube videos on it and following updates constantly i ve recently got my first gaming pc so naturally i had to finally dive into the game i d obsessed over for years what a crushing disappointment the impossible obviously engineered grind if you don t have premium the rampant spawn camping teams that don t play as a team the blatant literally couldn t be any more so if you tried gaijin overpowered nature of anything you might face on the russian tech tree particularly t34 s of any kind not unsurprising considering the importantce the image of the t34 holds in russia this game simply is no damn fun what a letdown i m done
