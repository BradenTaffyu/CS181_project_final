2022 early access review i ve played this game across a good 4 5 alphas and it still lacks so many quality of life things and has nonsensical choices the devs make because it s what we want twitch integration being the biggest one enemies still clip through walls doors and even sometimes still fall through the floor and hit you through it i had a zombie clipped through the floor where i couldn t see it and it was hitting me repeatedly so i m slapping the floor thinking wow this is a first invisible enemies nah it s just a crawler in the floor for a quest which by the way i couldn t get him to clip out of the floor and the prospect of day 1 destroying a floor tile with 5khp sounds as dismal as it would ve felt to do if you click in your crafting menu to craft anything too quickly it ll instead craft one of whatever you last chose sometimes things just disappear for no real reason my husband and i on multiple occasions have randomly lost glasses if we swap between them i could actually go through and rattle off a few other bugs we ve seen while playing over the years that still occur to this day but that s enough of that for now next we ll talk about optimization or what you would call optimization if you were a first year college student sorry frankly i couldn t care less that you guys think your game which has all the visual flair and effort of a juiced up minecraft server doesn t need to run well on higher rigs but most people pay money so their games won t run poorly it was cute in a16 not really though but maybe instead of making excuses you guys could make an effort to not have memory leaks and a myriad of optimization issues this many years in now if you re still here and reading and think ya know i can handle all of the things you ve mentioned i wanna buy it don t the game lacks any type of replay value realistically past building big bases or running around willynilly killing things you can do quests for traders that go from tier 1 to tier 5 now i know most people aren t going to play like they re a seals team six and get to tier 5 quests in the first 10 days but even after that there s nothing to do but the same thing over and over and over loot kill uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh don t die you can try different weapons but ultimately it s the equation with a different variable that has little effect speaking of weapons they add garbage like twitch integration to a almost purely single player game and spears still suck they ve never felt good once in the entire time i ve played and not because they aren t my preferred weapon they have zero going for them outside of range btw alpha 20 tho so maybe they ll add a way for me to use zoom calls integration or something who knows with these people edit so apparently they added gamespark in a19 and it ll be here till the game releases it collects specific data about gameplay stats like what skills you took at certain levels what killed you etc that in and of itself isn t a problem but there s no way to opt in or out zero transparency is bad enough but things like this have become common place in video games and it s bad imo either way you cut it
