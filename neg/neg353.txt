2022 lots of fo76 criticism are made by peoples who have either never played the game or played like 2h years ago but as someone who tried playing it on and off since it launched on the bethesda net platform and have put around 300h now so i can safely say that the game isn t that bad but my god is it tedious to play which is a shame because there s a lot to love in 76 it has the best map of the franchise an amazing art direction ton of loot and quest and everything but its all for nothing because once you get past level 30 unless you grind and pay that 1st sub the game will constantly fight you want to play it like its fo4 and just have fun exploring the wasteland and doing quests well once you hit level 30 most enemies turn into bullet sponges your crafting become much much more costly on ressources and at some point the main quest will straight up force you to grind events to progress basically once you hit level 30 and until at least level 50 when the level scalling stabilise the game go from a fun adventure in the appalachian wastelands to pure tedium and once you hit level 50 it show its true colors and turn into another mmo grind job with dailies and challenges and a pseudo battle pass and trust me there s much better mmo s than 76 out there
