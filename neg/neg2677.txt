2016 wait for winter sales by then it will be patched more and be cheaper right now stellaris has several fundamental problems sectors ai diplomacy to name a few and it is still being patched regularly the swinging balance changes makes me question whether even the developers know what they want this product to be there is one other reason to wait and that reason is mods mods are hands down the biggest reason to buy this game there are several total conversion mods in the works including starwars star trek warhammer 40k mass effect stargate and others unfortunately none of them are finished yet but they undoubtedly will be by december wait until winter sales you will enjoy the game a lot more then i will update this review in december when stellaris has been patched more note i have 525 hours logged in ck2 and 246 hours logged in eu4 also this review will probably get downvoted to hell by paradox fanboys doesn t mean it s not a valid review
