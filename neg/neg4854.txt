2018 i ve played total war games since the original medieval back in 2002 when i was just a wee lad and continued to enjoy them as they progressively got better in the series rome total war was a classic followed by the very good medieval total war 2 however something happened in that time period following medieval 2 and the later installments i began playing paradox games and sega began to pursue some of the worst aspects of modern game development now i can t get myself to even start a campaign in this game the battles have never looked better and with the addition of monsters and magic with the warhammer theme its really livened them up i love the attention to details of the units the different counters for different types introduced by warhammer and it fits great into the tactical battles however if this were merely a game about tactical battles with maybe some kind of simple warhammer dark crusade style campaign thrown on top of it i d be happy with it for maybe 40 bucks or less instead total war has always had its main meat in the grand campaign so of course this game came with one supplied and sadly it just fails its shallow and whats the worst part about it is it continues to get more shallow mtw2 had more complex diplomacy than wh2 and every grand campaign in wh2 is just a blob thy neighbor attrition fest there s no sense of factions or diplomacy or coalitions war has no cost unless you start losing and unlike in many paradox games there s no cost to non stop expansion and warfare there s no sense of spreading resources thin or using too much manpower or grabbing too much land and pissing off your neighbors by affecting the balance of power either concentrate on making the game entirely centered on battles or actually try and add some meat to the grand campaign until then i ll just start a new game in eu4
