2022 early access review this game has made almost 0 development progress since i bought it two years ago game is filled with numerous bugs nobody wants to create mods since every single hotfix which all change practically nothing will break every mod until those mods are updated now the game goes on sale while still in early access this game has been a massive disappointment
