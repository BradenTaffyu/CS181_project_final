2018 tldr basically fallout new vegas and even fallout 3 to an extent are better games than fallout 4 fallout 4 is more like call of duty than a fallout game fallout 4 is the star wars prequel of fallout games fallout 3 nv you start off with a pistol fallout 4 you start off with a free suit of power armor and a minigun and a companion no power armor training required in fallout 4 you should definitely play fallout 3 new vegas if you haven t otherwise anyone who has played enjoyed either fallout 3 or new vegas will be disappointed by fallout 4 not worth 40 for the base game and whatever i paid for the terrible dlc at all total ripoff the rpg is non existent long version this is the worst fallout game ever the commonwealth wasteland fallout 4 s wasteland is nowhere near as good as the capital wasteland in fallout 3 and brotherhood of steel s story is just a straight copy of fallout 3 a game i found more fun than fallout 4 fallout 4 s story isn t as good as new vegas fallout 4 has a linear story line compared to new vegas and new vegas had way more story choices look at the many different ending cutscenes for new vegas in fallout 4 its just destroy institute or save institute and thats it the minutemen railroad brotherhood of steel story ends all the same institute is destroyed whereas fallout new vegas the decisions you made in the mojave wasteland affected your story and the ending cutscene you got like for example the mr house ending and end cutscene is different with each playthrough fallout 4 doesn t improve on fallout 3 or new vegas at all even fallout 3 s ending was different depending on whether you were good or evil and certain story choices like putting the fev in the water purifier or sending sarah lyons to activate the water purifier fallout 3 isn t perfect but its far better than fallout 4 also fallout new vegas s factions have conflicting ideologiesfallout 4 ditches the karma system the skills system reputation system from new vegas disguises faction uniforms from new vegas copies and doesn t bother to improve the companion system from new vegas the end cutscene is nowhere near as good as new vegas and atleast fallout 3 had a different good evil cutscenes they changed how power armor works and give you a suit of power armor and a minigun for free at the beginning of the game and a companion in fallout 3 and new vegas you had to earn your power armor by getting training not to mention changes to the perks system and special and gutting the dialogue system every conversation ended with a yes in new vegas you could kill literally anyone oh and making your evil decisions in fallout 3 like bombing the citadel in broken steel for example not matter at all since the brotherhood of steel from the capital wasterland are here in fallout 4 and every conversation is a yes the new dialogue system is essentially yes no which actually leads to a yes anyway sarcasm and a question fallout 3 and new vegas s dialogue systems had more speech options and were better fallout 3 s wasteland was so much better new vegas had even better locations better quests you could actually be evil oh and the dlc in fallout 4 is so terrible far harbor is the only half decent dlc worth buying the rest of the dlc is crap nuka world is over in a second if you want to be good and its just replacing the minutemen with raiders so just basically you can now have more settlements except they can be evil the story is terrible and makes no sense as well like the characters for a start danse finding out he is a synth and then carries on hating synths makes no sense and he is still loyal to the brotherhood and hates the institute makes no sense since hes a synth himself and doesn t change him at all what sane parent from the 50 s would want to destroy oppose their own child by siding with the other factions let alone join raiders from nuka world and if shaun did care about our player character the parent why was kelogg hostile to us and him and his synths trying to kill us also why doesn t shaun care about our opinions why didn t shaun send synths to help guide the sole survivor to the institute since he ordered the sole survivor to be released and why are wasteland synths hostile to us since we are inevilably father s parent sole survivor being the parent of shaun father why wasn t shaun father saved with the cybernetics that were used to prolong keloggs life why doesn t the synth courser recognise the sole survivor as the parent of shaun known as father when we try to get a courser chip during the story why is there a chinese submarine still in boston 200 years after it nuked boston still armed with nukes after 200 years and why would our character help the chinese submarine captain ghoul at all why would the chinese ghoul responsible for nuking boston stay around for 200 years if the chinese captain is truely remorseful for his actions what has he done in the past 200 years since he nuked boston to make amends for his evil actions did he stay in his submarine for 200 years and as far as i can remember nick valentine doesn t become hostile or angry at all if you raid acadia either with the institute or brotherhood of steel btw the game essentially ends after the institute is saved destroyed in fallout 3 we got to go and see explore how the story decisions affected the wasteland like whether to put in the fev into the water purifier or sending sarah lyons to activate the water purifier and broken steel added more quests afterwards like the aqua cura water seller quest if you complete fallout 4 with the institute you end up as the institute director and nothing happens aside from synths appearing in diamond city and boring repetitive radiant quests similar to daily quests in wow there isn t any explanation of how the commonwealth is affected by your decision afterwards and the game is essentially over you don t get to play as the institute director or advance it or anything in new vegas factions have conflicting ideologies and opinions of the future of the mojave fallout 4 cause of conflict is basically just maxson hates synths thats it no explanation given or ideology or says what direction the brotherhood would take the commonwealth in most of the games locations are related to the settlement system and there is only 1 city anyway fallout 3 had megaton and rivet city and so many interesting locations the game revolves around a linear story line the side quests are easy and not that interesting at all also fallout 3 had more memorable side quests as did new vegas they turned this fallout game into call of duty the rpg is non existent its pretty much the star wars prequel of games and the 4 different factions idea is just a terrible copy from new vegas and nowhere as good and all the factions have the same ending anyway i could go on but this is way to long anyway i recommend people play fallout 3 and new vegas especially since they will be dirt cheap now they are far better games fallout 4 is terrible compared to those games fallout 4 isn t worth 40 for the base game i paid for it and whatever ripoff price they originally said for 5 rubbish dlc far harbor far harbor was ok to be fair except for that dima memories mission my friends have all said its okish just not as good as fallout 3 even positive reviews admit that fallout 4 gutted the rpg and is nowhere as good as nv or even 3
