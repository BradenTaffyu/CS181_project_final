2022 early access review if you re looking for a second warband you won t find it here the first part of the game when leveling up going to the very early part of joining a kingdom is enjoyable if limited beyond that it becomes a miserable grind of the same fights with no interesting kingdom mechanics or varied ways of playing the early access has been 2 years and it looks like this is all the major features we ll get so don t buy hoping it ll get better all around i would recommend it if it were around 20 pricepoint but definitely not more and it doesn t deliver the dream everyone had for the game maybe someday this forgettable disappointment will be out of early access hell
