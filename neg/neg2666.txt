2019 great game except it slows down to be being unplayable late mid game on a medium sized galaxy across multiple machines i have i cannot wait 30 seconds to tick 1 month when it takes a year to fly across a couple star systems note the game starts at about 4 seconds to tick 1 month it s even okay at 10 seconds for 1 month but there s no fun in spending an hour on a play session that should have taken 10 15 minutes please fix this paradox it has been broken for a year or more and i check every so often to see if it s better it s not i will love to purchase more dlcs but i can t justify it with the performance issues note the performance issues came as new features changes were added to the game
