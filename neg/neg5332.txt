mtg a needlessly loses advantages from paper magic and refuses to successfully take advantage of features it could implement as a digital adaptation while being very out of touch with the community things lost etiquette most paper magic is played at the kitchen table not tournaments or game stores most people play magic in an environment where everyone has consented to spoken or unspoken rules of etiquette having a deck that s 80 removal and board wipes aren t against any rules per se but would be challenged in many casual paper games even in game shops if you consistently and purposely play a higher powerlevel deck against others or are just playing over competitively and sweaty in general you can typically expect those other players to not want to play with you anymore irl there are consequences if you break rules of etiquette in mtg a there are not remember when i mentioned having a deck with 80 removal that deck is actually encouraged by mtg a because one of the daily challenges you can get is to remove a large number of your opponent s creatures it actually doesn t matter if that deck is unable to win because you get far more in game currency by fulfilling that challenge in as few matches as you can than you ever will winning that same number of matches if being matched against someone optimizing that daily challange sounds unfun that s because it is it s all highly cynical both ranked and unranked matches play out the same with most of my wins being concessions because my opponent didn t draw their game winning card on turn 3 5 most of the randos treat me like an annoying npc that is simply standing in their way from receiving more in game currency constantly spamming good game when i don t concede fast enough for their liking and why shouldn t they when the game goes to lengths to dehumanize players in the match pools by disallowing direct communication and then putting digital bounties on our heads this is one of the reasons i tend only to direct challenge friends even when this locks me out of a lot of the game s content through win rewards including exclusive cosmetics i would ve gladly paid real money for but was not allowed to you can do daily challenges with friends but not win progression if you ever pay for the battle pass like i unfortunately did you will realize that if you don t play and win against rando matches you ve quite literally lost out on your money s worth as well it s clear that the game sees playing competitively against randoms as its primary game mode in both content and development focus however at this point you couldn t pay me to be rando fodder game formats as much as i was harsh about the implementation of matches i also understand that you can only control player behavior so much which is way the dev team s refusal to introduce teams and other 2 player formats is maddening 2 player formats has been one of the most requested feature for years and over and over and over again the only response we get is the game isn t designed for it well no that s why we re asking you to develop it we didn t ask how hard it d be all game development is hard we ask that you value community feedback enough to do the hard things to do right by us and the team most likely the management does not value community feedback that s all their response tells me they don t care about us in many places in many game shops 4 player formats like commander or even two headed giant are the norm even at my house 2 player jumpstart or sealed when me and a few friends want to open a box together is the norm it makes mtg a a really tough sell for anyone who s experienced these multi player formats also let s say you used to have a regular group for commander one or more of those people move away you can t use mtg a to play with them online like you did before it s such a let down things never gained digital only expirences wotc used to create crafted single player pve experiences that i ve heard really good things about those games are no longer developed but i feel like pve could be implemented really really well in mtg a instead of grinding rando matches for a pack exclusive avatar imaging getting that avatar by defeating the character in an npc battle you d be able to develop multiple new npc battles with each pack showcase a set s archetypes and also include pve exclusive abilities so that it s fresh and different from playing against other players and you could include a competitive element to it by having multiple difficulties a points system to reward quick defeats and other achievements and introducing a leader board and other rewards making an incredibly difficult pve mode where the npc has multiple turns and other shenanigans like environmental effects and automatic token spawn would be a real treat for all the crazy theorycrafters who like to explore infinite combos and really quick win conditions and bc ai battles are already in the engine it would be easier to develop than 2 player formats and i think would really help revitalize the game another missed opportunity is digital only cards yes they exist but almost no one plays with them because they re relegated to their own format that also changes the wording of a bunch of in print cards which really turns off me and other paper arena players who don t want to memorize alternative characteristics for cards we own in both formats but i ve heard that there are really cool experimental cards like cards that have six sides mtg a has been trying to make digital only players more and more of a things in order to monetize a new base but i don t see this working out because of all the other issue i mention in this review especially because of accessibility accessibiliy in general the poorly designed tutorial and over competitiveness of rando matches makes the game less accessible to people completely new to magic compared to being taught using paper magic especially jumpstart by a trusted friend in the hobby however the most egregious lack of accessibility comes in with disabilities even with really common and easily accommodated disabilities like red green colorblindness my colorblind friend who had difficulty telling cards and decks apart was excited when i told them there was a digital version of mtg only for them to find there were no visual accessibility settings and they would have similar struggles in both paper and mtg a a friend of mine who finds it really tiring to hold pick up and precisely move cards for long periods of time because of motor issues was also excited when i told them about mtg a only for them to learn that the game has no keybinding so they wouldn t be able to use their accessible gamepad and would be forced to use the mouse for most things making the game far less accessible in many ways since they have been able to 3d print aids for paper magic both the the options needed to make the game accessible for my friends have just never been implemented so many games have these basic accessibility and qol features the bar is so low and the mtg a team bangs their head into it with every yearly update that doesn t address these issue mtg a will promote some marginalized communities which i am appreciative of as a member of some of those groups but it makes their total lack of energy for the disabled community more blatant if you re poc come on in if you re lgbtqia come on in if you re disabled shut the up and eat your slop because they re not going to spend a single resource to make your gaming experience better or even playable this is not to say magic is perfect with all other communities but that the disparity is obvious and hurtful as a disabled person and someone with lots of disabled loved ones who i would love to play the game with
