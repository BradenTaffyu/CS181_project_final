early access review yet another ea going full release without the promised content instead putting it into a full release roadmap yall lost my repect releasing to 1 0 with a price bump in an unfinished game pretending your roadmap is free updates the fun pimps turned into scumbags like a lot of other ea games no i cannot recommend this over a decade in ea and patiently waiting for promised updates and the fun pimps are baiting people to buy it with a false post 1 0 release roadmap sad another one bites the dust
