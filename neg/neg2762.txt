2016 review for stellarisat full price i can t recommend for a number of reasons of which i will go into further into this review tl dr would be that it is a pretty shallow and though polished it is rather undeveloped and the developers have purposesfully left a lot to want in preparation for dlc spam if you want to know what sort of spam just look at ck2 s dlc list fourty plus items if i recall correctly although you can get them pretty cheap given enough time during sales it is still a hefty amount for a hefty sum at a sale price or after some updates and possibly an expansion or two stellaris could very well be worth the money spent however at this point in time it is impossible to know exactly where it will go paradox is good at making feature rich games like crusader kings 2 ck2 europa universalis iv euiv but getting there takes time some of their games have had rocky starts and have a decent amount of content others like stellaris have had thus far a smooth and stable start but are very much lacking in content the good stable multiplayer did an eight hour long game with twenty others in a group i play with without a single hiccup at all smooth as silk with working hotjoin a big surprise given how broken multiplayer is in say crusader kings 2 at times diverse selection of species unfortunantly they don t have quite as big as an impact as one might wish for more onto that later but cool designs and a reasonably large number to choose from which is always sweet you can customise your starting ethics and racial traits all species have access to the same traits sadly ethics ethos allow you to be peaceful militaristic and so on you can make your political makeup somewhat unique compared to other playthroughs only a couple are actually viable for competetive multiplayer though ship editing and customisation it s there it does the job not the most sophisticated system around and somewhat lacking compared to other games in the genre purges enslavement and eugeni uh racial modifications uplift other species and over time force them to submit to your ethics modify them as you will political map in mid to late game reminds one of games such as eve large empires can wage huge wars federations form and politics can get interesting on mp at least ai is rather lackluster and not very good at that sort of thing or staying alive either large scale number of stars isn t everything and games like sins of a solar empire rebellion prove as much but it honestly helps create a sense of awe in space the bad ship combat system is incredibly simplistic in a very bad way factors such as range not being used lrms will engage in melee like every other ship for example instead of staying at their max range and the complete lack of control over ship orders and priority targets leaves battles completely at the mercy of rng and your ship compositions ai isn t very good at countering player navy makeups if it even tries at all you can t even tell your fleet to target specific high value targets in a fleet could be fixed by moving the system to something closer to what is in endless space as the combat system does sort of emulate what is used in that game but is less complex for it lacks difference phases long range medium range melee and tactics could be fixed by moving the system into something closer to sins of a solar empire rebellion different ship types serve a different purpse lrms will sit back out of harm s way whilst corvettes and destroyers armed with lasers and short range kinetics will engage in melee sort of thing give commander the ability to pick which targets individual ships in an engaged fleet the fleet focuses on or what certain ships should focus on something between the two could be good maybe really anything other than what it is now would be better because come on star ruler 2 endless space and sins of a solar empire rebellion all do space combat far better sr2 is made by a tiny two man team in their free time and is leagues better between the customization system and combat planet classes only affect two things when you can colonise it the required pre requisite technology and the resulting habitability which affects in turn how fast pop grows which is based on your starting planet class then graphics what the planet looks like some planets like tomb worlds being special planet types are somewhat unique but even then the differences are far from significant many planets such as toxic barren or lava worlds can t even be terraformed in the late game could be fixed by adjusting what sort of resource outputs are given by different classes some should give more minerals others more energy some more of x or y tech others biased towards having more space to build but less resources and so on species and phenotype don t affect what traits can be picked only diplomacy all of them live for the same number of base years which is 60 70 years no actual advantages or disadvantages to picking one or another this means at the end of the day what you pick only affects the graphics of a pop you see every time you click on a planet fleet or whatever unless you re dealing with people who ve picked xenophobic ethos could be tended to by giving certain races unique traits more or less slots for trait adjustments different bases ages possibly with some randomisation so tree people and turtle people live longer than a human no trade systems i mean trade as in trade ships you can exchange planets map information vision alliances and resources in deals but you can t exchange the frequently mentioned by capitalist style empires trade agreements would love to be able to build trade stations and would like to watch trade ships move back and forth even if they are simply sprites for performance reasons come on paradox every damn game has this sort of thing in as a default feature yet you ve left it out ship customization is quite limited paradox should take note of star ruler 2 and their ship customization system not asking for that system exactly but it is a damn good idea and is very well executed stale mid to late game i think they ve done a seriously good job at the early game other than the above problems which only become apparently later in the game and or through multiple playthroughs i ve got a lot to say as to what could be done but it is very likely that they have intentionally made these parts stale so to give room for extra dlc at least if the host owns the dlc all clients get it they ve confirmed it ll still be the case for this game so there is that thank paradox feels quite shallow i d say it is quite shallow for i feel it has less in it than euiv did on release and many others say it has far less than ck2 did too
