2021 before reading i should first make it clear that i am not rating thumbs down because i didn t like this game 200 hours might ve already given that part away omori is one of my favorite games of all time in fact and i am going to refrain as much as possible from leaving any story based spoilers in this review because this game is and i can t stress this enough best experienced as blind as possible and when you experience this game for the first time there s no going back afterwards that being said there comes the reason i rate this game negatively this game is not for everyone and this review is primarily for people reading through the negative reviews before buying the game out of skepticism for its overwhelmingly positive feedback i don t blame anyone who does this because some people want to know if a game is right for them before buying i will run through the demographics who i don t recommend omori to descending from most to least deal breaking 1 it s just another quirky earthbound inspired indie jrpg about depression i m certain that there are a few people who think this way about games that draw similarities to undertale a game that exploded into the mainstream around the time that indie games really started to make an impact around 2015 though this is up to debate if the thought of there being a sub genre of earthbound inspired indie jrpgs or games that discuss depression as a central theme keeps you awake at night because there is a supposed epidemic of these games that are lazy half baked excuses for finished products being overrated by weebs then i d stay as far away from this game as possible omori inspires itself greatly on earthbound and yume nikki with its wacky scenarios and themes about depression respectively traits that it wears on its sleeve to many that s not a big deal it s a means to draw inspiration to a new product that does things differently in its own way in my opinion i think that classifying a game as a rip off and sign of laziness from the developer based off of surface level aspects is in and of itself a half assed excuse to not play a game while simultaneously disliking it because i just know its gonna be like every other xxyyzz clone out there i know that the people who think this sort of thing are in the thankful minority but my opinions are not here to change anyone s mind on purpose and are only here as a warning for those who are predisposed to dislike games like omori to give it a skip 2 you have little tolerance for quirky or weird humorthis game like i said earlier is heavily inspired by earthbound make of that what you will it uses a lot of weird cutesy and quirky humor throughout the game that while i found it nice enough and funny for the most part other people may find it tiring and quirky may have some negative connotations depending on the person it s true that i did find some of the humor a little stale at times but it was not very often thankfully the game never tries to be edgy and use its themes for shock humor and the humor reserves itself to the more lighthearted moments of the game additionally there are many moments throughout that elicit feelings other than haha funny that are thoroughly enjoyable however the quirk factor is a prevalent part of the game and those who may find it tiring probably wouldn t feel too at home playing this game 3 you are unwilling to take the game as seriously as it takes itselfthis one might sound a little pretentious but i felt it necessary to bring this up too this game takes itself seriously and rightfully so it covers serious topics that are not to be danced around lightly so if you might be inclined to believe that the game might not be in the right to take itself seriously in tandem with all of the goofy stuff that happens in the background then the game might not leave a super great impression on you as this game is at its best when it is serious and when these moments are taken seriously 4 you are expecting high level and complex gameplaythis game s main purpose for existing is first and foremost to tell a story through the medium of a game not to be a game that also happens to tell a story this was stated by omocat herself at the beginning of the project and it still rings true in the final game now the gameplay is not bad by any means but some who love games primarily based on gameplay and not story may come away with a few complaints with good reason this game is very easy save for a few fights that are completely optional or impossible to access in the main route of the game the game s main combat system revolving around 3 emotions in a rock paper scissors type effectiveness that gets the job done alongside this is the typical turn based rpg aspects deal damage use items buff debuff you get the idea and when you put it all together its pretty enjoyable but not anything particularly groundbreaking save for a few fights where you actually need to use your brain in addition to this there are no random encounters in the overworld and no grinding is required to get past bosses which relieves a lot of annoying aspects many turn based rpgs share however some may see this as under utilization of the game s elements which is fair enough it is a game after all i would only see this as a reason to not buy the game if you do not care about the story in games like this at all 5 you are impatienti am not looking to criticize anyone for being impatient as most people do not have ample time to play video games this is probably the most difficult argument to make and also the one i see the most often in criticisms of this game because what constitutes poor pacing and a game that is too long varies incredibly widely from person to person if you were to run through the game doing a few side activities reading the dialogue not a whole lot of sidetracking this game takes about 25 hours to complete to me 25 hours is not a long game but a decent length without overstaying its welcome playing through persona 3 4 may have desensitized me to proper game length seeing how long those games are however to a lot of people that length of a game is too long many would prefer to squeeze a game that can be completed in a shorter time into their busy schedules and for many that s a deal breaker in addition to this there is the pacing of the game that is a little weird shifting between 2 settings throughout the game with the majority of development occurring in one part while the other has noticeably less i see the most criticism toward this aspect of the game and many will feel a bit unsatisfied or bored by the pacing at first i personally had very little issue with the pacing while playing and even came to appreciate it by the end due to the design and context within the game but that s just the kind of thing that i like not everybody has to and that s okay if you think of yourself as someone who likes to see the end of things quickly but still want to see omori through to the end i recommend you go into this game with patience in mind if you are uncertain about how patient you are with a game as long as omori but all other aspects of the game interest you i d recommend playing through lisa the painful beforehand as it possesses many similar traits to omori while many other ones distinguish the two greatly but it s half as long if you liked lisa then i think you d like omori too and if you didn t like lisa because it felt too long then you probably wouldn t like omori either keep in mind that i compared these games because they test the player s patience differently and there are plenty of people who d love lisa but not omori for different reasons and vice versa tl dr love this game but not for everyone play lisa the painful if you are on the fence
