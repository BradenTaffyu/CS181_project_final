2023 early access review at the current state the game is in i m going to have to leave a negative review with how extremely un optimised the game is and i really want to emphasise how un optimised it is many crashes the constant bugs the extremely delayed release lack of communication from wildcard especially the server issues the game is simply unplayable to many my biggest complaint has got to be the contract between wildcard and nitrado forcing users to use nitrado hosting making them a monopoly this is a huge loss for many hosting providers supporting and especially creating monopolies should never be okay and with that it has lead to leave a very bad taste in my mouth now just because the studio has made poor decisions doesn t mean the game is all bad the game looks great lots of new qol changes and improvements new features and sound design if i was to forget about everything i stated previously i definitely would suggest this game to anyone who enjoyed the first ark game but not for this ridiculous price this review may change in the future but at the time i am posting this i unfortunately cannot suggest this game nor do i support wildcard creating a monopoly of hosting providers edit wildcard has updated their policy allowing users to host as many servers as you wish without a licence and you may now receive tips and donations great job to everyone who signed the petition we stood up as a community and we got what we wanted edit 2 as we continue to get more content and updates i now understand that this game studio is taking the corporate approach this being said players have not received updates that we ask for instead introducing features that the studio wants i would never have bought this game if i knew studio wildcard would quit caring about their community edit 3 studio wildcard continues to squeeze every ounce of money possible from this game adding paid dinosaurs and useable items rather than just sticking to cosmetics unfortunately they have no competition in this game genre and will continue to create bad decisions until then
