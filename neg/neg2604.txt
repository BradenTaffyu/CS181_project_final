2022 game used to be fantastic but as of about 3 months ago nothing but glitches bugs and constant crashes at this point the devs just push out reskinned content and hope that it makes up for the lack of qol upgrades the ui is lowkey horrendous the insane instability crashes every hour or so nowadays and the abundance of bugs and glitches i bet you find at least 5 in your first hour it is sad to see this game kinda start to fall apart on the coding side because the content is good and it does feel like a fun challenging experience once they get bugs glitches crashes under control 9 10 until then no more than a 5 10 watch out guys way of the hunter is looking really good right about now
