2017 just bought the game opened it up and the first thing i m greeted with screens notifying me that i m missing 2 3 campaigns 50 of the available races are locked that the races i do have are incomplete and these wonderful green icons notifying me that i can spend almost 70 dollars to actually have my game be complete wow what a deal no more purchases from me because even if this is a wonderful game the opening screen was enough to sour the experience immediately it s not just the dlc which isn t an issue with me it s that the opening screen has a slew of icons plastered on everything saying how incomplete my game i just spent a bunch of money on is that s such a feeling after just buying the game that doesn t make me want to buy the dlc it makes me angry that i bought the game and makes me wonder whether i should bother with the game at all if so much content is taken out of the experience behind a 60 70 dollar paywall it also doesn t help that you are brought to the downloadable content tab by default when opening the game edit 1 16 2017 so after a few weeks of getting some time in with this game i wanted to expand the review to include the gameplay itself and not just criticism of the dlc and how they push it i haven t completed the empire campaign yet so my review doesn t encompass the entire experience but i figured i could add more about the gameplay so the review was more helpful to those that wanted to know specifically about the gameplay overalltotal war warhammer is my first total war game though not anywhere near my first 4x game i come to this series as a casual warhammer fan and strategy fan to put it simply the game is fairly fun in kind of a casual strategy way it s worth noting though that the campaign is story light so far if you care about this kind of thing the game is more strategy focused the game feels streamlined in many ways to make it easier for someone to get into it where even though the game has a lot of numbers options and complexity it is still designed in such a way that the player not completely familiar with the mechanics can go headlong into some hot big army action and strategy and still do well for yourself the game however can be offputting for exactly that reason there is a lot of apparent complexity and many of these things are extremely poorly explained or not explained at all many times you will just feel completely lost about how basic mechanics or stats work and just adhere to basic battle strategies of flanking units or running down archers with cavalry the advisor meant to act as a tutorial for the game only provides the barest of explanations for the game s mechanics and links you to paragraphs to read on the internet that still only vaguely explain the game s mechanics to give an example of how confusing these mechanics are i will illustrate a whole range of questions i had that had no ingame answers or explanations and are things i either had to look up on the internet or there is still no answer even after looking it up does charging an enemy have a max distance how do i know what it is does my unit need to be charging for a certain amount of time before it gets a bonus or could i get the full bonus charging from one meter away does the distance you charge an enemy from affect its effectiveness how long does my unit need to be standing still to brace for a charge does failing a diplomatic proposal make another country become less friendly towards you even if it s a greedy proposal what do any of the stats specifically do it has generic descriptions for how much defense or attack a unit has or how much of a charge bonus a unit gets or how much leadership a unit has but it doesn t actually explain what any of these numbers do or what formulas they re used in so you re never making a completely informed decision regarding these stats really 2 attack doesn t tell you much since you don t know what formula the game uses to determine damage what kind of bonus does flanking actually provide is there any penalty for choosing to disengage from an enemy unit is it actually useful for my units to rest from battle what specific effect does it have when my units are winded or very tired in battle how is damage calculated what determines how quickly a units leadership erodes are my archers volleying into the main bulk of enemy army hitting my own units if i have to fire over the head of my own troops how close can they be and how likely am i to harm them if they re engaged in combat the list goes on and on there are a million questions you will not know the answer to but you can still just play the game and largely ignore these details and still do alright but i feel this goes against the nature of strategy to not actually know how most of that stuff works the empire building facet of the gameplay is alright if a bit simple once you know how it works it s nothing to really get excited over or complain about but it feels a bit secondary and just kinda there to me most of your choices are pretty straightforward gameplay issueslet me start off by saying that though i have many nitpicks with the gameplay that the battles themselves are still fun one thing that makes it difficult to fault the game in this case is that the workshop modding available to this game is expansive meaning that if there s something you don t like there is an extremely high chance that there s a mod that fixes it i still feel that the community fixing the errors of the developers is a negative though even though fixes are available for example one aspect of the game that is completely broken is the auto resolve function it is ludicrous how effective it is to the point where if your objective was actual efficiency in conquering the campaign you should almost always be using it unless the enemy has a clear advantage something is broken with the formula where if your army is bigger or has a slight advantage auto resolve will obliterate your enemies and often leave your own units unscathed to an unrealistic extent another aspect i find a bit offputting is just how durable lords can be while hero units are intended to be strong in combat it s a bit silly that they re so hard to kill when they re just running for their lives they can survive hails of bullets and arrows they re barely hurt by cavalry surrounding and stabbing them and they haul ass faster than anything but mounted units even when they re on foot titles are a minor issue where some of my lords or my emperor would acquire negative traits out of seemingly nowhere or the game punishes my emperor with fearful simply because i effectively used ranged units for a battle there are all sorts of small mechanics like this that just feel like they weren t really fine tuned and working as they should the battles and overall campaign still work fine despite these grievances conclusionthere is fun to be had in this game and it does have a huge amount of hours you could sink into it with how long the campaign is and how many mods are available despite this i find myself feeling the game is a bit rough around the edges with many of its mechanics and that the game is a bit unfriendly for people new to the series this is on top of the aforementioned aggressive dlc practices which many may find offputting enough to be wary of this game in the first place i can t recommend it but i also can t say it s a bad product most of the issues i have with it are nitpicks not game ruining flaws if the pricetag is no issue to you and you re a strategy fan this is probably a good buy for you if you re more discerning and not as big on strategy you will probably want to wait for a sale
