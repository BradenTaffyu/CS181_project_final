2023 a great many reviews so far both positive and negative seem to center around performance while it s definitely true co the bed a bit here for most people these issues are fairly surmountable if not still having enough annoying present issues like stuttering for those same users so i feel compelled to counterbalance that by listing an assortment of the the much deeper shameful issues annoyances in this sequel the improved traffic pathing would really be more appreciable if the lifepath of cims seemed to matter all that much there are distinct periods of high rush hour and low utilization but in terms of actual behaviors cims interact illogically park at location very briefly before leaving immediately sparingly or often not at all i know this is a complete rewrite of the game compared to c s1 but how exactly did water physics manage to regress this badly relatedly don t waste your money on a hydro dam as it appears to be wholly non functional for power at this point or do waste money on your hydro dam because it actually doesn t matter the game economy is opaque at best and non functional at worst i m not sure if people are correct in reporting a complete absence of logistics mechanics but it seems like colossal order have so little confidence in this area of the game that businesses industries can get by on an excess of goods being teleported freely spawned in their inventories while also potentially suffering from a lack of customers and continue for an incredibly long time without ever going out of business i ve seen a couple people successfully export goods but most people report their air sea train cargo connections never loading a single thing while other people report businesses that have no outside road connection whatsoever still remaining in business so something is seriously broken in all of this also good luck getting your commercial plots to ever level up with their ceaseless moaning for customers you will frequently struggle to maintain a surplus probably due in no small part to economic silliness for most people they probably are overbuilding services but it is regardless more difficult than it probably should be not to worry though co have effectively papered over this by giving you particularly sizable cash bonuses every time you level up in the progression system unless you ve been running a deficit with no profits and few milestones for a while you re unlikely to ever end up in a penny pinching situation this was also true to a large extent in the original game but that was more because the economy was easy rather than due to it being fudged dealing aesthetically with lots roads on terrain in c s1 was never especially fun yet here we have also managed to regress massively from ugly to looks like a geometry error even if it s not actually building on terrain has gotten worse mechanically in general as well twice as many slope errors and twice as easily sensitively quays bridges yelling it s in water at the drop of a hat for infrastructure literally meant to be proximate to water even if you get a road right on terrain there s a good chance you get stuck with a disgusting retaining wall setup etc c s2 got us all excited for increased ability to build non car dependent cities in contrast to the original then what we get instead besides small ped paths that work similar to the original is a single type of ugly wide pedestrian street that pedestrians don t properly utilize maybe due to aforementioned issues with their day to day behavior but cars do love to utilize lmao especially if you zone commercial along it like one normally would do with pedestrian neighborhoods a lot of those commercial lots will end up being gas stations too i almost can t be mad at this one because it s so whimsical further frustrating your plans for a beautiful modern and sensible urbanist city plan is the fact that it is remarkably difficult to ever push your cims into utilizing the public transit you very considerately built for them not impossible but far more often than not you ll see marginal utilization on decent routes also remember how i mentioned ped pathways streets in your quest to wean off car dependence you won t see a single bicycle on said pathways maybe that s just me personally taking offense as a cyclist but it s yet another inexplicable regression from the original game roads are as everybody have noted massively improved in almost every practical way yet often beyond what a seasoned player might expect snapping is all at once too weak and too strong depending on context zoning plots becomes a planner s nightmare as you ll draw out a grid that is composed of perfect 90 degree angles and still get misaligned plots between the roads expecting all dlc functionality to be in this as sequel is not realistic but i m gonna use this word yet again the absolute regression here in campus areas park areas district zone specialization besides industry etc is pretty gaping on release of the original basegame the hyped up district city policies system was a little underwhelming as far as what you could really do with it and it was only after several dlc that the policies menu had any flesh on its bones it looks like an absolute abundance compared to the 6 or 7 policies they ve given us here lol i ve made peace with the decision to not use steam workshop in favor of still unreleased paradox mods but that doesn t mean i don t still think it s stupid and as an imposition upon this game it s just another feeble gasp from the increasingly frail wheezing body of paradox interactive ever since they went publicly traded other cosmetic gripes there isn t even a tasteful fog to obscure how ugly the borders of the playable map are all vegetation and any non sea water like rivers and lakes suddenly visibly do not exist beyond the playable boundary as do roads they couldn t even bother with something that kind of resembles a road going off into the distance the really funny thing is i ve seen on the tampere map at least that trees can still render beyond the playable area and some scatter into it for tree clusters on the borderlines they were just too lazy to add any garnish to this area otherwise which doesn t really make you want to make use of the nearby playable area lol death by 1000 cuts so much across both major and minor functionality is either practically inoperative fairly broken or at least a little broken unbalanced inconsistent including postboxes don t really seem to work the postal system does i think just not postboxes there s a lot of issues in other systems that are flat out silly just like this road naming and what the game considers a distinct road is all screwed up i ve had entire grid neighborhoods have 80 of said grid s roads considered one contiguous road and if you build off a road you never know how radically the game will shift what it considers to be part of the old road or a new road entirely custom road names are not protected in this process and you will lose your custom names extremely easily at this rate i d rather just pretend road names don t exist anymore and hide them but hiding labels is not an option which it was in c s1 seasonal cycles cannot be disabled and you cannot simply go to a climate that does not have seasonal cycles because all maps map themes are in temperate northern hemispheric climates anyway your winter wonderland will quickly become a snowy nightmare
