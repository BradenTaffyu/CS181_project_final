2016 2021 edit this game is still hot garbage and is carried strictly by being the only game in the genre approaching playable edit decided you know what i want to play tanks again and world of tanks looks like the bigger trashfire of the two unfortunately so i boot this up find out the germans at low tier have been given multiple crutches to make up for their crippling mental deficiencies shown by the average wehraboo they ve added anti cheat that doesn t seem to realize a 3000 meter shot from spawn over multiple hills isn t suspicious the matchmaking is slow the leveling is slower and by all accounts high tier is the worst it s been all in all it s the same different year presented by the literal drunken morons in charge edit yes i m still playing this because my only other option is mwo and i ve already touched that stove i ll always miss my 9al pre ghost heat had a match in berlin spawned north side thought i d flank around wide in my m18 hellcat sticking to the back roads for the time being ideal conditions for the thing oh they ve hit my speed again welp pan camera around checking for any enemies it s realistic and i m pretty far forward don t want any surprises in my glorified armored car why is an allied t 34 85 able to keep up with me while i m going full tilt on a long stretch of road in an m18 seems legit and in no way pants on head the average thought processes behind someone who actually loves tanks and did their homework war thunder realistic mode where we took out the russian ammo s inaccuracy nerfed american mobility and gun depression didn t bother fixing their ammo to behave like it s real world counterpart still haven t nerfed russian he ammo hitting up to 2 tiers higher than it s supposed to still haven t modeled german armor correctly to represent how weird the tiger s front armor was cool still haven t fixed american aphe actually not having he filler awesome oh and the german round velocity still blows check check oh they hit the american mobility yet again still haven t fixed their armor and now their biggest strength air power has to deal with assault fuses on a plane you wouldn t bother dive bombing in secret documents showing this is how the real war went huh that s interesting why doesn t the t34 s engine explode as often and why does it take multiple he direct hits to track tanks well alright we ll roll with that huh that crew hatch deflected an ap shell at 70 meters that s new tl dr world of tanks more accurately modeled the guns in their arcade game than gaijin did in realistic go play aces high ii if you want a realistic game and go play world of tanks if you want a better tank arcade game
