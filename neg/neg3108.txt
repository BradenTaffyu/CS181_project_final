2021 i m very skeptical of most of the reviews of this game as a long time player here is the story of wold of warships there was once a fun naval arcade game where you took pixel boats out and fought each other it wasn t perfect but it was an enjoyable game all the 3 main classes destroyer cruiser and battleship all had their roles and had a good meta game destroyers are the kind of sneaky low hp guys that are fast battleships are the big slow brawler type cruiser is someplace in the middle the game was good all the main classes had strengths and weaknesses aircraft carriers cvs existed but were difficult to play and largely ignored then the cv rework happened the cv rework changed cvs drastically we now have units in the game that can sit out of range of anything with totally different mechanics that basically just ignore what is going on and impose their will however they want you can not defend against the class as anti aircraft fire is basically worthless you can t out maneuver a cv because their planes are so much faster and more nimble you can not outplay a cv player whom is not brain dead period the class is so broken if you have anymore than 1 on each side in a game it simply becomes a nightmare for most of the players basically this class doesn t belong in the game period whomever came up with the new cv mechanics is smoking moon rocks then rather admit the rework was basically just keep pushing them because failure is not an option this is only one of the major issues with the game on top of this the game is structured in such a way to cause to frustration either though limited resources or long grinding in order to get you to buy stuff i m not really against this part but after you play a while you will realize how much of this game is aimed at whales there is a non stop amount of new ships even though they are broken and not tested half the time or special events to get players to spend money on top the already aggressive monetization system i mean they have events where they release new ships a month before you can get them in the game tech trees to get people to spend virtual money to buy them ahead of time these ships cost a lot of money i ve watched people spend 150 to get a ship early there is no bounds to the amount of money you can spend on this game if you want i do not care that they want to monetize the game but high level ships you can buy cost 50 we are talking aaa game cost for 1 ship there are other special high end ships that require a resource like in xp where if you where to buy the xp to buy the ship it would cost 300 even after buying a ship then the game still screws you as you need a captain to go along with it now if you want your captain to have skills you will either have to play the captain a lot or spend a bunch of money to level them on your ship you just shelled out for if you want to level them even faster you can buy flags and camos that give you more captain xp they also basically doubled the captain xp cap earlier this year to make it even worse i guess my point it it never feels like when i have shelled out money into the game that i can just play the game i have always felt milked it feels like it never ends there are too many ways to shell out for this game you re probably saying well rage you ve played 650 hours how bad can it be look i ve played and had some fun but overall i ve had a lot of not fun watching the game continue to erode what i thought made it great in the past to be fair it could still be a great game but never will be unless there are leadership changes at wargaming me recommending this game is like me telling you to get into an abusive relationship because that is what it is i ve played this game long enough to know this wargaming does not care about the players wargaming does not care about balancing the game wargaming does not care about making the game competitive wargaming does not care about making the game better wargaming only cares about how much money they can extract from you period as long as you know what you are getting yourself into go for it but don t say i didn t tell you
