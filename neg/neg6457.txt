2021 currently fh5 is garbage a joke towards the community behind it like a certain genre of racing be it street racing or anything else have fun requeuing for 30 minutes because you can t filter in races you want to participate in let alone decide in which class you want to race custom races also have issues like endurance races with friends well tough luck the game will disconnect you and your friends before the race event starts they removed 2 out of 5 races for online leaving you with 3 misserable races to do per session including the longest races they have and forget about picking a car or tune for each race you ll be forced to use the same car for all 3 used to be 5 races the last one i can understand somewhat understand but at this point and even on a ssd you ll experience more loading times for a race than you ll be racing balance meta you can put a car in almost any race yes true but forget that you ll have a chance if you don t use certain cars or with certain tunes and of course at least half the playerbase must be mentally challenged in mutliple ways drive clean leave them an entire road of space and they still will ram you out of checkpoints or rear end you smahing you into walls with a lovely slow punishment on top of it i d almost call it the bf2042 of racing an utter joke
