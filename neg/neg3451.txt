edit 3 27 24they released the beach properties update and totally broke the taa unplayable as of right now because all the other aa options are super rough to look at it took me 5 seconds to notice taa was broken and was making the border grids and most of the ui icons like high rent etc are invisible unless zoomed way in on then they are visible but 90 transparent still my god can they do anything right anymore this has to be some kind of joke at this point how many months before they fix this i wonder probably whenever the next overpriced soulless dlc comes out original review i rarely ever leave reviews think in my 4 years of steamin along ive left maybe 4 or so but colossal order is a colossal failure truly a paradox for those of us who played and enjoyed cs1 for so many years hard to fathom its the same team behind this game i am not surprised whatsoever 30 of the reviews from the last month have been negative they deserve almost every bit of it in my opinion most of the toxicity and hate as the devs like to call it is 100 warranted we have toxic whiny developers who somehow feel as if they re the victims here my damn good pc can hardly run this crap at a population of 10k even on medium settings without dipping down to under 20 25 fps at times and that s if my save file can even last to that point without getting corrupted and crashing 5 10 secs after un pausing the simulation and no its not my pc like the cities skylines and paradox colossal order loyalists and apologists say on repeat like a broken record its this trash game still no mod support months later still has terrible optimization toxic developer attitudes that heavily reminds me of my ex girlfriend who was 2018 s queen of gas lighting traffic and foot ai is just terrible bugs galore the sim speed is a disaster particularly at higher populations it just never ends man i have 300 hours in this game spent nearly 150 of that on my last city that subsequently corrupted and went fubar causign the file to crash to desktop after 5 seconds of un pausing the sim no workarounds could bring that file back to life 2 months later i had just spent oops i mean wasted 150 more hours of my life to try another city which also just today corrupted and crashes after a few seconds of un pausing the simulation no mods this time f k this game playing with peoples time and money is a great way to make sure your company has a poopy stained reputation for a good long while if not for the thunderstore and those who tweak the files and add them to it this game would be even more unbearable and unplayable than it already is 2 cities i worked meticulously on with my limited free time for hours corrupted gone crashing to desktop immediately upon un pausing in case anyone else is also having this issue i ll tell you what exactly didn t work for me everything x removing all mods x validating game files both times it reacquired 2 files but that wasn t the culprit x launching in dev mode and removing all cars and peds before un pausing x reinstalling the entire f king game x updating and reinstalling drivers x un pausing saving the game quickly then reloading that save x getting beyond angry at the 2nd f ked up file and violently punching my training bag for 30 minutes straight pretending like it was cs2 and colossal orderi have absolutely no drive or patience to ever try to make a 3rd city again ever its over for me me and cs2 are officially divorced and its father colossal order is a d ckhead like in many real life relationships and in the same vein as real life colossal order received 70 and i got nothing but lost time and disappointment i wont be returning not even 8 years from now when the devs finally hell maybe not even then get this s t straightened out i m done
