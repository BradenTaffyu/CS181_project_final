2017 oh bethesda i love you for the games you ve made but lately you have just been treating your fans like garbage no one wanted the creation club and instead of proving everyone wrong you decided to make this thing even worse then everyone though it was going to be how the hell you managed that is beyond me fallout 4 was an eh game when you promised your fans so much that already upset a lot of your fans when you promised this amazing game and gave us something that wasn t so amazing now you re creating this paid mod system which makes you pay for mods that are already free on the nexus because why not milk your fanbase anymore right remember when steam tried doing paid mods on the workshop for skyrim remember how well that worked out and how quickly they decided it was an awful idea because everyone hated it well you re doing the same exact thing but its worse because you won t remove it for some reason bethesda no one has ever wanted this no one wants paid mods if someone wants to help a developer of a mod there s this thing called a donation which i have done a few times for some amazing modders who gave out extra content for free meanwhile you re charging 5 dollars for a suit of power armor which a modder already made on the nexus for free bethesda since you re turning into this money hungry company let me give you an honest way to make money make more dlc s everyone would love more dlc s and i woudn t mind spending another 20 dollars for more actual good content but you want us to pay 5 dollars for something that took minimal effort to make no not happening i don t know why you can t see it but this is possibly the most idiotic thing any game company has done to their fanbase and for those people defending the creation club saying it is a choice to purchase these mods i have something to say to you as well there was a 2gb update just to add the creation club and nothing else since the creation club came out i have been having frequent crashes that never happened before and a lot of my mods just simply stopped working causing some of my saves to be unplayable so not only did we get paid mods that no one wanted but now some of my favorite free mods don t even work because of the creation club thanks bethesda i love you
