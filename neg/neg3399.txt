i currently have 1 447 hours in cs1 and 171 in cs2 those 171 were just trying to make things work but mate i m done cities skylines is my one and only i love it but i can t deal with this anymore i ve dealt with my fair share of trams going on strike at stops for no reason locking up the whole network it s a bug they re dealing with it maybe poorly implemented lane control thank you thunderstore and poor inherent support of docks quays also thanks thunderstore trains waiting in stations for real life hours ludicrous flooding of elementary schools prior to their update but i can t get past the complete deadlock my surface streets have become due to the provided parking lots parking lots are a big problem because depending on the lot size they have only one or two inputs outputs and everybody wants in or out of there at the same time and with time compression and yet realistic traffic modelling that is bad news for the entire traffic network i ve built a huge network of parking lots but my result is that the parking lot jam is multiplied my entire medium sized city of 150k is jammed solid trams busses trains and all nobody can get timely into the hundreds of provided parking lots blocking every single street they are provided on at all hours of the day i decided to absolutely flood my city with subways to provide relief from the traffic no change in the gridlock i provided the biggest most luxurious parking lots for the people commuting from outside the core maybe they d want to park their car and ride the any of the 35 metro lines i ve built for my medium sized city to ride into the central core no absolutely zero usage if they can t walk to a subway station then they ll just clog all the arteries and attempt to park in one of the silly amount of parking lots across town with how this game operates i do not foresee an easy solution to this parking lot problem it is a great pleasant townscaper for small populations of up to 50k but past that the real strategy is you v colossal order there s agent based modelling like cities skylines and flow based modelling like simcity 4 agent based is great it s more realistic on the a roads whereas flow based is easy on cpu and totally last gen but if you re going to commit to completely agent based you have to realize time compression has a huge factor on the b roads in summary 171 play time hours later it s still just another paid alpha
