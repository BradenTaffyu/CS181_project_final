2018 total war has totally given up on even attempting to be historically accurate while their games have never been exemplary on this count with a mediocre job being done on historical clothing and weaponry they have at least attempted to give players a general view of what ancient warfare would have been like now that has been pushed to the side in order to gain favor with extremely powerful and influential political extremeists in the media and academia the altering of history for political ends is a troubling development when mixing history and politics one should study history impartially and then use that history to help develop their own political ideas not use their political ideas to decide history anyone impartially studying history would know that where female generals did appear they were notable because they were unusual regardless of whatever ca wants to claim the spawnrate is anyone that spends a few hours playing the game shall encounter at least several female generals possibly even over a dozen depending on what faction they are playing as when one is creating media set in a historical setting they have a responsibility to educate and not mislead the public about the period in the current year the happless consumer of historical fiction is bombarded with every kind of misconception imaginable corporations that do this are doing great harm to the popular view of history that historians have been spending years trying to improve and correct for a long time total war was among the better and more accurate historical media shame on ca for using their platform to mislead and further muddy the public s perception of history when they could have been educating them
