2017 i was original distracted by the flashy presentation and action gameplay but now i realize the entire game was insulting my intelligence as a gamer it uses instant gratification and dopamine to make you think you re having fun while not challenging you at all this is a major step down from new vegas a game that treated you like a you could think for yourself oh and paid mods that sends a clear message that all these people care about are money
