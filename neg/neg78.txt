2022 early access review this is why i wish steam had a better review system then do you recommend this game or not i love this game i keep coming back to it i keep trying new things and i keep finding what works and what doesn t and what i find enjoyable with the game but in it s current state i can t recommend it to anyone who i don t 100 know will enjoy it it has a steep learning curve mechanics that aren t explained well or at all in game or on the wiki and a tutorial that goes over the barest bones of the game experience without really tutorializing anything aside from the bare basics of game play the game wants you to learn from what went wrong and get into a rhythm of what to do and some people might actually do that the rest will go streaming to the wiki or to reddit or to youtube videos looking for help advice and tips for things the game hasn t actually taught them and that s not the best first impression for someone diving into a new game as i said i love this game i m not going anywhere but i can t in good conscience recommend this game to anyone at the current moment
