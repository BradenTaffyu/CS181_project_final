2022 there s no big apocalypse just an endless procession of little ones neil gaimanguess i won t surprise anyone if i ll say that bethesda s acquisition of interplay s fallout franchise in 2007 was one one of the most controversial things ever happened in the history of video games on the one hand most of the old fans who grew up playing the originals were pissed the original fallout was all about tons of text choices and turn based combat it was pc rpg at its best and up to this day it s considered by many as one of the very best games of its kind now here comes bethesda and says no no no nobody likes turn based stuff with too much text nowadays let s make a real time game for consoles instead and let s make it look like the elder scrolls while we re at it personally i still remember just how pissed i was back in the days and i didn t even hate tes at that point it s just you know you can t ask people who prefer tea to switch to coffee and enjoy it on the other hand though bethesda brought the whole new kind of players into the post apocalyptic world of fallout those people didn t really care about the originals but bethesda s games became their new home for many years especially while being pretty much oblivion with guns fallout 3 offered us our usual mod support that makes tes games to stand out thanks to that even some of the old farts enjoyed f3 and keep returning to it up to this day like i said it s a very controversial thing i mean who s right here who s wrong honestly i don t know personally i don t think i m ok with bethesda using fallout name to create something entirely different but you know fallout 3 was a thing like it or not fallout 4 on the other hand sigh i ve already mentioned mods and naturally everybody loves those just because they allow you to change the game in pretty much any way you want but first of all while looking on what s going on on nexusmods bethesda eventually became very lazy why bothering making a complicated game while you can just give people an open world map with mod support just let people make things and call it a day as todd howard likes to say it just works that s just the thing bout fallout 4 it s not even a proper game it s a bloody minecraft the world here is so painfully empty that when you compare it with bethesda s games like morrowind it s just sad the map in this game is so dull and empty that i just i dunno what i used to enjoy in some of the older bethesda s games is that certain exploration feeling it was interesting to walk around and look for things just because you never knew what you re going to find here there s nothing to find the empty space between settlements here is just that an empty space the first thing you saw in morrowind after leaving the very first town was that weird dude falling from the sky which instantly made us forget about the main quest and start exploring here nothing just you and some empty space insert your mods here back to mods by the way even though bethesda literally wanted us to make a game for ourselves here as long as we won t count factions there are only 35 side quests only a few armor types and all in all it s pretty obvious that nobody really tried to fill game with stuff they actually sabotaged the process first of all installing the mods manually is a pain in the butt now sure nexusmods have their own tool for that and it s totally awesome but seriously bethesda seriously you want us to do your job and you don t even care to give us tools it s ridiculous how uncomfortable the official mod support here is sure we all know the true reason for that bethesda s wet dream is to sell us mods to make people do the job for them and then sell us the results for more money hence the creation club bull we have here and hence skyrim anniversary edition they re trying to sell for the full price and that s a lot of bull guys another thing about fallout 4 is that it s small that s it you can cross the entire map in only ten minutes that s right ten f cking minutes remember the times when everybody blamed morrowind for being smaller than daggerfall well now it s just you and ten f cking minutes enjoy sure you can say that fallout 3 wasn t really that bigger and you ll be correct but see while in f3 map came with some complications you can t just cross it by walking from a to b here it s just that an empty space you start running and in ten minutes you reach the other side phileas fogg approves main story is a very short too and comes with only about fifteen basic and painfully uninspired missions so what are we supposed to do in this game well you won t like the answer because the answer this time is grinding that s right for the very first time we ve got ourselves a bloody grindfest from bethesda see in this game we re supposed to build our own settlement and it s a painfully boring process you grind for stuff you recruit the new settlers you try to convince the other territories to join and so on it doesn t sound that bad but in reality it s very boring even if you enjoy games like harvest moon and stardew valley you won t like it here especially since the ui is painfully bad and to make things even worse you can t just ignore your settlement completely just because you ll need it to unlock the final part of the main story the worst thing about this game though is the fact that the series just degenerated i mean sure in comparison with the originals fallout 3 was a pretty dumb experience but at least it tried to imitate what we had before it fallout 4 in f4 you can just forget about all that rpg stuff it doesn t matter which dialogue lines you pick up anymore and during the main story you ll only be able to use your abilities to make impact on dialogue for like a couple of times it s that bad in other words nobody even tries to pretend anymore bethesda doesn t care about the original fallout and thinks that a dumb shooter with mods is more than enough for us as a proof of that they actually asked id software to help with the fps part which was a very smart move and thanks to that shooting mechanics feel way better than before not as good as in dedicated fps titles but still it s not nearly as clunky as i ve expected but when it s about rpg stuff bethesda was like nah rpgs are for nerds let s shoot some mutants instead heck for the very first time in the series the ending isn t even influenced by our choices like what the f ck guys we just choose one of the ways and get corresponding cutscene even action games offer us better stuff from time to time nowadays what the f ck in other words when it s about fallout 3 there s a room for dispute plenty of it but when it s about fallout 4 it s a totally different story the entire thing is a disgrace no matter who you are old school fan of the originals or bethesda kind of person who enjoyed fallout 3 you won t like it in here fallout 4 is just a small and empty map with hours of uninspired grinding everything you loved about the originals it isn t here everything you loved about fallout 3 it isn t here either but you can buy yourself some creation club credits and spend them on officially approved mods because why not right
