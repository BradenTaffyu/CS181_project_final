2019 yet another good game with a trash matchmaking this game managed to fail its matchmaking in 2 different ways though i m gonna write tx a lot t1 or t7 for example i m speaking about the tiers each ship belongs to a tier from 1 to 10 which defines it s power level and also his matchmaking range t1 to t4 the matchmaking doesn t even try it won t search for players for more than 5 seconds and then it starts the match with almost all players being bots great so no pvp from t1 to t4 then you finally get your t5 ship and the matchmaking stops matching you with and against bots and actually waits for people which means the bot games at t4 and lower are intentional whew there s still one problem though you get in the game with your unupgraded t5 ship and you re matched against killer t7s they have better range speed armor damage penetration name anything good ect so yeah it s basically unplayable sum up matchmaking t4 and lower non existent matchmaking t5 and higher absolute trash great not to mention the game is p2w it s also a grindfest and balance is a joke i clearly can t recommend it pwaiting for skull and bones
