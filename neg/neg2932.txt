2018 i have been a long time player of stellaris and while i took a few months break in playing i returned back only to find myself playing utterly different game namely europa universalis 4 but in space yay not while i own eu4 as well it has become my least favourite of paradox games i own after enjoying it for a while compared to ck2 it just felt stale now this staleness has spread to stellaris too unfortunately the patch 2 0 changes gameplay in so many ways it would be adequate to call it entirely new game this new game in my personal opinion is far worse product than the earlier versions of the game i m just gonna share a few observations here from my gameplay landgrabbing becomes a thing in early game for later game expansion it is important to get as many systems as possible so that you have something to colonise later on without going to war whereas in 1 91 i built my colony within 5 years of start date of the game now it makes more sense to focus using influence on landgrabbing and building first colony much later i built my first colony like 40 years from start date of game unless set on aggressive ai is really meek edit ai being totally crippled is a well documented fact just go to paradox online forums and look up threads war system now is more crippled because of war weariness meter it is very difficult to vassalize another empire you get war weariness even for the winning battles like eu4 you now have to take empires preferably piece by piece total warfare aspect is practically gone save it for some exceptions in eu4 this makes sense but in space not really hivemind militaristic aliens getting war weariness yeah sure there is also nasty planetary force bug when my fleet bombards planet and defences reach 0 meter resets itself who knows maybe it s actually a feature edit as in comments by pipecleaner it seems to be a new feature i have mixed feelings about it it takes ages to move ships from one side of galaxy to the other if you have vast space empire spanning quarter of the galaxy you need to now account that sending colony ship from one side to the other might take few years before it reachers designed planet and other few when you start colonisation process patch 2 02 makes it even worse as dev s made it even 70 slower to move fleets now guess they are really going for that glacial pace feel huh doomstacking and trench warfare becomes a thing feeling bit defenseless because of that nasty spiritualist empire over there just use ftl inhibitor and built a big base with nice support fleet stationed with it problem solved even if the enemy manages to go through around and even defeats your base you probably have other one in line also by the time your enemy reaches third base he will probably make peace with you because war attrition i could go on about war attrition how stupidly it is calculated fleet manager is utterly useless i actually prefer managing fleets old way that s how bad it is gameplay feels and actually is waaaay much slower compared to what it was because of new starbase system planets become basically useless unless of course you need many places to build research ships and construction ships only resource you can t grab from space is unity everything else there is space so planets are pretty much useless unless you like unity with limited warfare benefits of massive fleets compared to upkeep costs don t make sense considering this new warfare it s actually better to hire mercs wanna try vassalizing empire that is at war too bad not allowed to do that in previous games you were discouraged by building your colonies too far apart because of high influence cost but now due to hyperlane system and massive influence penalties it s completely worthless endavour devs say wormholes aren t completely gone we put randomly on a map few places you cant teleport in between there is your wormhole not even close as a player who spent a lot of time with wormwhole ftl there is nothing close to that at the moment also if you hope mods bring it back in 2 0 that line of code has been entirely removed from game so no hope for ftl other than hyperlanes all in all where i would have recommended this game before 2 0 patch i now have to give it a negative review unless you really like eu4 and would like to play with same mechanics in more futuristic environment yes paradox has a product for you stellaris it s eu4 but waait for it in space yay for a next playthrough next weekend maybe gonna have to figure out how to go back to 1 9 versions 2 0 upward are terrible also shimakaze review in many ways is on point albeit more forgiving
