horribly unbalanced economy and unhistorical game play i would much rather pay 200 for a quality tank game than to deal with the devs of this game and a clearly overpowered faction let us not even talk about the fact that i am facing helicopters and vietnam war era tanks in ww2 tanks aircraft in ground battles are also incredibly unbalanced no amount of skill will save you from the pay to win model of this game unfortunately no other such game exists yet edit yes i am in too deep and no i cannot turn back now
