2016 i ve played fallout 2 fallout 3 new vegas and this without a doubt this is the most disappointing fallout to date i bought this game hoping to have another fantastic rpg experience from the people whe made fallout 3 i didn t get that instead i got an action adventure fps with an fps perk system if i wanted to play an fps i d play arma ii or insurgency or even cs go and i hate that game this is not what i buy a fallout for i do not buy it for the gunplay i do not buy it for a voice protagonist i do not buy it for crafting i buy it because i like roleplaying i like imagining what my past was and what my future will be i like creating an archetype for my character to follow with certain weapons to use and certain quests to take and do evil or good i can t be evil only good i can t make a character archetype or niche because my perks and stats will all be maxed after i play long enough hell there are only a few perks that are even interesting while the rest are simply percentage buffs that s not engaging and that certainly is not an rpg want an alright fps go ahead and get it it s pretty alright i guess more customisation than any other fps on the market so you should enjoy that but if you want an rpg play fallout 3 play new vegas play oblivion or morrowind or mass effect or even dragon age play witcher hell play stardew valley but this is no rpg and if that s what you want then this is not where you want your money going
