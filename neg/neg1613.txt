2021 early access review rtx 2080 super 64gb ram i9 intelstill gets massive lag spikes on every screen for about 5 to 10 seconds i know it s still early access but this last patch has made the freezing even worse updated drivers and checked to see if my pc is leaking memory or anything but i see nothing just not optimised or some idk not my job game works great when in battle or walking around the screen freezing just makes the game not that fun to play played an extra 40 hours and still no change even with their progress well maybe the ai is csgo level brain dead well at least in cs they can attack they keep posting that they ve made optimizations and fixed things that would cause freezes to be shorter the only thing i m looking forward to with this game is a talented person to release an unofficial patch and the warhammer mod if anyone can see this review like many other people have said do not buy this right now wait for when the game is more fleshed out and has a good amount of mods to add to the lackluster game mechanics in other words 10 out of why the is this game 50 10yoooooooooo it s actually 75 haha what a pc gamer moment tried again and it seems to have solved itself so for now i d say even though it can be very fun it is in no way worth full price right now especially since they released the game where you need mods to improve the game mechanics such as ai and diplomacy otherwise mid to late game is just a fist full of bs one after another they are seriously releasing this hollow game without adding anything besides great graphics and music you had one job lmao what happened to the extensive diplomacy or any other mechanic you said you would be adding like maybe for instance a working ai that can actually climb a ladder this is the definition of throwing an unfinished game to modders and calling it a day an absolute shame such a promising game and company has followed the actions of many other aaa titles you literally had a blueprint and years of feedback to provide something even slightly more fleshed out than warband there are literal mods that are years old with better ai than this if you aren t interested in playing multiplayer i highly recommend to just use a friends family share or borrow it from the internet not even worth 40 let alone 70
