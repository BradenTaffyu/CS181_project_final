2017 i love civ i want so badly to love this game i m sorry you ve had a full year to fix this game the loading time is still unbearable the ai is still too stupid to make games playable every interaction with opponents is fraught with basic ui errors there are critical mistakes that any player would notice in their first hour that would take any tester one hour to report and would take any programmer one hour to fix after a year this is a lazy game this is a cash grab do not buy this game
