2022 i can t recommend this game due to it s excessive grind and micro transactions the developers have created a system of inconveniences that they then offer a means to pay to get through moderately quicker the game quickly becomes more about the grind of progress the grind to unlock new content over just having fun playing a great game for what it is i want to have fun just playing this game and enjoy it for what it is but it s hard to do that when progress is so sooooo slow i feel like i m a wallet to gaijin they re dangling a carrot of fun for me but it s always just out of reach but it could be closer if i just paid them money to bring it closer it s a shame the game is really good but their profit model is absolutely broken and it holds the game back so much in my opinion
