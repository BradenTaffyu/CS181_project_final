2022 early access review single player is alright if you like walking around and doing the same thing over and over and over and over again with no real side quests just silly side minigames that 95 are not worth the time and or just really lame or events and broken economies and where nothing you do matters or amounts to really anything and there aren t really any lasting consequences to anything also the ai good and bad is really stupid even on the hardest difficulties leading to a way too easy campaign that just kind of results in a way too easy steam role where nothing you do matters to anyone not even the ai honestly they just re skinned and re sold warband but their multiplayer doesn t even work right crashing constantly and single player is too buggy and breaks too easy to mess with pvp is by far the saddest thing as it breaks every 15min or every match and the whole server crashes plus vladia is the only faction people play because xbow spam is such an op noob tube and their armor units are too cheap so get spammed plus there is no real direction or anything to the pvp mode i guess there are flags but no one really pays attention to them except the back cappers it feels like they re skinned and hyped then sold a bunch of copies and cut their team down to a fat hamster on a wheel powering their 1980s macintosh servers and dipped with the profit at first i was excited and i guess thought i was having fun but honestly i kind of feel scammed and bored loading up this game this coming from a huge fan of the series too as i really did try
