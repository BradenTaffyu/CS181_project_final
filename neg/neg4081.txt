2023 id like to give an up vote with over 800 hours on steam and over 1000 hours off steam but no body i mean no body wants your stupid yet another launcher what a worthless addition to an other wise great game seriously people why are you and every other company insistent on adding their own launcher mining our data tracking the number of players why steam does it for you plus you re now are also using unity analytics how much information do you people need to harvest we players don t want it we paid for the game leave us and our data alone it is one of the reasons i will not be in a hurry to purchase ksp2 that and the crazy eula that has mentions of things like micro transactions you can count me out as i hope many other people will ignore the hype and vote with their wallet this was something made with care and love for fun and learning until it got sold off for the greater good and ksp2 seems like it is just a twisted corporate perversion shame on certain you tubers for shilling and not pointing that out it makes me sad if you just have to play this specific game then i would say go with this one rather than the 2nd but i just can t endorse adding a launcher and unity analytics into a game that was just fine without and i really can t bring myself to early access ksp2 until i am sure there is no transactions modding is enabled and not screwed up and i d really like them to ditch the launcher there too
