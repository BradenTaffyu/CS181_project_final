2018 honestly the game itself is excellent but the disgusting business practices of paradox is why i would never recommend this game at least until paradox changes their disgustingly greedy ways if you were late to the party on getting eu4 then have fun shelling out over 200 for dlc and it s not like its just add ons that you could live without no they literally put essential game mechanics behind several of these dlc s i honestly can t think of a game with a more despicable dlc policy shame on paradox interactive
