2021 hoiv has had too many issues for too long and pdx is only concerned about them so far as they can turn them into dlcs to milk you dry of every last kronor euro dollar pound etc their updates are jokes their work ethic is a joke they have the worst moderation service known to mankind with the thinnest skins imaginable they hate hearing the truth and prefer to stick their heads in the sand or somewhere darker on their own bodies they just are not a good company and their stop start attention to hoiv as well as their other titles shows this they ignored hoiv for ages despite many complaints and reports of issues and they only started talking again now so that they can sell you their soviet dlc i don t recommend ever purchasing a paradox game again at this point in time no matter how addicting it is they are designed to hook you that way but the company does not stand by their products anymore like they used too avoid hoiv and the rest of their buggy lineup of aaa titles
