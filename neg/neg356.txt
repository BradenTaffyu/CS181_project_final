2021 i ve played through most of the game s story now gotten to level 50 gotten to the officer on deck quest and well i gave up entirely and it s because of one reason the stashbox i am convinced that the stashbox s cap was raised just to make it so you d fill it near the end of the game because if you like hoarding resources in this game like you do in fallout 4 when base building then sorry buckaroo but your box will become more full than a hentai character during a gang bang with three deathclaws as soon as it got full and i had like 20lbs of screws on me that i couldn t deposit because for some reason the junk weighs more than it does in fallout 4 i immediately realized what the true purpose of fallout 1st was to create a problem then sell a solution for it yes i know i am basically beating a dead horse at this point but seriously what the actual bethesda do i look like the kind of person who would want to spend 15 a month just so i can get infinite scrap storage the scrapbox should be free i don t care if you need to kill the scorchbeast queen 69420 times or some to unlock its blueprint so i can entirely say with all my heart this game i m done with it edit fyi if you leave a comment disagreeing with me and saying the game is amazing and your only argument for that is insults i m just gonna delete it i don t really like getting notifications from those types of people if you are gonna just disagree with me or say something i got wrong go right ahead just don t be a about it aight edit 2 i have a tendency to replay games i give bad reviews to give them a more fair shake it s a problem anyways yeah my criticism still stands even in the newer updates
