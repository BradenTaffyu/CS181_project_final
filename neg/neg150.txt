2022 early access review i love this game but this last eula update tore everything to the ground for me it s a total deal breaker the problembasically we are not buying a game in beta we are buying the beta of the game wich means indie stone could perfectly take the game out of the beta early access and sell it again to you even thought you already payed for it reading the eulaoriginally posted by indie stone s eula the indie stone is planning to continue working on project zomboid for many years to come but your purchase is the game as is rather than for future milestone builds in the pz road map if i m not wrong this was not clarified way back when pz released are we looking at a turning point where indie stone will give us a new version of the same game and to play the full version of it we will have to purchase again separately from our own licence steamthumbsdown sorry indie stone if this is how things are going to be i can t recomend this game edit1 i will continue supporting indie stone like many more of us will do and their next projects hopefully a better version of pz diferent engine im sold im sure they will yet lets not forget this is a review in wich i can recomend or not recomend this game and it s experience for my own reasons and my own perspective and i m entitled to change this review if needed edit2 i want to thank nasko for its answer as a dev i do not like the idea of a dodgy wording on a eula and since i was not the only one concearned with it and even thought at first glance understood the same motivations behind the update on that i still do not see how is this a proof of promise of obtaining a full game and why its not clarified in the text furthermore i don t agree with the choose of words and i quote do not buy a game for a promise since this is a transaction with some terms and the promise factor is in deed regulated and can be intepretated as final product ans so we all pay for a final product its in the agreement even thought we get early acces to the indevelopment product that is written in the terms again i love pz and supported since the beggining even bought it twice first was on my old steam account and gifted to many others 5 keys so far i love pz but my issues were with the last eula update and that only edit3 recap for the tl drit seems that the game developer indie stone included language in their eula that caused confusion and concern among players regarding the future development and release of the game project zomboid the developer has responded that this interpretation of the eula is incorrect and that buying the game in its current early access state does not legally entitle customers to future updates or refunds they also stated that they will not charge players for the full 1 0 release it s possible that the developer could have better clarified the language in the eula to avoid confusion and concern among players additionally they could have provided more information on their plans for the game s development and release to provide transparency and build trust with their players or at least connected the aditions to the eula followed by clarification regarding the actual state of the game and the posible repercusion of these aditions to the eula to bring clarity to the overall development noone is demanding anthing and all user from the steam platform are by agreement entitled to provide their own review and perspective of the game based on their own experience always again many thanks to indie stone for theirt atempt in clarifying this misunderstanding edit4 thanks for the community award badge
