2023 i beat the game with a friend from start to finish gave it a fair shake the whole way and can confidently say i did not like it i felt unattached to the story and every non companion character most people show up and you interact with them like 4 times and then that s it but they give their life to you the companions you don t pick after making it off of the starting island are just killed off you can replace them with mercenaries if you need party diversity but why not let them all come to the end with their cool quests it would ve made a certain moment at the end so much cooler the combat was just stunlock or be stunlocked that is not very fun or engaging it is frustrating to sit there and slowly die while stunned and debuffed to hell and not the most exciting to fight bags of health that can t fight back i built a tank and spent most of my time doing no damage and being hardly able to draw agro or protect my team i specced out at the end and found that my supporting was just as effective but now i could damage people but then the game ended i imagine that severely affected my experience and made combat all the less enjoyable so i ll admit it is my fault but dps with stun shouldn t be the only viable way to play if you do not level up persuasion and pick any other skill you are wasting your skill points that skill is necessary regardless of how high your stats are to pass saving throw type things and persuasion checks both in dialogue otherwise dialogue is constantly persuasion failed 0 needed 1 2 3 4 5 why even tie persuasions to stats then and why is a saving throw style effect persuasion i can resist mind control because i talk good a terrible system sure loremaster is needed for being able to use the random generated loot and bartering is required so you don t break the bank when you have to replace all your gear for the upteenth time but you can offload those skills to an npc companion they won t ever speak in dialogue outside of their quests and quips anyway spoilers the bossthe final boss sucked we killed every boss we fought up to that point all the way down to erasing their souls but somehow they show up summoned at the end anyway the final boss fight is just everyone is here nothing new or unique it didn t even involve the super weapon that was behind the fancy throne
