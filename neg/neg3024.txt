2017 i ll start off by saying that i enjoy this game however i can t recommend this game purely based on not being able to join a server if you don t have the dlc i have all the dlc and i will probably buy more of it as comes out but find it difficult to race drive with friends who aren t interested in the same cars as me it s also difficult to start out a championship with a group of people as you have to go through which cars someone has which car they want and which ones people want to buy making people buy cars they don t want or will never drive just so they can be on the same server as someone else is irritating and that is why i don t recommend this game
