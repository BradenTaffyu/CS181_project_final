2019 consider this a neutral review similar to my review for hitman absolution fallout 4 is an alright game it was my first experience with a fallout game and i was very excited however even as a newcomer to the series even i could feel like something was missing the story isn t very interesting the gameplay loop is pretty alright satisfying enough if that s the mood you re in however i have unfortunately little to say on this game i return to it very occasionally run it for a couple minutes and then decide i get bored after my first run through i berated my game with modifications to try and make it more interesting but the paid mods are absolute rubbish and a lot of the free ones that were on the steam mod list were pretty uninteresting far from some of the giant game sized mods i d come to expect in bethesda games like there were and still are in skyrim i have no doubt there are some great really fun mods out there but on the easy add steam list i didn t see much interesting 5 10 4 10 it s yeah i don t see myself ever coming back to fallout 4 although i m thankful to being introduced to the series i plan to play through new vegas one of these days
