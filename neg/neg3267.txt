2017 why are features that fix the base game and national focuses which could easily be modded in btw placed in dlcs nobody knows paradox s business practice is horrible and is slowly becoming ea albeit the dlcs are fairly cheap but still not worth it relative to what they offer though the game itself is neat but somewhat lacking in content don t be fooled into thinking this game is complex it isn t deep down its just a simple produce build research more than the enemy attack them game with a bunch of witty features and occasionally there are strategic tactical elements strategic knowing what to build produce basically macro tactical when to attack attacking as in the offensive actions you do in war not the act of declaring war and when to not micro if only steam could allow me to do an eh recommendation basically its a good game but the dlc policy needs to shape up
