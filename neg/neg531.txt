2023 i never expected to be writing this as a long time fan of both project moon and the releases they ve put out over the years however recent events have made it clear to me that this studio is more than willing to kowtow to the most dangerous and vocal minority given even the slightest of pressures in the firing of one of their key cg artists over a situation she had no direct involvement in whatsoever an unparalleled display of cowardice coming from a studio responsible for stories focusing on people mainly women who fight tooth and nail for the sake of their own happiness the entire handling of this situation as well as the incredibly blatant avoidance of translating official statements made on this situation in an attempt to keep overseas fans in the dark about what is going on has left me deeply disappointed in the way this game is being handled and wary of any future releases made under this studio and the limbus company franchise as a whole until this situation has been addressed i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anybody who has had even a passing interest in previous project moon works very obviously their way of thinking has changed both drastically and for the worse
