2022 if you enjoy staring at the screen while doing literally nothing for over ten minutes every time its your opponents turn then this is the game for you every pvp deck you fight will be built to negate every card you play this is essentially a single player game for whoever happens to go first you might as well just play solitaire by yourself all day the limited banned list is pretty much worthless and you will see the same op cards in every deck you go against i regret wasting time in this game
