2021 tl dr at the end i m speaking purely through my experience with the game i am not a reviewer or anything this is my opinion and you might disagree and probably will but opinions are opinions if you enjoy fallout 76 kudos to you i love it when people are happy with their time spent on x or y if only steam had a neutral score it s what the game deservers is fallout 76 a good fallout game no far from it heck i would say it s the worse fallout experience out there even after almost 3 years it s still kind of a mess gamebreaking bugs not that i have encountered but lots and lots of other inconveniences such as frame drops server issues inventory management clunky combat missing items getting out of bounds player interactions etc frame drops what happens when you decide to use a singleplayer focus engine and force it to handle multiplayer fallout 76 happens this game is terribly optimized even if you have the recommended requirements expect fps drops in some open world areas combine that with clunky combat and you have one hell of a combination indoors instances are fine for the most part looking at you daily ops so if you look at the minimun requirements and believe it will run at 50 ish fps obviously depending on your specs you re wrong it s probably 20 30 be prepared to struggle if i have to dig into the game files to fix performance issues we are doing something wrong server issues let s see we have a good engine just a terrible choice for multiplayer i hope servers can at least be stable and yes for the most part they are sometimes enemies tp sometimes you tp sometimes it disconnects you just because sometimes it can rewind your progress granted it only happened once and it was just minutes of desync didn t lose anything just had to do a step on a quest again it clearly struggles to keep up with everyone inventory management i will never understand how there s people out there that defend bethesda for selling us a better stash the vanilla stash has a total weight limit of 1200 ibs sounds like a lot it s not it might look like it at the start and you might go pppfff this wont get full anytime soon ooohhh but it will and when it does it s hell welp time to scrap sell weapons armor if you want to keep the sweet sweet junk with you even your character s weight limit is awful even if you have max strength max carry weight perks lower weight of x item perks you re still gonna get overencumbered your inventory will sit at a nice 249 250 just as an example so it s about collecting junk until the limit scrap it on your camp and repeat or you would repeat if it weren t because your stash will eventually be full as i mentioned sometimes it even bugs and you become overencumbered when you re clearly not hitting the weight limit good luck fast traveling clunky combat combat in modern fallout games has always been a mixed bagged it s either good or meh at best and here it s pure meh let me elaborate further it plays like f4 or even f3 but it sure as hell doesn t feel as good 60 of the guns in this game are just boring you got your standard pistols assault rifles shotguns sniper rifles gamma guns laser guns melee weapons etc they all feel plastic ky there s no weight they sound boring what i m trying to get to is that they do not distinct from each other it s just a bad gunplay overrall what about the other 40 it s actually really really good when you start getting the late game guns it s a whole different experience and that s also an issue difficulty in this game is everywhere it s either hard just because or too easy oneshot everything ish and for some people including me that s just not engaging after the 12453th time weapons have durability check ammo management is there check while annoying as it is it s fallout after all sidenote there s always a meta there s always something that s on top of the food chain and that s fine but if that means some weapons are just not reliable at all cough bows cough why have them in the first place also give love to laser guns missing items honestly what s the point in grinding out gear just for it to have the slightest chance of dissapearing from your inventory forever well i got that slightest chance i lost legendary armor part of my build and a whole set of pa bethesda wont do anything about it and never will believe in that it s been an issue for a long time now they ll just ignore your ticket and move on because from their perspective you re a liar going out for free stuff some lucky people just log off and in for it to be fixed some do and doesn t do anything can you guess which one i was out of bounds okay this is just a small thing that probably wont affect you but hear me out as a fellow vault dweller cannibal it s so annoying eating your victims and puuf falling through the ground it may not happen but the chance of dying in the middle of nowhere and having to sprint like crazy for your loot is just annoying player interactions it s been an issue since launch and will always be an issue because of the game s core concept of an online open world fallout game simply put everyone is playing their fallout adventure at the same time and they sure as hell are the protagonist but i m a solo player i don t care then why are you playing an online fallout game you might as well go to new vegas and have one hell of a ride there anyways the world is just hugeeeeee and also empty npcs can t carry the emptiness they ll just stand there and repeat the same two lines and when you finally find somebody it usually goes like x heart y heart leave pvp players are only a 10 of the playerbase and they seen to have a bad time looking to 1v1 somebody else other than dave level 750 over there so if you re looking to do that be prepared to struggle too maybe adding a whole pvp dedicated server would fix it but bethesda doesn t care about pvp they did try with nuclear winter the battle royale mode but we all know how that turned out it s not all negatives though camps are amazing it s crazy what other people can do with such a limited builder and the best interactions with someone will happen on your or their camp the community is friendly 90 of the time so don t be afraid to salute a fellow dweller but i still like you despite all that i still like this game but i cannot defend it at all on the countrary i will give it all the hard love it needs just to be better and that s about it my main issues with f76 there s stuff i didn t talk about like seasons or the terrible writting or quests in general i also didn t mention the perk system which makes the combat way more enjoyable once you get the hang of a build tl dr fallout 76 is it better now yes 100 does that make it a good game no it s mediocre at best if you have the reference of what a fallout game has to have then you re probably gonna have lots of issues with it newcomers to fallout in general should be fine but believe me when i say there s a better product out there this game is the worse first impression you re gonna get of the franchise terrible inventory management lackluster multiplayer experience boring gun play dumb difficulty scaling performance issues and many others want to buy it wait for sale it s not worth the full price tag not even those deluxe editions and please don t support fallout first it s a joke all though it s your money don t listen to this crazy girl thank you for stopping by
