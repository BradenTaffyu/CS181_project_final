2017 turn based games are often difficult to get into due to the complexity of their mechanics planning your moves ahead of your opponent be it an ai or a human forces you to think ahead much like chess would do getting better at a turn based game demands from the player the understanding of the metagame in place this means knowing in advance from your previous knowledge of playing the game what moves could yield in the desired effect a basic early game strategy for civilization vi one of many would be to rush astrology and a holy site if you encounter a natural wonder in the first turns so you can get ahead in the religious path with an associated great prophet permitting you to create an early religion this is an example of a meta you find a natural wonder in the early turns a you research astrology b you build a holy site c you get your great prophet in time d you found your religion e there are plenty of those and the secret is to know in advance which one you will use to get to your goals it s the motto of civ vi and sean bean tells it to you during the trailer when launching the game you must adapt and press forward if you are to reach your journey s end now here comes the problem the ai will actively cockblock your strategy and ruin whatever meta you are trying to go for at the expense of following a proper one for itself in other words the ai will constantly try to counter what you are doing in a way that is unproductive for itself and thus will focus on destroying whatever sparks of creativity you are trying to put into the damn game in higher difficulties this behaviour does not change it simply gets percentage related boni on everything while this very poorly implemented ai effectively kills the game firaxis did nothing to bring solutions to better it and focuses instead on releasing civilization packs to money grab credulous buyers it has some good points despite the ai mess however the art direction is good accross the board and many animations are top notch despite having a mobile game feel going on it s only a feel though also it is probably a nice experience when played in multiplayer with an ai limited to controlling barbarians avoid this at all costs if you plan on mostly playing the singleplayer go for the previous iteration civilization v or endless legend update 3 march some grammar and formatting
