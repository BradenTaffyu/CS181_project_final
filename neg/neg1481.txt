2022 early access review this being a day one purchase fro me and bought on promises by the devs this has been in ea for over 2 years now and still so many things are broken or gameplay features missing that were in warband these are just a few no strategic options with the lords cant request them to go and defend or attack like you used to in warband find claimants to the thrones or npc that planned a rebellion and support them to start civil war better courtship system that enables you to woo potential partners each had likes dislikes and felt like they had personalities for example you could dedicate your tournament win to a person you were interested in to build dialogue lord duels to settle scores lords had better personalities and acted very much true to their given attributes in bannerlord they appear to behave randomlythere are so many more things they havent bothered adding and after two years and being a very successful ea release you wonder if they lost the motivation now that money is in the bank they probably chilling on a luxury yacht in the mediterranean leaving modding teams to pick up the peaces a shame really no way a game with this kind of following and sales figures should still be in ea after 2 years trickling out small patches every now and then to fool people into thinking they are active
