100 vanilla no mods review pros cons enormous world with dozens of detailed handcrafted locations enjoyable gunplay alongside an extensive gear modding system very good variety of enemies equipment and approaches to situations large amount of unique weapons items lore files to collect shallow disappointing role playing component mediocre overall writing that never really hooks you in streamlined progression with major balance issues severe quality of life issues in settlement management most companions and quests are underwhelming bugs issues specs rare crashes transitions between locations can load very slowly at random certain quests may not progress correctly 3900x 2080ti 32gb ram ssd 1440pcontent replay value depending on completion rate and play style time taken may differ greatly in my case it took something more than 110 hours on very hard difficulty for a thorough one replay value is decent because of other builds to try out and different choices factions to join that mutually exclude each other is it worth buying the regular price of 20 is excellent for this content amount however i can t recommend this game to fans of the franchise as they will be disappointed by the many drawbacks and cuts it introduces verdict mediocrerating chart heredespite improving on some aspects fo4 waters down the progression butchers roleplaying and streamlines gameplay way too much for its own good it pales if compared to any previous fallout game at best this is an action spin off but ultimately a bad entry for the series follow our curator page summit reviews to see more high quality reviews regularly the world contains many unique encounters like this one however the truly interesting ones are few and far between a screenshot of fallout 4 by tamaster in deptha post nuclear role playing game or not being a roleplaying series fallout was always distinguished by its deep dialogue variety and depth influenced in large part by character skills this core component has been massively watered down in fo4 that not only decided to completely remove the skill levels from the character progression leaving now only special attributes and passive perks but also almost never uses the remaining features in dialogues choices apart from a few isolated instances and charisma which sometimes is still useful it won t matter what your character specializes in dialogues and interactions will mostly be streamlined and uninfluenced by your build this translates into a shallow boring set of conversations that in most part end up in the same way regardless or just have binary choices instead of the much more variegated alternatives the series accustomed us to at least the level of detail of locations is still remarkable with diverse dungeons each telling their own story or being part of larger plots exploring ruins and vaults is compelling for a while anyway rebuilding the commonwealthsettlement building is an all new feature for the series allowing players to build manage and defend outposts all around the game world which in turn bring benefits like reinforcements passive income generation material scavenging traders and of course also a place to use as base satisfying the needs with water food and defense related facilities is important to attract new settlers and boost population growth building requires resources scrapped from generic items found in the world for example screws and metal can be extracted from a toy car ceramic from a plate and so on doing so is a nice change of pace and seeing your custom fortified outposts all around the wasteland can grow on you however the management is a grueling task fiddly console oriented controls settler ai bugs unexplained mechanics and the huge chore of scrapping lugging materials around make this whole part a time waster the benefits aren t worth the amount of time and work used to create settlements you could simply ignore them and be just fine in addition they need to be defended at times while the game gives you no warning of an attack happening unless you open the quest menu with damage as consequence organizing and building efficient settlements is satisfying and a good change of pace management overall proves annoying though a screenshot of fallout 4 by tamaster balance what balance i ll just steamroll everything in my power armor even on very hard difficulty any character can become overpowered early this is due to how the progression is structured allowing to freely enhance attributes at each level up can make characters masters of all quickly while perks can be obtained only in relation to attributes not other skills or minimum level thresholds power armor is potent cheap to maintain handed to the player in the first few hours uses exhaustible fusion cores that are however abundant in the world and makes players hulking high defense war machines without drawbacks weapons become devastating rather soon even more so with mods and related perks even deathclaws will be only cannon fodder at a certain point no enemy will pose a challenge anymore making the game dull survival difficulty is slightly harder but doesn t fix the above mentioned problems while adding diseases nutrition slower healing and ammo weight however it also completely disables fast travel which is an extremely annoying choice also incompatible with settlement defense tasks good luck getting in time to the other side of the map on foot mostly forgettable comradesbarring a few exceptions most companions result underdeveloped in their character and one dimensional even if they react to player actions with a like dislike system thus unlocking new perks or romance possibilities they never change significantly or evolve their personality that much even after significant events also they re pretty much cannon fodder in combat and their damage skills can t keep up later on they re only useful to carry extra stuff when you re near capacity or as decoys sad nothing better than a rocket launcher to dispatch a pack of ghouls some damage types may be more or less effective depending on the enemy a screenshot of fallout 4 by tamaster combat customization the illusion of choicefo4 improves a lot on combat fluidity it delivers solid weight satisfying gunplay and meaty feeling in each firefight the weapon modding compartment has never been better with resource dependent craftable upgrades such as sights better barrels stocks drum magazines or unique variations of specific weapons however also here there are flaws for instance critical hits can only happen in vats now and the limb crippling mechanic plays a marginal role as opposed to the vital one of previous games despite an abundance of mods legendary modifiers dropped from rare enemies and unique guns the way to go will always be damage per shot oriented it s a race to make each weapon as damaging as possible all other mods improving recoil accuracy fire rate etc are ultimately useless compared to raw stopping power the same goes for armor where damage reduction and carry weight are kings
