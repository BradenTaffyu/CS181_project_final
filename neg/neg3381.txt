2016 hoi4 was a game i had been looking forward to for some time when the release was pushed back for balancing issues i was dissapointed but also rejoicing that a company had the integrity to acknowledge the need to correct issues having played it i m left wondering what they fixed the ai is horrible amphibious attacks with 3 divisions allies unable to hold territory god forbid you expect them to launch legitimate offensives and the trade issue please explain why germany would ever trade away excess oil and rubber for the sake of sanity why can the player not control where resources are being traded to the graphics are beautiful and the mechanics for ground combat seem to be there as for naval and air i m uncertain but it might be ok as well the game doesn t deserve the high ratings i understand paradox is usually good about patching and fixing problems they have started with stellaris issues and hopefully hoi4 is soon to see some much needed repairs
