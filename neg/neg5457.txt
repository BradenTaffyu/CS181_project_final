2019 tldr below overall the game is ok many of the greatest aspects of rtw1 and me2 were reworked for the worse the game looks great most factions have great arsenal of units and the campaigns are more aligned with history than the predecessor game rtw 1 the factional diplomacy is the best part about this game over rtw in this game each faction has a visible score of your relations with them this is an improvement because you can actually have strong time woven alliances with factions and you now know who will soon be your enemies if you don t improve relations 2 the co op campaigns are the second best part of this game over rtw if those two aspects don t interest you then continue reading the game feels soulless family trees and the structure of general creation is sub par to older total war titles the naval battles feel like rubber duckies playing bumper car in a bath tub probably the reason the dev s scrapped naval battles on future titles the army limitations and forced garrisons are a huge disappointment to me i preferred the old titles because you have more freedom and flexibility on how you reinforce settlements and how you attack now every single battle with every single faction is just a stack of 20 fighting another stack of 20 the max army sizes no reinforcement armies and the only skirmishes are when you beat that 20 stack and go to fight their town s fixed sized garrison not to mention that since generally only 20 units fight 20 units each army is just a spam of the few strongest units in each faction which makes each battle feel entirely too unrealistic no skirmisher armies no real strategy just juggernauts running it down the field the ai seems entirely downhill since rtw and me2 which is sad considering those games are far older titles the ai seems poorly scripted and either a cheats horribly to maintain advantages or b has no sense of self preservation tldr all in all rome 2 feels like you are playing a scripted rail shooter when you paid for a grand global strategy game both the limitations on the number of armies and the limitations of units in battle make most every battle feel the same rome 2 has great aesthetics but the game play is lacking in the most important areas especially compared to previous total war titles
