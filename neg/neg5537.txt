2013 rome 2 is a very pretty game it also has a lot of nice features to it and if you are new to the series i m sure you ll love it being a veteran of the total war series though its a major step back in almost every way while big and pretty the overland map is not very functional and serves mostly as a vehicle for moving your ten million agents that has to be moved every turn of course you also move armies here and this is where the biggest disappointment of the game comes out the ai is horrible in almost every single way while it has gotten better the ai still has no real idea what to do in sieges other than the extremely weird magic torches combat between armies end up being large blops of men something that was introduced only in this latest of the series all in all i can only recommen people interested in the series to get rome total war 1 medieval 2 or shogun 2 all three are much better games with more features and better strategic combat
