2019 do i recommend this game yes but actually no let me explainthis game is fun that s a highly agreed on opinion the mechanics the strategy and micromanagement is fun to add i love how you can customize the game settings and create all these fun rules for yourself to actually be challenged in a way you see fair the graphics are really good imo and i love the colors this is a fun game it really is otherwise i wouldn t have played it for as long as i did but here s where the but actually no part comes in the a i is deadass garbage it s complete garbage the difficulties are essentially just increasing levels of handicap the a i doesn t get smarter they just get more advantages throughout the course of the entire game its a way to make a i harder not to mention that the a i is b r o k e n it will literally almost never use airpower although one of the dlcs fixes that which brings me to my next point the game heavily relies on you buying the extortionate new dlcs without it the a i is 10 times more broken than it is with the dlcs in conclusion its loads of fun but it should be way better if you can gather a group of friends and play a full game this game is fantastic
