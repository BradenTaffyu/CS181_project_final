2021 rage quit soulsi know a lot of people are in love with the series but it just isn t fun for me there s a thin line between hard and frustrating and this game is just frustrating there s no sense of accomplishment after a hard area there s only relief all games should have difficulty options and i don t care what so called elitists kids say these developers do not care and they ignore a huge number of potential buyers do they realize there are older gamers people who are just bad at fast games or even handicapped gamers nope these people are not allowed to play this easy mode wouldn t hurt anyone it only would make some people happy why play it then if you don t like it you ask well this game has amazing atmosphere lore music and wonderful artstyle so you know just maybe people want to play it for these things but the whole series is marketed as insanely difficult games and this creates toxic elitist community on top i ve got this from humble bundle after playing dark souls 2 i managed to finish that one somehow and ds3 looked prettier and had much better level design overall look and mood so i thought why not i ll activate my key and then the frustration started i had absolutely zero fun with this all those things i mentioned like lore atmosphere music i forgot about them after couple of hours and stopped caring about them because frustration makes it impossible to pay attention to so what is ds3 it s a third person action game with rpg elements and barely any story i want to notice that story doesn t equal lore the latter is great or maybe i should say the story telling sisn t good you just run through the levels while fighting extremely cheap and overpowered enemies they always have more health no stamina system they hit harder than you and they often ambush you and put you into an impossible situations basically there are few types of enemies only they have different textures but they all have same moves and patterns worst thing is that if you die you must go through the level again unlike in ds2 you can t get rid of enemies here another stupid decision ds2 was at least playable because of that bosses are pretty boring their visual design is awesome but the whole fighting is boring as hell bosses have few moves and just repeat them over and over again compare it to monster hunter and ds bosses feel like they were made with zero effort hey just put this huge boss there give him insane amount of hp and strength and be done with it it s just cheap lazy design cheap ambushes cheap enemies cheap bosses which actually are easier than regular enemies controls are ok ish it s janky and unresponsive you can easily fall your inputs have intentional delay to make it harder to react rolling doesn t work half of the time shield should help huh nope shields worked as intended in ds2 but here shields barely help you don t have any special moves or skills can t even jump you only need to press the button at the right time 0 1 seconds too early or too late and you get hit and get caught in a series of non stop attacks i m not sure what the story is about because it s way too hard to follow it when you get 30 seconds of story and then 10 hours of frustrating combat that makes you forget what npc said and you forget what are you doing there in general you think maybe you can farm grind and level up like in normal game as final fantasy and make it easier or harder depending on how much you grind nope leveling up makes little difference instead of losing 40 of hp from one hit you lose 38 one more downgrade comparing to ds2 is that you can t restore your health as many times as you want overall ds2 was a better game not as pretty but it was balanced at least to some degree while ds3 is poorly balanced where nothing matters except your reaction time and ability to predict enemy moves it has really dark and grim atmosphere which is stunning it s rare for games to have such an amazing atmosphere another one which pops into my mind is stalker another game i did not enjoy at all that is accompanied by great soundtrack which transitions into epic music when fighting the bosses there s also always online function which makes the game even harder other players can invade you and kill you another amazing useless feature at least you can turn off invasions here but then you lose online features which helps sometimes a little graphically it looks average artistic style is amazing along with level design both environments and enemy visual design is amazing but graphics in general aren t very good the game is quite blurry it lacks graphical options locked to 60fps and has no native ultrawide support these developers clearly do not care about user experience yes i know for those who are extremely good at action games this could be fun but its not for me games should bring joy to you entertainment having good time etc and this only induce stress negative stress which overshadows all the amazing things this game has this game is nearly impossible for me and i only feel frustration maybe i ll finish it someday if someone helps me out otherwise i think i will never finish it but i m sure i m gonna ignore all the souls like games unless it s safe to use cheats prosgreat atmospheregreat soundtrackgreat artstylegood loreconsjanky controlscheating op cheap aifull of of cheap deathsway too difficult for
