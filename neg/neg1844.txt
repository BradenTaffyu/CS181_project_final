2016 why negative 1 reload time is being changed by developers they way they want completely independently from real conditions i am not sure if its still like this now but 1 year ago m18 hellcat had 8 sec reload and sherman with the same cannon had 5 seconds reload for example 2 ammoracks are just broken and broken intentionally on many tanks ammorack is blowing up realistically in most of cases when its hit by a shell like it should but a lot of tanks with very high caliber guns like maus is 2 3 4 kv 2 etc for some stupid reasons have nearly unexplodable ammoracks you penetrate them and hit ammorack directly several times in different places result it just becomes black 3 finally absolutely utterly destroyed and annihilated balance on 5 7 8 0 battle rating before like 1 2 years ago war thunder had a lot lower historical limit on vehicles the most late vehicles that were in the game and had the highest br 7 7 or 8 0 were is 4m king tiger 105mm panther 2 early t 54 it didnt have all the best late shells and so on basically the latest vehicles in the game were designed in late 1940s or early 50s and battle rating did make sense however time was going and developer decided to add later vehicles with more advanced technologies they started adding later t 54 t 10m m60 leopard 1 these tanks had heat shells with up to 400mm pen and sabot shells with a bit lower and it would be completely normal if only they would give them proper br br that would be way beyond 8 0 but guess what there is still not even a single ground vehicle with br higher than 8 0 even though they have jets with br 9 0 probably the guy who defines ground veh balance cant count more than 8 this becomes even worse now since they are adding more late vehicles like t 62 and atgm vehicle for every side controllable anti tank missiles this entire mess is happening while there are such tanks as is 2 and king tiger on br 6 7 just think about it regular late ww2 tanks are fighting with 60s vehicles with atgms sabots and heat shells 20 years difference they even put one premium tank with atgms on br 6 7 as result of this completely idiotic balancing many vehicles became completely unplayable or barely playable in only some of situations adding tanks from 60s on brs 7 7 and 8 0 caused lowering down brs of some earlier vehicles like is 3 and is 4 now we have vehicles that absolutely suck against vehicles with just a bit higher br they can meet in battle but at the same time they are annihilating vehicles that are having a bit lower br than they
