if you thought you only had to spend 39 99 on fallout 76 to play the game you are wrong you are required to pay an additional 12 99 monthly for fallout 1st to play the game the way it was intended by bethesda fallout 1st was released in 2019 as a last ditch effort to save fallout 76 before shutting it down because of how poor fallout 76 was doing financially fallout 1st generated enough money to prevent fallout 76 from shutting down and since 2019 every single update bethesda has released includes more pay to win mechanics that directly benefit fallout 1st buyers and clearly shows that the game was never intended to be a single purchase title fallout 1st needs a metric ton of additional content before it is worth your 13 the only reason fallout 1st prevented fallout 76 from shutting down is because of the clear pay to win advantage it gives you over other players the pay to win advantages from fallout 1st attracted enough buyers to prevent 76 from shutting down fallout 76 is a live service game that profits from you continuously giving them money fallout 1st is a pay to win subscription service that is clearly profitable and bethesda has no interest in making the game fair for players that refuse to buy fallout 1st fallout 76 is an unfinished game and bethesda uses fallout 1st to balance the awful gameplay mechanics loops that are present in fallout 76 spend your money wisely and please do not support the mtx practices businesses like bethesda use it just makes video games worse for all of us that enjoy them
