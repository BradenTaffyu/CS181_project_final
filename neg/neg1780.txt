2020 best current dog fighting game that i know of held back by its insane over monetization prices and the grinding which is balanced around them it s also gosh darn gorgeous has a bunch of modes has amazing gameplay when there are no glitches or poor balancing acts in play and has mixed vehicular combat you can expect very good support for mouse and keyboard with the ability to remap to your heart s content stick and vr users will definitely enjoy themselves here i like qe for throttle and ws for pitch to help my mouse aim be sharper especially when i m in spitfires or zeros anyway i just i don t know i tried to get back into this game and every time i m enjoying shooting down planes then i make it back to the main menu and shake my head because i remember why i stopped that feeling of progression isn t present here when going past rank 2 it s miserable you have all these planes for all these countries walled off by hours upon hours of grinding even with boosters or premium status heaven forbid if you choose a country that you end up disliking further down their vehicle research tree and if for some reason you d like to try other things such as ships and tanks or maybe that s what you went for initially then you d best prepare yourself for tony hawk war thunder edition to make matters even worse each vehicle has upgrade parts that can be grinded for which means matchmaking can still be questionable your plane versus someone else s upgraded plane means you ll lose assuming you both have a similar amount of knowledge climbing means living for some countries and if they climb faster than you well and there are repair costs that will eat away at your normal in game currency unless you re racking up kills every time you want to put your plane in a slot please pay more lions normal to do so eagles are the premium currency i just can t recommend this game long term any money spent was done so in order to bypass the grinding and monetization mechanics implemented to delay progression big thanks to my good friend that gifted me some packages when i was financially not rich to help me progress i d like to point out that i ve spent 225 on path of exile a game i ve played since 2012 and then linked to steam when it debuted here i felt good when i spent that money on ggg because it created this feeling that i was paying them back for all the good times they let me have with their game a feeling i didn t get with war thunder i even feel better spending money on pok mon go there are just better ways to monetize i guess there s ace combat 7 i ll go give that more attention despite how it controls war thunder maybe try it out for the stellar gameplay but give yourself a strict budget and know when to call it quits ah for reference i d like to add that i made it to rank v in the us tree and have two jets f2h 2 and f9f 2 rank iii for ussr britain and maybe japan
