2021 the ai in this game is annoying as in the upper half of difficutly levels it just bends physics and gravity to it s will and will just do whatever it wants to get a certain time i guess this doesn t feel like racing at all you might as well just have time trials at this point the difficulty levels are also super inconsistent expert could be quite winnable in one race and in the next average would be unwinnable it s ok to have make it difficult and there are many games out there that can make the racing fun this is just feels like getting cheated every race and i don t like it
