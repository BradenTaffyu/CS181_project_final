2014 warband is a very frustrating game for me as it offers something that intrigues me it merges a roleplay game with a strategy game while at the same time implementing them so weakly take the roleplay aspectyou play a character that levels and has skills that you can develop you can also equip that character with weapons armor and such that you find in the loot of defeated enemy armies or that you can buy in one of the towns eventually you can even recruit other characters and level and equip them too but what lacks is actually a good story line with an captivating background and good dialogues in fact there is not much roleplay to be done there are lords and kings but they are all faceless ententies and limited to a set of basic quests take warfareat first the battles are fascinating you don t look down up them as in most games but are actually there down on the ground among your troops thanks to the 1st 3rd person look and that gives you more of a feeling that you are actually there but when you start to get more troops you want to be able use tactics but there is hardly any tool to control your armies properly in fact because battles are limited you won t have all troops on the battlefield and you have a limited control over them most battles thus are nothing more than masses of men hacking away at eachother recruting of troops is nice until you are somewhat further into the game than you find you have to harvest the villages for recruits on a permanent basis you find out that you spend a lot of time running around the map recruiting troops and training them interesting at first but when the game progresses and you need more of them this harvesting and recruiting becomes tedious in many games this process is automated but not in this game take diplomacy trade and economydiplomacy comes down to just four options declare war end war submit to an adversary and say hello there are no such things like making trade agreements alliances sending gifts or threathen trade can be done by buying items in one town and selling them in another town given the fact that you have a limited inventory most towns have only a few items and a profitable town is usually at the other side of the map trade is too time intensive especially as compared to the option selling loot and captured troops economy consists of taxing your lands and buying a factory one per town at the max you have almost no control over taxing or over your factories take the relations you with your lordseventually when you establish your own empire you will need some lords to help you out these lords have likes and dislikes you have a very limited control over that you can give them a fief which makes them more happy with you but makes all the others less happy with you given the fact that when you give a lord a fief his happiness will increase with say 10 while those of the others will decrease with 1 or 2 you know that you are limited to ten lords at the most as they will all overall decrease more than you can increase them by given each of them a fief take the siegessieges are terrible boring affairs after a while you can try to leave sieges to the ai which results in tremendous losses so you are forced to organise them yourself which generally comes down to having your missle troops kill all their troops until you can either assault them or until they have nobody left and on goes the list of weakly implemented things i am surely amazed that people find it a good game and if so i am happy for them but you must have a lot of stamina to go through having to besiege each and every castle and town some of them twice just to beat the game at some point the game should end if you have like 75 of the map or are so powerful that others should submit to you but you have to defeat them all by conquering the whole map it is tedious and boring and when achieved you get a simple message i therefore won t play it again nor am i enticed to play sequels however i have seen that there is an expansion called with fire and sword and it seems to have improved on some aspect of the game perhaps improved enough to make it interesting july 2015 cleaned some text
