so i came back to this game after a long time and thought i would buy some dlc and possibly warhammar 3 to experience new parts of the game that has been added since the 3 years since i have last played however reading some reviews of dlc s and warhammar 3 i came across this quote the right to discuss is a privilege it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game ca s pr departmentthis is a completely unacceptable thing to say to your audience and from looking into it further ca even requests steam to take down negative reviews without looking at community feedback and instead just wanting their review ration to stay positive so i am doing my part in letting others know about their disgusting business practices and their recent 150 percent price increases on all products to make the higher ups more money not cool ca please don t buy any unnecessary products from this company and i m doing my part to spread awareness for our fallen player comments who have already been taken down
