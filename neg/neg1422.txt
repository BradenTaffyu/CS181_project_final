2022 i purchased mount blade ii bannerlord when it first launched back in 2020 for early access i like many fans of their previous game was very excited to finally see a newer and more modern game the graphics are good and a lot of the quality of life improvements are great in this sequel but i cannot recommend this game because it is still riddled with so many bugs that were prevalent as early as when they first launched the game with no sign or intention on fixing them this whole leaving early access and releasing a 1 0 version reeks of a cash grab to finally release the game on consoles don t get me wrong they ve made many improvements fixed a bunch of bugs and the game is fun i honestly really like it but there s just so many little bugs that shouldn t even be a thing now especially with an apparent 1 0 release there is not a finished game feeling and i honestly can t tell any difference from the game being out of early access it still looks like an early access game let me give you some examples you have beards not appearing correctly in character creation as in some of the icons for the beards look nothing like the beard on the character some beards aren t even showing on characters and just look clean shaven there are many many graphical glitches in the game most i remember being present as early as 2020 when holding alt to highlight important npcs when in an open world area you ll see random highlighted furniture that are under the game s landscape where you wouldn t even be able to access on the world map you can often see a weird highlight of shadows of what i assume is your party model traversing the world map some npc portraits have the infamous assassin s creed facial bug where they just have horror eyeballs and teeth showing with floating hair a lot of npcs portraits i ve noticed particularly in your clan menu do not have their eyes whenever i exit the game i always get some windows error message sound talking about clearing nav mesh when wearing some clothes not only do they suffer from terrible clipping but some even make it so your character s head isn t attached to the body correctly so you can see straight through their neck not only are there many graphical bugs but some annoying gameplay bugs persist also which many have complained about for years for example say you have 100 troops and you can t be bothered to start the fight to just kill 30 odd looters even though if you actually play the battle your troops decimate them every time with a simple charge blindly command for whatever reason when you auto battle and send your troops without you they will still somehow manage to kill one of your high tier units that are fully armoured and even mounted on horseback you only get once rng chance to romance someone if you fail even once you will never get a chance to try again there is still no way to control your caravan routes to make them stay in your territory so while at war they will continue crossing into enemy lands to be killed and have 15k wasted for their initial cost of deploying which makes it very rare they ever recoup their cost during wartime which is basically all the time i absolutely hate how they wasted time in their campaign mode it was the most blandest boring low effort i ve ever seen in a campaign the story is non existent it s just you trying to hunt for three banner pieces with a bit of mundane lore info dump copy and pasted to you with all the npcs you are forced to talk to some of them even say the exact same thing word for word with very minor changes not to mention the recent inclusion of voice acting somehow made it even worse due to their terrible lip syncing that makes it so goofy looking and comedic that it completely takes me out of immersion every npc now voices their first line to you and i just hate it they look so goofy when delivering their lines i preferred it when they were silent i don t understand why they wasted time and resources working on this half baked campaign when they could have just focused on the simulation sandbox that literally everyone only plays the game for there are still so many improvements that need to be made that i can t believe they thought this was good to go as a 1 0 release don t get me wrong i still enjoy playing it but this being a 1 0 fully released game is a complete joke i have never used any mods while playing this game for the record all of my experience over the years are completely of the vanilla experience
