2021 frontier developments did not change at all one hour long campaign which cannot be called tutorial game is beautiful and fun but in the end it all comes down to developers what they want from this game apparently they already started with dlcs meaning this was just mere money grab added after almost 1 year as i previously said it was simply money grab with all dlcs and releasing unfinished game after seeing this new scam expansion with dominion movie coming up frontier developments studio will never receive a single digit from me imagine selling half finished game only to get it packed in expansion for additional money after waiting almost a year i wanted to give it time so they can publish some updates and maybe released missing half of the game from launch because they owe it to us imagine going to a cinema pay for the ticket and drinks only to be met by commercials in mid way suggesting to pay for the rest of the movie that they should have included or simply off what developers do in between expansions is completely irrelevant because they released few very minor updates which means they are focused on their extortion with dlcs i gave it 2nd chance to play and replay trying to get achievements to 100 they fixed a bit micro management with medical and response center since that basically was 90 of the game not giving you any time to watch dino animations and other features in game
