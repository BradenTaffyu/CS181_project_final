2023 this isn t a strategy game it s a sandbox empire roleplaying game with a heavy emphasis on economic micromanagement that feels to me like it punishes you for learning its intricacies by burdening you with more micromanagement and empire modifier stacking that s okay if you re a fan of eu4 or other games in the pdx library and this is still a game i like to play with my wife and get enjoyment out of but it s really hard to recommend to someone that enjoys more straightforward deterministic turn based strategy the more i ve played stellaris the more i ve realized that my success in the game is never the result of any wider strategic decision making daring gambits or shrewd trade deals but it s my willingness to allow myself to be bogged down in optimizing every facet of my empire i used to think stellaris s real time with pause was the natural evolution of strategy games but i think it s the biggest monkey on this game s back aside from the fact that the ai still has very little idea of how to play the game in a series like civilization the game state alternates between decision making and resolving turns for other players you have a clear finite amount of actions you can take with your resources during this decision making phase and you get very obvious feedback sometimes immediately on those actions when you end your turn and the game cycles like this it s still possible to unoptimally develop backwater cities once you get really big but it s basically impossible to actually neglect using the resources at your disposal in some way so the opportunity cost you are dealing with is one action versus another action not one action versus doing nothing because i don t feel like it stellaris is a different beast altogether once the fun of the very early game discovery a fun that withers with repeated playthroughs as you go through the same tedious story chains over and over is over most of your actions will be 1 tabbing through colonies to spam districts2 tabbing through your colonies to build the same combos of buildings that give you proper amenities unity whatever3 tabbing through your starports to upgrade everything on them or build the same ideal combo of defensive utility structures i have ptsd from how many anchorages i ve build 4 checking that your scientists aren t sitting around with their thumbs up their butts a recent patch allows you to automate anomaly research something that was easy to forget to do since queuing up the commands to check them was another tedious micro barrier5 right clicking inconsequential diplomatic notification spam and configuring each message to never appear again because you don t care that the cloacial planet confederation with one planet across the galaxy entered a piddly research agreement with the destined merchant hegemony6 waiting for your alloys to go up so you can build habitats with your idle construction ships because any downtime that they aren t building habitats that grow more pops is just wasted potential seeing a pattern here because the game state is always in flux you are encouraged especially at higher difficulties in the mid game to apply maximum effort to squeezing the most out of your economy and may god have mercy on your soul if you conquer a bunch of ai planets there is a reason space genocide is a community meme it is more performant and less tedious to just crack a planet open than it is to take it over and deal with the disastrous planetary setups that the ai comes up with districts that make no sense buildings that don t support them and low stability are all staples of ai planets which just amount to more clicking so much clicking and for what the tactical layer of course has micromanagement issues as well the ai may be dumb but it s much faster at being dumb than you are it will always be more nimble with fleets and during wars it seems to know exactly when you re occupied with some other fight so it can slip nuisance fleets behind you and capture systems meanwhile if you ball your fleets up and send them to attack there s a good chance that half the fleet will take the natural hyperlane while the other half for no discernible reason will take the gateway on the other side of the system if you aren t babysitting them at least once per campaign you ll be on autopilot wiping out crisis fleets with your doomstack and get a notification that you lost a combat only to zoom over in time to see that the fleets you ordered to attack split themselves up and the second half of that fleet is heading into battle to die where the first half just did the current war exhaustion implementation makes this so much worse here s a common situation in stellaris you go for the vassalize wargoal and conquer everything except for one enclave system on the other side of the galaxy you haven t lost a single battle and you ve brought your enemy to their knees they won t except surrender though because of how war exhaustion works you are auto peaced out despite all of this and a vassal is created from your occupied worlds that has your own ethics not bad though right that s a big vassal still wrong the pops on those planets have their own ethics and they hate their government planet stability in all your vassals planets goes to pot it s worth saying you get zero notification of any of this after a few years the entire vassal defects to the one planet minor you just carved up and still have a truce with you don t get rebellions you aren t told this is happening and there is nothing you can do about it there is no option to allow the new government to have their original empire s ethics they just flip from being your vassal to going back to the previous empire all these issues beg for distant worlds 2 levels of automation and we have sector and colony automation but it sucks we don t have fleet automation imperator had army automation which was honestly a godsend as you expanded out more why are we missing that here which sucks but even if we had those features what s the point it feels like stellaris is trapped between a game that s currently giving you rsi from station planet development and the potential of a game that automates these issues away and has very little strategic depth to offer as a result of it in the meantime we get dlc s every half year or so that tack on more modifier stacking busywork but do very little to change the rhythm of the game or give you new approaches to play federations suck and have resulted in diplomatically stagnant galaxies where borders never change since they launched it s not been fixed to this day espionage is overly complicated and by the time you figure out how it works you ve begun to realize it s actually useless as well the galactic council feels like an explore the galaxy for free button and resolutions denunciations feel like they have virtually no impact on your empire aside from filling up your inbox every modifier is 5 10 of something it s just middle management spreadsheet balancing noise you can make distinct empires and imagine all the backstories you want but at the end of the day victory is only determined by how many alloys you produce and thus how strong your military is there is no tourism there is no religion or spiritual victory there is no diplomacy aside from let s federate so both our fleets can punch someone there is only your fleet and the pops that allow you to make that fleet stellaris is still a mellow out game for me and i ve got a lot of fun out of it but i can t recommend it to newcomers the price of entry is too high for what you get which is a rich polished empire designer with ai that doesn t know how to cope with or leverage the dozens of extraneous features that all end up feeling like an annoyance or burden to the player
