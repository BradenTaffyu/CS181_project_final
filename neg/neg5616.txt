2018 i am not necessarily giving the game a thumbs down over the addition of female generals although that is wildly ridiculous given the time frame but mostly due to ca disparaging their customers i am a decades long customer of the total war franchise and yet the call me horrid names due simply to my making with a historical based criticism of a historical game names like misogynist garbage humans angry men fragile masculinity is that really called for when making observations that there simply were not female generals at this time in history fine then i am responding in kind garbage developer
