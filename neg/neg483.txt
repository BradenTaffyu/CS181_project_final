2020 finally decided to give this game another go after many years of refusing to due to the microtransactions and 1st limiting in game fun and making half the game an inventory management simulator granted the actual game and story have improved much more with the several content additions that have been added over time but in essence i feel the game is still missing so much all because they want to make more money game is equally enjoyable frustrating at times and definitely better with friends though i am still dissapointed at how this game turned out
