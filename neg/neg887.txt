2022 i am a long time fan of the fallout series back from the original two games and i also had fun with fallout 3 and new vegas but this one doesn t quite cut it pros generally quite good voice acting some of the companions and other important characters feel like actual characters this time around some of the story bits are interesting cons but most of the story falls flat or just doesn t go anywhere story in general lacks nuance and meaningful choices ending feels like it s on rails with zero player choice once you get to the point of choosing one of the factions this game feels very dumbed down and unfortunately the game play doesn t make up for the lack of engaging game mechanics most guns never feel good even with maxed relevant perks i had the best time with shotguns settlement building is very clumsy and constricted this could have been fun but unfortunately it was far too frustrating to actually build anything larger than a little shack
