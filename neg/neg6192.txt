a lot of potential here but owlcat has once again completely ruined it game is really fun really diverse and has some really interesting build options but this is the buggiest least polished most obtuse tactical rpg i ve ever played here s a sample list ranged attacks just disappear for no reason ui confirms you ll hit the target attack goes off attack disappears no dodge roll no missed hit nothing in the combat log just gone game can t handle changes in elevation see the first item in this list stuff disappears as soon as it encounters a little bump seems to me like an inquisitor should be smart enough to be able to shoot up some stairs but here we are line of sight is a coin toss stack of crates can t see around it big steel ramp yeah its not an obstacle at allhalf of the sanctic psyker powers are just unavailable during the majority of major encounters for absolutely zero reason these are very strong party support skills so you re just missing a lot of key support utility and healing for the most important fights in the game the game s idea of difficulty is giving the enemy multiple turns per round healing back to full from 0 health and ridiculous amounts of dodge even on super massive enemies quest flags that just disappear including really important side quests that lead to alternate choices in story altering quests looking at you final judgement melta charges are way too scarce for how many demolition checks there areeverything is a loading screen everything really cool important interesting encounters are relegated to read text describing what s happening and choose skill checks chapter 4 and onwards have about as much qa testing as cyberpunk 2077 had on release not even exaggerating buy this game on sale or on grey market have a ton of fun until chapter 4 then despair as you watch the game fall apart at the seams owlcat test your f king sh i really want to emphasize that the game that is here is really good if owlcat can actually get the game fixed then this will be an easy recommend but right now this game shouldn t have released
