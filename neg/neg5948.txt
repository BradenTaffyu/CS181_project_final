2017 i love this game but the super unfriendly paradox dlc policy is just crazy i feel they want to suck every dollar from their customers and is even worse for new players who have to pay over 100 to play the latest game this is a complete nonsense and an unsustainable policy and it s affecting their loyal fans i wanted to recommend the game to a close friend who loves history but he has to play over 100 dollars to play the same game that s simply crazy i really hope that paradox changes this situation soon by offering real discounts for dlc packs or something like that
