2017 total dissapointment if your looking for a pretty game with out much care for the originals this is it stop over simplifing my games give me my damn skills back dont give me the illusion of choice give me choices give more to the game not less fallout 1 2 had far more customization and this is supposed to follow suit story is easily predicted and extremely linear
