2022 when this game was first introduced to me it marked every box i was looking for in a game real time grand strategy and still being able to take place as the commander on the field and not only partake in the battle but continue to order your troops it was truly the game i was looking for all my life when i bought it it was very bare bones early access filled with bugs and frequent crashes i knew what i signed up for when purchasing an early access game and despite all that i still loved this game then the honeymoon period was over the game received updates over time but nothing really changed the game was still somewhat lackluster in its content filled with bugs broken systems critical to gameplay and anytime a new update was released all previous saves were broken expected but frustrating when you get so far through a campaign to now have the file corrupted now that 1 0 is released lets see whats changed new maps new voice lines and thats about it still core game mechanics broken the new voice lines dont sync still more bugs then a amazon rainforest this game is not in a 1 0 release please be aware of these deceptive practices moving forward its not all bad though you can still have countless hours of fun ive put in 200 hours as of writing this review i just cannot recommend a finished product thats definitely not finished tl dr this game is not in a finished state despite the company s claim only get this game if its discounted past 50 but i doubt that will ever happen considering they ve up ed the price in early access
