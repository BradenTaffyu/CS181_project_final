2018 i am not a fan of the removal of warp and wormhole travel part of the reason why i really liked the game was the diversity of customization options while you may be using simple hyperlanes to travel the stars i could be using a gate to get to any location within a radius of course this makes certain strategies such as chokepoints and cornering pointless but that was the point of the game the developers don t care that they are removing options in the game that means that you should not care to buy this game until they bring back options
