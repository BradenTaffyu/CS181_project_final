2018 early access review whilst with great depth there is usually only one route forwards and the flawed design has left traps for the player to fall into in short the game has slow progression limited ways to fix what goes wrong such that abandoning your 10 hour save and starting a new one can get you further there is no win condition or goal the mechanics are unexplained and an exercise in self sufficiency with the problem of imperfect solutions in a world of perfect maths masochistic might be the defining word in long the problems no tutorials scenarios or victory condition no indication of the game being developed to be more than a sandbox you can lose despite the opening words having always been find out why you re here a reliance on third party wikis the official forums or google to understand problems or long standing bugs and their imperfect solutions player vigil over and maintenance of systems created there is no real automation or set and forget the world changes and your solutions have to incorporate new designs to deal with temperature germs separation of fluids gases and their storage or usage the larger your base grows the more time you spend fixing instead of exploring or playing joke toys in the toybox hydrofans should make things cool down they only make their operator run away from being too cold whilst nothing else is rock granulators destroy half of a metal to refine it in a system of limited resources later on you can use a metal refinery to not destroy any metal unfortunately no one considered design implications you start with copper ore you get the granulator you refine until you only have copper using up twice as much as you need to because you lose half of it oh dear late game exosuits require copper ore and no other metal hatches pufts wheezeworts slicksters all of these provide benefits unlimited coal unlimited slime for a dufunct and convoluted system of oxygen creation which was made deadly when germs were introduced and unnecessary when clean water was made unlimited unlimited very localised cooling there is no player constructed solution for cooling only heat displacement unlimited oil though for three of these being animals there are no paddocks or farmer jobs only bug exploitation with doors manual player reliant feeding and expensive in effort end game animal relocation tools none of these can reproduce all of these can die or be destroyed you cannot make more algae terrariums are available after algae deoxidisers but produce less o2 they both use the limited resource of algae abyssalite a material used to ignore the broken temperature system because it prevents transferring heat even when built into normal walls which puts to shame the later unlocked insulated walls cooking most recipes reduce or halve the calories of its ingredients whilst either removing the effect of diarrhea or minorly improving food quality food quality doesn t matter except maybe in long term gamesbugs building a wire bridge over heavy cable causes the heavy cable to think it s being overused breaking it the metal refinery can break due to taking in too little water applying the same amount of heat to it as normal and winding up with superhot water electrolyzers output 1 000g of gas this doesn t spread fast enough due to atmosphere simulation to let the electrolyzer output its next load leading to downtime in a system designed for perfect maths duplicants building walls around their own heads leaving them helplessly suffocating and screaming that they failed at life energy is designed to be like reality if you produce more than you consume that s your fault but you have to pay attention to turning off and later on your generators there is no automation outside of exploits the other problem with energy is that doing anything costs a lot until you unlock natural gas generators a coal power generator produces 600w a gas pump uses 240w once you have water retrieval water purification food refrigeration cooling system oxygen generation liquid gas splitting massage table food production you have very little left over to manipulate your environment without burning through a lot of your limited resources after natural gas you have the problem of my circuits overlap and break from overuse fertilizer synthesizers are used not to make fertiliser but natural gas for natural gas generators to make excess electricity coal generators require you to mine a finite resource or feed hatches then manually deliver that coal to the generator a natural gas generator setup requires your duplicants to shower go to the toilet and wash their hands you don t even need to use the fertiliser you make this is inconsistent balancing with most of the game making all other solutions redundant heat is near impossible to deal with your options are heat displacement piling on your limited number of wheezeworts or abusing exploits such as water dripping 90 of your duplicant s day is running to and fro without doing much of note everything takes forever to do for them and they cannot carry a sizeable amount of materials to put into storage farming plants range from no attention required with a high heat tolerance to i need to be in light fed water every day in this specific gas and i cannot live in anything higher than starting ambient temperature any temperature past minute 5 of play unfortunately most plants are high maintenance with only two being reasonable space management is key but you will always need more planning takes time building the plan takes more time destroying and rebuilding to fix mistakes takes even more time made a mess is not fun to begin with and perhaps for most of the game your water will be in open topped storage at the bottom of your base duplicants who can t hold it in any longer will pollute your water supply with germs and the game doesn t explain you need to heat up the germs to kill them heating water up costs a lot of energy you then have to deal with heat you can t remove good luck germs are not engaging or interesting food poisoning can largely be ignored slimelung kills duplicants after an arbitrary 10 days if they don t spend 4 days lying on a bed or standing in a tube sometimes a duplicant goes to take their temperature sometimes they eat tablets you make i think i ve never seen a tablet be consumed subjective depressing atmosphere most of your staple food is valued as grisly terrible or poor though that might be because half the food is soil deep fried soil maggots and pickled maggots the loading screen worldly creatures plants and other objects yay for placebos hope will cure our slimy tuberculosis are drawn with an air of unhinged much like klei s don t starve you can consider it whimsically dr seuss but with an edgy dark side that exists just because it can in other words there is only okay worse and abysmal there is no good the development cycle being clearly timed is nice to see however like most early access games nothing new added changes the game early access has yielded two germs plastic for expensive better buildings expensive transport tubes and now job hats after a year we still don t have tiles coloured out of the material they re built out of the roadmap on klei s website promises no more game than what you see now some people say they go to bed thinking of this game at night if you do it will be because you re wracking your brain for that perfect solution the game lets you pretend exists if you have limited time outside work or school for play this eats up time like it s nothing whilst ten hours later you re still struggling with the same problems people who love deconstructing the mechanics of games might enjoy this but it is not a game to play or win
