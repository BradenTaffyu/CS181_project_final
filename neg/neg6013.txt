2020 great game with crap practices i plan to play more of it and the community is great with mods the reason i m leaving a negative view is because much of the content some of it central to the game is locked behind a paywall even though most of the dlc they are offering could easily be incorporated in a free update one example is that you can t support independence of other nations unless you have either conquest of paradise or el dorado as of this review a summer sale is on and still it costs well over 100 bucks to get all the downloadable content if you still want this game just be aware of this issue while the dlc practices are still scummy hearts of iron iv and stellaris aren t nearly as bloated as eu iv
