2021 incredible game that keeps you playing for hours but after much thought i am gutted to say i can t recommend the game due to a simple fixable and sadly repeatedly ignored issue by the developers that many people not just myself have experienced if you do not have 20 20 vision you will need cybernetically augmented genetically enhanced eyes to see the small text in this game there are no ui or text scaling options for those of us who don t like to hunch over and glare at a screen at point blank range the eye strain is real please devs save my eyes
