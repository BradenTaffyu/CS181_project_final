2021 i just can t with this game any more between units just stopping mid attack to the inability for the game to actually recognize the changes to battle maps it s purely frustrating at this point to find any further enjoyment from this game don t get me wrong i have always enjoyed the total war series but it feels like every update to this game makes the basics worse i ve had too many actively played battles that failed because the interface refused to properly recognize where i was directing troops literally battles where clicking on spot on the map directed troops backwards troops just stopping for no reason lack of response and i can t count how many times archers and siege weapons acted in melee mode when set to shoot when selecting a target to attack beyond the battles it s also mind boggling that with the amount of patches and updates that when you build a palace your city troops actually get downgraded if your building the palace after being declared an emperor which let s face it if you re building the palace sooner than that you re probably doing something wrong if you enjoy strategy and can bare to delegate every battle then this game still has saving grace but if you enjoy turning the tides on close battles or reducing casualties from battles by playing them yourself this total war game has fallen a long way i honestly don t feel like cavalry is even cavalry at times any more these are just the most recently glaring issues i ve had with this game it all worked much better before the updates but now it s just getting unbearable i do hope rome remastered comes fully stocked and un needing of countless add ons and updates as out of all the total war series that one has felt the most polished
