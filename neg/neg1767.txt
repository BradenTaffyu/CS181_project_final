2019 over the years i ve had lots and lots of fun playing warthunder but i ve had even more pain especially recently it has cool planes and tanks from ww1 to the cold war you might find yourself with an interest in tanks that you never knew you had before the game plays well and it looks pretty but there s no reason to play on highest quality graphics why give yourself a handicap everybody plays on potato quality in order to spot targets better gaijin keeps favoring new content over improving the game the rubles must flow balancing no adding new games modes or improving the few we ve had since it launched no fixing the battle rating system oh hell no adding maps that actually works babushka please once every few months they ll instead add a new overpowered tank or airplane and we all eat it up me included now they ve even launched their own marketplace in order to squeeze us even more well not me anymore i m done on top of that you ve got no safety net what happens if your account get breached and whatever lowlife gains access to your account uses hacks well let me tell you gaijin will punish you you re s t out of luck gaijin will not lift a finger to help you even if presented with overwhelming evidence they ll ask you for your dxdiag information wait a day and then say oh yes we found evidence that you ve modified your gamelauncer and or game files this is clearly your fault please don t bother us any more do svidaniya sucker how would i know because this just happened to me my gaijin account was breached from russia and then accessed from russia and georgia in the same day i thought this might be proof enough that somebody hacked my account but gaijin refused to look at the evidence and the banhammer fell on me my 6 year old account 800 hours and an embarrassing amount of money just gone thanks gaijoob yes you might have fun with this game believe me when i say i ve had literal tons of fun with it since 2013 it is super fun to sneak up on top tier tanks in an m22 and kill them it s hilarious to own top tier matches with your ww2 pe 8 bomber and it s fun to drive around low tiers when you have tons of experience but it s not worth it your time and money are better spent somewhere else you might save yourself getting burned like i did in addition to saving yourself from the stomac ulcers high blood pressure and imminent hatred of all things russian thanks gaijooble very cool
