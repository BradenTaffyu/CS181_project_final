2021 early access review i cannot recommend this game it s been 8 years released 2013 it is now 2021 i ll give it some credit that it has gone through some graphical change and some features were added but i don t recommend it because i used to mod and write codes for this game but every other year they would change it and everything will go to hell or you lose your world s data and this kept happening in about 2018 i stopped playing it and so did my community because our beautiful and largely created world that we stayed on for 4 years this game is like minecraft had finally failed we had a underground tunnel network to go from one major city to another we had a pvp arena and everything a large underground hive similiar to resident evil the movie we had a death pit where people could stay on horde night every 7 days we made gigantic fortified skyscrapers all kinds of things custom mods that we made ourselves with our small team of devs and more we even had ingame faction npcs and players you register to a faction and if you were killed you d drop your factions coin that an enemy faction could turn in for exclusive loot via reputation in your own faction we even made respawns for loot trees and other resources so that we would have indefinite resources in the world example respawning boulders that would give you little bit of everything cars that would self respawn etc
