2023 early access review i ve absolutely loved this game for years and highly recommend it so you may ask why am i posting a negative review because the game i love has been updated out of existence to the dev s credit you can still download previous builds and play those but i have little hope for the game to ever get more polished now since it s completely changed directions the root issue to me seems to be the developers have suddenly shifted from improving the overall experience to trying to force players to play the way they want them to play which to me is a terrible idea for an open world survival crafting game previous systems allowed you to bypass endless rng grinding by using your skill points to unlock crafting options rather than trying to find recipes as loot this system was excellent because it made two different play styles viable the base builder and the explorer you could find a place to huddle up and grind for xp by mining and base building then use that xp to unlock crafting recipes by spending perks or you could go out exploring and use your xp to increase your killing potential as you raided progressively more dangerous structures for better loot which might contain crafting recipes and the two play styles complemented each other beautifully if your friend wanted to just hunt zombies but you wanted to just play mad scientist two of you could enter a symbiotic relationship where both prospered the adventurer going off and bringing back new wonders while the mad scientist invented new weapons and tools for the adventurer it would seem however that in spite of the previous system being allowing for multiple different play styles that encouraged team play the devs didn t like the idea of players bypassing the rng grind the new system merges the two play styles resulting in a system that to me is the worst of both worlds now you have to grind for xp to use your skill points to buy an improved chance at finding the books that might or might not be the recipes that you want you now have no choice you have to grind endlessly for xp to buy perks like you did when going base builder and then you have to grind random loot to find the books you actually want to unlock the recipes you need this doubles the grind needed to accomplish anything forces players to rely on rng and takes away their choice of playstyle now everyone needs to play the exact same game loop grind xp grind rng book drops no exceptions to me this is objectively less fun regardless of what play style you enjoyed and this is only the most recent of the major changes that in my opinion make the game worse with each recent update rather than better the other major change being the removal of liquid containers in builds alpha 20 7 and before you could find or craft empty jars and take them to water sources to fill them then boil them to get clean water to drink or craft with a very logical way to gain water in a post apocalyptic wasteland however for reasons beyond my understanding this feature was also removed it is no longer possible to find or craft empty vessels so instead your post apocalyptic survivors who are smart enough to build power tools and vehicles from scratch apparently never learn how to fill empty jars
