2022 i adore this game but i can t recommend it for full price it lacks too much to be worth the price big word vomit warning i did not edit this very much it s all just a passionate word vomit the gameplay gets pretty repetitive all aspects of it are stumped in some way such as online events the map while being big is also very boring in my opinion there aren t any cities it s mostly just wilderness while the wilderness looks good graphically none of it wowed me aesthetically so the surroundings got boring after a while the races in this game get very repetitive there is very little variation in tracks they all kinda do the same thing the only saving grace is the publicly posted races i have so many nitpicks about poor game design i could write a list of 100 it s baffling like for instance half the road races are street races which is just another word for filler races they just made half their races take place with ai traffic and pretended it was totally different when in reality all it does is give half the road races an extremely annoying feature this has me writing off half the road races as useless because of how frustrating it is to drive into the traffic and random crashes from the other ai cars also half the races are dirt races which is okay but the vast majority of players play for road racing so it feels kind of a waste all these factors make the races feel repetitive and unvaried which is a shame because the actual feel of the cars is really good another issue i have is that there is no form of progression in the game it s basically just capitalism grind for money buy all the cars that s it that s the endgame the story has you doing random events untill you unlock all the races after less than 20 hours of gameplay it s really dumb truthfully some of the special events are fun and have you driving cool cars and even a parade float with a v8 but none of this stuff is very challenging you just hold the accelerator and go forward until you achieve the scripted win these special events are just made to be eye candy fun to look at and experience but shallow gameplay beyond that which brings me to the game in general it was not made to be played for more than 50 hours which is a shame given the insane price tag it s all eye candy for the mainstream audience the game looks really good while maintaining very accessible performance my system easily handles 120fps on high preset with an rx 6600 xt and i5 10400f for anyone who knows what that means for a game that realistically doesnt need more than 30fps this is very impressive however i hardly call this a selling point i wouldn t spend this much money on a dedicated impressive performance graphics display along with this and the extremely repetitive gameplay that doesn t keep racing game and forza fans in mind makes me feel left behind since the game makes for good eye candy i spent most of my time listening to my own music or a podcast while i play just so that i can turn my brain off and listen it s a good game for doing that but again not for the pricetag the whole game was clearly made for people to waste money on just to see the graphics and lots of cars and only play for like 20 hours plenty of my friends forza fans btw have bought the game played it a bit to finish the story and get the cars they like and then slowly got bored the gameplay simply has no hook to keep people interested it feels like another bloated racing game by a triple a company for my final point a subjective one the atmosphere is disappointing the music for instance is representative of my last point it s not very good forza fans seem to agree i ve seen reviews from people who thought fh4 s music was better at least for the drum and bass music which is a real shame because many people really love the drum and bass radio in fh4 my personal experience goes way back to fh1 which nails atmosphere to a tee the music in that game makes the experience feel like a 2000 s dance party the whole thing has the proper energy it needed to stand out as a new racing game awesome music was essential because the horizon festival was a music car festival with people visiting for cars and beats and the hit soundtrack was representative of that people who were fans of bass arena back in fh1 now find themselves disappointed in the new music me especially go listen to the fh1 bass arena soundtrack yourself it oozes with personality whereas the new soundtrack is filled with new pop hits old rock scores and lame bass again very subjective but i think it kinda sucks lol the atmosphere is lacking in general especially with the lack of a story fh1 had funny memorable characters and a world you wished you lived in while fh5 provides a cookie cutter world that simply exists to be the place you race in outside of the quirky mexican events the personality is lacking and i expect more from such a big publisher the one good thing i need to mention before i m done is that the gameplay is still 100 times better than nfs in my opinion even though i ve been a big need for speed fan in the past their gameplay is unrealistic and bizzare these days especially with their terrible drifting eughhh no don t get nfs they re too far gone i got a pc just because all the racing games sucked on playstation except for the new gran turismo but it s too late to go back now lol okay i m done mid game overpriced go back to your roots playground games and turn 10 wow me again like you did 10 years ago stop pumping out this cookie cutter open world racer nonesense
