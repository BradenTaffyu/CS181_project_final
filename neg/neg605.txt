2017 until they fix the glaring bugs i can t in good faith recommend this game that seems to be getting unanimous positivte reviews so many times quests will just not finish even though you fulfilled all the requirements you know what s absolutely not fun in a game wandering around forever trying to figure out why the hell a quest isn t completing wondering what kind of obscure thing you might have missed only to google it and see that it should be completing but isn t personally i hate having to constantly google things in a game just to make sure i m not missing something and 90 of the time it just turns out the game wasn t qa d properly and glaring bugs are why you can t finish a quest really instills my confidence and makes me feel real immersed in the role playing game it goes beyond quests too though tons of annoying like i can t tell you how many times i have clearly clicked the dialogue icon on a character in town only to have my character do some sort of phantom thieving attempt no they re not sneaking no they aren t click on items on the ground and then i get attacked and have to reload constantly having quicksave before literally every interaction in the game is not fun but if you don t what s even less fun is backtracking over parts of the game just because of some bullcrap glitchy behavior in battle it s mind numbingly infuriating as well so many times i will be trying to click attack on someone and the dude will just run to the side of them and waste their action points doing a pointless move that turn into an attack of opportunity instead of you know just attacking the person directly in front of them also a lot of skills are just horrible with how the ui handles it how many times do i need to click an arrow in my hot bar before you freaking register it for me to fire or how many times do i need to click drink a consumable to consume it spoiler alert it s a completely random amount of times each time because somehow the ui is so buggy in this game that it ends up boiling down to rng to get your clicks to even register and there s also a ton of annoying things that just blow my mind the pathing in this game is a joke try moving your party through an area with a lot of environmental hazards and tell me it went smoothly then i can call you a blatent liar you re constantly getting story events triggered to the wrong character usually never the person you want talking to the particular character to pass a persuasion attempt there s also other crap like randomly just losing items after cutscenes and not realizing till way too many saves later and i could keep going on yada yada but i m sure all the fanboys will defend this game to the death as being the most perfect game ever built event though it s impossible to go 5 minutes in the game without experience some sort of inconvenience due to bugs it would be a good game without the bugs and honestly i ll probably just suffer through it anyway because no one makes any good games these days and this is what i m left with yay
