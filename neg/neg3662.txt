2017 early access review i wish there was a possibly option for whether i recommend this game in a way i love or loved it as you can see from the amount of hours i ve played but had i bought it now with the current version that would not be the case i played on a dedicated server with friends i know well from other games in a multigame guild with them and at first we loved it but the main problem we had time and time again was the hordes not working we spent ages building a huge outpost with walkways etc to kill the zombies from only for none to turn up on the 7th or multiple of nights we would be eagerly awaiting them and nothing very occasionally they did turn up and it was great fun but i m talking one night in 100 forum post after forum post has complained about the hordes a game like this the hordes are the main thing if they dont work the rest of the game isn t really worth playing unless you enjoy building huge bases just to look at one by one my friends stopped playing every single one of them stating the same reason the lack of hordes zombies to fight it ended up with just 3 of us paying for a server we stuck with it though to a15 but we have now decided to stop paying and play another game and wait until they have finished messing about and i mean messing about and we know what sort of game we end up with then we shall decide whether to resurect our server or move on it s sad as this is one of the games i have loved more than any other but it seems like the devs are making it up as they are going along concerntrating on things that while great don t get around the simple problem that on a zombie survival game if we dont have zombies that work properly hordes turning up to give us a challenge then the rest while nice is pretty pointless fix the hordes so the game is fun then concentrate on the rest they seem to take 2 steps forward then 3 steps back one of the things they have fixed is that if you are on a multiplayer server hordes now turn up for all players but i use the term horde loosely when i used to play if the horde turned up it was a real horde non stop for ages what felt like tons of zombies now you get something like 8 zombies per player turn up the devs seem to have spent a lot of time with a new type of zombie that takes a lot more of your computer resources when to be honest i think most people myself included were perfectly happy with the original zombies like the hawian tshirt guy etc and for every person that is impressed by the new zombie i expect theres around 5 that wish they had concentrated on fixing the game instead there s threads such as show i m not alone with this train of thought when i first played we had different meats you might have to hunt boar to make a certain recipie you might have to hunt deer now you have generic meat you used to have a forge that felt like you were using a forge when crafting now it feels more like you are using a piece of software i really really want to love this game again but all i and my friends want to do is build good bases and have hordes of zombies attack and try to smash their way through that used to happen sometimes it now doesn t seem to happen at all with the long release times between updates and each update bringing in fluff that while a few people might like it doesn t fix the actual game play i fear for it s future we were told they hope to go gold by the end of the year but as i said they do seem to be making it up as they go along if this is so i cant see many more updates coming first and the game is still severly broken i really really wish they would fix the core game before concentraiting on things like zip lines etc the devs release a q a or a game play vid almost every week now i don t know why he reads a question mumbles maybe and moves on to the next one you only have to go to the official forum under to see how many people have given up look at the comments for alpha 14 various patches up to 14 6 most of them with pages of our responces 14 5 on 7th april 2016 had 84 pages of replies just 3 weeks later 14 6 dropped and had 49 pages of replies and on 6th october alpha 15 dropped and had 76 pages of replies then on 7th dec alpha 15 1 dropped 6 weeks later we have just 7 pages of replies and one of those pages is a discussion on grammer rather than the game that shows me that many people like myself have simply given up on it for now it could have been one of the best survival games ever but in my opinion they have gone in a direction that is bewildering to many people that used to adore this game sure it s still got its fans sure i ve got my moneys worth many times over but i m talking about what the game is like now not when i used to enjoy it and sadly it is not the game it once was many of us stuck with it even though things like the hordes never did work properly as we could see the potential but with every release it feels more and more like just another game and is loosing the things that to me made it special i really hope that in months to come i m writing another review where i can say that they ended up with a superb game that i enyoy but sadly from what i keep reading i doubt that will be the case
