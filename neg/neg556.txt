2023 don t pay attention to the number of hours in steam i went through all the chapters with ex missions except for additional boss on 3 22 on the phone and i m not happy you see playing every game from project moon feels like poking your balls with nail especially after the release remember we don t talk about love town difficulty curve in limbus company is similar to lobotomy corporation and library of ruina first levels are no brainers you literally can t lose no matter how hard you try but then something happens for me the first sign of bullshitery is level 3 4 which i couldn t even pass for some time then it was 3 5 then 3 18 3 19 yeah starting from chapter 3 you can get the classic project moon gaming experience gameplay is similar to library of ruina but it has less variety every character or identity has 3 skills passive abilities ego skill and 1 defending skill guard evade counter attack that s it the only thing you can do is changing your characters because sinners have different damage types and damage resistances you don t really think about it because 1 2 chapter except dungeons maybe are on autopilot starting from chapter 3 every battle is about winning in clash having higher number so what s wrong with that right library of ruina has the same type of gameplay well for some reason in order to win in clash you have to get a lot of modificators from coins which is random if you win a clash your opponent lose 1 coin and vice versa in short your gameplay is based purely on random which is really bad half of the characters in certain levels are useless because their skills are less effective you have lower chance of winning in clash don t forget that every sinner has only 3 skills that you can t change buuuut they can be upgraded through leveling and tiering but how can you level up your sinner more on that later there are some status effects but you can t build your strategy around them because everything that matters is winning in clash having a higher number neat huh the other issue is technical condition of the game i used poco x3 pro to play this game and well it wasn t enjoyable at the start of the prologue cutscene i was softlocked i couldn t continue the dialogue so i had to change the region on my phone to usa fps were locked on 20 or so and every usage of ego freezed the game for 3 10 seconds why dunno also textures were lower than they are on pc but my graphic settings were on high the most frustrating experience is playing fights against abnormalities where thank you very much you can choose where your attack lands on controls in fights with abnormalities are inconvinient on phone specifically choosing attack and your target you spend too much time on that i forgot to mention that in fights against humans the target is always on opponents with lower speed or at least i think so in late fights you can t even defend yourself from attacks you don t have this option you ll get staggered it is a condition where your sinner can t attack for 1 round and takes fatal damage from every attack type usually 1 round is enough for your sinner to die because you can t counter attacks on the staggered sinner talking about defend skills well usually they are useless evade stat is maximum 12 2 basic 10 coin which isn t enough to evade late enemies guard helps you block one attack if you are lucky but every coin is not only a modificator but also an additional attack for example having a skill with 5 attack and 4 coins 2 means that after winning in clash you can land 4 hits and it can be 7 9 11 13 40 damage in total attack or 5 5 5 5 25 damage counter attack is similar to guard but at the end you can hit your opponent once if you are not staggered of course the gameplay is fine if you exclude random factor which you can t but having so much mechanics means that you as a developer has to explain them to the player but they haven t tutorial is done poorly the only thing you as a new player get that you have to match attacks with similar color thank you so much very helpful of course they will mention different attack types attack resistances passives abilities but you see since the first chapters are no brainers you can easily forget about it don t mention that tutorial explains those mechanics badly they don t even explain to you ego skills and resources you have for them but they are essential in late fights ugh the last thing is gacha mechanic if you want to complete the game you can use only standart characters it s half true they will get 3rd tier for free which is great because 3rd tier gives you the 3rd skill before that you have only 2 skills for each character but from my experience their skills are weaker they have lower number in clashes than skills of rare identities which you can obtain only by spending donate currency lunacy at the start of the game you have a lot of lunacy you even get 2 tickets for free 10 spins also you gain some lunacy for completing the story and ex missions which are completing the fight under 10 rounds also you can obtain additional lunacy through battle pass 400 800 or so and that s it there are no other options to gain more lunacy and if you want to get new characters after completing the story donate some cash i heard that project moon wants to give the ability to earn 450 lunacy each week through completing mirror dungeons that s cool but in order to get 10 spins you have to spend 1300 lunacy and you want to spend your lunacy only on 10 spins because it has the only pity system you will get at least 1 character 2 waiting 3 weeks for the possibilty to spin 10 times is veeeery generous some words about exp and grind leveling up raises your hp defense and attack stat for skills so if you want to complete the game at the end of it your characters should have at least 20 lvl although the difficulty can be 30 level on 3 4 level my characters had only 11 lvl or so the only possibility to earn exp tickets to level up your characters is by playing mirror dungeons which are locked until you complete 2nd chapter very interesting you will get 10 gold and silver tickets 1000 and 100 exp correspondingly and 5 random or 3 specific hero shard cases why do you need them to buy identities and egoes of course but the price is very high 400 for 3 stars hero and 150 for 2 star hero 400 for ego and you have to spend shards of a certain hero btw at present you can obtain only 50 random and 30 specific hero shards each week although standart characters get 3 tier for free other identities can be tiered up by using threads an another material to get them you have to transfer shards to threads one for one for 3rd tier for 3 star hero you need 100 threads for 2 star hero 60 threads 3rd tier is must have later in game you ll get some during the story but after that the only possibilty to get threads is exchanging don t forget that shards are obtained through mirror dungeons and they are not funny very grindy i omitted the story art design and music because i have nothing against them they are top notch that s why i like project moon games for their art lore and music we are talking about the game after all at the current state i can t recommend this game of course project moon will nerf some levels add new ways to get lunacy and new content but in current state this game is bad only 3 chapters and mirror dung if you are unfamiliar with project moon games you will be dissapointed by difficulty curve and drop it if you are a gacha player there is also nothing interesting for you because after completing the story lunacy is obtainable only through money if you are project moon fan well you can play it but i doubt you will enjoy it thanks for reading
