2021 i got this game and loved it for years before the 2k launcher was required so now in order to play i need to use a game launcher to launch a game launcher it is poorly implemented it slows your system down it is completely useless bloatware rather than attempting to provide a more desirable product experience to make profit this developer would rather provide an exploitable negative for users experience to the same end i dont support this type of practice because it makes gaming one of my favorite things a worse experience for myself and my fellow gamers i hope you agree and do not support this company any longer
