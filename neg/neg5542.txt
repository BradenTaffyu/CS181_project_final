2018 ancient battlefields neither were nor could afford to fill gender quotas like modern workplaces a woman commanding soldiers to battle was such a rare occurrence that myths of such events echoed in time to see every third general be a female in a game like this is immersion breaking and cringe inducing to many historically savvy players and does a disservice to all the historical and legendary female figures that stood against all odds and inspire women and men alike this constitutes an issue for me but it s forgivable what is not is the cynical way the devs responded to their playerbase whether due to petty politics or some vein attempt at winning over an imaginary new market compromising the integrity of the game is cause for concern and disrespecting the opinions of fans belittling them and telling them not to play the game is insulting and inexcusable it would be very hard for me to follow any future projects after this fiasco
