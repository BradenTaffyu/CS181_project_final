product received for free you can tell by my hours played i have put a decent amount of time into this game despite the amount of hours i spent playing i do not recommend this game to other players the main issue is the price to have a complete game unless you have 1000 to burn then you won t be getting the full sims experience and even then the full experience is barely worth it with how insanely buggy the game is some of the dlc barely function there is a reason why at least a thousand of the playerbase got the game via a different method ea do better or else you will lose your playerbase to those that do care about this game genre
