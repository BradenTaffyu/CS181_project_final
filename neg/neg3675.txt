overall 6 107 days to die is an open world sandbox game with a unique blend of survival crafting base building and tower defense mechanics set in a post apocalyptic zombie infested world the game revolves around the core premise of surviving day to day while preparing for a massive zombie horde attack that happens every seventh day hence the title unlike many other survival games that focus solely on gathering resources and battling enemies 7 days to die introduces a dynamic system where players must constantly adapt to an escalating threat the zombies grow stronger and more relentless as time progresses demanding not only resource management but also strategic thinking in how you build and defend your base which makes 7d2d notable in regard to depth complexity and challenge the crafting system is one of the game s highlights offering a vast array of items to create from simple tools and weapons to complex fortifications and traps designed to withstand the zombie onslaught managing resources like food water and crafting materials becomes increasingly challenging as you venture through a procedurally generated voxel based world filled with abandoned cities wilderness and decaying remnants of civilization however survival isn t just about fending off zombies you must also manage your character s well being dealing with injuries hunger thirst and environmental dangers like extreme weather adding depth and realism to the experience combat is a mix of melee and ranged but it can feel very clunky especially in close quarters fighting though ranged weapons provide some relief as long as you can manage the somewhat limited ammo multiplayer and co op play are undoubtedly the game s most significant feature as coordinating with friends to build an effective base and face the seventh day horde together enhances both the tension and the excitement pvp servers can absolutely get toxic so i personally recommend just playing with friends but pve servers are much more tolerable if you intend to play with random players regardless the multiplayer dynamics bring a new level of unpredictability and exhilaration unfortunately this is where the positives come to a screeching halt the game s visuals feel dated with rough textures and character models that don t measure up to more modern survival titles and performance issues like framerate drops bugs and graphical glitches can detract from the immersion particularly during large scale horde battles despite not personally following this game the entire time it was in alpha for literally over 10 years i was glad to see such a long running project finally reach completion and get a 1 0 release earlier this year however the 1 0 release of 7 days to die is ironically my most significant gripe with this game despite being in development for over a decade and finally attaining its full release the game still retains many of the rough edges that have plagued it throughout its extensive early access period for a game that has been in alpha for such a long time you would expect a significant leap in polish stability and overall performance to come along with a 1 0 release and an increased price tag of 45 in the contrary the visual presentation remains dated with textures and character models that feel like relics from a previous generation of gaming while the core mechanics survival crafting and base building are robust they also haven t seen the kind of dramatic overhaul or refinement that would justify such a steep price increase additionally the combat while functional still feels clunky and imprecise and the ai pathfinding issues that lead zombies to behave erratically during horde nights still persist performance issues mentioned earlier like bugs frame rate drops and occasional graphics glitches remain a problem particularly on larger maps or during more intense gameplay moments considering the wealth of other survival games on the market many of which offer more polished or innovative mechanics for a similar or lower price the fun pimps have a very insulting audacity to have 7 days to die stand on a 45 price point longtime fans may appreciate the final release for the culmination of its years of development and what it represents for the game but in general 7d2d feel like an overpriced janky experience especially when compared to other titles in the survival genre tl dr 7 days to die is a very average sometimes slightly above average open world sandbox zombie game that s 1 0 release earlier this year doesn t justify its 45 price tag despite over a decade spent in alpha the game still suffers from clunky combat dated visuals and persistent performance issues like bugs framerate drops and zombie ai pathfinding problems while the survival mechanics and crafting systems are deep they haven t received the polish or overhaul expected after such a long alpha phase even on sale all the issues previously mentioned issues will still persist so compared to other survival games many of which offer better visuals smoother gameplay and more innovation at a lower price anyway 7 days to die feels disrespectfully overpriced and underpolished and for those reasons i simply can t recommend it
