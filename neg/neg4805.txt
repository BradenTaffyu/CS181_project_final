note the game is seeing constant updates so this review might be outdated by the time you read it full priced game that has less features than the old one the main one being the lack of lan mode judging by aaa standards which are low nowadays but my point is that they have the necessary budget to tackle the issues mentioned bellow edit i thought you couldn t save load multiplayer games but turns out you can to load them select the saved game game mode when creating a multiplayer edit 2 i ve grown to like how oracles generate favor in any case it was just a minor detail in my original review added qol suggestion about observer mode missing features cannot host local lan games you can only play with others while online minor issues from the old game that weren t fixed despite this one being in a new engine units can sometimes get stuck inside town centers ai that controls units the one that makes yours units follow orders you give path finding struggles with big chunky units like war elephants they will often keep bumping into each other questionable decision making on attack commands units can stray away from the given order location indefinitely if they are chasing a unit that s faster than them flash back to 30 hoplites chasing a caravan across the map questionable decision making on attack commands buildings get completely ignored when there is at least a single enemy unit in vision if you have 50 soldiers and 1 enemy villager spawns they will all stop destroying the enemy s buildings to chase that villager some qol suggestions allow observer mode to flip the side of each player in the ui allow players to change the side of their minimap on the ui allow players to configure the opacity of certain ui elements for example the resource window of the alternative ui is very transparent allow players to toggle off the maximum population warning allow players to toggle off unit trained sounds or at least reduce their volume if you plan to keep supporting the villager ai feature make it behave more efficiently and make norse dwarvers be prioritized on gold gathering make it clear what each ai difficulty changes some units buildings techs s tooltips still aren t descriptive enough use the extended edition s tooltip mod as reference for example the current tooltips don t show the values of the bonuses the pharaoh empowering ability gives the arrows fx are a bit too much
