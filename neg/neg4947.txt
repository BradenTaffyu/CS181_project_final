2023 it is a beautiful game and i cannot stress that enough but it is also severely lacking the ai is absolutely braindead and is only a challenge because it cheats a lot and has an incredible player bias the game is primarily character driven but apart from the main characters the average player will not care about them at all which is to the severe detriment of the game they are not generated and therefore every play through is with the same characters sadly to end it all the campaign plays like real time while it is turn based and the battle play like an mmorpg with a lot of button smashing instead of an rtt because battlefield tactics hardly amount to anything
