2017 don t let the sales fool you don t let this game being x price fool you look at all the negative reviews look at the reviews at the top of this page paradox has flagged quite a few of them as abusive or off topic buy it on sale if you want but understand this the community consensus full game base game art of war common sense rights of man still costs around 40 on sale now that s in the u s where the prices haven t been raised anywhere between 17 to 100 good luck trying to buy this if you live in a country where the price point had fallen out of line with our other markets don t bother with this shady company don t get yourself involved in a type of game where paradox is uncontested by outside competitors there s a good chance that you ll like the game if you are into history and strategy games but this comes at the grave risk of being a puppet to paradox where they have optional dlc that 100 is not required because recent game updates have become dependent on these dlc sure it s possible that you may enjoy the game without the dlc but understand that you are in the few the biggest reason that you will feel heavily inclined to buy the dlc is that some mechanics that are game breakingly essential have a price tag put on them which includes being able to develop a province transfer province occupation abdicate heirs game mechanics that if you re not familiar with the game are important and make the game incomplete and frustrating without them tl dr don t bother with this game paradox prioritizes profits over quality content and customer satisfaction edit paradox has reversed the price changes and while i appreciate the move i am skeptical that paradox may try to raise the prices again at a later point in time they have also tagged the flagging of reviews to an unknown culprit and not themselves take that how you wish aside from that ignore the price change portion of the review i still stand by my belief that the dlc policy is ludicrous and therefore my negative review does not change
