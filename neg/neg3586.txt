2019 early access review its has been a fun game for years sadly the quality of the game goes down with each revision as mechanic changes have turned the game into a glorified xp grind the studio does not seem to be that in touch with their fan base anymore which is sad as for over a year i would refer to this game as the best zombie game of all time nowadays i get in the mood to play it and within the first hour i realize why i had not for several months very disappointing turning point for a once amazing game
