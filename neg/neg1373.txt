2021 early access review my thumbs down review is based on 3 main things that i will break down a bit more to explain overall i love the concept of this game and the promise of it but as it is and as it is currently being developed i gotta give this a thumbs down so two main points 1 this game has is and will be in early access till christ himself comes back as far as i can tell this game has taken somewhere close of 7 years just to get to early access and now it s been in early access for over a year and what game did we get for all this dev time an unplayable mess is what we all got campaign has barely any features has only the loosest and unfinished storyline that an indie developer could have done better and even the multiplayer is bare bones at best all in all this game feels like something still in alpha stages compared to others and it s been 8 years bethesda takes less time and comes up with a somewhat more completed game or at least they used to anyway point for this one is they don t do anything to actually get this game to release levels of quality since it s come out almost all of the main features of the game are still incomplete from the character creation to the story line to the clan management unless you use mods which brings me to point 2 2 the mods are the only reason and only way to play this game in any kind of enjoyable way you want to be a hireling and be a simple soldier to work your way up the ranks need a mod want to simply make a character not look like a patato person with fat clay lumps for limbs mod it baby want to be able to manage the clan you started and actually run it like a proper kingdom i submit to you a mod want to edit your friggin banner so it doesn t look like everyone elses and also have the actual icons of said banner be properly aligned on your shields and banners in banner lord you get a mod and you get a mod and you get a mod have i made my point yet nope it needs a friggin mod too in all seriousness though this game is un fun and barely playable without mods early access more like too early to tell without mods and the hero s who have been modding this game despite all of the mechanisms to do so being locked this game is still far from being playable imo and that s a huge problem beyond that though it seems as if tw is perfectly fine with this situation as they essentially rely on modders to do more development of their game than they do which leads me to point 3 in my what the tw rant 3 they aren t even developing their friggin game want to know what the latest patch does it fixes bugs i found 29 mentions of the word bug throughout the patchnotes and almost as many mentions of the words fixed and crash but you know what i didn t find additional content i expect bug fixes hell nioh 2 still hands out some bug fixes and their game is actually finished and a year or two old without competitive multiplayer but here s the thing tw still has to finish this game or so they say they patch their game like a company that has already finished the thing and is just maintaining it but it isn t finished folks and not by a looooong shot they added 4 new armors and some physics to reins some very minor additions to the campaign map incredibly small changes to quests such as making your brother finally act like every other npc in the game by the way that one was fixed by a mod back at the beginning of the year and this recent patch is just the latest in a long line of tiny little itty bitty changes to the game at a time this game will never be done at this rate it just won t to sum it all up don t buy this game unless you want to spend hours figuring out the mods you want downloading them off of nexus which is having it s own issues pissing off the modding community now and then figure out which ones even work anymore because without the mods this game is definitely not worth the price unless you come across a sale making htis thing 10 or less don t do it save your money spend it on games that actually get finished and just come and check on this in another year or two maybe then some actual progress will be made p s i m not mad i m just very disappointed
