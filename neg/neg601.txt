2022 i m a sucker for story driven western rpgs like baldur s gate tyranny elder scrolls dragon age mass effect kotor witcher disco elysium but despite looking great on paper divinity 2 doesn t deliver it starts off promising the characters are interesting and the dialogue is funny and witty i thought the combat sucked at first because i was low level and new to the game but after 65 hours i can safely say it doesn t improve significantly it s too hard even on classic normal difficulty enemies are always above my level and i end up having to cheese the battles just to get through the characters don t really get much deeper throughout the game the lore feels inconsistent and difficult to grasp quests are sometimes more cryptic than in morrowind don t get me wrong i love that the game doesn t hold my hand and have a quest marker on top of the character i should be talking to but it should still feel rewarding to play it s like the game punishes you for not playing it in a certain way i put as many points into persuasion and trying to be diplomatic manipulative but 1 i m usually just a little short of the needed value for a persuasion check even with enchanted trinkets 2 you get no exp from persuading your way through an encounter essentially you get punished for not fighting i made a nice diverse team with a tanky warrior mage for support and area damage archer and a rogue for more damage and ya know rogue shenanigans useless apparently i should just hyper specialize into a glass cannon pyromancer and have a bunch of tanks or some after 65 hours i don t care about the characters i feel like the story isn t going anywhere i don t understand the moral framework of the game like what is acceptable behavior according to whom and why and the combat isn t satisfying like i don t mind hard if it s ultimately rewarding but this ain t it chief disappointed the theme song is a bop tho
