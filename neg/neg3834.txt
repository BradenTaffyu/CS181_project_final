2017 early access review this game was fun at first enjoyed the challenge but then the frustrating things started these are things disappearing from my inventory zombies falling into walls when downed so you cant hit them and they get up and two hit kill you and the worst all the zombie spawning you can look around and see no zombies the suddenly a couple of seconds later one appears behind stuns you and thats it your dead and my personal favourite you can clear a house walk out of a room walk back in seconds later and hey presto not one but two or three of them so untill this is fixed i can not recomend this game
