2023 early access review after plenty of hours played first time was like the beta of the alpha it was actually a fun game which actually had some decent updated to a certain point after 10 years of staying in early access mode i can not advise anyone to play there hasn t been any game changing update or any new feature for some years now i m actually shocked after reading worldwide 14million sold which makes me think 14 000 000 x 20 currently 22 99 i brought it on a sale for like 18 that s why i just assume 20 for easier math 280 000 000 and this game is still in this state many bugs nothing new nothing special anymore i d advise to look elsewhere for some fun
