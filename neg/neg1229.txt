2017 comparing this game to the previous fallout games is a sad experience for everyone rpg elements have been greatly toned down in favor of more action and the mystery of the post apocalyptic america is no more boston and its surrondings the commonwealth aren t as interesting and mystical as mojave or even capital wasteland there are no top secret government bases hidden super weapons or luxurious post war societies it s a huge ruin with poor wastelanders in it even though synths present a nice ethical dilemma to the world of fallout the institute and the other new factions are quite boring and uninteresting the enclave and the caesar s legion from the previous games were so well designed that you couldn t help admire them even though they were the bad guys imagine the remnants of the u s government and an actual legion of post apocalyptic roman warriors now imagine a bunch of mad scientist stuck underground doing crazy experiments and dumping the failed ones to the surface the institute cannot compare with the enclave and the legion the game is actually very good in terms of combat mechanics and weapon modding system you can enjoy building your own weapons with a ton of different attachments and then kill a gang of raiders by yourself by said weapons sadly the legendary weapon system introduced in this game fails to meet the expectations legendary weapons defined by the game drop from every sort of strong creature and just have a random effect on top of a common weapon like a lazer rifle that shoots faster or a pistol that fires explosive bullets there are some named special legendary weapons but they don t have unique models and also just a common weapon with an effect honestly there are so many of these legendary items that they don t feel legendary at all as for armor same rules apply you can mod them to your pleasure and legendary ones are just crappy vanilla armors with random effects one thing i liked about this game more than the previous ones is the power armor you use them like a vehicle instead of wearing them like common armor from your inventory when you enter a power armor your hud changes and you get bonuses like increased carry weight bonus melee damage increased protection from everything including radiation and no falling damage you can mod power armor pieces like other armor which is also good i think power armors are my favourite things in this game graphics are decent they don t feel that old however this game is a very bad console port and is badly optimised there are so many issues with this game even though you have a good pc setup long loading times blurry textures that take ages to load weird alt tab issues and last but not least a bethesda classic a ton of bugs i can go on for hours writing this but i m getting tired so i ll just make a pros cons list pros good crafting system weapon and armor modding power armors combat system building your own settlements theme musics companions your character talkscons cliche story no karma system boring factions legendary weapons small map almost exclusively urban areas lacking content bad optimisation repetitive faction quests looking at you preston every other music than theme musics bugs obviously the commonwealth and its people are boring no character skills only perks only charisma checks in special dialogue options because there are no skills anymore bad dialogue system lacking in meaning and decision making companions become your slaves and live in your settlements farming and no personal life too much emphasis on american history mainly because we re in boston only two different game endings no slideshows about what happened after the end bethesda s dlc pricing policy workshop dlcs that should have been in the vanilla game very few decisions that affect you and the world and your other decisions factions are always pissed at each other no compromisethere are so many more but you get the general idea don t buy this game if you are an rpg gamer and liked the previous fallouts buy it if you are only looking for some action and want to shoot stuff in post apocalypse
