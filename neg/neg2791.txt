2022 the developers have a terrible habit of completely reworking huge aspects of their game that no one asked them to change and were often well liked in lieu of proper bugfixes balancing content updates that the community actually asks for or performance improvements after the third of such a rework i m quitting playing and abandoning the product 6 12 months ago i would ve given a more forgiving description of stellaris and suggested others maybe try it but even with the custodian initiative the game s developers continue to squander the miracle formula they ve stumbled upon they have no design vision for the game and periodically scramble its insides in a poor attempt to keep old playerbase interested and distracted from the fact that the game still runs terribly and and hasn t received any of their long requested features each time they introduce more bugs and imbalances and eventually their bloated systems are finally removed and reworked too don t give them your money i won t anymore
