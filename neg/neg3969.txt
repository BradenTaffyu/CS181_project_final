2017 one of the best sims i played that said it s past it s peak yes it cost money every month but that s ok the fact that they are spreading the playerbase now again with the new rallycross will hurt them in the long run races were already hard to fill up other than the 4most populair classes it s hasn t survived the time and is now falling behind big time that in the combination with a pretty fanboy rotten community that all act like sheeps i can t recommend this unless u have money enough and don t care for it i got a playseat tm steer with the shifter and pedals and trackir and some other stuff but if i compare that to the price of a real racecar these days ofc used ones then the difference is starting to become smaller and smaller cars are there starting around 1500 yes ofc trackdays cost more money but i think the reward will be bigger if u r doing it once in a while in real life then competing with other pixels on ur screen there are some more minor flaws with the game which haven t been taken care of for years now which is also no excuse instead of focusing on raceseries that will attract people and keep them there they just spreading them around the more and more classes which ofc cost more money if u want to race them cuz u need to buy other cars and maybe tracks if u don t have them already all in all this makes me choose for something else and turned me actually off of simracing in general so don t let it happen to you
