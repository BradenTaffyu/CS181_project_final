2020 hard to articulate how i feel about this game two years ago it was game of the year and deservingly so it was a finely crafted game that was the result of useful community feedback during early access however since the official release mt inexplicably treats the game as if it s still in early access sometimes making arbitrary changes sometimes making wholesale changes to core mechanics and sometimes incorporating community suggestions that make the game in some respects easier ironically they then later respond to those same community tweaks by introducing artificial difficulty all that i wanted to play was the game that i originally purchased which was labeled as an official release not early access any dlcs and now i can t play that game anymore without sacrificing the new content as well so thanks i guess the developers have really eroded my enthusiasm and i regret talking so many people into purchasing this you ve been warned the game you re purchasing now might not be the game you re playing a year from now either
