2022 everyone has been complaining about gem economy pack releases without secret packs and other such things today we ve gotten another huge update getting ever closer to the card pool we should have and they released an obscene like actually obscene amount of urs for actually bad decks you cannot and you will not be playing with new decks unless you are willing to drop hundreads of euros on it either do like the big streamers and yugitubers do or don t play new decks cuz konami sure as hell won t let you play em nicely tl dr the fanbase has been complaining for a while about konami being a bunch of greedy devs with ideas konami decided to double down with their practices 2024 edit if you wonder if it got better since my hours more than doubled since my initial review no it got worse it is an absolute joke if you check any release date decks they are actually fair to build whereas if you search for any new releases they are more expensive than many duel links decks obviously this is an unfair comparasion since md still has better f2p features like crafting but the situation is just really bad if you are looking for playing with friends using a non komoney affiliated product will prolly be better
