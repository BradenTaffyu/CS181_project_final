2023 i loved mount blade warband and theoretically i also enjoy bannerlord but there s a number of issues that are never addressed and a number of problems that continually crop up the issues taleworlds seemed to have implemented a bunch of features into bannerlord on the wouldn t it be cool if principle this adds in a bunch of things to do in the game except that s as far as most of those features go you can find lists of all the things to do anywhere unfortunately the vast majority of these features are extremely shallow everything from criminal organizations to diplomacy looks rich and developed but in actual practice is very limited in what you can do with it or in the case of things like blacksmithing totally depends on rng you can engage with a feature thinking that it s going to be something that adds to depth of play only to realize that no there s no depth to it and it takes about 5 minutes to figure out how it works so you can use manipulate it to your advantage or to realize that it does nothing and abandon it take those crime bosses you can meet in cities for instance doing jobs for them builds up your reputation with the boss you work for and you can eventually help them take over their city by eliminating the other bosses what does that get you a few coins can you work to set yourself up as a new kingpin running your own criminal organization and reaping the benefits of it no can you leverage the crime boss that you just secured sole domination of a city for into helping you take over the city militarily no does it provide any benefit at all or even have an in depth system that engages from a roleplaying perspect no the bugs the main bug and the one i m dealing with right now after coming back to bannerlord after a few months break is that taleworlds has the habit of breaking the game with every other patch break it is such a way that a substantial portion of their playerbase can t even get the game to start this tends to happen literally every other patch or so which then necessitates either rolling back to a version of the game that did work or waiting the 2 3 months for them to actually patch the problem tl dr wide as the ocean shallow as a puddle and tw keeps breaking their own game and taking months to get it working again barely acceptable as early access and definitely not acceptable as a full release title avoid this game for a couple more years
