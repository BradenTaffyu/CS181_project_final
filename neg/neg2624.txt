i don t play any modes besides offline franchise and there is a massive bug for me where the game crashes if you save it during the draft it s corrupted 2 season already sure it could be on me for draft scumming but if that s how i want to play that s my choice even without the bug the ui is very laggy slow and i have a high powered laptop so i know it isn t an issue on my end when it can run games like warhammer max graphics without any issue there shouldn t be a black loading screen screen to see your coaches your stats your roster your depth chart and every other literal menu sure that is 4 5 seconds but still every screen menu transition is dragging i will admit most of the franchise changes have been nice but the crash bug is unacceptable i am not a product tester i am a customer your game should be released without bugs like this especially when franchise mode is the feature the worked so hard to improve easports if it s in the game it will break the game
