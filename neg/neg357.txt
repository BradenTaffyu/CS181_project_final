2022 after 3200 hours since b e t a i think it s time to tell anyone who s new or plans to come to the 76 universe my thoughts on the game and how it evolved in 4 years to what it is today i m choosing to write a review here because it s probably the only place bethesda cannot delete any criticism unlike the official discord and now the retired official forums where moderators erase any post that resembles anything else but a praise to their games since this will be a mostly negative review i m going to start with the cons instead of the pros here 1 communication with the player base exists as long as the player base does not criticize the features of the game as they were designed by bethesda after 2 years of testing the changes on live servers with disastrous consequences a public test server has been made available to the fans but still the bugs make it to live servers and the feedback is mostly ignored by bethesda all in all it s a yeah we hear you but we re going to do things our way anyway because we know better 2 every patch is a russian roulette it may break some minor things or may take out the game entirely for a couple of hours days depending on the severity there is no patch that doesn t mess something up 3 development is atrociously slow took them 2 years to bring npcs to the game one year and a half to bring the bos questline another 2 years to bring the expeditions to the pitt the new content is also becoming less and less polished and feels more like we need to copy something from the older fallouts so we can keep people interested lately it seems they do the bare minimum when adding new content because sometime ago they put on the roadmap and they can t postpone it anymore 4 there is an overpriced shop and a subscription fee both are optional but without them you ll be missing some important quality of life features the shop items are rotating thus you don t know when something you like may be available again and that s how they create the fear of missing out putting pressure on you to buy it right now some goes with special offers for a limited time and regardless of the subscription the really cool stuff will be available in bundles that can only be bought with real money it s not quite 16x times the details but it s definitely 16x times the cost or more if you re not careful 5 there is a new battlepass every three months it s called a season every season we get daily and weekly challenges that force you to login almost everyday if you want to get the cool rewards and those cool rewards are among the last on the battlepass sure there might be one or two in the middle to keep you going but if you really want the good stuff you need to finish the season it s considered new content used to be cosmetic only now they re adding actual items to it so if you don t wanna grind like crazy afterwards you d better login daily and finish your battlepass they re designed to keep the players paying the subscription when there is no actual content being released 6 it s a looter shooter in the end the endgame is getting good gear but unfortunately this too has a major twist welcome to casino 76 where you will re roll everyday for a limited amount of course the stats on your gear legendary gear has a maximum of 3 attributes let s say you need a good chest piece and rolled the dice you got 1 good attribute and 2 crappy ones next time you roll you do not get to keep the good attribute you roll again all 3 chances are you ll get 3 crappy ones and get pissed getting a good set of armor with the perfect stats could take you years i am not joking next game that i buy with such mechanics inside it will be a straight refund 7 nerfs every year or so bethesda decides to break something willingly in the name of balance or in layman s terms whatever the kids on reddit are crying about i will not get into everything which was nerfed to the ground like melee and now explosive combined with what i ve said in the earlier phrase at no 6 after gambling for a long time to get your desired legendary when you see it nerfed into oblivion you ll be one angry customer 8 now we go into the dark side which is stricly related to the gambling mechanics on gear and broken balance in the game since day 1 the dark side is the black market the illegal trading of items for real money regardless of any speculation bethesda is in on it too it is real and it s breaking the game hacked items duped items things that were never supposed to be in the game are available to buy and use hell there are even legit items for sale say you need a full set of armor and you re looking for certain attributes on it will you spend years trying to get it yourself and by that time probably the thing is obsolete anyway or will you be tempted to buy it online 9 pvp many veterans of the fallout franchise are not avid pvp ers so i suppose this was implemented for getting the attention of other types of players to the game it s something they ve been toying with since day 1 and failed in all possible manners from game modes that got scrapped like survival free for all pvp and nuclear winter battle royale to forced pvp in certain areas of the map also pvp is plagued by black market items without a proper set of armor weapons and consumables any regular player has absolutely no chance of making it 10 pve for a new player there is enough to do to keep you busy for a good amount of time it s not as bad as it was 4 years ago but the content is limited to some degree the real problem is what the future looks like new content is becoming less and less exciting what do i mean by that well the first world boss was flying the second world boss was walking now the third world boss isn t even moving see where i m getting at wastelanders brought npcs to the game and it was a major and a good change then the brotherhood of steel arrived but it was way less content there next we had the pitt which is a glorified dungeon and now they re bringing a very over simplified version of nuka world from fallout 4 into 76 and they ll keep doing that put up the minimum amount of work into features as long as the subscriptions keep rolling in here comes the pros now 1 you can shoot super mutants with a mg 42 machine gun while you re chugging down nuka cola quantums and flying in your power armor like you re aluminium man basically you can go do whatever the hell you want as long as it puts a smile on your face conclusion take it with a grain of salt this is fallout 4 multiplayer with pretty colors and a ton of bugs what todd howard said in an interview a while back sums it up pretty good we sold 12 million copies of fallout 4 and now we can t reach those players anymore and by that he meant reaching their wallets they ve tried with creation club but anyone in their right mind would get free mods instead 76 is the answer it s where they can put up a shop and slap a subscription fee to a beloved franchise everything is done so you ll spend more time in game and buy buy buy and then buy some more that s why there is no mod support even if they promised it a long time ago that s why there are artificial problems created in game like the limits on stash size and the durability of items so they can sell you the solutions of course you re not forced to buy them but every year they tease you with the benefits of having a subscription and give you little doses of quality of life for free in the shop just like a dealer they try to hook you up and then milk you dry so be careful buy it on discount and use it at your own risk go through the story because now there is one have some fun but don t make the mistake of getting too attached to it and have great expectations you ll only be hurt in the long run
