2021 its a great game but after they added the 2k launcher the game is constantly crashing its not possible to play with friends online one of us needs to restart the game every few minutes and every few turns the game needs to synchronize again also only problems when trying to join lobbys while having more dlcs active this worked fine before they somehow managed to break the game 2k can go itself one of the worst publishers
