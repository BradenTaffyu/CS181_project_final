2023 while i love the sims and this entry certainly runs smoother and looks better with better character customization that s where the good things about this game stop it still costs hundreds of dollars to buy all the dlc for this game and let me tell you that they ve made everything into a dlc want a pet dlc want to take your sims out to a restaurant sometimes during the week like a normal person would do dlc want to pretty much do anything with your sims besides have them sit at home or wait for them to come back from working a job dlc it s after you play for a while and decide you want to start doing things that you realize you actually can t do sh until you buy some dlc this game has been out for years and there still isn t a bundle with all the dlc i m not going to buy a single pack ea you damn buffoons i would have been happy to spend up to like 100 total on this game but now i will stick with the free version and not spend a dime on the stupidly overpriced dlc i would rather download all the dlc illegally than pay you hundreds for it honestly i d recommend you just play sims 3 because there is a ton of included content compared to this game
