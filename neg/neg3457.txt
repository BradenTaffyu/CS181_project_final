i love the game and played for more than 200 hours i bought the game after release but after buying it and watching my brother play he pre purchased the ultimate edition i felt bad about not having any way to get the additional maps that are on it besides buying another copy of the game then i read about it and tampere is only pre purchase also after playing for so many hours and trying to figure out how to increase tourism i realized that i didn t pre purchase the game so i also don t get to use the landmarks in my city tourism is quite limited to only four buildings some that look ridiculous in my current city tbh this feels wrong specially on a game that had such a bumpy release can t recommend the game as it is right now sadly i hope the post gets some attention as i d like these issues addressed by the developers not the community it s a punishing newcomers there s still lots of work to do specially if you build a city with public transportation systems hard to select each line hard to rename the connections stations or you try to build with tunnels avoid if possible inside a mountain you ll need to slope considerably i played a map with considerable elevation and makes things quite complicated with the slope there are many things not explained an i think that the community will have to build guides around it also spent hours trying to build a dam it follows very specific conditions and you don t get any way to measure the output until you get the water at a certain level meaning most likely you fail except you re on a cascade waterfall in one of my cities it didn t work because the river split the output of the dam was almost nothing when it had 200mt by at least 50 metres tall thanks for reading the game is still entertaining and deserves a positive score eventually i admire the work put out it s just some things are unexpected cheers
