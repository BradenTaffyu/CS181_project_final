2023 tldr it s a decent game the story is alright but it s filled to the brim with cutscenes and dialog tons of fetch quests about 25 30 hours of main story which goes by quickly i m not impressed by the graphics whatsoever and i still suffer a lot with lag spikes and glitches even tho i have a decent computer detailed review the main story gets sorta boring quite quick it s a lot of get this for me or speak with quests feels a lot like filler rather than actual main stuff getting side quests and main story mixed up is really easy combat is fun in the beginning but as time goes it gets monotonous and it s about 60 of the game the finale boss battle is probably the best one yet unbelievable tedious dialog and cutscenes take up a lot of the game which isn t an issue for me normally but it drags out in hogwarts legacy you can t really pick up any quests without having to go through 1 5 minutes dialog or a cutscenes of sorts which also counts for the side quests or the many extra things to do such as the merlin challenges something i really enjoy is spending time with magical beasts it s dull but enjoyable and generally working on the room of requirement is really relaxing once you ve collected everything colleting can be a big part of the game it s not necessary whatsoever but it s a good break from questions if you re expecting some connections between harry potter and hogwarts legacy dont buy the game there s a few similarities and easter eggs but not nearly enough for buying it and no theres no option of any romance in the game none so don t buy it for that either my biggest issue with the game is how bad it is to play on pc even after a few updates and patches i m still suffering with a lot of lag spikes map glitches and delayed gameplay i have a pretty solid gaming computer that runs most games not hogwarts legacy tho not even on low or medium settings
