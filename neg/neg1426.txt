2020 early access review i bought this game for the single player and it hurts me to say that i don t like it that much i ve been waiting for so long only a small hand full of maps that makes the game feel repetitive you have to fight battles against enemies that you will easily crush over and over making the game feel repetitive most of the time battles are extremely one sided i find that an army of 70 rarely beats an army of say 100 meaning there is very little incentive to take the risk it s not fun there are basically no times where you win a battle that is slightly against you there are no upsets strategy and tactics are not very important charge beats smaller army pretty much edit these numbers are loose obviously not talking about facing looters here sieges honestly piss me off my men do not do what i want why my army is divided into tiny sections that i don t decide my archers just stand there with their mouths open getting riddled with arrows and refuse to shoot back i bring all me men to ones side of the castle to climb ladders but they would rather run all the way across to a ladder a mile away and trickle in so the enemy can kill them easily i wish i could point at ladders they are allowed to use or not allowed to use buying shops feels really weak not a lot to do other than attack bandits siege castles which is a pain or join a kings army and do the first two things i have been so excited about this game since it was first announced and i know it s not done but currently i m disappointed it s pretty much warband but with crafting and better graphics i pray this review ages badly
