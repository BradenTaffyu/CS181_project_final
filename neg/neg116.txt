2021 early access review if you came to this game for multiplayer experience don t bother mp for current version is in year and half lasting development and it will take more if you came to this game for singleplayer experience don t bother as well it s fun for like 40 hours of grind but after you set up a nice base and stock supplies you suddenly realize there is nothing to do as npcs were promised for circa 6 7 years and will never be implemented i personally then felt like i have wasted all the time doing the grind because after the grind there is no fun summary huge potential wasted by developers core mechanics that were promised years ago are still missing game has been in ea for 8 years now great modding community is propably worth the price if you don t mind feeling dissapointed in the endupdate so we are in june almost 4 months after i originally posted the review according to their dev blogs the multiplayer is still far from done saying they are still fixing the zombie issues which they were doing 4 months ago they haven t even got to the cars which they say are messed up i am open to betting on how much longer is the developmnet going to take my take is at least another 4 6 months update 2 ok so now the multiplayer is in and it is kinda fun but still no npcs in sight it just still lacks the longevity of the gameplay and it is still all grind no fun so i will change the review to positive once the npcs will be added update 3 so it is 2024 now and guess what absolutely no npcs in sight they are gonna release b42 this year which contains animals and crafting overhaul sooo who asked for this add the npcs ffs you can bet me in the comments but considering they will spend like another 2 years bugfixing their bugged update as they always do i wager that npcs will maybe be added in 2027
