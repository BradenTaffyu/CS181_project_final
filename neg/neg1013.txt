2015 fallout 4 within my first hours i was blown away it was a new experience it was fun and i was loving it probably about 15 hours in i started to notice the flaws and oh boy is there a lot of them the building mechanic is probably my least favorite thing about this game it honestly feels like something they chucked in last minute to make the game more unique don t get me wrong if done right it could have been a welcome addition to the game but it was not done right its a clunky mess finding the right materials takes a long time too long worse yet it forces you to do it for certain quests so if you can t find one bit of oil then you can t progress anymore next the quests the quests are the worst from any bethesda game ever dull and repetitive very uninspired and lack luster i found myself doing the exact same quests over and over and over with minor differences be it the enemies you are sent to kill or the location you are going to next the main story now the main story was spoiled everywhere so obviously i m not going to enjoy it as much that being said it was weak it was very very weak at the end of the game my honest to god thoughts were oh that was it that was the end i guess very unsatisfying there are aspects i like about this game though i find the power armor and weapon customization really fun using power armor is always a blast and finding new sets is a treat my final verdict i think this game was very very overhyped i played into the hype and was excited as a little kid at christmas but oh boy was i dissapointed its not a bad game its just not the game we expected bethesda can do much better then this edit after around 75 hours i have no more quests left well real quests anyway i am doing the same 3 quests over and over again i have gone town to town settlement to settlement looking for a new quest i don t remember a single bethesda game has had me searching for quests another thing that has left me utterly dissapointed is the lack of again real quests so after 75 hours i have reached my end to fallout 4 there is nothing left for me to do other than start a new character but i just dont want to do that goodbye fallout 4 edit 2 after a long time i ve finally come back and visited this game i ve put some serious hours into it and it s better the second time around it is still very flawed and i still agree with all of my previous points if you played this game previously and didn t enjoy it i reccomend giving it another go it s more enjoyable the second time
