2017 not worth buying just wait till it has 1 2 expansions not that single civ dlc crap and it is fixed up and running good better buy civ 5 full edition and play that while waiting for this one to be playable this game eithers works ok if you are very lucky or its is bugged like hell me and my wife loved to play civ 5 so around december we went and got civ6 deluxe edition so we can play it together for us it was hell since the start first the damn deluxe bonus we should have got just did not work the game simply did not show aztec civ and also the few civ that they released since then had the same problem vikings poland australia persia and macedonia simply did not work even if we can see them in game as installed they just don t show up as playable and we did a fresh install after every patch or new civ and all the things we found on diferent forums about that missing civ bugs one day aztec vikings and poland simply poped up as playable civs sill waiting for the others civs to work other then that the entire game seems more like a beta version at best resources seem to get bugged out and you either get them or not at random on every turn enemy civs gets stuck and denouces you non stop over and over the entire game or can attack you even if you ar not at war with them
