2022 i m speechless the sheer audacity of bioware ea i was hyped for this expansion for months and then it got delayed alright happens you know it s gonna be fine i thought then the day came it was here i downloaded the patch paid for game time and waited i was ready now that i have played it let me tell you it was horrible the expansion is only around 2 hours of content and most of it is fighting through dozens and dozens of enemies aside from that it s a buggy mess and the last bossfight is nearly unplayable i tried to beat it 8 9 times before i got through all because of a fall damage bug i wasn t the only one as other players in the chat were having the same problem this expansion was a cash grab and makes onslaught look like shadow of revan what the hell happened here who greenlighted this i m almost certain it was made by 4 interns or some leftovers from the anthem team don t pay for this wait for the next patch expansion 10 year anniversary my ass
