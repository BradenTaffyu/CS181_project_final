2021 the performance is trash there is a known memory leak on the pc version and the devs have been very hush about it i have tried many fixes but even on window mode at lowest resolution and lowest graphic settings with all the reddit user hotfixes like allowing more virtual memory and disabling steam overlay disable nvidia and xbox game bar and yet an i7 9700k 32gb ram and a 3080 series card gradually drops to 20fps with 2 second freezes horizon 4 had many issues as well so my spidey senses are telling me the issues will never be fixed i hope that i m wrong but the past speak louder than words
