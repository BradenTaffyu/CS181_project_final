2015 i used to play hours on this game from 9pm to 4am straight yes that was how fun it was back then paradox has apparently followed suit and adopted business practices ahem ea ahem ca ahem ubisoft ahem you know what i m talking about the common sense dlc and update basically made this game barebones now i had to mod the game e g complete colonial control extended timeline etc to actually have fun when the art of war dlc and update came out i was actually ok with it because it didn t up the game at all updates are supposed to improve the game not to slap your customers in the face whilst stripping the game of content and basically asking hey you buy our new dlc jesus christ paradox is greedy now don t get me wrong this game is amazing a benchmark for grand strategy but until these shady business practices stop i advise you not to buy this game at its current state paradox interactive please listen to your customers don t be greedy douchbags it s trully a sad that gaming as come to this
