2017 absolute cash grab don t waste your money on this ugly looking guns and crappy rpg mechanics all four dialogue options can be summed up to yes no yes maybe yes and why also yes one of the devs even confirmed that this was intentional because he hated having to think and dialogue in general when it comes to video games every bethesda title gets dumber with each iteration this game doesn t deserve the fallout name wait until there s a goty edition that costs 20 or less when a game requires community made mods to make it enjoyable it isn t worth your time
