2019 so the game is okay i think civ 5 and 4 were better so i would recommend those over this that the previous games did things better is of course personal opinion yet there is another reason i would not recommend this there is a disturbing attempt to change a personally owned game into the new games as a service by forcing an updated user agreement that did not exist at the launch of the game and if you like having your files personal or dont want to agree to give them the information they want then you cant play the game anymore thats a very shady move to think that all they need to do to take away ownership or how you play a game no matter how old the game is is just to update a new user agreement that would be like nintendo in the 80 s locking a nes copy of super mario with radio waves and not letting you play it unless you mailed them a signed letter the letter saying that you agreed to hand over your address book and photo album if they decided they wanted it in return for letting you play your ummm actually now its their game thats insane id rather vote with my wallet and play a less intrusive game it was brought to my attention that the older games were also updated with this policy so if you want the avoid that check it out if you are ok with the policy i would still recommend the older games as a matter of personal preference
