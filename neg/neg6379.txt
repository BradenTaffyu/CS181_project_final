2022 forza horizon 5 looks great has a lot of content and lets you roam a big varied map and is ruined by the absolute shameful unforgivable ai or lack thereof see the drivatars you race against are a complete lie there is no ai there is no intelligence non human cars do not obey the same physic as you do they follow the racing line at a preset speed which depends on the difficulty setting as if they were on rails no matter what car they re in only once you are very close to them does physic start to influence them at which point they completely forget how to drive and usually brake even if in a straigh road so your only chance to win at higher difficulty level is to take the lead very early usually in the first few corners by dive bombing and ramming failing that once the lead car get a couple of seconds in front of you you always start a race mid pack so you re always at a disadvantage you can forget about catching up just restart the race and ram harder oh and obviously they cheat they accelerate much faster than you and in the off chance you get a significant lead they rubberband back to you at insane speeds of course you can lower the difficulty at which point the game becomes a walk in the park not fun either it is such a shame because forza horizon 5 is a fun car game but a terrible racing game edit and to add insult to injury the game is full of bugs some small some progression breaking all annoying some of them having existed for months and the devs don t seem to give a flying about it
