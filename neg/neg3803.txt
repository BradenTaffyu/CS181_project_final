2018 early access review i love this game and have recommended it to many friends things i enjoyed the grind of using the skills to slowly upgrade in those skills areas digging construction mining looting stamina and it truly felt rewarding you would be able to suddenly build a new item or feature on your base and felt like it rewarded you for that time and effort the work to craft gun parts or assemble bike parts awesome fun you had to explore and look in certain areas of towns to hope to find something you need the feeling when i found the recipe i wanted was so relieving i would run back to base and start building what i had been trying to for days good food was hard to come by and that made the game brilliant you had to plan in advance your day and what was more important parts or food it was awesome to build up inventories of these things seeing other people online was an awesome sketchy time it was big enough that you did not see them often but you could stand back and observe follow them if you wanted etc multiplayer was fun again pretty much everything in the world was useful dirt rocks everythingthese are some of the many aspects of 7dtd i really enjoyed it felt like you were surviving unofrtunately in patch a17 it does not seem to have all those unique parts of the game in fact they seemingly completely overhauled many things not sure why the crafting system has now become a standard perk system it seems way to casual i miss the old experience upgrade points no more assembling of certain items you just find guns easily too much good loot is easy to find zombies spawn in your view so you clear out an area only to have multiple zombies spawn in so much food i had about 20 meat items from one animal it used to be 2 3 i feel like they have purposely made loot gathering easy so you can build a base faster to defend by the first 7th day horde it was punishing before and you had to plan carefully how to survive the 7th day i would just dig tunnels early on then have to hide the evidence of zombies pounding the dirt in case someone noticed the disturbance and guessed there might be a base underground i don t know perhaps i will try again but this new patch really killed that survival feeling i had before i really don t know why the devs felt a need to completely overhaul the crafting system not just a few changes but completely change it so it is now a very different game they could have simply tweaked many of the a16 4 items to improve the game i doubt they will reverse the complete overhaul from what i read so i will try again in 5 6 months but otherwise i can t recommend this latest version of the game shame it was my favourite survival game
