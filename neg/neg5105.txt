2017 great game but the business model with dlc is abusive and borderline disrespectful to clients to have all the content you would have to spend twice as much money on dlc as what the base game cost that is a ridiculous paywall to put in place games should be updated for free to some extent for example blood its a war game with no blood unless you pay a 5 dlc go figure even the wood elves a major faction are the 1st dlc when they should have been in base game or added later on for free
