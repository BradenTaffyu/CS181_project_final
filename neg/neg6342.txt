2023 skip to the end for the summary if you don t feel like reading all of this the castle with hogwarts legacy you really won t find much to do with hogwarts itself despite the fact that you play as a student nearly all of the game itself takes place far away from hogwarts nearly all of the side quests that you will recieve is either some kind of collect the thing or fight this guy over on the other side of the map quests in hogwarts are usually just classes which feels lame considering how impressive the level design actually is for the castle there are passageways and secret areas everywhere unique puzzles exclusive to the castle you ll even find a guy walking sideways on the wall interesting how your character doesn t become super jacked at the end of it from running on all those stairs the queststhere are three student questlines one for gryffindor hufflepuff and slytherin seems they spent their budget on the ravenclaw line pasting the same 5 merlin trials over and over again all three are just them being overly trusting with their life story and when you finish one of their quests they never let you go on to the next one not even giving a locked quest or anything so basically we have this insane plan and we ll need to find the place and find out the truth at the bottom but meh i ll send you an owl or something though i will say sebastians storyline was more interesting and had much more depth than the main storyline main storyline itself is pretty lame goblins want equality and freedom from oppression and your job is to go around on a rampage and kill them wow i m such a hero there s also a bunch of keeper trials which are actually fleshed out dungeons with mixes of combat and puzzles even an actual boss fight but why none of this information through these quests and cutscenes actually matters because the goal of the game is to kill a guy there is no changes in plot other than a death scene at the end which felt thrown in because wow noooo time to cry i guess despite the character being super minor overall the main characterthe unisex main character is just a mary sue everything they do is right perfect they re good at everything they get exclusive right to the room of requirement instantly a master at wandwork and spells planting making potions et cetera they also just don t stop talking ever every location even a pile of rocks will have some form of pointless dialogue from the character even in the last cutscene for the house cup awards there is no recognition for the house you chose theres little difference at all in the game apart from one quest in the first two hours of the game in all the bloat they recorded for the npc s and the main character you d think they would mention something about you being in the house you are in nope in fact they don t even announce the name of your house when you win the house cup they say this students house while you stand there awkwardly in the hall when everyone else is sitting down what a terrible wrap up the combati played the game on the hardest difficulty and so should you as the game really isn t that hard to begin with you ll even have potions that make it even easier bosses themselves have like two attacks and dodging is way more fun than parrying with protego i don t really use combos that often bc the enemies die quick anyways bu the shields enemies have are pretty annoying because this guy has a yellow circle around him i have to make sure i have a slot or two dedicated to spells that can get through that and even when the guy hasn t fully got up from the attack they ll always re protego and now its time to either put another purple spell in or wait and dodge before you can hit him again combat is boring and tedious also ashwinder poacher ranger spell spam there is no consequence for using unforgivable spells like mind control stun and insta death even characters won t say any relevant things about it other than i didn t like that in the books and movies people who use those spells are sent to azkaban for the rest of their lives but not you even the people still treat you like a glorious hero despite being a genocidal maniac no better than the enemies the worldthe world is scattered with map markers and camps and merlin trials and spider nests and blah blah blah there is no filter option in the map to hide all the stupid treasure dungeons the world is scattered with bloat copy pasted merlin trials which there are 95 of and all have an unskippable identical cutscene at the end of them why i feel like the game would breathe much better if they dropped the open world and only focused on hogwarts hogsmeade and maybe a couple close surroundings like the forbidden forest i like getting all achievements in a game before i close the book on it and boy was this painful the conclusionhogwarts legacy is yet another open world game filled with bloat and pointless fetch quests most puzzle solutions are just given to you by main character self talk and most of them you ll find identical replicas everywhere if you d like to play as a student seek elsewhere because 99 of the game is outside of the castle in random stretched out areas little about this game is actually fun and performance wise the game is choppy and drops frames quite frequently even with the reccomended specs and 32 gb of ram combat is annoying and easy and nothing you do or who you are matters this is a rushed game and you shouldn t buy it
