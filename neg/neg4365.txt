2016 i m a huge civilization fan and have been since i first played civ ii many years ago every single civ game since civ ii has been able to provide me with that just one more turn feeling at launch despite any shortcomings or bugs that needed to be ironed out with patches or expansions i ll even include beyond earth in that statement sure it had it s flaws but it had me coming back for more turns just not as many as iv or v did i m sad to say civ vi does not provide me with that same feeling at launch there are numerous issues that i have with the game some of these issues i recognize as being based on my personal tastes rather than any fault on the developers part but the majority of the major issues i have seem to be common complaints i ve seen here and elsewhere and sadly ignored or swept aside by professional reviewers the ui is woefully inefficient compared to the ui s in iv and v while i appreciate the drive to try something new and i admit i fell very hard for v s ui and design i love art deco designs the ui feels less like a fully fleshed out idea and more like something that is still in the beta stage being tweaked and primed before launch tooltips really need a lot of work the map and fog of war design can be a bit of an eyesore and confusing to boot while i m fine with the map design for undiscovered territory the fog of war either needs a color change or complete revamp as it can be confusing and a bit of an eye sore in determining what features and resources lay within the fog of war as well as where the fog of war ends and where the undiscovered portion of the map begins the diplomacy options while improved huge fan of the casus belli feature still need some tweaking ai players can ask you to remove your troops from their border but you re unable to make the same request why speaking of ai it still needs a lot of work here s a good example an ai player will ask you to enter a joint war with them you agree the very next turn the very same ai player will denounce you as a warmonger uhhhhh what you are given no clear indication how diplomatic bonuses and penalties work beyond a vague war monger 15 etc tooltip when ai leaders denounce you their animation screen loads you see their denunciation then another screen loads where until you meet a particular research requirement your only option is to say goodbye i know some people hated the way civ v s diplomacy worked but i miss it quite a bit compared to this convoluted yet barebones method of telling me that cleopatra doesn t think i have a very large army every few turns honestly this whole issue could be solved by not forcing me to watch an animation prior to making a choice every time another civ wants to denounce me or make me an offer the great people and policy cards feel really sparse while i think the new system shows promise it s really aggravating to see the list of cards popup and feel like art assets for each great person or policy wasn t included or ready for launch while i think the new mechanics like city districts and the new policy mechanics sounded cool pre launch i find myself often confused as to how exactly they and their bonuses work due to the lack of aforementioned tooltips i get that as i play more my understanding of them will grow but it s really frustrating to have to figure it out this way whereas previous firaxis titles were much much better at communicating how core game mechanics worked i m hoping that i can eventually change this review to a recommend in the coming months but for right now i realize that while i m in the minority i cannot heartedly recommend this game until it gets some serious tlc from firaxis there s a great base here for what i think can be a truly fantastic addition to the civ series it just needs a lot of work to get there i hope firaxis can eventually fix these issues and make this the game i know they re capable of making buy at your own risk for now
