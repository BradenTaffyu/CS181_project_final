2018 i ve been playing this franchising since eu2 i ve played also knights of honor stellaris victoria ii ckii hearts of iron ii iii iv all in all it s the best game in this category however being monopoly in the industry made paradox greedy they literally have expanded so much for the recent years they aren t the company as i ve known them before dlc policy and pricing are kinda joke for students like me i haven t got a constant income but i could buy their games in the past nowadays i cannot play full game because of their pricing policy it s very ridiculuous they can implement many features without enlist a price lots of new dlcs and features do not have radical engine changing variations for the game i really don t understand if you have budget there is no game else satisfy you like this series but until you have possibility to buy this game stay away from paradox they aren t different than ea games or ubisoft they lost their credibility in my mind
