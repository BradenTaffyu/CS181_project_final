2018 for years now i have loved and played all the total war games i have spent countless hours enjoying every single second i have spent playing any game in the total war series however i refuse to sit back and do nothing after seeing staff from creative assembly publicly talk down to the very people that make up this community and tell them mod them out or just not play and to also issue such an asinine statement total war games are historically authentic not historically accurate by bringing your politics into this series you have destroyed the ability to remove ourselves from reality our escape from the normality and chaos of the real world has now been integrated into the very hide away we once held by doing this you have started to erode at the essence that is a game so i will leave this here as a reminder that on this day yet another series that i had long held in such high regard has finally fallen
