2016 to start the review i have to confess that i wasn t a good paradox fan till last year i played cracked version of their games for years hoi2 eu3 vic2 hoi3 eu4 ck2 etc that s my sin and i redeemed it by buying almost all of them in recent 2 years i feel i could say farewell to my pirate gaming days and be a legal and good gamer with respect thus i bought stellaris on launch day with full pirce as the first such try in my gaming experience with paradox i played it as crazy till 40 hours later when a strong feeling of being fooled stormed my mind this game as in its current status though with best graphics in paradox games is only skeleton fleshless and souless i only state one of its many problems lack of content the early game could be fun meaning you explore and expand and plan cautiously yet after a certain point there s nothing left to do except repeatitive micro management there is no advanced development since you can only manage 5 to 7 stars and building types are quite limited there is no advanced governance since most of your empire has to be governed by sectors but you only have minimum interactions with them like energy focus and mineral focus plus their ai is dumb as hell there is no intense fighting since 1 corvette is extremly op you don t really need bigger ships 2 formation tactics strategy supply lines morale and meaningful defence facilities don t exist 3 combat ai doesn t exist as well the only model of war is chase your enemy all around the map due to no supply lines and real defence or chokepoint grind them automatically no tactics formation morale land troops on their planet repeat after your doomstack finishes their doomstack war is in fact over no rebuilding a proper fleet no guerrilla tactics no desperate defence of their home planet nothing thre is no politics since the only functional factions are only separatists and you can easily crack down their hopless revolt by adding more cheap garrisons no cry for the change of government no pursuit for another religion no independence desire from sectors nothing there is no trade literally no you can t ship extra food from one planet to another you can t build markets or trading posts let alone trade routes you don t have any ethics or government types with anything raleted to the concept of trade there is no espionage literally no spy no steal tech no incite revolt no support independence nothing there is no advanced diplomacy since only really functional options are war and alliance federation without it there s almost no way for fleet access and tech co operation while the later is unfinished and bugged you want crisis system in vic 2 h r e system in eu 3 4 feudal relationships in ck2 sorry but you must be dreaming yes there are some end game crisises like the mongol invasion in ck2 but in this universe no one really cares and above is only my incomplete conclusion of one of major problems of this game i know paradox fanboys would argue it s just normal for paradox s game on release status paradox will gradually patch the game and add more and more contents to it over time but the issue is they made a shallow beta with just too few features and contents and sell it as if it s finished then maybe 1 or 2 years later after several overprieced dlc milking we as their free qa employees will finally get the full game after paying maybe 100 or 200 bucks with tears and gratitude i have admired the ambition of stellaris and looked foward to promises made by paradox i have tried to understand and tolerate the dlc milking practice made by paradox since its base games at least seem finished and are even with some suprisingly good features sadly it seems it s a new routine for devs to release unfinished games with full pirce and charge players for so called dlcs which are actully cut off contents of base game paradox is just one of them suddenly i feel guilty of buying a full priced legal game for the first time not for the loss of 40 bucks but for my openly contirbution to the suicidal greed of a once wonderful game developer
