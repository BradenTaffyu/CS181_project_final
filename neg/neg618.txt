2018 this game had potential in the beginning but that potential quickly deteriorated with progression through this nightmare i ve played tabletop rpgs for 10 years and some crpgs such as planescape torment neverwinter nights 1 2 ultima and pillars of eternity and the presentation of divinity original sin 2 had me interested here s my take on this game pros pleasant artstyle and shaders dialogue between playable characters themselves and npcs are interesting and engaging crisp sound effects and battle animations mix match freely with abilities not locked to starter class cons very unbalanced encounters game mechanics forces you to stack one damage type and play heavily on meta knowledge resurrection is not possible without scrolls no option to raise the dead after combat or by holy building in towns teleportation skills sometimes breaks the game loot is boring and uninspired crafting is cluttered and needlessly obscuring now into a bit of the nitty gritty parts the game has good visual quality decent voice acting with the exception of the created character s voices and allows for varied characterisation with the mix match style of abilities these aspects combined makes for a more natural character progression and development as the story unfolds later on when combat becomes more of a focus the problems are quickly apparent i understand the idea behind having a physical armor pool and magical armor pool to block each type of damage status effects the inherent problem with this design is that it forces the player to put all damage into one type to overcome only one armor type with some simple math many players including me have concluded that a full physical party is the dominant setup leaving one member as a hybrid for times when enemies have no magical armor and can be slowed down with one spell however physical abilities are more reliable to disable and lockdown multiple enemies over magical abilities a downside of having a pure magic caster are surfaces which is one of the selling points this game has yes you can use wet surfaces to your advantage but that is a double edged sword because this game s very heavy usage of reposition abilities the crowd of enemies you want to affect with shocking will most likely affect your party members too this is because of the ai scripting which makes enemies dogpile onto your weakest character this makes a tanking build virtually useless since enemies can simply teleport past your tank making attacks of opportunity useless and even run through attacks of opportunity or burning surfaces to secure a kill every encounter fought will almost always start with your party bunched up and vulnerable to splash damage if you try to split up your party you might find the other members being outside combat and ending up dead last in initiative when you walk them into the combat zone and all enemies are free to act first you may find yourself wander into an empty valley when an encounter springs up and the enemy are already in perfect positions split up on both sides and on top of high ground too high to teleport to from bottom level while creatures with height advantage gains damage bonuses and vice versa this causes a significant disadvantage which you constantly have to meta game around by re entering combat fleeing or quick loading and remember the enemy positioning so you can setup a counter take all of this into account and one hard counter strategy is nearly required and that is teleportation or nether swap these spells are not bound to the rules of armor and can be used on almost anyone meaning you can pull a boss away from its minions and dogpile the boss before the minions catch up you may also teleport ranged enemies down from their perches and hopefully manage to dogpile them before they teleport back up in sequence my final straw was when i entered an area at level 10 where i needed a quest item taking this quest item and leaving meant a multitude of creatures 6 1 elite version appearing and acting almost immediately we were of equal level they had relatively low health no physical armor nor magic armor and could be brought down with one whirlwind of my fighter taking that group down caused a duplicate group to appear on the opposite side of the room contextually and the elite which was left alive cast a resurrection spell which brought all dead enemies back to 50 health and first in initiative order they start with 5 action points as they can move and attack twice and deal about 170 damage per hit now we fight a group of 12 2 elites and all of them act before my entire party and to make matters worse there are a total creature count of 24 2 elite in that same room running this encounter in a d d challenge rating calculator using 24 monsters cr 6 as they are easier to kill and 2 elites cr 8 one by itself poses not much of a threat comes up to an encounter challenge rating of 30 meaning your party need to be at level 30 for this battle to be at equal difficulty obviously these systems are very different in mechanics but the encounter scaling works fairly similarly this calculation discounts any abilities to resurrect creatures this game is an unbalanced mess of you vs the system with extensive need of immersion breaking meta knowledge to overcome its artificial difficulty all of these aspects creates an incredibly frustrating and unintuitive playing experience where you are required to stack one damage type with multiple ranged characters have multiple teleportation abilities for yourself and enemies constantly chase after enemies who teleport around to catch them struggle against the unintuitive targeting system i have missed attacks when the attack line targeted the floor and not the enemy my cursor pointed at fight a system which clearly is designed against you enemies have consumables but cannot be stolen nor looted if killed prior to using them mindless creatures zombies constructs intelligently navigates with perfect calculation where to walk through a sea of fire and survive with single digit hitpoints when it would otherwise kill them if they walked as expected enemy ranged attackers have longer range than your characters on equal elevation lack of spell restrictions e g an enemy who can summon a creature which can summon another creature which can summon another creature ad nauseam enemy mass resurrection spells places their revived creatures after the reviver in initiative a trial error mentality of encounter designs discover the encounter lose from overwhelming odds and retry specificly to counter the enemy setup yes i know games need to be challenging that being said when you are required to stack certain abilities playstyles and know what abilities and enemy placements are going to be before engaging an encounter to have a fighting chance you have failed as a dungeon master and a designer
