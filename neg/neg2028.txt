2023 although the numbers on my profile state that i only have around 110 hours played on steam i used to regularly play the game off steam for about 8 9 years now which totals at around 2000 hours played with that being said i consider myself knowledgeable enough to review the game in its current or rather recent state as i no longer actively play due to factors which i will discuss in the following paragraphs war thunder is a game like no other while there may be other titles that offer a similar general theme armored vehicles combat aircraft and battleships only war thunder manages to create a compendium of mostly realistic and historical vehicles which you may use in combined battles whether arcade realistic or even simulator no other game on the market that i m aware of offers such a comprehensive and vast bundle which together forms a very fun experience at least at its core the gameplay elements as it was stated can be considered very solid as the general loop is quite simple yet satisfying and engaging with a sense of depth though even this is a matter of discussion due to the game s current state for many years war thunder s economic and monetization system has become progressively more predatory towards the players themselves what began as rather usual business practice devolved into straight up hostility resulting in relative unplayability a game by its core principle should offer a fun experience a relaxing escape from reality for many or fair competition to pump the adrenaline for others however what war thunder currently offers is neither the number of anti consumer decisions made by the developers is too extensive to list at this point however the bottom line entails the fact that without paying for a premium account an expensive premium vehicle up to 70 euros per unit as well as actually performing well in battles on top of all it is nigh impossible to break even in regards to the in game currency without which it is impossible to progress in the game e g actually buying vehicles paying repair costs purchasing ammunition and training crews for each vehicle not to mention the need to gain research points which are a prerequisite to actually buying the vehicles themselves and i m not even going to further mention how buggy inconsistent and frustrating the game is due to its imbalanced battle rating system unrealistic implementation of certain vehicles artificial buffs or nerfs and a rather lacking map design originally the game revolved around interwar and ww2 vehicles but now it is possible to research modern as in present day tanks and aircraft which the players are forced to use on the very same maps as would be the case with older vehicles all of the issues that i only briefly mentioned which is merely scratching the surface would not be all that tragic a breaking point if you will if it weren t for the largest problem of all that being the developers themselves as a caring community the players have submitted countless bug reports suggestions and complaints over the game s decade long existence the majority of feedback has thus far been steadily ignored swept beneath a rug some of the less patient players have even gone so far as to commit the crime of espionage by revealing classified documents to improve upon certain vehicle s characteristics no matter the amount of constructive criticism the developers simply do not heed any of the feedback at least the vast majority of it as long as it doesn t enhance their profits which they have confirmed themselves not only ignoring criticism the developers have further doubled down by publishing rather condescending statements which shift the blame to players and insult their intelligence a logical course of action would be not to antagonize your customers after all a happy customer is a paying customer but this is gaijin we re dealing with constantly throughout the game s history patch after patch the in game economic system has experienced revisions which solidify a stranglehold on rewards and earnings up to the point where it is unfeasible to play the game altogether war thunder is supposed to be free to play mind you now it is closer to a pay to play title the changes have been implemented at a creeping pace so as not to upset the players to be less obvious not so sudden only a few player driven uprisings have so far been organized which have resulted only in a temporary halt to the aforementioned anti consumer changes but seeing how the developers refuse to listen to civil and constructive feedback by dedicated players customers who fill their pockets and create their wages the community has decided that more drastic measures need to be taken considering my own experience with the game and the developers i simply cannot recommend this title to anyone with a sound mind it will only drain your wallet whilst leaving you frustrated possibly the greatest waste of potential on the gaming market
