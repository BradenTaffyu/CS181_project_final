2019 non native english speaker here i bought the game in ea in 2017 don t get me wrong dead cells is a good game that being said there are 6 difficulty levels and you must play on the highest difficulty to get to the last level real ending thinking about fighting the last boss on very hard or expert mode well you can t only 0 1 of players steam stats have reached the last level and the last boss about 4 and 5 cells mode highest difficulties and real ending since the rise of the giant update the game has become unfair and unbalanced imo enemies they re more numerous now have been buffed and some weapons have been nerfed sometimes there is so much stuff on screen it s ridiculous so you have to be very very careful spending the majority of your time standing still waiting for your skills to cooldown say goodbye to the fun fast paced action i d like to see the devs finishing it without using custom mode
