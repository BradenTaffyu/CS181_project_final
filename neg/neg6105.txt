2023 warning this is a negative review solely from the perspective of someone who exclusively plays campaigns if you are interested in a multiplayer rts than this review is not for you if you are interested in a mp rts than this game is a must buy while the engine and ui could have been better the fluidity of gameplay and other certain aspects are janky compared to sc2 the game is still fantastic and relic has done a fantastic job with civilization design it takes the best aspects of aoe 2 and 3 and has modernized it again this is immediately a positive review for anyone interested in playing a multiplayer rtsfrom a campaign player standpoint this game is dissapointing partly because aoe2 has such iconic singeplayer campaigns they nailed certain aspects of the campaign in particular the history and cinematics the historical detail is amazing the various clips are very cool and i personally love the cinematic style of how they did things whereas aoe2 took enormous artistic license with how they portrayed campaigns aoe4 really is a great retelling of history that being said aoe 4 campaign is severely lacking in content compared to aoe2 only half the vanilla civs are represented in campaign two of which are the easiest civs in the game the mongols and rus campaigns are nice as they are a good introduction to the harder civs english and french on the other hand have very little nuance it would have been amazing to have an abassid delhi chinese or hre campaign but instead we get english and french part of this issue is that for singeplayer there is just limited content if you play on hard the campaign takes around 20 or so hours this sounds alright until you realize that half of that is bloat from terrible mission design so many of the campaign missions are just awful and slogs half the missions have enemy units just spawning from outside the map meaning that if you haven t played the missions beforehand you are literally just getting backstabbed constantly from random spawn points so many of the missions are hour long fiascos because the maps are just gigantic and the mission objectives are stupid that isn t even getting started with certain bugs that can occur in particular enemy units getting trapped in random terrain and you have to hunt them down for 5 minutes to finish an objective anyway tldr this game is definitely worth buying at full price if you are interested in a multiplayer rts if you re solely interested in campaign i d highly advise waiting for it to be on sale there is not enough content and the campaign content that is there is very frustrating from a gameplay standpoint
