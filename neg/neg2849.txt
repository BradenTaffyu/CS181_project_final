2016 there really needs to be a star system i am going to say no but just barely good great early to mid game the best sim aspect of any 4x space game micro managers wet dream bad 1 diplomacy is horrific early to mid it is worthless late it is nearly impossible move a faction one way or another 2 combat is very simply early to mid almost so much so that it is boring late combat is nearly impossible during the late stages when you have 10 core sectors and you are part of a federation your navy is huge probably around 50k if your federation fights another alliance federation that is of equil footing just forget it you will get plastered not because their fleet is bigger but because the computer just moves faster not just thinking their ships just move faster now you might be thinking that is why my computer allies are for right wrong your computer allies does basically one thing when you as a federation alliance go to war they all come to your biggest fleet and just follow you around i don t know if that is design flaw or intention but it sucks the computer fed alliance is sending ships to like 10 to 15 systems all in small batches with landing forces as soon as they see your big fleet they jump and scatter it is impossible to catch them i believe the intention to this tactic was to promote defense stations as they have ftl scramblers but at this stage a fleet that huge will blast that station and when your bigger fleet pops in will run and scatter super frustrating it is an impossible endeavor to protect a large empire 3 you cannot win a large map victory conditions are 40 of inhabitable planets or complete domination 600 stars forever to conquer 40 let alone complete domination even if this was doable and i suppose several months of play time and you theoretically good the combat system makes it impossible one big war and you are done there is no coming back from that the war will last forever because of their warscore method it would be an insanely long war i know this sounds pretty bad i am bit emotional because i just had my long game just get wrecked due to the combat system it is a great game but right now they need to address some key late game issues if you have the money try it out if you are a little tight on funds wait a few months
