2014 just a sad sad entrant to the total war series this is probably the most dissapointing title i have played in the last twenty years this is the product of a once passionate and aspirational studio which has now sunk under it s own weight of success and has lost all perspective on what makes a game work at it s core at launch the game was simply utterly broken the tutorials didn t work the end turns took minutes the graphics didn t work the lag and stutter was incredible the ai was non existent the mechanics weren t thought through what s more ca added some awful features random capture points on the battlefield magic spells and 1 turn per year anyone and removed many staples of the series that made the game so great seasons family tree map trading eight full months on some of this has been amended but the game today is still a shell of a tw title and doesn t really cut the mustard seasons have finally been introduced and the game has been optimised so that it actually runs properly but it s just not enough to overcome all of the weaknesses of rome 2 siege battles are absolutely redundant the ai is simply non functioning unit rosters are limited and generic unit formations do not work properly and battlefield ai remains poor naval battles are a joke and sieges are an embarassment the portraits in the game look abysmal because the number of armies is restricted and troops are so easy to afford every army on the map will be a full stack which is stupid public order and slaves are game systems that do not work properly and detract from the game generals and agents die far too quickly terrain has no effect in battle ie archers will have the same range from the bottom of a hill as at the top armies can magically cross oceans without the need for building boats the time it takes armies navies to traverse the map is stupid 4 years to sail around italy etc you can t build walls or roads to improve a settlement you can t control public order in your settlemets unless you own the entire province which makes no sense the civil war is a poorly executed idea which is unrealistic and stupid armies just spawn out of nowhere in their thouands the politics system is just tacked on as an afterthought it s barely worth being there the technology research is uninspiring and boring the traits system for armies generals is similarly unexciting and tedious the game engine itself doesn t seem to be able to handle the simulation of armed combat which is a bit of a problem all in all this is an absolute trainwreck of a game where the developers obviously looked back over the elements of the tw series that made the games so successful and then decided to jettison anything that was worth a damn and replace it with the worst features they could imagine there is no hope this game will ever be in a decent state and meanwhile ca pump out the dlcs to be lapped up by devoted fanboys digging the grave of pc gaming by accepting a game made with such low standards
