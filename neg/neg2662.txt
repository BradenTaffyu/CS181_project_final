this is one of my most played games on steam i struggle to justify giving it a negative review after over 600 hours of playtime but after quitting and retrying it over and over again across the years i just cannot help but come to the same conclusion every time i uninstall this time vampire this review isn t about the game s monetization which is uncomfortable but not even close to my main gripe with it rather it s about why i think that at the end of the day stellaris is incredibly boring and tedious in spite of having a really strong opening hook and it really does start strong honestly i could spend hours in the empire creator putting together some new civilization based on whatever sci fi tropes or combination of tropes i m currently intrigued by the possibilities are almost endless and there exists no 4x on the market sci fi or otherwise that gets my fantasy synapses firing like stellaris does and that s why i keep coming back to it like it s my abusive ex that allure that promise of fulfilling unique tailor made fantasies is so damn strong then you get into the game and none of it matters anymore every playthrough is virtually indistinguishable from one another all you do is push green ship icons around yellow blue spotlights on a black background no landmarks to remember no unique visuals to any place or my own units or my planets it s all generic icons that look identical for every kind of race yes i understand you can zoom in doing so is strictly pointless for gameplay purposes 99 of the time if playing zoomed out is the way to practically play the game in its intended capacity then the game needs to present me with flavorful visuals in this mode stellaris isn t the only space 4x failing in this regard i ll add i also understand that some people praise the supposed emergent storytelling that stellaris and other paradox games offers but it just doesn t click for me i m a creative person i am a roleplayer i live and breathe fiction but when i m playing a video game i just can t make myself come up with a story to narrate my bland in game exploits to spice up what would otherwise be just that a bland experience the random events and excavations are well written but really repetitive and extremely disconnected from one another again no matter what kind of empire concepts i came up with they ll always be the same and so will their resolution they don t tie together to tell some kind of overarching story they re just moments in time that become less memorable the more you go through them so if we accept that i don t do the whole solo rp thing of pretending like my bland in game actions have some kind of narrative weight to them i m left with playing a game that if it isn t a 4x at the very least wears all the trappings of one and it s just not very good in this capacity i already mentioned how visually the game is a complete dud which means exploration is incredibly boring what s beyond the next line oh look it s a blue star as opposed to a red one empire management is actually decent for a while it s tedious for sure but i actually like the economy model and i don t mind managing 3 4 planets for a while however trying to do so in the late game is sisyphean and i m not sure the automation is really doing a good job and warfare warfare is the worst there s just nothing to it no strategy no depth not even visual spectacle fleets auto engage each other and some background calculation determines who wins with no input from the player surprise it s almost always the bigger fleet that wins meaning ship customization is an unnecessary feature for people who are really into the rp of defining their own ship classes i guess there s no micro there s no discernible difference between weapon loadouts no anything just pump ships till you reach naval cap then send it at their doomstack and that s if you are lucky and get an early war later on with multiple fleets going around it s just a tedious exercise of chasing different stacks around the galaxy and finding a surprise fleet somewhere in your own backwater maybe and then there s planetary assaults good god who wants to ship around an easily sniped fleet of land armies just so they can right click and auto win a planetary assault can t we integrate that into the main fleet again there s a ton of armies potentially with a lot of flavor slave armies undead armies giant robots xenomorphs to name a few that sounds really damn cool until you get to the gameplay they re just icons displayed in a grid with a white bar going down as their health depletes stellaris promises such a rich fantasy i could make a decadent slaver empire an harmonious isolationist theocracy a robot hivemind egalitarian mechanists necrophages the list goes on but the moment you hit play it turns out that all of it is a meaningless sham stellaris wants you to think up the coolest sci fi faction imaginable that you d want to play then it sits you in front of an excel sheet and buries your dream six feet under that s why i don t like this game and yet keep coming back to it the siren song is so powerful but my only reward for following it is to be pulled beneath the waves as i uninstall for the 50th time i felt the need to record my thoughts somewhere thanks for reading if you got this far i m sure i ll be back here in a year or so edit with my previous reviews accumulating a total of like 6 7 upvotes i m kinda blown away by this one s reception it s the one i spent the least time on lol so thanks everyone for giving me the time of day i appreciate it i d like to add commentary for the people who think it s wild that i gave it a negative review after 600 hours because i get what you re thinking the thing is that s how you know this isn t a kneejerk reaction it s a verdict tempered over countless play sessions and the truth is that of course i wasn t miserable for over 600 hours before coming to my conclusion but a majority of that time also wasn t quality time in stellaris it s very easy for me to get caught in a torpor like rut of clicking new techs building new buildings growing my border blobs and shoving icons around a map that provides just enough 4x dopamine to keep me engaged but provides none of the substance to make any of it strategical or satisfying the experience is adjacent to a really good idle game at the end of any session however much like with an idle game i could not look back and point at a single moment in time that felt like a highlight a moment that felt meaningful where the dynamic or tempo shifted where i found something cool or whatever the entire session which could easily last upwards of 6 7 hours was a uniform stream of meaningless clicking until fatigue catches up with me i don t hate the game but it s a challenge to truly recommend something that repeatedly promises me i ll be able to experience these super cool fantasies but then makes me end up feeling so indifferent and bored by the end of it it s a thoroughly toxic cycle there are much better 4x out there that i can play without feeling like my time was flushed down the drain they just don t have the same capacity for me to realize my fantasy ideas which remains stellaris s usp that lives rent free in my head it s why i keep giving the game always one more last chance in the hopes that this time it ll be different it never is though so that s why i gave it a thumbs down after so much time hopefully that makes sense
