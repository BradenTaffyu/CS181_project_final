rogue trader is a game i would like to give a neutral score to i have completed 1 5 runs my first being heretical and my second one i am halfway through being iconoclast the game up to the end of act 3 is well written and engaging you can tell the developers know their 40k lore inside and out and being a huge warhammer 40k fan that is appreciated as any fan will know there are many warhammer games but few good warhammer games where this game falls apart is after act 3 there are only two major quests in act 4 with some sidequests that make it shorter than all the other acts before it you can follow up on rumours if you piece together clues but the rumour system is currently bugged so without the toybox mod you cannot set the flags for some of the quests to work correctly act 5 took me 4 5 hours to complete on daring during my first run and has many bugs with checks that mean again you have to use toybox i have a feeling that the later acts were not playtested or developed as much as they should have been as of patch 102 i can say that acts 1 3 have been a pleasure to play compared to my first run but the bugs with rumours and several quests in acts 4 5 remain i am of the opinion that a lot was cut from the last acts if you use the toybox to access parts of the game that are half done and usually inaccessible several areas were merged and some parts of the story have been removed i do not know why this is the case but it is disappointing to see if you are a warhammer fan like i am this is like a love letter to the fandom in a game format that you have been waiting for even if you have never tried a crpg before i strongly recommend getting this game at some point if you are a crpg fan then i also recommend getting the game at some point the part of me that is torn over this game is because i feel we only have 3 5 of a complete game even when the next patch comes out even if all the bugs get fixed acts 4 and 5 are too short the secret companions you can get late in the game have no quests or even dialogue like the other ones you can get either so for the current price owlcat wants you to pay you will have to choose if it is right for you many of the skills and talents do not work or are bugged as well currently several quests late in the game are only doable with the toybox mod it is a must have if you want to complete the game i give this game a 6 5 10 because of the bugs and needing a mod to complete quests buy it on sale after it is patched unless you are a huge warhammer or crpg fan
