2016 so far i ve been through two full games and i m finding myself regretting that the only choices for this review are yes or no let s say that until the game goes through thorough testing and adjusting i d have to go for no it s a civilization game just like its precedessors and as such i ve having fun and not regretting my purchase but my god is the game trying to make it as unfun as possible the ai goes out of its way to ruin whatever you re trying to achieve and pushes you toward an aggressive military game even though you may not wish to what i like in the civ franchise is that contrary to most 4x games you can have a complete game without ever having to focus on war in this one as far as i can tell it s going to be hard all other civilizations not matter what kind of agenda they re pursuing tend to act irrationally their opinion of you swings unbelievably fast from one turn to the next i assume it happens when you re too close to some behavior threshold and oscillate around it resulting in an artificially schizophrenic behavior when you re bargaining and asking them for what they d like several times in a row their demand sometimes goes up sometimes goes down llike a druken man random generator barbarians and religious missionaries do only one thing swamp you even when you re first in faith generation another civilization will have 4 5 times more missionaries than you and invade your whole territory with them even if you re only at turn 10 two barbarian camps can pop next to your only city and produce 2 3 units each to lay siege to itall games in the series made the ai behave unfairly because the devs have never been able to make it actually strategically sound but here it reaches new heights of irrationality and stupidity the game goes from challenging to frustrating because you see the ai mismanaging its own civilization in order to make you have a bad day and nothing else generating frustration inside the game is good but outside the game not so much everything related to interactions with other civilization tend to be like that perhaps they re so much driven by their newly added agendas that they re too busy to care about whatever diplomacy you re trying to do perhaps it s the reason why they removed any form of diplomatic victory this aside some of the additions to the game are really nice managing a town in its full glory with districts and forcing you to care about the terrain and adjacent buildings is really pleasant the ui gives you a much better access to a lot of info than civ v s ui with a few strange exceptions which become noticeable when you re managing a wide civlization and need a thorough overview of all your cities or when you re having many trade routes technically on mac the game is good without being great on a hd7950 it really slows down in the late game and even went unresponsive a couple of time in the civ leaders cinematics it also seems to slow down after a few hours with short freezes after many actions but comes back to normal after you quit and relaunch and it s unable to close itself when you click back to desktop and must be killed all in all i m not too worried civ v was a disaster at launch and ended up being a very good game this one is not a disaster but it certainly could use some gameplay testing and some bug fixing before it can seriously be recommended to everyone
