2019 tldr at the bottomi have lost over 120 worth of in game currency as well as other currency and presets made in game due to my account being compromised i believe if you spend money on this game and it is compromised for whatever reason you stand no chance at retrieving it gaijin support refuses to restore anything places 100 of the blame on me and will not even acknowledge that i have lost anything i do not trust this company with my personal login information if you use this game i would recommend making a new email and a password that you do not use for anything else in my opinion the account compromise was not at my own fault the information used to log into the account has been inactive and unused for several years i have never used a 3rd party application or website related to war thunder the account login and password was old and not the same as any of the logins or passwords i have used in years no other information or accounts of mine have be compromised in any form or fashion nor have there been any attempts on top of that my account was compromised by a russian i know this because there was a support ticked created 10 months ago in russian from russia attempting to change my email address associated with my war thunder account luckily gaijin did not allow them to do so not that it matters because i do not plan on ever playing this game again this is enough information in my mind to be extremely suspicious of them they are a russian company the compromise was done by a russian the account information was not actively being used and shouldn t have been compromised from my own doing nothing else of mine has been compromised or attempted to be to my knowledge recently i decided to start playing war thunder again and possibly get back into the game somewhat to my surprise i couldn t get into my account i figured since it had been so long since i played i just forgot the password so i changed it and successfully logged into my account when i logged in i noticed i had no eagles no lions no presets and some stuff saved in russian i do remember when i stopped playing i still had about 24k eagles over 5 million lions saved up i immediately contacted gaijin support to let them know my account had been used by someone else they locked me out of my account emailed my original email account and instructed me open a new account to speak to them about the issue they spent the next 3 days asking me a bunch of questions just to verify i actually was the owner which is understandable i guess but it wasn t very pleasant dealing with them and i was already extremely frustrated from dealing with this losing all my stuff and pretty much assuming from the start they were never going to restore anything of mine they finally restored my account to me then i proceeded to try to address the issue i contacted about in the first place this is their response anastasia wednesday at 22 01we did not see that any operations were made on your account best regards specialist at gaijin entertainment support teamvazrik47 wednesday at 22 59yes there were things done to my account i have around 24k golden eagles spent all of my lions were spent and all

blamed me for compromising my account information without proof so i blamed them of compromising my information i have a few other friends that have had their accounts compromised by russians while playing this game and lost some money and time spent in the game i asked them to post here this was the response i got vazriktoday at 3 25 pmi am rewriting the review nowi would appreciate you getting on there and writing a comment on mine saying your account information was compromised by a russian as well and what you lostthats the support ticket today at 3 36 pmwhat was funny was they banned your review then unbanned it and no i don t want to write a review cause i wouldn t put it past them to mess with my account if i talk out against them and i have to much time and money in the gamevazriktoday at 3 38 pmreally thats why you dont want to post anything today at 3 49 pmyes i know how the company can be why should i compromise my account i ve got around a grand in the gamei m not trying to make you mad but i m sure they would try some petty bs even one of the comments in your review says the same thinghe doesn t even want to get on here and post anything in fear of losing something because of this company that right there says alot i cannot prove they are at fault the company needs to be professionally investigated and reviewed to get that type of proof in my opinion there is plenty of evidence to be extremely suspicious you are either a fanboy or have some other motive to protect the company if you want to undermine or suppress this type of information do not post anything here unless you have a similar story to tell or have other information or opinion of shady things this company does this is not where you are going to come and mock call me stupid sorry for your loss or be disrespectful in any way this actually happened and i wouldn t be taking the time to type this if it hadn t with that being said i will just delete anything of the sort go write a positive review if you want to say something good about the game i think it should be obvious to any intelligent human being you can post here all the great times and how much you love this game and it would overwhelm the post undermining the information being put out if there were more situations of this than good situations with the game then there wouldn t be a game to begin with there should not even be one circumstance of this in my opinion and there are many this review has been edited to update ensure it is only providing factual information and clearly define what is opinion tldr i don t trust gaijin i don t believe anyone should trust any money or information to this company i lost over 120 worth of in game currency customer support was arrogant and will not restore anything i am overall surprised i even recovered the account period my friends that have had similar things happen are afraid to even post here for fear of repercussion from the company do not reply unless you have a similar story or more information regarding the matter all others will be deleted it is obvious a lot of people like this game i do not need you to tell me here that is not what this review is about please upvote review to increase visibility
