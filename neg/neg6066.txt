2016 the game is good but 130 of paid updates makes it impossible for me to recommend this game here is how the paradox marketing scheme works 1 release a vanilla game that is as stripped down as possible2 release major features of the game in a series of 20 paid updates and call them dlc 3 end up with a game that costs 44 and a dlc list that amounts to 245 4 enjoy the profits
