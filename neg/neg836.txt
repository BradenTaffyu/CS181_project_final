2015 i want to like this game i really do but with the horribly balanced combat system meaningless dialogue choices boring quests and a pretty badly written main quest even by bethesda standards i just don t like it very much is it fun yes is it addicting yes but if you re looking for an old style fallout game it s not here now follows a rant by a long time fallout fan with mild spoilers about game design not story you can spoil that by yourself why are deathclaws so pathetic in this game they do less damage than in fo3 nv they lost their armor piercing claws they re slower and when starting combat that do that stupid roaring houl thing that feral ghouls used to do to make sure they never catch you by surprise in return they now occasionally dodge to the side every now and then wow so scary skills who needs them hopefully not you because bethesda decided fo4 would be better without them i hear this was done to make your s p e c i a l more important than in previous iterations well they failed big time tldr cha is king followed by str and int the rest is worthless why cha no speech skill anymore so success in speech checks is entirely determined by cha you want to build settlements more cha more settlers more settlers more resources money cha also influences store prices so high cha means you ll have more caps than you ll even need f04 s puts heavy influence on loot and more str more loot you can carry the high level str perks are also very powerful more int faster leveling more perks 6 in int also gives access to gamebreakingly powerful weapon armor mods get per up to 4 to pick locks that is all it s good for agi and lck are only needs if you like vats i never once thought i needed vats end gives health and health regen but why bother with end if power armor makes you practically invincible i mentioned power armor the lowest tier of power armor that you get for free in the first town in the game is protects more than twice as well as the highest tier of non powered armor that takes about 50 hours of playtime to get yeah i think there s some balance issues here weapons they really the bed with weapon balance lets get started there are so few weapons in this game there s less than there was in fo3 there s two shotguns there s two laser weapons there s one plasma weapon they included 50 cal ammo but they neglected to add a weapon specifically uses it you have to rechamber one of your pistols rifles to use 50 cal ammo and it s not even worth it since 50 cal damage is extremely underwhelming there are two types of weapons in this game worthless and incredibly powerful the incredibly powerful weapons are this either because they have a very good price per bullet to damage ratio or they just do crazy amounts of damage the combat rifle is an example of an extremely efficient weapon for its ammo and the deliverer gauss rifle plasma weapon gatling laser are examples of weapons that just do insane amounts of damage yes i know these examples are late game weapons but they just so much damage compared to what you re upgrading from for example you ll probably replace your hunting rifle 44 damage with the gauss rifle 210 damage legendary weapons what the actual bethesda did you think this through at all sigh i hate these things so much ok so basically legendary weapons are basically regular weapons with enchantments on them they re dropped by randomly spawned legendary enemies which are exactly the same as regular enemies except they get one free full heal when about to die for some unexplained reason they then drop one weapon or piece of armor with an enchantment on them such as ghoul slayer or irradiated or violent or something like that which gives them some sort of combat bonus this would be great but 90 of these enchantments are worthless ooh you got a pistol that does a little more damage against ghouls or molerats or a neat little shotgun that sets people on fire for a little bit of damage that seems good until you get a legendary w two shot explosive crippling or wounding and show you that any other enchantment besides these are a joke these enchantments on the right weapons completely removes any combat challenge whatsoever yes getting the right enchantments on the right weapons from a legendary enemy drop is random but don t worry you can buy them too with a half hearted effort you can find merchants that sell explosive smgs or two shot combat rifles less than an hour after leaving the vault and since you re a smart player with high cha buying them won t be a problem either so yeah bethesda added magic weapons which drop from enemies which magically heal this system replaces fo3 nv s unique weapons that were scattered across the world remember when you would scavenge across the world and come across the terrible shotgun or the thrill of diving into the deathclaw sanctuary for vengance or completing a quest to control an ancient orbital laser weapons platform that you could use on anything yeah you re not gonna see anything that in fo4 for the most part you ll just find more legendary weapons with a punny name rather than something truly unique full discloure there are a few special things to find but when i say few i mean it like two things
