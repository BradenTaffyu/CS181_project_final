2018 early access review honestly i loved this game i enjoyed how it was in alpha 15 and alpha 16 brought plenty of actually good or changes i was fine either way with now after alpha 17 release and playing for a few hours aside from the crashes and etc which is to be expected it s experimental people not a stable build i don t like the game anymore they can not decide what direction or how they want the core of the game to be they go back and worth or changes constantly and make the skill tree less and less make any kind of sense alpha 15 you leveled up by making the item and could in time learn to make other items like the workbench etc w e i liked that it made sense the more you make something the better you get at it and over time you re good enough to make something new and better alpha 16 you level up and put skill points into what are essentially skill trees okay fine not as fun for a game like this but i am fine with either one of these options now it s similar to alpha 16 with a mix of 15 sort of but just comes out more confusing and doesn t really make sense on how they have it moving the mouse to control vehicles what the just get rid of that completely idk who thought that was a good idea killing zombies is honestly something you can chose to completely by pass now since they can t figure out how to get rid of the loot dupe so they just say eh screw it no more looting zombies they re just big meat bags to pumble on for exp now which you can do with any block in the game so kind of lost some incentive to activily try to kill zombies i feel as though for me alpha 17 has completely trashed the simplicity and fun of the best zombie survival game now honestly i don t plan on playing alpha 17 at all and i ll wait and see when they completely change the game again like the do every big patch for better or worse alpha 17 is too much of a chore than actual fun to play
