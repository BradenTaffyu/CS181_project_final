2020 early access review bannerlord isn t worth 60i love mount and blade warband it s the only game as of writing that i have over 1000 hours in and i value the game for the memories i have made in its multiplayer through the campaigns and roleplay servers to the outright bizarre mods that you can find for it on the workshop most of the people on my friends list are players who i met on here i wanted to go into its sequel after long years of waiting with a happy outlook on it eight years of development surely there has to be some massive draw as a justification for the long years of waiting what massive features over the original does bannerlord possess updated graphics that s it in every other respect warband has this game beat and it isn t me being sentimental about nostalgia or anything like that bannerlord is a mediocre game that was rushed out to consumers when it honestly should ve had more time in development ironically enough as a whole the game world which has changed calradia from what we knew it as during warband feels completely bland and uninteresting the lords lack any sense of personality as do the companions in fact most of the npcs in the game are just quest boxes with some added substance for one the combat oh my god the combat in single player it is whatever there s no added brutality in the form of decapitations or dismemberment to make the gamer mush in my head i call a brain cry out with horrified glee at the brutality of war and how awesome i look doing it the multiplayer can suck my left nut and work the shaft whilst it s doing that because jesus christmas christ it is awful block delay movement that feels like you re dancing on ice and the animations are just clunky how do you get a clunkier animation than a game that came out in 2010 warband had an amazing sense of unit diversity swadia possessed amazing heavy cavalry rhodoks had their infamous sharpshooters and nords their huscarls whilst i ll admit the factions are different more i ll get onto later there s nothing of note for me to build towards no interesting unit combinations that i can build my army around instead of the basic inf cav archer and factions oh boy reskins of the original with hardly any of the enjoyment that i got out of the previous iterations the only unique ish faction is your bog standard roman empire espy that you find in most forms of fantasy yet strangely enough it suffers because of it for those unfamiliar the empire is in a state of civil war with a split between three factions the northern empire the southern empire and the western empire the western empire is the most obvious one you ll probably recognise being a direct reference to western rome of antiquity southern being byzantium northern i have no idea what their real world equivalent is frankly they get eliminated in all my playthroughs so i consider them irrelevant they use the same unit tree there is no deviation to compensate for their different historical inspirations if you hire a troop from the western empire you might as well have hired one from the other two this wouldn t be a problem if the game didn t try to highlight their differences through their lords gairos of western rome is militaristic which i learnt because the game out right tells me and bares resemblance to the leaders of western rome in the past notably being a thrax knock off gairos is someone who considers war to be his best bet whilst the leader of the southern empire prefers diplomacy yet they don t show off this difference in governing ideology through the army tree in fact they don t show it off at all basically long story short roman empire espy has no roman empire units bad the quests are just repetitive cookie cutter fetch quests or something akin to which you might find in an mmo probably an mmo from bethesda escort missions make a return yay although what s the point of an escort mission if you just remove the damn accompany army option because yes my favourite thing to do is rapidly click in front of a caravan just to keep up with them the story ah yes the story the game throws you into a mission where you need to hunt down the rest of your family to save them from kidnappers oh no you think as you sit upright with the idea that you ll be storming a hideout to rescue npcs much like the first game where the introductory quest acts as a tutorial and you have your own family member alongside you you can take on the world together with your bro you realise and before you can even begin to enjoy the idea it all falls apart saving your kidnapped siblings working with your brother to save them building up an army to storm the kidnappers gates to show them that you re not be messed with placeholder it s a placeholder quest your brother disappears to rescue your siblings and is never seen again instead you re left to roam about the map to conquer the world whilst a glaring loose end is looking you in the face one that won t be resolved and you re left thinking what the f ck was the point of that the opening in mount and blade warband was good because it gave you anonymity it let you build your own backstory and fill in the gaps with your imagination and it certainly didn t blue ball you by leaving you half invested in a questline and then just dropping it out of the blue get back here you shout back finish me off but the quest is gone and now you re sad it gets worse in order to world build taleworlds thought it was a great idea to go and speak to ten other lords about a battle that happened before you arrived in this land a battle you learnt from a bandit so you think no trouble and go to the nearest lord you can find warband had an amazing feature where you could find a lord s whereabouts by asking a lord where is duke whatshisface bannerlord doesn t have that feature so have fun travelling all over the map for these ten lords that may or may not be at their capital this is the point where most people call it a day and go to loot a village or something if you persevere and god preserve you if you do you ll find that you need to find pieces of a dragon banner so you can remake it and stake your claim on this land because you have a flag ha get it because banner lord it s it s funny it s a real knee slapper ha kill me the banner that was broken shall return to minas tirith at this point i should probably make a notice of the fact you can have a clan and that includes making mongrel children that resemble your circus freakshow of a character don t lie we all made one and if you die because there s permadeath then that mongrel child will become a mongrel adult and can carry on your will of being a raider i guess character customisation is lacking your characters look like hi res versions of viking conquest plebs and despite all of these issues people will still rush to its defence by claiming it is early access just wait for it to get released it s early access what these people do not realise is that early access is the release people will not care about testing the game they just want a product with enough features to keep them entertained no matter how rough it is this game doesn t feel finished enough to justify opening the floodgates for people to get their hands on the time it goes live wiki pages will be created sub reddits will be created reviewers will be giving their thoughts and people will be making tutorial videos or videos on who the best wife is no amount of it s early access will stop the hype train if your game is not ready for scrutiny this idea of withholding judgement on a game until it comes out of early access is both baffling to me and downright annoying tl dr bannerlord is bad go play garfield kart instead
