2020 so first the good i really enjoyed playing the game i ve played lots of other total war games and this one brings some really interesting things to the table namely more in depth character interaction more complicated region management a really cool tech tree and more that got me more invested with my play through now the bad in short bugs i first installed on linux i prefer setting games up on there if i can it s my main os and i m keen to show there s a market for linux games problem is that i get about 10 20 hours into a campaign on ubuntu and the game just crashes admittedly i only tried it once because i d rather not get burned investing another 20 30 hours in a campaign i can never finish but as far as i can tell this is a common problem so i setup a new ssd with windows 10 especially so i can play this game about 20 30 hours into that campaign the same thing happens when i end my turn the games crashes i can excuse a few bugs shortly after release but we re more than a year out from release stuff like this shouldn t happen i paid full price for the game around 40 50 knowing that i ve enjoyed other total war games in the past and the reviews sounded great but there s really no point in me investing in this game if the campaign is unplayable it s so so frustrating to get really invested in a campaign twice only for it to bug out on me and become unplayable i wouldn t recommend this game to anyone especially on linux for the above reasons which is really sad and unfortunate because the gameplay in itself is really top notch ca please don t market a game on linux if you ve only bothered implementing a half arsed port and please don t charge 40 for a game if long standing bugs make the campaign unplayable don t think i ll ever pay full price for a ca game again seems obvious to me that they have some serious quality control issues
