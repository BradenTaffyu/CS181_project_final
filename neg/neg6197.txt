i really wanted to like this game and for the first two acts i did i loved it it reminded me how amazing the warhammer 40k universe could be then act iii came about and it was so bad it killed my enthusiasm for completing the game wake up horribly debuffed no gear no companions and if you didn t make your character as a jack of all trades you may not even be able to continue the story because you lack the skills needed to continue alone act iii is so awful i cannot recommend anyone play this game i have not completed the game because act iii killed my desire to play it ever again etajust as an alert to anyone who is thinking about getting this the game has been out for seven months and instead of focusing on bug fixing the developer is focused on nerfing abilities and classes because apparently we re weren t having the right kind of fun with their game
