2023 tldr fun until you complete pool 3 then you get bored playing the same decks so all you end up doing is completing the daily missions opening 1 or 2 caches a day in the hopes you get a card so i usually play marvel snap when waiting for new sets in the other card games i play so in my case ptcg releases a new set this week so when that comes out i won t touch marvel snap for at least 6 months lol
