quite enjoyed this game at first but the devs have decided several patches in a row that major nerfs to player skills were the correct approach while players could certainly make overpowered builds before i don t feel nerfing a single player game months after launch is a good approach and will always thumbs down it if you want to make things harder add specific fixes changes enemy counter skills on the higher difficulties don t take away power fantasy on normal or easier it s just rude it also screws over those of us who had quirky but not very strong builds from the rp perspective if a component of that build was a casualty of fixing something that was too strong
