2023 i have played this game quite a bit over a few weeks and as far as a party based top down rpg it possesses some qualities that make it one of the best i have played multiplayer is smooth and fun simulating a dnd type experience with your friends characters can be re specced at any point during the game after you reach the 2nd chapter so you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to your party combat gameplay is overall very fun and balances tactics and party building into your success however it possesses some major flaws questing is extraordinarily confusing and tedious leveling up is very slow as a result most of the game world is not even explorable once you reach the 2nd chapter i have scoured the game world to try and find a quest to do my party is currently at level 10 and every area available to me has enemies overleveled for me to even think about fighting by looking up guides i can find walkthroughs of specific quests i can do at my level but i don t think i should have to by consequence i feel punished not rewarded for exploring the majority of the game world being over leveled the entire game means you spend way more time walking around looking for something to do rather than playing the game also walking is egregiously slow this game could really do for a fast forward button used outside of combat like what pillars of eternity has i count it as a design flaw that a large majority of the time you spend in game is just looking for a plausible quest to do not even completing the quest this has led to a boring frustrating experience where you are constantly stumped at what to do and if you do happen to succeed at defeating overleveled enemies the game punishes you by dropping loot of that monster s level which your character receives a penalty for wielding i m all for a challenge and i don t shy away from games that don t hold my hand all the time but when a game is more confusing and frustrating than it is fun no matter how fun it is it isn t worth buying also make sure at least one character in your party spends several of their points in persuasion otherwise you either miss out on content or are railroaded into fighting almost everyone
