2017 this game is essentially too little jam spread across a piece of toast early mid late rinse repeat the early game is easily the strongest part of the game you design your civilization you keep it on normal speed hope for good resources in your starting system you send out your science ship and get to see all the cool little events you choose how to expand by the mid late game what are you doing speed set on fastest research just comes up with 5 upgrades you send your blob of ships against another blob the end game events are just the same few things each time then when you replay you find yourself repeating those things you see the same events and same techs replays become as boring as your late games flavour you spend all the time making a civilization and the differences between you and another race end up being well not a lot a few numbers of diplomacy points between neighbours a few odd buildings here and there where is the flavour the game doesn t feel like a space opera the galaxy map is uninteresting and not alive both in terms of scenery doing nothing and ships doing nothing where are sweeping asteroid fields stopping your development until you get tech to go through them or black holes trapping and destroying ships where are trade routes and civilian ships moving between planets as commerce and people move where are the politics between civilizations and laws within federations the ships you build will be similar to the last lot of ships you built and the other races will have similar ships and the same techs it ends up feeling like numbers on a screen your differences between your neighbours do not matter a lot and they should for a game built around your specific civilization the differences should feel interesting nit picks and systems some systems like war are guaranteed to make you frustrated in one war the enemy could not invade my planets they were too well defended as they had a higher war score they put forward a offer of a peace to reject these deals i was paying 100 influence without noticing i ran out of influence and lost half my empire despite the fact the war was not yet lost federations are guaranteed to get you into several wars without you knowing it often to the extent that it is better to go it alone than to join with them the future i am sure that more features will be introduced in more dlc mods also do make great additions to the game there is enough content here to get you through some binge days of playing but eventually you will grow to be apathetic
