2022 yu gi oh master duel is a great game when you have friends and it s a terrible choice if you are a solo player i am not complaining about new players who need a bit longer to think about their turns but slow players are a huge problem if they go on like this they will kill multiplayer eventually you are wasting minutes watching the opponent do nothing beyond playing a land every turn for their first turns unacceptable time limit in each turn makes ranked games unplayable why do people copy paste others decks if they have absolutely no idea how these decks are working it s very annoying if you have friends who are willing to play with you well you know test many decks do some crazy summons share interesting builds you will have a lot fun the game is extremely enjoyable with friends after all that s the whole purpose of multiplayer games for players to enjoy that experience together the crafting system is very simple you can get many cards in a very short time which is very awesome and that would be the biggest plus there are many interesting solo missions and these missions will entertain you greatly unfortunately i will leave a negative review there are some things i don t like ranked games are unplayable that s the fact practice games are very slow there s no option to skip them the music is also awful you can not add banned cards to your deck other yu gi oh games like legacy of the duelist did not have this you could add even 3x forbidden cards to your deck fullscreen issues
