couldn t do the railroad ending because of a bug in underground undercover that by the looks of it has been around since launch you d think they would have patched it by now considering its a main story quest used console commands to skip the quests and get the achievements as i wasn t about to play through the game again for 2 achievements after almost 130 hours fyi bug relates to the character glory somehow dying after an earlier quests and preventing you from talking to desdemona at the very end of underground undercover to initiate the next quest please patch this already devs
