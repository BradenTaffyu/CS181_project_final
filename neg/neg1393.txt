2020 early access review before you read let me tell you i am genuinely pissed about the current state of the game but aware it will improve this is just my opinion on what we have now i do not intend to insult tale worlds i just hope to give them some feedback and a much needed wake up call this seems more like 1 2 years development not 5 let me just start off by saying this game franchise is by far my favourite franchise of all time i played warband on xb1 for what must be over 1000 hours doing literally anything you can think of in the native game when i found out there was a sequel in production i saved up and bought a pc just so i could play it i got my pc about three years ago and played another 300 hrs of viking conquest and mods was it worth it no this was in the nicest way possible a complete let down i am completely aware this game is only in early access and will most likely be further developed into an acceptable sequel to warband the fact that this has been in development for god knows how long and this is the early access we was given really makes me wonder what they have been doing over at tale worlds i will now list a few problems that i think are unacceptable 1 performance issuesthe performance of this game is dreadful i load into a battle against 10 looters with 10 men of my own and the game has a heart attack maxing out at 10fps despite having the recommended system requirements this is by far the biggest issue in the game and needs to be fixed asap 2 crashesi have crashed multiple times just doing the most simple things such as leaving a tavern or waiting on the worldmap i have seen that tale worlds has fixed some of these issues with the hotfix but im not sure how these havent already been completely patched out before ea release 3 dialogue now im not sure if taleworlds thinks its fanbase are stupid but its pretty obvious that over half the dialogue is the exact same as it is from warband 10 years ago i was really looking forward to seeing what new stuff i could say to lords and bandits but ended up just being dissapointed with the same old stuff now this is a much smaller issue and id rather the devs fix the performance issues or something more important first but it is still pretty ridiculous that they are using ten year old dialouge it could well be just to try to create nostalgia similiar to what they did with the music which was done really well as it wasnt just exacly the same music as warband but it just comes accross as lazy now i could continue my list but i highly doubt anyone will look into this so its not really worth it but if you want to change my mind or correct me on something do leave a commentupdate taleworlds have now added plenty of patches that have improved the performance and removed most crashes i will now say that i recommend this game to some extent its fun for a while however i would still wait for the full release as the lack of new features still leaves the game feeling empty and like a remaster of warband after waiting for this for so long i am still displeased with the state of the game however i am impressed with taleworlds pumping out patches so frequently but this is not enough for me to totally change my opinion so i will still leave this review as not recommended it is likely to stay that way until taleworlds deliver a game that i personally feel is acceptable for the time spent on the development i am happy that i can finally play the game without the game crashing or having low performance now though that was one of my main issues and im glad they fixed it keep up the good work talewords edit 30 11 2020still aint got any worthwhile updates that make it feel like its worth the wait only updating for the steam awards lol
