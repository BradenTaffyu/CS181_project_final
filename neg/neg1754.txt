2019 warthunder used to be an extremely unique game full of amazing potential it s all wasted now unless they do something big to fix it to name off some of the big problems namely through this way the capability for gaijin whenever releasing an update to completely miss the mark on what we consumers and the playerbase want we want bug fixes better and fixed maps compressed battle ratings so ww2 vehicles aren t fighting tanks from 1962 more attention to air rb skill based matchmaking less massive grinds free fpe and parts and so much more i personally am tired of seeing new content this comes from someone who loves content in games i want the game to be fixed and made into something it was back in like 2013 or 2014 i m in tier 4 and every couple months that grind to top tier gets longer and longer on to some of the shady this company does it recently is going to be updating the game so you can pick and choose what maps you want to play and what maps you don t want to play the bad side to this you might ask you have to pay premium time to get the luxury to be assued that you will not play on some of the absolutely awful maps in the game like kursk for example sure free players will be able to dislike maps but there s no gurantee you won t get it and i have sneaking suspicion that disliking a map does noting to affect your chances of getting a specific map next gaijin decided hey lets try and fix the game by removing vehicles that have been in the game since almost when german ground forces were added to the game thats right the tiger 2 105 panther 2 and maus some actually competitive german tanks are being removed can you get them ever again after this yes in their ultra grindy events or you can pay a tidy sum of golden eagles to just get them no grinding required don t download this don t waste your time if you are super interested keep track of it through social media like youtube on what s going on maybe they ll get their act together
