2018 early access review the a17 build changes many aspects to the game and improves on a lot of things however it is a major step down from the previous build many of the mechanics have been dumbed down in favour of a dullified worse skill system that now controls just about every aspect of the player the game now lacks a lot of depth that it had before though the new content is cool it doesn t feel particularly fitting and i still feel like the developers have no idea what they even want this game to be the progression has been ruined in my opinion and is now almost purely focused on grinding for xp as opposed to gathering materials and looting alongside skill progression the guns are now ridiculously abundant but weak and depend on skills for some reason they used to be hard to obtain lethal and felt valuable but well balanced honestly a17 would have been an extremely welcome update and prior to this new update i would have recommended the game but i feel like the old looting progression gun building skills stamina wellness and the old item quality systems were some of the best parts about this game these a17 changes have killed 7 days to die for me at least and i don t expect the devs to take the recent criticism on board
