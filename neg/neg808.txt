2016 overall gameplay is good but the game lacks substancepros the game looks great has amazing sound design and music and the controls are smooth the combat has been improved greatly from the previous games but still offers some challenge the companions feel a little less like brick walls and most of them are actually tolerable cons the dialogue system is oversimplified in that sometimes i ll have no idea what a dialogue choice is really going to say before choosing it the crafting systems feels kind of forced especially with settlement crafting i don t like that the settlements can t defend themselves or set themselves up and it s hard to get levels early in the game without helping the minutemen my biggest complaint with the game is that it gives you the illusion of choice by having multiple factions but will force you to join one of them in order to complete the main story the factions are extremely boring and mostly deal with endless go here kill find this questsdlc buggy and unfulfilling doesn t really add anything new besides a few weapons that are basically no different from the base game far harbor boils down to the main quest with different faces nuka world is raid the commonwealth aka manage settlements automatron just sucks if you don t like companions or if you dont have an intelligence build
