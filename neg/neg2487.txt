2020 not gonna lie i ve played the hell out of this game but the more i ve done so the more i ve been left with an inescapable feeling of disappointment i m a massive city builder fan and 11 bit s previous title this war of mine is very high on my all time favourites so when i first heard about this game despite the best efforts of steam s terrible recommendations algorithm to keep it a secret from me i was pretty darned excited my two main complaints are that there s no variation in how you can play when you get something wrong your city will immediately begin an inevitable inescapable slide into doom my other serious gripe is the constant upselling the dlc purchase options are so in built into the menus and many of them are prioritised above the regular content to such an extent that it can be difficult to actually find a map that i m allowed to actually play having achievements for content i haven t even purchased is what s ultimately tipped me to leaving this review i can t say i haven t gotten my money s worth from this obviously and i can t say i haven t had any fun with it there s a lot of really beautiful detail but it s a case of premise and promise far outstripping the actual experience ultimately i can t recommend it to myself so i can t rationally recommend it to others just my opinion
