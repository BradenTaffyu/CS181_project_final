to be honest i refunded last year s madden madden 24 within an hour and a half so i may have missed some of these differences for those of you that play mut keep wasting your money as this review is not for you anyone playing online in general this is a waste of time don t let the hours that i ve put into this game fool you i m stuck with the game and only play the broken franchise mode if you re experiencing frame rate issues set the frame rate to lock to 60fps my game defaulted to an auto 30fps 60fps and there was lag until i did that i have a pc build with the exact same recommended system requirements that are listed by ea and i can run my game with the high graphic setting selected without any issues or visual defects at all improvements this year s madden has been optimized increasing speeds between menus and progressing through each week in franchise mode the draft prospects have some new tables and columns that make finding exactly what you re looking for easy some new offensive and defensive plays slightly more challenging all madden really when you re on defensive coverage just dumbs down and when you re on offense you don t fall forward for an additional 3 yards every play i haven t spent time messing with the sliders yet as i know in previous years they didn t make a difference slightly better gameplay runs smoother than last year s version slightly better logic when it comes to trades and contracts in franchise mode things that still need improvements or got worse the commentary doesn t do it for me sorry but kate scott is terrible all of her lines have the same cadence and it s annoying i put the commentary volume down to 0 ea was better off using ai tools to clone john madden s voice and to use it in this game boom wind inside domes that aren t retractable look at the flags on the goalposts underneath drag routes are always open the players catch it at full speed and can easily take a 3 yard pass the distance on every play the defense will not adjust or cover these routes as they play a yard too far back i can only imagine how annoying people online are knowing this remember to adjust the zone drops to counter this the cpu still will not call a prevent defense when there s a couple seconds left in the 2nd or 4th quarter unless you call hail mary the cpu still presses and allows you to get behind the defense for a 70 yard td this has been broken for at least 8 years or so in franchise mode your division will lose games just to keep you in the mix this has been going on for at least 4 years now and takes away from the challenge if my team sucks i shouldn t get a chance to come back and win the division that easily h2h looks to have taken a step back i can no longer see how many of you tragic boring individuals play all of your games as the 5 best teams or the same team 600 times after beating someone i can no longer directly compare stats side by side there is a leaderboard table but the main team column is null surprise surprise bring back the days of showing the dnf s win loss record up front and which team the loser was going to play with i m tired of playing the chiefs ravens dolphins 49ers and bengals on rotation with everyone running the same 2 plays i need variety and freedom of choice again the problem is we can t hurt anyone s feelings anymore and show that they suck at something so we keep it anonymous go back to fortnite or roblox if you can t handle it it s minor and it adds to the strategy but i miss the coin toss i don t always want to start one way in my franchise games too many soft kids out there that quit when they didn t get the coin toss in their favor ruined it for everyone i like how after completing a game in the recap stats there are drops and pancake blocks but it is not available in the season stats that s been going on for almost 10 years though it took ea almost 6 years to fix the pass deflections stats so maybe it ll be another improvement they ll tout when we are allowed to have another nfl licensed competitor again speaking of going on for 10 years the fantasy draft in franchise mode hasn t changed in that amount of time either maybe i want to see the career stats of a player before i draft them much like every other complaint the pro bowl roster screen has been the same for about 10 years too sorry people that defend ea but there s really no denying that the game has fundamentally been the same all these years there s no way to search for who made the pro bowl other than click on each individual player and check their awards you cannot view the roster after the week before the super bowl or click to see individual stats for the players maybe i would like to see how many times a player has made the pro bowl and which years overall if you bought last year s madden and want faster menus this is for you if you haven t purchased a madden game in 3 years this may be worth it i am only keeping this game because i am done with consoles and wanted to play a football game again on my pc after a few year hiatus i give madden 25 a 6 out of 10
