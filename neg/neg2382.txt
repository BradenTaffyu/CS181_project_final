2022 i was going to get all the dlc now that it s on sale on steam again but i can t since i already own the game whelp i mean if you really don t want my money i ll hold onto it but it s a damn shame almost like you should put one of those packs out that can account for the main game already being owned and taking off the price of it or something not like the people that got screwed buying this on steam before it got swiped have been waiting to get all the dlc not like we ve been waiting for the truereleasedate this is what we get
