2015 i never felt this conflicted about a game before if you just want a good shooter with rpg elements you may buy this game if you want a fallout role playing game you will be deeply disapointed lets first talk about the gameplay very shortly i like it it feels good when you shoot stuff there are lots of different weapons which can be modded and so on the enemies are well done and there is much to explore the controls are basically like fallout3 so they are ok in my opinion for the graphic bethesda choose to put their effort into the assets instead of a high tech graphics engine which i think was a good choice for this game it looks good and still manages to create great atmospheric moments through lighting so why do i dislike the game then as short answer the game designers and story designers from bethesda clearly had no idea what a fallout game is all about sry guys but you failed so hard that it hurts to further explain this i will talk about two points some people may consider this as spoilers though i will just talk about what happens in maybe the first hour so if you do not want to know anything about the beginning you have to trust me p1 the character you are playing the problem is that this time the character has a pre defined backstory in the previous games you could always create your own character and act like you felt was fitting here you basically play a parent of a young infant you live in a pre war suburb or something probably never had to deal with violence and in the next moment you are thrown into the nuclear wasteland my problem is how the character reacts to the situation to give an example npc can you help us kill the raiders that threaten us you yes sure this is your first sidequest there is no believable emotional reaction or whatsoever my conclusion is that you play a bloodthirsty psychopath the fact that it talks is just the last nail in this coffin 2 there are actually very intersting features in this game like town building the power armor crafting cool enemies and so on if you are a dog friend unlike me count the dog in the problem is the game designers decided to throw that after you like it is nothing 10 minutes out of the vault and you help some settlers they are like hey there is a power armor on the roof why dont you take it ahh yes and also take that minigun as if this wouldnt be enough that the game presents you two of the most iconic items right at the beginning you also kill a deathclaw with it the settlers are like hey do you want to be our leader ok lets build a settlement bethesda i want to work for stuff like that how retarded are these settlers anyway waiting for someone who just emerged from the vault not knowing anything about the wastelands and immediatly crown him to their leader how did these people manage to survive in the wasteland anyway to conclude this the world is not authentic i dont believe that this world could exist because everyone is either a useless settler waiting for you to help them or a raider shooting anything on sight there are characters which are more interesting but it always feels like they do not belong into this world one last point which might be interesting to know the game uses the same disretized difficulty system like skyrim and oblivion so it happended to me that a radroach at some point took 5 hits with the same weapon i one shotted it always with
