yeah sure lets push the game to 1 0 so we can charge new players more money whilst ignoring the fanbase when it comes to any form of criticism and making literally zero effort to optimize the game in anyway these devs have literally stated that 7dtd is a more popular franchise than gta i think that tells you all you need to know about their priorities mods are literally the only reason i m still supporting this game at all otherwise i would have left years ago a brilliant game in the hands of developers who have no clue what they re doing
