2020 2020 fun at first years ago this game just feels old and tired every time i launch it now their commitment to old looking graphics copy paste assets invisible walls everywhere clipping issues forced sleep zones that don t match reality and the idiotic seriously idiotic ai which you are forced to always deal with just cant get me to buy any more states when you look forward to how much more content will be released i don t see hope of core gameplay improvements to make the game any more fun that just doesn t seem to be the business model here they have a good enough model it s been almost 5 years and they only released a few states with the same bushes and trees and weeds and a lot of the same between occasional landmarks hidden from close scrutiny by invisible walls and distant viewpoints i just don t get it i want this game to be better that s why i complain 2024 4 years later and i m still so saddened by the state of this game i suspect they give up before getting to ny otherwise that s like 8 more years of this same old tired low res assets repeating the fanboys of this game are really doing a dis service to the rest of us that have also invested and are not feeling a return like just have higher standards
