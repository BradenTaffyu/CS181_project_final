2021 the quick and dirty its a horrible painful cycle its like getting high on drugs coming down then wanting to go back up again except everytime you get high it gets more and more painful full story when i first downloaded this game the early tanks we re trash but it wasn t so bad for me because i choose the country germany and they have really fast pew pew 20mm guns on their tanks i came from wot and i was used to that satisfying feeling of hitting the enemy and watching their life bleed but this new experience was going to take sometime to get used to i ve always been fascinated by ww2 tanks the innovation in such a short amount of time you know so i wanted the tiger and this is what led me on a long long long grind thus began the cycle you want a certain tank so you have to grind for it that means playing countless matches in your trash tank that you have to further play in order to unlock parts to make the trash tank a not so trash tank you earn a type of currency which you use to upgrade and add crew etc etc basic ftp bs mechanics but in the early game its not so bad you have alot of options and besides getting seal clubbed from veteran players running away from high tier you will have fun after the long grind i got it i finally got the tiger the joy quickly faded to anguish as i was constantly up tiered in the trash match making that puts your tank most times in unfair scenario s but i kept grinding and finally the tank was decent from a far i wanted more i wanted the modern stuff i just had to try it but this is the trap they constantly add new vehicles to dupe you into grinding harder eventually the grind gets so hard you think maybe i cannnnn spend a few bucks to keep my soul annnnddd thats their strategy make the game so painful you want to spend some money on it sadly their is no other game like this so i quit then come back constantly trust me it doesn t get less painful if you aren t on your a game other players will wipe you from existence every game it only takes one shot and you literally pay for it every time you die i could go on and on about the bugs and matchmaking etc don t play this game don t give these people your money just look at the cost of packs 90 for a 1 tank and plane and like a week of less painful play your gonna get hooked and waste your money find something better read the other reviews thousands of hours and they can t stop because they are hooked and can t stop grinding lol its a sick cycle
