2017 everyone has their own likes and of course their own dislikes i would definitely agree with the more than just often stated fact that fallout 4 s rpg mechanics and overall story are of lackluster quality if not directly inexistent it s what built the franchise from the ground up and it s honestly a shame to see what little effort was put into it but if i had to state at least one single redeeming fact it would definitely be the combat system their beautiful animations and the overall presentation including the dynamic smoke and heck even the introduction of melee shoves and quick use grenades unfortunately all of that falls short at keeping up with what should ve been the true game fallout a post nuclear role playing game which went from role playing game to battlefield with perks one set character one set bunch of characteristics you can be stronger or weaker you can be agile or limp as a noodle you can be a four leaf clover s worth of luck or you can be a black cat herder but that s about it really the perks that you can choose are incapable of directly defining your character as a person as someone you d like them to be because it s already been done for you the only true defining aspects are the speech choices in conversations and guess what they too are lacking in terms of basically everything all of this might have been stated hundreds of times already sure but does it really differ from the main issue at hand i must say this now fans of the classic games up to new vegas might be highly disappointed uncomfortable unused to the feeling or all of them at the same time good on you if you absolutely loved the game it definitely has its redeeming aspects i will admit in conclusion my opinion on this game is mixed that is all i might add more later or not
