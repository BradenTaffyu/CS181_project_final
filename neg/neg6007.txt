2020 worth a buy s bell ringing out of control everything is behind a paywall for example i tried playing as sweden which was a client state under denmark well i wanted to use the diplomacy option to get the support of other nations in my fight for independence yeah no you want to the independence button in the diplomacy window you ll have to buy the dlc for that this is what is wrong with the gaming industry today the one time a development team makes a good game it gets absolutely screwed over by the grabblers and it would be a great game there is a lot of depth to give you an idea i ve played for 18 hours and i just now am starting to feel like i have the basic concepts down if you can find a way to get the dlcs without paying the company the exorbitant rates it s asking for over 250 00 then the game would probably be enjoyable
