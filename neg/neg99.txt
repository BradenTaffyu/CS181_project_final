early access review i love the combat in zomboid but me the exp system is garbage how will the player gain the skills to repair their car engine why they will disassemble and reassemble the same light bulbs on the same cars for two real actual hours calling it a system is giving it too much credit its a time sink just barely requiring enough player input to stop you going afk but not enough to every be enjoyable its just clicking on menus for hours that s not an exaggeration or a misrepresentation if you want to do build or repair anything in zomboid you have to invest several real hours per skill just clicking menus want to speed up the grind why just spend 10 actual real minutes looking at your character read a book sure you can speed it up with the game setting but setting it from anything less than instant in multiplayer just feels horrible sorry friends i need to go afk for 10 minutes to read this book so it will only take me two hours of right clicking menus instead of three hours to unlock the ability to fix the engine that s not game design that s just a time sink
