2020 the game is very pretty and it is oddly addicting at times if you dont enjoy endless grinding it is not very enjoyable in the long run tanks are better than world of tanks but that isnt really saying much the new ships are fun but world of warships is a lot better if you want naval action air suffers from very bad game balance there is a lot of grinding crew levels experience to unlock the simplest things on your vehicles such as fire extinguishers etc it takes a long time before your new vehicles are remotely playable designed to make you spend ingame credits crews take hundreds of hours to level i have 60 hours and have barely gained any levels for any of my crew there apparently is no ranking system you routinely get pitted against vastly superior players which is fun for the veterans as they get to enjoy some good old seal clubbing as a novice not so much in short graphics are great gameplay is mediocre community is good for the most part game balance is mostly horrid no ranking in arcade you meet players of all skill levels the grind is relentless the grind is eternal
