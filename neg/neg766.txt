2021 fallout 4 isn t in and of itself outright bad but i can t really recommend it as a fallout game firstly it s story feels far to intrusive fallout new vegas or fallout 1 and 2 you play a character with some background but a future you craft fallout 3 and 4 are either someone else s story or a pre built story where the only change is how crazy you are it feels like while theirs plenty to do sorta you re still playing an avenging dad whereas in 1 and 2 you have a mission but a world to shape and room to be your character and in new vegas you almost have a fresh start on your life that ends up intertwining with the main story it s factions feel lifeless their reasoning behavior it all feels like a joke a caricature but not in a good way the way things resolve feels forced too the cast is just less enthralling their are fun mechanics and certainly a lot of cool ideas power armor is certainly more interesting but the aesththics are kinda terrible they had a plethora of solid designs but they just went hole hog on these generically atompunk and dieselpunl designs designs that don t really make any sense for what they are and don t make sense within the setting honestly i won t say don t play it but don t expect the enticing world of new vegas 1 or 2 it s okay and as a game in and of itself it can be fun their are some excellent visuals and some cool ideas theirs even some really interesting lore but in the end i don t recommend it as a fallout game think of it as more fallout adjacent play it enjoy it then go play in the far more interesting world of the mojave
