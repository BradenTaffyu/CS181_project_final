2023 let me start by saying i ve not synced my gaijin account launcher bs with my steam account until recently so not all my play hours of this game are here let me continue by saying i got a full year premium a couple of months ago to be able to cope with the very poor economy i play mostly naval now but i have hundreds of hours of air combat and ground combat as well it s gotten to the point where i have a full premium line up of ships and planes and selecting cheap ammo and taking out parts from the vehicle so that i can keep repair costs down despite being in top 3 players 80 of matches i barely made any sl it got to a point where i was basically playing the highest profit broken vehicles vehicles that i don t like in a sort of speculation mode to earn sl so that i can actually play the vehicles i want to play i have stopped playing this game a couple of months ago my premium time is wasting away my significant investments in premium vehicles and gold and all their bs because on top of the whole economy thing being insufferable now i m at the mercy of their antiquated poorly optimized half dead zombie frankenstein server hamsters i mean i remember a recent event where they made us build a stupid plane to trade for whatever stupid vehicles and the parts were memes they were making fun of us complaining about the game server hamsters and russian bias and all the well known complaints from over the years are a joke to them i will remove this game from my computer and from my memory no more money no more of my time that is enough
