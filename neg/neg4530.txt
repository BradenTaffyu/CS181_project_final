2017 so obviously before i begin i should mention the the dlc s for this game are ridiculous and that i feel a little ripped off for paying the extra 20 to get the first 4 expansion packs regardless of the money its the gameplay that makes or breaks a game so lets get into that so is this game worth your money short answer no not in its current state the ai on anything less than emporer is downright laughable they will declare war for silly reasons like you having luxury resources they do not or a smaller navy i wouldnt necessarily be apposed to this if they actually did anything with their wars obviously their tactics leave a little to be desired but not only are they unable to capture city s without a significant tech lead on you they will often lose 2 3 city s in their wars that they declared they seemingly dont prepare at all and then you will be labeled as the warmonger because they are terrible at wars they declared it is fixable with mods but no game should get a positive review if it is described as fixable with mods so i wouldnt buy until its at a significant discount
