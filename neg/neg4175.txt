2018 i ve never actually reviewed a game before and it saddens me that my first review is negative for what really is a great game however the new developers have come out with a new eula that they require all users to sign despite there having already been a previous one in existance with no provisions in it that lets them modify it without mutual consent this is a straight up illegal action that has been ruled against all over the world by supreme courts and even violates steams own tos not to mention it basically gives the developers rights to everything on your computer and allows them to view the contents of your computer even if completely unrelated to the game that means under this new eula they would be allowed to steal your bank accounts all your passwords collect personal information and sell it to advertisers and other such things all without telling you except for in the eula of course which you must sign to play the game you already own a license to illegally however if you have no issues against your personal information being stolen then the game itself is awesome in which case feel free to get it
