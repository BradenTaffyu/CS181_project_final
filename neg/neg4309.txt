2020 alright after 225 hours and 3 expansions here is my casual ish takeaway from civ vi i ve decided to leave a not recommended review on the basis of the following issues which have for the life of the game prohibited my complete enjoyment of it first some good things i think the art style is fine though many prefer civ v s art style i do wish hills were a little easier to see i think the district system has largely been well made it encourages forward thinking and creative placements of cities where you get good early tiles to work while preserving good spots for various districts later some people will not prefer it preferring instead to focus on improving tiles i think the spy system is well integrated with districts giving you a lot of flexibility for disrupting enemy plans the city states are fun and diverse the wonders both natural and built are all fairly powerful and neat to build and see in your empire i think the movement changes from civ v to vi are fine you explore the map more slowly but it makes more intuitive sense from a realism standpoint and feels less game y combat outside of the horrible ai is more interesting than civ v the movement changes and introduction of corps and armies adds some much needed pacing to combat especially early on in civ v combat was all very zerg heavy declare war blast them away before they can react going wide is more viable than in civ v but going tall can be tricky new civs are better at this i haven t had as much experience with them yet i think they have reached after many years a decent balance with war weariness and diplomacy though the ai never seem as hostile towards each other as they are to you for some grievances early in the game s life cycle ai were duplicitous traitors with whom you could not form lasting relationships no longer the case the bad 1 the games systems are much more integrated with each other than previous civ titles which makes planning out a strategy more cohesive but eliminates the modularity of the game because the systems are all so integrated with one another if you modify the kind of game you want to play for some variety you are left with some broken artifacts like tech and civics boosts which are now impossible for instance barbarians in this game are much more of a nuisance than in the previous title civ v which is not inherently bad given that they were basically meaningless in most of that game s life but if you want to turn off barbarians it messes up other systems in the game particularly the tech and civics boosts which require feats like kill 3 barbarians or clear a barbarian camp on top of this without barbs you are nearly guaranteed an early dark age in fact its better to leave barbs on for another reason namely that at higher difficulty the ai deals with them more poorly than you do so it can help you out even though they are annoying so you re left with this annoying system which is integrated pretty strongly into other systems early barbs are one example but the whole game has integration like this making customization and even modding more onerous in previous titles you could make interesting custom games but in this game as you turn on and off settings other systems break easily to compensate they have added new modes like crazy meteor storms and frequent weather disruptions and stuff to instigate chaos and they re planning to add a mode which shuffles the tech and civics trees i don t really like these because i m often trying to create a specific sort of game for my mood not just generate wild experiences i don t think civ is a series which lends itself to these kind of crazy modes since much of the game is in the planning not reacting to events let me be clear reaction based strategy gameplay does work darkest dungeon is one of my absolute favorite games but not as much here 2 the ai issue raises my next point ai in this series has been getting progressively worse since civ iv and this game takes the cake for 3 expansions players have cried for improved ai but the ai is just as dumb as ever rather than fix the ai each successive civ game has just frontloaded the difficulty by which i mean that the difficulty in the game emerges from giving the ai enormous starting advantages which once overcome are never really are a threat to you again the effect of this is a very unbalanced play experience where early game wars are extremely difficult but late game wars are easy this problem persists in all of my games regardless of the victory condition i aim for i never feel like the ai has done something crafty or attacked a vulnerability in my strategy for a cheeky win they either overwhelm you with numbers or crumble they are abysmal at combat they do not play or act like humans and negotiating with them is a chore once again it is not possible to tell them to not forward settle you the ai will place bad cities for them in the middle of your territory providing more annoyance for no reason you can tell them to stop sending religious units but they will ignore you 3 that brings me to my last concern religion the religion system in this game is not fun it is very tedious in single player and relatively pointless in multiplayer in single player i usually turn religious victories off because fighting the ai s waves of religious units bogs the game down incredibly they absolutely spam the hell out of religious units which does not do the turn timer any favors as later turns get longer and longer requiring more processing power while the ai shuffle their huge fleets of religious units like with regular combat they fight religious wars not with tactics but with sheer overwhelming numbers which is a pain to deal with it s difficult to start a religion in higher difficulties because the ai get such an enormous early advantage and the total number of religions allowed in a game is limited religious units can be killed by regular war units after declaring war meaning that in multiplayer a religious victory is nearly impossible and religion is pursued simply for the inherent buffs it gives in your own territory which are hardly worth it since most of them are buffs to the spreading of your religion in the first place thankfully you can just turn off religion victory and ignore it but that doesn t solve the ai spending huge amounts of time and resources both in game and computationally shuffling around dozens of religious units each i think it is indicative that the developers know the system is weak given its relative lack of integration compared to other systems on top of this the expansions as i have bought them are almost always a good deal only once they go on sale the raw content of the expansion which often just amounts to fixes of previously bad design decisions is not worth 40 they feel more like dlc than fully fleshed out expansions if money is tight which it has been these last years of my life this game s cost has been a bit prohibitive i think the team at firaxis is pretty good at listening to fan feedback but they seem to be limited in their capacity to fix some issues which i m sure they are aware of ai probably due to budgetary restrictions and so on i just want to end by saying i know that my issues with the game are mostly subjective and i have had fun with the game despite these issues however enough of the game systems are outright annoying that the game feels really frustrating and sloggish to play and because they re integrated so heavily hard to deal with or even mod out civ v has a robust mod archive and even years later provides as much as this game for less money so i would encourage people to consider which one they want to pick up
