2023 early access review 7 days to die scratches a very specific itch the horde assaulting your base every 7 days gives purpose to your progression and the upgrading of your base and gear beyond doing it just for it s own sake by challenging your defences on a regular basis this 7 day timer keeps you constantly on your toes after a horde night it ll take a few days to replenish the supplies you spent and repair the damage done and then you have the remaining few days to upgrade beyond that point in preparation for the next assault all of this sounds great and it is however the developers clearly have a specific playstyle they want you to use and a significant portion of their game design is shutting down other ways of playing when i started playing 7 days you farmed by just tilling the ground and planting seeds however this didn t require leaving your base so the developers replaced this with farm plots that require rotten flesh that force you to go out and harvest rotting corpses to farm as a side effect of this you also can t get crops up as quickly so need to scavenge food more if you want to craft anything beyond pipe weapons and armour you need blueprints and or weapon parts which you cannot craft you must find forcing you to scavenge every day come next update the quality you can craft to will be determined by how frequently you have looted an particular item with their learn by looting system rather than getting better by crafting how it used to be done or skills how it s done now again hampering any playstyle that isn t go out and loot at every opportunity that being said i do hate the current skill system so silver lining there were players who would use the gyrocopter to avoid horde night by flying above their base to keep zombies off it and themselves so the developers added birds that will just swarm and kill you if you attempt that because they want you to be down on the ground in amongst the horde fighting similarly prior to zombies being able to dig people used to make use of underground bases and moats to also avoid horde night so zombies dig now both of these tactics can be considered a little cheaty however 7 days is supposed to be a sandbox survival game and is advertised as such however it is so railroady by design to prevent you using the sandbox in a way the developers do not think is cool you get the point and my main gripe i would like this sandbox survival to be a sandbox and let me survive in my own way rather than guiding me down a specific set of methods the developers deem the correct way to use a sandbox i love the game i have played 200 hours on pc at the time of writing and will play many more because the base concept and gameplay loop of a recurring horde night scratches an itch no other game does but i do not recommend it p s this game will never be finished due to the devs completely redoing the design every few years see previous rant about the levelling system having completely changed 3 times
