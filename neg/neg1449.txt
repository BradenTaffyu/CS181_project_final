2022 edit 24 06 2024bannerlord was very promising at the beginning 4 years later since early access i can say this game became a scam twe should repay me for selling me a broken game these devs are crooks don t buy it dear tw e please please please could you finish your game the one called bannerlord before throwing at us whatever extension you deem us worthy of i know we all need to make more money for ever and ever but still i don t care about you trying to do it with a new concept when you didn t finish the one for which you ve already been paid i only care about the warfare game and you ve got lots of blank spaces to fill and a lot of mechanics to stabilize and a lot of things to optimize already i know you know they know the offical release is on but still i can t help feeling dissatisfied like there s something missing you know i was there for the early access and i tried and i tried but to no avail i failed to fall in love with you you don t speak to me or rarely you re awfully oversatisfied of yourself you always do the bare minimum and you never take my remarks seriously how could this work i ve got high standards you know your game should be magnificent glorious mind blowing but it s mediocre at best how on earth did you do that how could you be so blind so self centered so full of yourself it seems to me there s a community here to support you from the start so why are you spitting on them why are you spitting on me with a pseudo dlc i don t want i m not ashamed to play video games you know and i don t want to be a scribe otherwise i want to be a warlord i want wars and intrigues i want to build a dynasty i want to explore calradia as i conquer her him it with massive armies like thousands and thousands of troops and i want to fight these battles without any limit i don t care about a guy who writes reports of whatever wonders he could see to whomever i want to be able to play the game i paid for and i m so tired of waiting you ask me to recommand your game but how could i seriously because standards are so low i should live an eternal life to see the days of the last reckoning yes i know but still try me the game was more than 2 years in early access and is still unstable unbalanced and unoptimized and what you do to thank me for my support is giving me an extension i didn t ask for are you serious are you for real yours truly
