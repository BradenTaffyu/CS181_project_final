not recommended the launch was awful but given so many reviews have already covered that i will base mine as someone who got the deluxe edition played for my 168 hours before stopping i stopped playing to wait for bug fixes to what i consider the most game breaking issues such as the high rent complaints that just send your city into an eventual death cycle it is literally insane that co haven t put out a fix to just disqualify office or industry from spreading land value even as a band aid until the proper fix is ready because this one single bug just ruins any city that gets to the point of offices you cannot work around it you cannot ignore it by not zoning office because offices will eventually be needed so you end up just losing hours of gameplay because of this cancerous spead of land value that does not go away no matter what you do all other issues aside their lack of updates their horrendous launch their tone deaf and gaslighting statements discontinues word of the week now appearing on instagram lol this game is a hot mess no one has taken accountability there is no roadmap to fixes no actual dialogue with the players and no hotfixes to help get the game to avoid crashes or land value death spiral but they are excited to bring us quays a cs1 base game launch day feature in a dlc down the line so we got that going for us i cannot in good conscience recommend this game at all
