2021 this was a splendid game when i bought it when it first came out but to my dismay with every dlc that has been released the game has become considerably worse my favourite faction zheng jiang became a cripple when it s reform tree was raped to become a stupid mess you really dont want to waste any time on dealing with most of the new factions that are released with the dlcs are completely useless while a couple of them are stupidly strong by default thus it seems they try to create an incentive to spend money on the dlc yes i am talking about you zhurong the storyline and it s characters were very interesting in the beginning and they interacted with each other in a way i found lovely harmonious every faction had it s niche and it s unique characters and their stories conquests defeats etc while the new ones are still unique they threw everything out of balance dong zhuo is a mere joke now but in face of the jungle tribes after the year 200 everything is if a dev is greedy and let s you play just 1 4 of his game for the full price because of nowadays common dlc practice that s fine with me as long as the game is still playable for people who dont buy them not to mention the new useless mechanic that was introduced imperial favor the fact that ai sucks the ui is somewhat complicated and the help you get is just more confusing than anything the fact that units wont do what you tell them to sometimes is almost standard by now walking instead of attacking with ranged weapon inability to lay out path for a unit that is not a straight line icons lighting up wrongly and you can read about these things in a lot of other reviews below if you like strategy games in which devs feel like they can alter core mechanics on the go along with releasing p2w content then this game is for you as it doesn t seem that commonplace dlc practice will die down any time soon i seriously doubt i will ever buy a game from you ever again edit i m trying to give it a 2nd chance but only to see the game crash multiple times when playing as a specific faction
