2023 so i like the game but its not a game that you should buy at full price and if you liked bg and you dont play crpgs i would say avoid it bg is i think unicorn in crpgs they just do something that keeps also people that dont play crpgs entertained also combat there is very enjoyable here the combat is very slow and combat maps are huge so it takes a lot of time to get through them if it doesnt softlock the abilities most times dont tell you a full story and you cant for example see on your ultimate what buffs you have taken for it or it is bugged game has super heavy lean on abilities and level ups that you took but it anyways feels bland and boring after a while since you use 1 2 abilities over again with 0 diversity ai is braindead once i had a battle with allies and they nearly killed two of my characters and few of their characters engagement in warehouse since there the brainded ai shined ai has no tactics they just do rapid fire or rush you they dont care if cover or not flanking etc abilities and level up are very user unfriendly and you always need to list through it to find your abilities i hated it also in pathfinder that they look the same give me a filter offensive defensive support class abilities etc its annoying to go through them over and over again even if you have favorites button edit filters are there well not always when it is not bugged or they just forgot to add them abilities tell you nothing what percentage you will deal if you have the skill that is prerequisite and its heavily percentage based so gl counting its super hard in combat to tell if passive buffs trigger or not you always need to hover look at portrait its super lazy and needs more information and polish some ability buffs dont work so thats also thatyou get the random secondary class after 18 is annoying since i feel like when i have psycher its really weird every single one of them you can respec at least its good for melee and ranged but i couldn t see any good class for psycher i think maybe tactician could be good edit respec also works from the point you got the character inventory and trading the inventory has good filters categories but holy hell finding a weapon that is better in stats or armor is like pain in the ass since there is no rarity system again the bonuses are super convoluted if this than that and this than that its like doing a min max every single time you want to do something rarity would at least help here tho after a time i recommend always send to cargo button this helps a lot i really hate how they did trading its one off pick item and leave its super weird and it shouldnt be in a game since i dont hord in games but this game i have always feeling that i cant use granades because i cant use them since they are limited etc edit after you get colonies you can get unlimited amount of stuff but i still think this system is really poorly designed cargo is bugged it never sells all stuff that can be soldstory well first 6 hours boring first 10 hours more exiting but atleast the pacing picks up its hard to say if i like the story because everything feels the same you go somewhere there is a heretic uprising and then there is main heretic happend 3 times tho i must say that i enjoyed it because of the setting and that this is a rare crpg in space also nearly 0 voiceacting is sometimes a slog all in all im just 20 hrs in but i must say if you dont need to play it right away wait for sale or half a year so they pollish this game since it needs some love more tooltips etc to see what is happening that you sometimes need to calculate it if it is good when leveling up edit after finishing act 2 the game is just bugridden experience rushed and not game tested avaoid until sale also balance is completly off i got a battle in arena when i was left with my mele guy that took 0 dmg from boss and boss had 90 percent evasion funny part was taht she healed to full when it was her turn every time she got low so it was softlocked she couldnt kill me and i couldnt kill her i reloaded and then just boltered her down with arch militant in one turn since you can do that with 14 stacks to every boss and i can continue with so many bugs that hardlocks the game and you need to reload even funner you can die in a scripted book event and you cant do anything about it it is a skill check o o i needed to reload 3 times just to get the positive outcome since if you fail its insta dead edit after 70 hours on acount and just wanted the story to end since i spent so much hours in it this game feels like early access or beta there is no way this is full release example lot of items that had one icon have now clear different icon it is like they ran out of time and rushed the release there is no way you change so many icons after first week as a bugfix
