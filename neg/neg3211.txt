2019 god was i excited to play a naval warfare game where i could cruise around with a battleship and shoot big guns i did just that what followed was way less than i expected the first hours were great i didn t know what i was doing i struggled to hit moving targets i struggled to drive my ship and i sucked at doing both together i also had no idea how to position so i thought because i m a big ship i should be tanking damage like a champ i quickly learned otherwise after receiving my first citadel shot i kept playing trying to get better i learned to multi task i got better at positioning and learning to read moving targets i still was somehow struggling to land shots for some reason and then i read into it and figured out rng had a large part in shell dispersal so i decided i d try moving in a bit to take better aim this is when i had my first really negative experience and the entire game spiraled down as i figured out that bbs are not much good at anything at all i was playing the tier 8 north carolina i had just come around an island unseen to intercept a destroyer that had been caught out and was running he appeared right inside 10km as we both came past the island and i had guns trained full broadside expecting him i fired every shell leading to compensate for the distance and speed and aiming slightly above the waterline i connect with 4 of my 9 shells all over penetrated the dd doing almost nothing i knew what awaited me next so i turned into the dd but i couldn t turn fast enough and got obliterated by torpedoes these types of events kept happening shells over penetrating on dds and cruisers ricocheting or crushing on other bbs my hei shells doing little damage and rarely starting fires i m lucky if i can do 50k damage before i die or the match ends it s disheartening i am by no means great at this game but i came to play bbs and it s always disappointing when i do i m sure i could learn better tactics study how to citadel each ship and use more effective flags and things but i just want to play casual games as a bb i can t shoot at long ranges because the shell dispersal is atrocious i can t get close because i m so slow that if i get torpedoed it s over especially if they re deep water i can easily be burned down by gunboat cruisers with little retaliation tl dr bbs are underwhelming to play and it makes me sad
