2015 i wish there was a neutral score that i could give this game because don t starve is a great game with only one big drawback there is no sort of save mechanic i know many people are going to write me off because this is a survival game and death is supposed to be permanent and punishing but having put 100 hours into this game i really can t shake the feeling that i am wasting my time when i die after playing 1 game for 20hrs serious my 100 hrs is only like 3 or 4 games where i survived for like 20 hrs then died to something stupid if there was some sort of saving mechanic like every 10 hrs or so many days it wouldn t be so bad for me personally don t starve feels a lot like a roguelike to me but the experience is streched out over hrs instead of minutes one of my favorite games is binding of isaac and the beauty of that game is that every game is pretty much unique and there is almost no way that a playthrough can last longer than and hour there just isn t enough in don t starve for me to recommend it to someone who values their free time
