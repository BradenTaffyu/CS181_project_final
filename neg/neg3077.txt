a cool and well made passion project that is slowly getting killed by dlc bloat 2 5this game calling itself a story generator comes across as very pretentious this is a simple basebuilding defense game with mild survival elements and rudimentary combat the pawns are so lacking in personality and depth you practically have to force them to generate the story yourself what little personality they do have is based entirely on their traits a simple system which often only effects their ability to make stuff and kill people aside a colonist can either be gay and have two traits or be straight and have three traits because for some reason the pawn s sexual preference takes up the same slot as the trait that could have made them work faster since straight is the default in this game it doesnt take up a trait slot meaning that on average a gay colonist might be a little less beneficial to you than a straight one im not implying tynan or the dev team are homophobes for this it s just a funny example of this game s faulty design there s also never any reason to send pawns away from the colony except for when the game occasionally railroads you into it with urgent quests and even then the full extent of those quests is walk five minutes down the road destroy the thing come home being able to send trade caravans is a very nice feature but the loot you get from raiding enemy settlements is so ridiculously worthless that trade caravans are the only reason to ever willingly leave your base speaking of the combat the combat isn t perfect either it s a bit rng heavy so pretty often you ll find that player skill gives way to dice rolls you can give your pawn steel armour and set him up behind a barricade made of stone but there s always the chance he ll just get his kidneys blown to bits by a half blind raider with a pistol cheaper than his wooden leg because he generated the right numbers the intelligent ai director the game s smug way of saying random events also throws human enemies at you in such high amounts it s like having a full scale ground invasion every second tuesday it practically encourages you to perform cheesy and boring strategies like killboxes forcing your enemies into a tiny room to shoot them one by one so they have absolutely zero chance of ever getting into your base the direct control over your colonists is a great feature you can force them to perform certain tasks they otherwise wouldn t on their own and streamlining automating your resource production is a relatively easy process it also gives you opportunities for silly simulated cruelty but dont be fooled when talking about the cruel aspects of the game like organ harvesting and kidnapping the game gets kinda circlejerked as if it s some kind of in depth war crime simulator it s definitely funny to harvest a raiders organs cut his limbs off get him addicted to three new drugs and send him home to his family in a transport pod but it s hard to take any of these horrors seriously when the characters look like potatoes and have the personality to match and then theres the dlc the game and it s dlcs costs 115 usd in total which is a lot of money the dlc is the absolute worst aspect of this game it d be fine if the dlc were just low priced side projects to enhance your gameplay but the focus has shifted so hard towards dlc that the base game is suffering for it each update has been adding less and less over time focusing more on minor quality of life changes than introducing new systems or adding depth to existing ones youd think with each dlc costing more than half the price of the base game theyd have the budget needed to blow those free workshop mods outta the water but these 25 dollar dlc still just feel like workshop mods with a pricetag especially the newest dlc anomaly which is so overpriced and undercooked that it s downright insulting all that said i still had fun with it most of my negativity is because im frustrated to see the direction this game is headed if you come in expecting a game where you farm drugs harvest organs and kill people youll have fun if you come in expecting an in depth emotional storytelling sim with an intelligent ai director youre not going to like it
