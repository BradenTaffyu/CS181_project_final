2017 in a nutshell the company that publishes developes the game paradox is getting painfuly close to ea ubisoft in how they run their business if not even worse their dlc approach is absolutely atrocious ck2 eu4 have both got a couple dozen dlcs over the years with a combined price of soon to hit 300 expect the same to happen to this game too besides that paradox has increased up to 100 increase in some regions prices in many regions without any announcement beforehand right before the steam summer sale 2017 if you re willing to throw some of your money away and are willing to indulge paradox in their cupidity go ahead otherwise steer very well clear of any of their products especially their gra dlc missing egies
