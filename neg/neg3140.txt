2022 i have love hate relationship with this game on one hand i have so much fun learning about the mechanics of the naval battles and the historical ships the main reason why i got into warships on the other hand the game has horrible balancing system and you can t really progress without throwing money at wargaming s face i love playing this game but since it is a pay to win game i won t recommend this game to my friends
