i have never left a review for a game in my life however after seeing what this game has devolved into i feel i need to warn others this game has consistently gone down hill over the years with arbitrary removal of certain mechanics and the introduction of others that only seem to hinder progress in a senseless way to pad out gameplay forcing you to grind for longer want water how about we remove bottles and force you to grind for the resources to build a water catcher only to have it produce said bottles oh but guess what you cant reuse them instead you have to boil that water in a cooking pot which makes you guessed it another bottle oh but once you drink it disappears into the ether like it was never there senseless surivival mechanics in a zombie game makes no sense i would never throw my water container away in a zombie apocalypse and lets not forget the amount of food you have to eat is ridiculous especially since it takes 5 meat to make 1 grilled meat in what world does that make sense the fun pimps have shown they have no idea what they re doing or where they want there game to go sad really i used to love this game but with everything now it is no longer enjoyable sure the game looks better now but that means very little when the gameplay continues to suffer
