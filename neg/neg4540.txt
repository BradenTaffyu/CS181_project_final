2018 this game is sort of good yet a major disappointment as a civ fan i really was looking forward to playing it after some time has passed rise and fall coming out mods all that and it dissapointed me in the worst way by showing promise and then not delivering by being good and full of features but not enjoyable in the end make no mistake it has a lot of good stuff in it the features that were added and were seriously improving the game are districts it gives more substance to city specialization it forces you to plan for the future and creates incentive not to build everything in every single city you must sacrifice a tile and opportunity to build other districts to build one since you can only build districts after growing your city to certain sizes one at a time eventually you can build all of them but it s gonna be near the endgame so you have to chose what is more important for this particular city for the coming era science religion economy military culture production happiness diplomacy system culture progress like a scientific one with civil tech tree governments can be changed like in civ 3 with slots for various policies it could be potentially a very good feature barbarians with their scouts that have to return to outpost to inform them to start popping out units for invasion in r f era score which forces the player to do something instead of sitting still if you wantr to avoid dark age you ve got to earn some points hunt barbarians conquer somebody found a religion find a natural wonder anything religion is much better made conversion given easier to understand quantification loyalty system and ability to lure a city into a rebellion against your neighbors etc etcbut and here are the cons it was all poorly executed in the end mostly when it comes to balance things either become too easy or too hard everything is snowballing like there is no tomorrow and snowballing kills all the fun too much micromanaging there is no empire wide management only manual control over every single city workers are the worst part they are finite now have 3 charges and can only make 3 improvements before disappearing it forces the player to constantly make new workers and micromanage everything they do no automatic improvement be so kind and manually direct your workers and the problem is as you empire grows in tiles and cities the ammount of micromanaging becomes tedious and tiring culture progress was nerfed too far and now the limited ammount of policies means that there is not much incentive to worry about cultural output there is no real rush to unlock a social policy since now you can t use it anyway unless you disable one of those already in use worst of all ai ai is bad very bad stupid self contradictory asshats they have no correlation between diplomacy war economy and other aspects they value their agenda so much that the moment you so much as fart in the wrong direction they become maniacs hell bent on destroying you even at the cost of their everything they declare wars on you on schedule regardless of how many soldiers they have and where they are they send soldiers in small waves at random direction they completely suck at wars despite insistently starting them and more they regularly glitch and get stuck with their first settler unable to send him unable to build new ones without using the first one stuck with one city forever they lag behind in science even at higher difficulties ai is the worst part of the game so in the end this game is pure frustration great start with all those features and shiny shinies and then everything becomes irritating constant idiocy from the ai mixed with regular turn interruptions when they want to tell you that you suck or you rock or you suck again there aren t even any reply options and you have to constantly check on improvements and order workers and control them meaningless constant wars with obsessed neighbors that lose all rationality after the first time and become your sworn enemy air and sea combat is pure madness ai are terrible at everything but sea and air game takes the cake don t buy you ll regret it and refund won t work since you ll play for more than few hours before you realise it s unplayable better install vox populi on civ 5 and enjoy the real civ game update after the gathering storm i once again tried to like this game and failed some things were fixed but major problems remained good 1 natural events add flavor it is somewhat like events in civ 5 vox populi with more special effects 2 ai no longer obsessed with their agenda so they at least are not going to flip once you chop a forest or convert a city 3 diplomacy system was refined and made more complex not that it helps with ai being so dumb 4 ai no longer get stuck with their first settler bad 1 ai still sucks they can t wage wars they disperse their forces send them in small waves instead of concentrating they don t see how offending a stronger neighbor by attacking their vassal city state is bad in my most recent game playing as inka spain tried to take antananarivo which was my vassal city state not only did they give me an excuse to destroy them they couldn t take a city despite getting it to 0 hp because they retreated with mellee units for no rerason leaving a bunch of ranged units to shoot at a city with already broken defences also ai with a lot of great people for whatever reason don t use them they don t spend their charges they don t pair them with units they send great people as scouts i mean spain from the same example had like 6 or 7 admirals in that war all of them sailing alone near my shores and dying meaninglessly to my privateers it is not unusual to see a great writer running from barbarians in a desert on the other side of the world from his nation also science is still ai s weakest point they can t keep up 2 i found some new faults with city states their bonuses are overpowered in early game meeting a few scientific city states before anyone else garantees that you are the top dog for the ancient and classical eras which easily translates into a snowballing advantage throughout the entire game ai can t use that advantage so it doesn t help them btw i would make 1 envoy bonuses smaller or perhaps it is better to disable the 1 envoy reward for being the first to meet the city state and i believe that city state quests are too simple like build unit x or build district y wtf i would upgrade my troops and build districts anyway why do i earn an envoy for basically no reason at least make city state tasks as difficult as tech and civic boosts which are also too affordable 3 natural disasters are too easy volcanos and river floods are a boon if anything anything else is irrelevant a rare storm is the only dangerous thing rising sea level can be a danger only if by industrial era everyone is equally advanced and have co2 emissions otherwise you simply don t build coal power plants and rush for computers tech generally sea levels haven t bothered me even once on emperor difficulty maybe you have to play on deity
