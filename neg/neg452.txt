2021 do you enjoy laggy shooters maybe irritating characters that you have to deal with on the main quest perhaps forcing players to pay for single player even though it definitely plays as if ment for single player also maybe you don t enjoy just playing games and really would prefer to play a game where you can starve to death i cannot understand the decisions that led to this game fallout 4 was alright reasonable storyline not great but it at least had one from the very beginning of the game you feel that meandering feeling no idea what you are supposed to do you then have to get into their crazy workstation setup which adds complications where there previously weren t any you then have to negotiate around a place that gives you no sense as to why you should play the game there isn t any direction none the graphics are better than fallout 4 but not enough to warrant the rest of this horrible game the redeeming feature of multiplayer makes sure your level 1 friend feels useful because the creatures are as easy to kill for him as for you making you feel like you ve sunk thousands of hours wandering aimlessly for no reason you ve got a great gun now bullets where are the bullets you need to get into another complicated system of taking a base build a workshop defend it power the bullet making machine with about 10 generators leave it to it then try and keep gaming with no bullets waiting for your bullets to be done what a waste of time please whatever you do play something else get fallout 3 or 4 skyrim just anything this game sucks
