2023 a game that will shine in time they nailed the setting and lore so well it hurts to say that the actual gameplay isnt done cooking yet i ve had allied ai shoot me in the back so many times that it s not a bug its a feature at this point a few wtf encounters where the game will just break and turns will take ages for the enemy to finish a turn a very strange difficulty curve where i either demolish the enemy or get wrecked just cause they got lucky getting full auto d while behind full cover and the enemy has 35 40 ballistic skill 4 times in a fight we also have in game cutscene s not behaving the camera sometimes stay s put even tho the characters move on or they will just stand around like they forgot what they are suppose to do space combat also feels tacked on and hard to judge if your in way over your head and i m not sure how i feel about the trade system in the game since you don t really have money its based off your characters reputation as in this guy wont give you things unless you give him a lot of stuff make them like you and prove that you are a big player in the galactic share market it s odd but may need some more getting use to however the game has nailed things that most 40k games don t the characters are interesting and give insight into things not often shown in 40k media they also have alot of flesh and depth to them something 40k struggles with in games the world and the dialogue are spot on and the choices you make are in context of being in 40k this is a grim world that often punishes mercy and makes you interact with the choice rather then just i wanna be good or bad sometimes being an emperor nut is totally the moral thing to do while showing mercy to a civilian can result in the death of many more innocents or worse tldr wait at the moment the preorders collectors can take the brunt of the unpolished gameplay and knowing owlcat they will clean the game up in time good time to check back up would probably be after the first dlc drops edit update the fact owl cat is paying attention and is actually looking into these reviews says a lot while i think the game has been released to early i have the upmost confidence they will fix these bugs and refine the game
