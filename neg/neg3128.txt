2023 this could ve been a pretty solid strategic semi realistic war game but unfortunately the developers decision to push carriers and submarines often takes the fun out of it for people who play ships which is pretty bad for a game about naval combat where most people play ships depending on how unlucky your are with the matchmaking it s not uncommon being forced to just sit there and watch your health ticking down from constant aerial attacks if your ship isn t nimble enough to be able to dodge torpedoes and bombs anti air is a joke and planes can just ignore it but apart from frustrating game play this is also the most expensive f2p i ve played first of all you need premium which costs about 7 50 month unless you re happy with playing only the low tier boats without premium any kind of levelling and resource farming is severely hamstrung and you ll eventually run into the glass ceiling where you expend more money than you gain per match but even with premium levelling gets painfully slow at higher tiers so you ll probably want to buy some resource boosters and to not fight at a disadvantage you probably want to buy signals that offer single use passive buffs to your ship then there is also a battle pass which is another 7 50 per month and does not give any premium currency back compared to many other f2p games where you buy a 3 month battle pass for 10 and can earn enough premium currency to buy the next one of you max it out this just feels unnecessarily greedy but surely 15 month is not that bad you say well there are also constant collection events where you can get new ships and other unique rewards and there are of course lots of premium ships to straight up buy mid tier ships are around 20 each and high tier go up to 60 special events often involve gambling elements and or obscure costs with extra steps so it s not impossible that you ll have to pay 200 if you want the final reward i m not changing my recommendation against this game because of these reasons but i have to admit that it has grown on me over time i found that installing some mods made the game more enjoyable so don t hesitate to do that if you are going to play it playing against carriers and subs can still be boring depending on which ship you re in but at least the matches without them are more fun
