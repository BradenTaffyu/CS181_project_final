still completely missing features you d expect of a full release like bandits or the story mode all this 1 0 update is is an excuse to bump the price up it is by no stretch the full release eleven years and an utterly egregious price hike later and you get whoops haha we can t get it on the old gen console we were developing it for now guess you gotta re buy it teehee i ve no stake in the console crowd for this game but it is beyond a piss take
