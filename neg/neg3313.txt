2021 if you plan on buying only the base game without dlcs and don t use mods don t bother however i highly recommend hoi4 if you plan on using mods or at least get the dlcs which are overpriced by a lot but that is another story vanilla hoi4the base game feels barebone and offers very little when it comes to different playstyles and strategies minor nations are designed with the bare minimum and even some major ones have very simple focus trees vanilla hoi4 is void of decisions diverse playstyle options and interesting history progression those are the reasons why i cannot recommend the base game it is an empty shell of a strategy game dlcsthe dlcs introduce mechanics which improve the overall gameplay by quite a bit and open a lot more strategic possibilities alternate history is also way more diverse and offers interesting world progression it makes the game way more challenging and replayable that being said they are too expensive for what they offer and a lot of what they introduce should have already been in the base game only consider getting the dlcs if they are on sale modsthe big positive is the modding community mods are the lifeblood of this game there are countless mods out there for pretty much everything you can imagine many of them completely overhaul the game and improve it in every aspect they turn hoi4 into an amazing strategy game with a huge replayability factor
