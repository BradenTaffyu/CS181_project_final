there s a really great game in here somewhere that is desperate to get out but after five previous releases bannerlord amounts to putting a new coat of paint on a rusted old junker and declaring it good as new the fun parts of the game are overshadowed by poorly implemented game elements that have existed from the beginning the developers have forged ahead with blinders on refusing to address any of the series shortcomings users are expected to waste hundreds of hours on this game for very little progress and spend most of their time watching their party ride across the map for some reason even the fast forward button is slow as hell there is a lot of room for quality of life improvements to make the game less of a headache for users a few simple changes would save users hundreds of hours but it s like they want you to waste your time after hundreds of hours you will continue to discover really basic and life changing techniques and concepts that should have been more obvious or not included in the design to begin with like there being different kinds of horses and knowing how many of each kind are needed to make your forces move across the campaign map at a slightly less slow speed
