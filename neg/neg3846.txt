2013 early access review it is a pretty good game but please note that this is a game in alpha status which means it has loads of bugs and unsatisfied features if you are really a fan for zombie survival games you can try this but if you got a pretty critical mind plz wait until beta comes out anyway it is a bit expensive afterall p s some features in the traliers are not currently avaliable for players p s 2 i just don t understand why they are changing the price so quick i ve bought it for 35 aud and now it just reduced to 25 aud within 2 months with no notification or any bonus for old players just bugs bugs bugs feeling worse for this game
