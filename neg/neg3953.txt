2020 great game and a lot fun but the price a lot of toxic racers and gets super annoying when it s a rank race but the biggest thing is the price a monthly sub plus you have to buy tracks and cars come on if it was one or the other i would give a thumbs up but they are just sucking every little penny out of you
