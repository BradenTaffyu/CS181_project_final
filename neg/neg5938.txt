2018 i love the paradox games i haven t missed a single one of their in house developments since hearts of iron 3 got me hooked on grand strategy as a history nerd i adore the image of history they portray that everything could be totally different that history isn t a traintrack without forks and as a gamer who loves being able to not only play good guys it s great fun to paint the globe in your color europa universalis 4 is no exception here it s a great game with tons of replayability that can offer you countless hours of fun if you are willing to learn the game which has become a lot easier since previous iterations and are enjoying this mix of warfare management where you only command the armies and thus the overall strategy not the tactics of individual units and empire management so for that i would give this game a resounding recommendation however i still cannot give this game a thumbs up and overall recommendation for a very simple reason paradox s dlc policy for eu4 for a lot of games paradox has a fairly fair policy they offer many many dlcs at relatively low price that contain visual changes so if you wanna make the armies look even more authentic and or cool you buy them if you think it s worth the extra bucks and a few expansions at slightly higher price points that add a couple of extra features however most of these features are fully optional and they are usually accompanied by free updates that improve the game so expansions are nice to have but not mandatory the dlc policy they have for crusader kings 2 or hearts of iron 4 follows that model and i have no objections to that for eu4 however it feels different there have been six expansions for eu4 with the seventh dharma to be released in a few days as of the writing of this review and several of these expansions have mixed reviews some of them add several new features some of them just focus on changing a few things around in certain areas of the world or for certain countries without bringing too much substantial to the table yet the price for all of these expansions is set at 20 or your regional equivalent that puts the overall price for the game with all expansions currently at around 150 now that might not be something to be too disappointed with and affect the recommendation like that though i would argue that it is kinda ridiculous to pay as much for a complete game as you would for a new console regardless of whether that game is eu4 fallout 4 or any of the call of duties but the thing is some of their features arguably should have been part of the free updates because they are such immense quality of life improvements like for example being able to switch out the occupants of a province which is absolutely essential for distributing the spoils of war and the fact that it is not part of the base game can result in situations that require save scumming to get around them when you are fighting in a war with an ally who keeps occupying territory that you want to claim or vice versa where you occupied territory you want to give to your ally but have to let your enemy reconquer so your ally can occupy again just so you can give it to your ally in the peace deal it s the combination of these three factors an arguably too high price point some expansions with too few features to justify their price and some features that seem so critical that it feels a little like coercion to lock them behind a 20 paywall that leads me to recommend europa universalis 4 in principle but i still cannot give it an official recommendation due to the dlc policy that is in my opinion the worst of any paradox game i would not recommend buying any dlc for this game unless there is a substantial 50 and more discount and i urge paradox to overthink this kind of dlc policy if not for eu4 then for their next release because a lapse in judgement is one thing selling overpriced products another
