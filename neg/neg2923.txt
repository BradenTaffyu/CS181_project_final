2018 sadly this used to be a great game for me 1 9 was very close to being the most wonderful sandbox experience ever then came 2 0 and the removal of 2 3 of the ftl travel options i wish developers would be as interested in providing options for players as they seem to be interested in removing features i am sure there are plenty of people who still enjoy this game sadly after purchasing the initial game and 5 dlcs for the game i cannot in good faith recommend it even with the number of hours i have invested the truth is this is currently not the game that i enjoyed playing if the game mechanics would have been limited to hyperspace from day one i likely never would have bought the base game maybe some day they will revert to the old system and i can once again be excited about starting new games designing new alien races and spending hundreds of hours tackling the largest galaxies i have seen in a space game to date until then this game isn t even on my radar 3 10 for removing features as an update
