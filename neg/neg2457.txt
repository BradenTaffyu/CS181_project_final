2022 i ll be honest the game itself is great well made few errors i ve ever encountered a solid if short solo mode honestly one of konami s best recent games the gem economy is an absolute improvement over konami s other f2p yu gi oh game each pack is double the price of gems but gems are far more abundant at least they are initially and easy to obtain again initially without spending anything and if you re lacking cards you can get them directly with these little rarity tokens you get by breaking down cards of a certain rarity i will say that getting certain kinds of tokens are much harder to get than others but eh still an improvement the primary reason i m putting it down and will rarely touch it again is the same reason i ve always put down other yu gi oh simulation games in the past the people who play it don t bother playing a deck you actually like if you re not running a deck that stops your opponent from doing literally anything and everything you may as well surrender because you re sure as not gonna get a chance to play yourself that s just not fun i don t play yu gi oh to not play it nor do i play it to deny other people the chance to play it but there are way too many people who play the game who do because single player duels easy wins advancement apparently who cares about dignity am i right if you re of a similar mindset to myself by all means play the game just don t touch the ranked then become quickly bored once you finish all the solo mode has to offer because there s nothing else to do in the game at the time of writing anyway i ve heard mention of events in the future which if true may be enough to draw me back though i suspect it won t be enough to keep me invested in the long term if you re okay with substituting yu gi oh for solitare hop right in enjoy screwing over others like the con man you are and know that i am judging you very harshly it figures that the only real problem i have with this isn t even konami s direct fault edit so master duel s first event came out recently honestly the entire thing is such an excellent summation of master duel overall it s not even funny excellent concept and well put together aside from the abundance of connection errors from its first 24 hours but that got cleared up quick abundant initial rewards before quickly drying up and drip feeding the rest in the tiniest amounts and almost entirely let down by the people who play the thing who favour expedient rewards over actually enjoying the damn thing though hilariously the problem there is the exact reverse of my previous point about the ranked mode rather than everyone building don t let your opponent play decks people are actually playing decks designed to lose as quickly as possible which is honestly just a different form of don t let your opponent play in my eyes if this is the standard we re setting for master duel events going forward my previous prediction was on the money
