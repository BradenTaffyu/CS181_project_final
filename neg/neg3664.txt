2023 early access review a20 i d have recommended a21 i just can t the game has great bones and the potential to dominate the genre but the devs just can t seeem to get over themselves and develop it into a gem they shoot themselves in the foot at every step and over the last ten years this came has undergone metamorphosis over and over well with a21 they crossed a bridge too far they want you to believe it s a sandbox but there s only one way to get skills and it s the same way regardless of which skill it is want to boil an egg go find magazines want to learn to forge magaziness want to build turrets waste points taking the skill that says you learn how to make turrets and has an icon of a turret then realize that nope you need to go get magazines each category has some 75 magazines which equates to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of magazines not unique ones mind you you need 75 identical magazines in each category this turns the game from a post apocalyptic zombie survivor into a looter grindfest there s just no reason whatsoever that a person can t learn cooking by y know cooking there isn t a need in a successful sandbox game to require everyone adopt the exact same playstyle in order to advance their character the devs said it felt good and pleaded with the community to give it a chance i went in with an open mind and still couldn t stomach it also as has already been said to death the water thing is as annoying as it sounds you need filters to create clean water which are nearly exclusively purchased from a trader which forces you to play capitalism in post apocalyptia don t think that sounds like fun rather avoid it you apparently just in case it sounds like they balanced it they also made a filter that fits in your helmet and completely removes the need for purified water so you either have to play ball with the traders or you can just remove it from the game entirely i m so confused as to what their vision is but i want the good 7d2d back if the game is past a21 when you re considering buying this be sure to research just that iteration because this game looks absolutely nothing like it did back in the day and nobody can say what any new iteration will look like as for a21 don t buy it even on sale it s hot trash you can access a20 etc in the betaa menus if you want but you ll still be buying a game with no vision for what it ll end up being
