don t get me wrong i enjoy this game i usually play for 1 to 3 hours at a time and during that time the game crashes about 5 times i bought the game for 5 and honestly it s not worth more buy a cheap key somewhere else but never pay the regular full price for this mess of a game bethesda really should be ashamed that being said and if you ignore the most brain dead conversations that have ever existed in the history of gaming fallout 76 is quite fun although i enjoy playing this game i m giving a negative review because i can t honestly recommend an overpriced mess like this
