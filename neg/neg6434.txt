2021 it s fh4 in mexico but that s fine that s what i was expecting but moreso other than being fh4 in mexico it s fh4 but broken if you re thinking of playing this game with friends wait awhile networking issues plague the game with randomly disappearing cars even worse if they re in your party the devs have also setup social media for you to follow some of which have been taken down or are vacant the only news source for the games upcoming patches is a q a detailing bugs they dont intend to fix other than that their latest priority was patching a jeep you could exploit for wheelspins while simultaneously creating more bugs in the game wait until the game is finished otherwise wait until it is on sale or just get fh4
