at its core stellaris is a complex but not impenetrably so 4x with an emphasis on customization with countless decisions made by the player and random events that come together to masterfully create internal stories it also nails the space empire exploration itch far better than any similar rts in my opinion however i can not in good conscience recommend it for three reasons 1 progressive complexityas stellaris has developed paradox has steadily added to game systems in their dlcs without streamlining existing systems well original stellaris consumer goods alloys megastructures federations diplomacy espionage overlord expansion leader expansion astral rifts each dlc adds a new system which sounds interesting but every system piles up the pop ups on your screen and things drawing your attention such that the game is simply unwieldy if you like your rts games to make you feel like you re playing osu then you might like it but you should know that most systems i e espionage overlord expansion leader expansion etc added by dlcs give players who haven t purchased the dlc access to a lite version with many of the perks of the system withheld this would be fine but ai empires who you ll mostly be playing against have full access to all of them giving them a distinct advantage over the player in ways the player cannot fight back against this leads to point 2 2 paradox s world famous monetization systemstellaris currently has 361 of dlc on sale it gets a little better but many of these dlcs improve the base game which feels unfinished without them to such a degree or as previously mentioned will give ai empires an advantage until purchased that players are strongly pressured to buy them to get the full experience it doesn t help that the dlcs have greatly declined in quality with some see overlord and galactic paragons and the soon to release machine age simply reworking existing systems in a way that should have been free and others see astral planes that add reskinned versions of existing systems paradox as with many of their other games that have suffered the same fate recently released a monthly subscription service which i hope disgusts you as much as it does me 3 the late game does not workstellaris is awfully optimized and when the late game comes around unless you have a truly top of the line computer the sheer amount of calculations the game will be making slows progression to a crawl i believe this is why stellaris has a reputation for players never completing runs in 359 hours of gamplay i have never completed a run because it always ends up unplayable if you only play on the tiniest galaxy size defeating much of the appeal of galactic conquest with a minimal amount of empires it may be tolerable but likely not great no mod that i ve found has substantially helped this issue the issues with stellaris are not impossible to fix but paradox has continuously neglected them in favor of cranking out as many subpar 20 dlcs as possible i hope you take a pass on stellaris until it becomes the game it has all the potential to be
