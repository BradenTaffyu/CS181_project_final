2023 have to give this a thumbs down just because i think this game should sit at mixed as an honest representation of the overall experience pros 1 great world building interesting story2 character stories are generally engaging if a little two dimensional 3 multiple ways to resolve stories though sometimes it boils down to killing not killing someone 4 combat has a lot of potential for interesting tactical scenarios though it becomes overwrought see cons 5 ai has some interesting ways of resolving combat you won t find too many games with the kind of depth you see in enemies here cons1 the physical magic armor addition in dos2 completely changes the strategic use of crowd control enemies even at classic level take a lot of chipping away before your skills take effect the enemy on the other hand rarely experiences this issue 2 those enemies are frequently more powerful than you at the same level more armor stronger attacks more actions per turn and skills you don t even have access to it feels less like a straight challenge and more like the devs put their thumb on the scale because they couldn t find a way to keep the difficulty up without being cheap 3 the source mechanic underwhelming powers that take waaaaay too many of your action points which involves a wonky and unwelcome resource management 4 the fire the endless annoying fire this game is a virtual being on fire simulator 5 the special fire that you can t put out normally but have to manage your source fun 6 combat takes a year the computer will jump turns cc you to death and leave you sitting there watching it play itself for 15 minutes 7 the uninspiring character progression most of the time you re just adding a point or two to an attribute or skill 8 the poorly realized and ambiguous crafting system the mind numbing inventory management etc 9 the overly cryptic puzzles and special combat scenarios that after you get done making a sandwich waiting for the computer to play by itself are not intuitive at any level 10 did i mention the fire 11 i could go on look i liked dos1 and there s a lot of love in this game but after playing through a couple times not finished yet i just feel like it s so much wasted potential i haven t found it too hard it s just worn me down the combat feels like a chore and the only way to get through fights is to juggle resurrection scrolls to me that isn t strategy i hope there s a dos3 i really do and i hope larian learns something from making an actual d d game the goal of an rpg is to inspire players to overcome challenges not to constantly cheap them into submission with contrived combat scenarios and ambiguous structure could have been one of the greats but larian leaned in far too hard here and wound up with a meh experience
