2021 early access review i ve owned this game for many years and little have changed it has good potential but it s still just the same as it was when i bought it no npc s no real story no real gameplay except stocking up on things you need and making a secure place from the zombies but atleast you can drive around in a car and grab gear now there s nothing here to keep you interested no unexpected events no one to talk to no other survivors etc it just feels pointless and empty keep in mind this game was released as early access 8 years ago and is still in early access with little change
