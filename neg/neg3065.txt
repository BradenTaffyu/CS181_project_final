it s complicated rimworld is not a bad game it s engaging it s highly moddable the development team is still supporting it even a decade later with thoughtful and deliberate expansion packs the gameplay lends itself both to being taken seriously and to the sort of comedy from circumstance that can stop you in your tracks it s not difficult to put several hundred several thousand hours into it even considering what follows this paragraph it s still worth the base price of admission and for the most part the first three expansion packs are gently qualified successes but if we are going to judge it on the basis of what its creator has said is the most important part of it as a story generator then it s really middling as one it has outgrown a lot of the core systems and design assumptions that were made ten years ago certain parts of the game were never that strong to begin with most notably interacting with factions on the world map trade raiding conquest questing and they ve only gotten worse with time and neglect the entire game is built around one number that scales with how wealthy the storyteller game master is calculated to think your settlement is which in turn informs it of what severity of threats and misfortunes to apply the way this calculation was and is made has started to make less and less sense with each expansion and with the changes introduced by anomaly expansion has completely broken down in my opinion i don t know where we re going to go from here it s okay to finish a game even one with no true narrative end like rimworld but i really really wish there was more of it and there isn t and it s that powerful sense of missed opportunity that really drove a thumbs down versus a thumbs up
