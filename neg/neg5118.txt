2017 moneygrab got it because it was on humble b at 10 stuff that sould be in the base game is overcharged as dlc dumbed down total war game mechanics in both the campaign and battle map i cant overlook this so im not recommending unless its at an even bigger discount then the summer sale specially the dlc at least 70 could have been the best tw shame
