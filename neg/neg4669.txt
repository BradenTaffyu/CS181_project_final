sadly i love the game but the direction it is headed with the dlc and bonus content and season pass it s sad really if you want a silly destroy game get the game itself and leave it at that don t encourage saber interactive who bought this game up and are now very much in the process of rushing it towards the next wall at least so far that is the looks
