2021 early access review it s a really great game until mid game and you realize how shallow it is and how many necessary features it lacks imo the developers are taking way too long to give the game much needed polish and have adopted a modders will fix it type of mentality i really love this game but can t say it s ready yet hope the developers will pick up the pace
