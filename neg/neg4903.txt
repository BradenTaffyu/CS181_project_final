2020 the game itself is fun to play for a bit like the civ games it gets repetitive really quick i give this a huge thumbs down because of the fact that spending 60 on the game only seems to unlock a small portion of the scenarios characters available i m so tired of these games that just keep trying to milk you for more and more money after you ve already paid for the main title
