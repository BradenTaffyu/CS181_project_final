2023 dead cells is a great game the gameplay is fun the levels are interesting despite most biomes sharing 50 of enemies the music is overall really good the references are fun and the visuals goodness the visuals i have no idea how a game that looks this good runs this well on my crappy computer that has 4 gigs of ram and shipped with windows 8 the only notable lag was during one attack of one of the dlc bosses i thoroughly enjoyed most of this game so why am i giving a negative review in a nutshell this game has no respect for you this game hates you it despises you and there are two reasons for this damage output and time first damage normal enemies do way too much damage look getting beaned by an attack because you threw out my parry too early that s a skill issue losing half your health because you threw out your parry too early that s cruel loosing a run because you threw out a parry too early against a normal enemy not a big enemy and lost half your health or got combo d to death in a second that s bull losing a 2 hour run to the previous scenario that s a call too turn on assist mode and severely reduce the enemy and trap damage output which i did eventually and enemies still did a lot of damage 20 enemy and trap damage and the game still didn t feel fair at times and before anyone dismisses me with the thought git gud scrub or hah don t let this idiot a real souls game like i say the first time i beat this game i did it with assist mode off that without any cells but still i ve beaten bloodborne s true ending both the true ending and evil ending of sekiro and the remake of demon souls and this game has more bull than any of them at least with fromsoft games or for a rougelike example splunkey you only lose 5 10 minutes or like 15 30 in the later example when you go from full health to dead in less than 5 seconds at least when the same thing happens to you in noita another brutally difficult rougelite that s really cool the main path only takes like 20 40 minutes and if you go for any of the side content that takes dozens of hours it s a case of you know what you were getting into but dead cell the most basic ending can take over 2 hours unless you speedrun 2 whole hours down the drain because a basic enemy got a cheep shot at you in the latter half of the game it s worth noting that the obscene damage output mostly has to do with normal enemies strangely bosses do far more reasonable damage than normal enemies why is it that the enemies that are designed to be fought 1v1 or at least in closed and predictable environments do less damage than enemies that can potentially be fought 1 3 at a time and even more than that on the highest two difficulties don t get me wrong the bosses are still brutal but it s weirdly reasonable compared to the rest of the game the second reason is time like i said runs taken at a casual pace can take over 2 hours that s already a long time for an action rougelike but that s not the bs part the bs part is that to get the intended experience beating the game once isn t enough now anyone who goes into a rougelike rougelite with the intention of beating it once and then never touching it again isn t playing rougelikes correctly but there s a point where it gets obsessive once you beat the game you unlock a boss cell and activating it does several things it makes 1 cell doors available giving you access to more loot and shops most importantly health item shops which sell a rare item that refills one of the charges of your health flask it makes extra enemies spawn including some that i m pretty sure are excusive to the ng runs it decreases the amount of health potion refills that you get i actually like part of how the higher diffaculities work it s a lot more interesting than just haha your survivability is so low that the game is nearly impossible now lol good luck idiot but considering the damage output issues i said before less health refills a big deal especially once you unlock the second cell and the third cell and the fourth and the fifth but the worst part is to get the true ending which is part of the intended experience you have to get all 5 boss cells and go through the rise of the giant dlc content which the developers actually brag about being too hard for most people to consider fair while i enjoyed rise of the giant i can t say it s ok to lock the true ending behind content that the developers brag about not being fair and the base game is already unfair also the rise of the giant dlc is free and you can just ignore that content if you don t like it and don t care about the true ending so i don t know why it s dlc but that s a minimum of six loops realistically much more to get the true ending and the final one is longer i m fine with crazy difficulty settings but locking the true ending behind it is uncool i d consider 2 or 3 cells to be the hardest semi reasonable difficulty 4 cells has mechanics that are clearly not designed for casual play and 5 5 is just nuts you wanna know a game that does the forces you to play at a higher difficulty to get the true ending right monolith after the end that game has two difficulty levels normal and hard hard mode doesn t decrease your effective health and the content between starting hard and getting the true ending is actually shorter than starting normal and getting the not true ending that s much more reasonable than the nonsense you have to go through to get the true ending in this game and while i won t spoil the contents of the ending lore wise the true ending you get for defeating the true final boss of dead cells isn t worth it i don t believe my opinions are popular ones but soulslike fans tend to be so masochistic that it borders on toxic and they aren t afraid to let you know but personally despite thoroughly enjoying the game i can t recommend it if enemy and trap damage output was severely reduced i d consider recommending the game but i don t think the devs would ever consider that plus that s only half the issue and the other half a fundamental flaw that would require changing part of the game s identity for the approximately 0 people who care i plan on writing reviews for all of the dlc as well but here s the short version if you must buy dead cells all the dlc is worth it except the bad seed dlc so get all the dlc except that one if you can tl dr dead cells is the best game that i would not hesitate to say don t play it ever
