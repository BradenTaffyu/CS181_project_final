2023 tl dr game is alright just go buy horizon 4 instead this is one of those games that desperately needs a middle of the road rating option because at it s core it is still a fantastic racing game we ve come to know and love in the games of the forza series the driving is tight and responsive not floating too far off either end of the sim cade tightrope and striking an excellent balance with how the cars feel in weight and grip most of the tracks are engaging and a blast to rip through in a majority of cars and performance classes and the open world is varied enough in surface and style to always have somewhere else to go or a new style to try the cars even with so few actually new inclusions are still well detailed and the sound improvement over horizon 4 is tenfold yet in good faith i cannot recommend this game to anyone despite singing it s praises above the core of the game while still indisputably horizon is hollow and of little extra substance than horizon 4 campaign even more unengaging than the previous entry chocked full of style and cultural references without having any point or driving force no escalation in car type or class and a story so forgettable it retroactively makes 4 s look better by comparison it s basically a sandbox and while everything is done well or at the least passably there s just no incentive to experience anything but what they railroad you in to with regards to the story online still absolutely plagued by the previous entry s problems some even exacerbated throughout this entry load times have been made somehow even longer even on ssd and chances are half your lobby is gone by the time the race actually loads the convoy system constantly breaks and splits your party or makes them invisible or a plethora of other issues that weren t even present in fh4 the world system somehow feels even emptier even with the same amount of players none are to be found roaming or racing along the highway or doing much of anything really might as well be playing horizon solo the racing again plagued by the issues of it s predecessor the lead ai on higher difficulties getting rubber banding from p1 all the way to the finish and lower difficulties being absolutely pointless if you have access to any way of steering your car at all as for online racing it s basically flipping a coin on if your opponents have functioning brake keys constantly using cars in front and walls to take corners instead which i can t even blame them for as there s piss all incentive to race cleanly or for anything but 1st while the collision detection system has been improved from fh4 ghosting players much more frequently it doesn t do anything to mitigate the issue as at the next corner without any repercussion your opponent can just attempt to barrel into you or a wall with minimal issue even in team races cars are again being drip fed through content which for the most part isn t a bad thing but there s so few new additions you re basically playing to get cars that they removed from fh4 for no discernible reason half the time the customization has been improved and although still meager is better than previous offerings the paint and vinyl system is still fantastic and the community always has excellent designs on offer as long as they don t get banned for being funny or having any ethnic iconography open world activities and timed lap rivals are infested with cheaters any seasonal car is hoarded and sold for max price on the auction house making it unobtainable for the average player without some decent luck or a massive time investment to grind out the money event lab while plagued by low effort content also has some amazing tracks and ideas by the community and is by far the best way to enjoy this sandbox racing experience it pains me to have to be so harsh on the game but with such little innovation and constant issues there s not much of a reason to pick it over horizon 4 unless you ve already played that one and even then this just feels like an expansion of that game there s a great game core here there really is but it s mired in a box without a soul just go buy fh4 instead because this game is much of the same with even less charm
