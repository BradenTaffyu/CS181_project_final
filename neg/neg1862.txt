2014 i loved this game and i still enjoy playing it but as of late this game has pissed me off to the point of insanity first off the devs do not listen to a single thing their players say and even ban or censor the ones who speak out on their forums or on steam they have nerfed every german plane and tank i had once enjoyed to drive and fly and made every russian plane or tank a unstoppable killing machine which is not only historically inaccurate but unfair aswell it seems anymore that the devs are only in it to pocket from their loyal fan base that being said if they were to fix their mistakes and and actually listen to their players they could make this the wonderfull game it used to be
