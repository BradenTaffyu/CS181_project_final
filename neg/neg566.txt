2023 with the news of the upcoming season 2 update i am giving this a negative due to a majority of the changes just being not player friendly the team at project moon is pulling a hoyoverse where they realize how profitable the game is and want to milk it as much as possible some of the changes that they are making that makes me hate this update and probably the game soon enough is as follows season 1 ego shard carryover once the new season starts all ego shards will be halved and turned into thread this is a very unfriendly system due to it being specifically targeted to remove the saving up of ego shards to force players to roll the gacha instead of being wise with their resources now if you wanted to save for a new ryoshu or new sinclair with your shards tough luck they don t want you to do that they re taking it away and turning it into a currency that should be more available in the first place but they do not want you to have an easy time raising characters or saving up to get characters in the future after your gacha luck runs outnew upty tier thread spinning uptying your characters is essentially raising their ascension in other games you use threads to do this different identities take a different amount of thread to raise up ranging from 40 to 100 sometimes they are adding in a 4th upty stage which is normally a good thing however they re forcing you to use egoshards yeah that thing they are taking away from you come season 2 they want you to use that to raise up your character which is essentially your pity system in the game how many will it take no one knows yet but it s not a good idea nor does it excite me for the future of this game i can see it crashing and burning soon enough because the developers are ready to make all the wrong changes quickly it feels like it comes from a place of greed and i know this is a free to play game that doesn t mean systems need to be changed to make players spend their money more they made it free to play of their own volition it s not good to make such drastic changes like this when it had a bright f2p friendly future and just a nice feel overall new pity system now something to smile about right a pity system is something the game needed other than the egoshards because if you didn t pull a character consistently or you did not grind the mirror dungeon weekly you didn t get to save up ego shards to get the 3 star you so wanted now for their pity system they ve decided to copy the most greedy system that there is every 200th summon will net you a copy of the character of your choosing okay 200 summons isn t so bad if you space it out between different banners then you could eventually get that hong lu you ve wanted well the progress does not carry over it s ridiculous that they could honestly release this news and expect anyone to be excited over it yes players who spend money regularly will see that 200 mark but players who do not have the luxury to spend money especially in today s economy where a majority of people cannot afford houses or rent on a gacha game where they have a probability to get what they want it wouldn t be so bad if they didn t decided to just take away the egoshards that people have been saving up for the occasion where they could redeem a character they wanted removal of identities and egos from the gacha this one just sucks in general it s one thing to remove a limited summer character but a variant of a character that was featured in an event is worse especially when that character has a limited amount of identities to go with anyway it s not fair to players coming into the game late and its not fair for the ones who missed her despite their best efforts in the gacha overall the player experience for people who don t have a lot of disposable income in terms of collecting characters you like will decrease significantly there are other changes i take issue with but i don t really want to sit here and harp about the entire changelog my point is that project moon is a company that a lot of people like and expect to make changes that will improve the quality of life of the game while also providing interesting changes and longevity the changes that are coming are the opposite of that it makes me sad to see something like this happen to such a promising game they are stubborn as well although the changes are subject to change i doubt they will change it so this will probably mark the end of my limbus company tenure assuming its as bad as it reads i will stay turned with a heavy heart but optimistic brain because this is the only game where i can play as ryoshu and outis lmao
