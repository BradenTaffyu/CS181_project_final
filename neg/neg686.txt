2017 i enjoyed fallout 4 but a lot of that enjoyment came from being able to tailor the experience to my own preferences through the use of mods that s always been the conundrum when judging bethesda games is it a good game because you can mod it however you please or is it a bad game because you need to throw so many mods at it for it to become playable trying to hide mods behind a paywall makes that question a little easier to answer
