2016 i ll admit i ve put a fair few hours into this game it was a novelty more than anything else having the wasteland in hd but the more i played the more i realised that 5 years of development time was just not enough to properly make this game the graphics are reasonable however they re also fairly taxing on memory my computer set it to high and yet i had a lot of problems with the game freezing until i reduced them down to medium that frustrated me in terms of game breaking bugs i never came across anything that bad however there were a few places where enemies fell through the floor and followed me underground for a while the story is very subpar spoilers pick a faction kill the other two factions watch a generic ending cutscene great endspoilers the gameplay was grand i enjoyed the power armor and the weapons were good the legendary and unique weapons annoyed me however because unique weapons were just weapons with a generic legendary perk that you could only get once on that particular weapon honestly the game just made me want to go back to skyrim and thats how i need to compare it unfortunately the exploration and roleplaying aspects of fallout 4 just don t in any way live up to what bethesda has been able to produce before
