2018 i ll start this off to say that this is just my personal opinion based off of the kinds of things i like and don t like i m sure there will be plenty people out there that will disagree with me and that s perfectly fine by me i loved this game this is the only game i ve played over and over again purchased every dlc for and logged almost 800 hours in since it first game out it was fun interesting and over all easy to play the fact that the developers were making major changes to the way the game played as part of free upgrades was interesting to me and in general i agreed with or at least understood the reasoning behind their changes even if i didn t love it 100 this latest upgade has completely destroyed my love of this game it took a simple empire management process and turned it into a heavy micro managing mess before when i had a new planet i could que up some buildings let them all build wait for the population to catch up rinse and repeat all while letting me concentrate on the rest of the functions of my empire now you have to worry about too many jobs not enough of the right kinds of jobs building too fast not building fast enough not building enough of the right kind of resources building too much of the wrong kind of resources and so forth add to that the fact that you re now given a soft limit on how fast you can expand your territory you can claim more but you start taking penilities on a bunch of stuff a trade system that helps bring in income but only if you want to split your military into a bunch of micro fleets and micro manage them so that you don t loose it all to piracy degridation and a manditory breaking up of your empire into individual semi self contained sectors which you can t even control how they form or what systems they contain anymore secotors in generaly having been my biggest gripe about the game over all but at least before this i could just ignore it and build one big sector and you ve taken all the fun out of everything i enjoyed about the game and just turned it into a mess i tried giving this a fair shake i ve started several games played for a good six hours or so but i just can t get into the game anymore so i m taking this out of my favorite game on steam catagory and marking it not recommended because if i were buying this game for the first time right now i d want someone to talk me out of it
