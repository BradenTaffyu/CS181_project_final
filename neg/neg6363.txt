2016 you might probably like this game and it is definitely a great game but i didn t enjoy it enough to recommend it mainly because of how it unfolds over time the game started off really great with a great story building up with appealing graphics with great characters and also a great background score i really enjoyed the game until a specific point probably somewhere around ep 4 or 5 that is when the story really started to unravel itself and the story didn t end as well as it began also stupid one liners and ridiculous dialogues between max and chloe became annoying and took away from the reality factor of the game in ep 5 the protagonist s tone and voice became a bit annoying but that might just be me and the ridiculousness didn t help and lastly hoping for a great ending you are presented with a choice that makes all the choices you ve made so far in the game to be worthless they don t matter at all if the game did not have such a strict linear storyline and a bit more freedom with the powers it could have been much better
