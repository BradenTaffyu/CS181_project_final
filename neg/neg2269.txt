2023 i want to start this off by saying my logged steam hours do not accurately reflect my time in game used to play on many other platforms such as console and pc before connecting to steam i have spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours and just as many hard earned dollars into this game the gameplay itself is actually pretty fun with a vast roster of amazing vehicles to enjoy war thunder is pretty unique in the modern gaming market which has really carried it to the successful position it is in today that being said however the severe lack of competition has allowed gaijin to treat their playerbase however they want and they have started to take a hostile position against their players and are threatening to shut down the game because players continue to voice their opinions on the variety of issues that currently make war thunder a frustrating experience the primary issue that so many people are bringing up right now is the economy over the recent years gaijin have repeatedly reduced the amount of currency and experience gained making the already very lengthy grind that much longer and more frustrating they just came out with an article trash talking the community saying that we don t know how f2p games are made and monetized and that this atrocious grind is standard practice it s normal for f2p games to incentivize paying money to progress quicker the trade off is always time vs money but war thunder has made it so egregious and painful that they basically force you to spend money just to have fun they even said in the article that the free to play experience is supposed to feel bad going as far as making sure you can t profit unless you pay to play ie having a premium account and premium vehicles not only have they reduced the amount of progress gained they also started gatekeeping standard gameplay features behind even more experience and sl requirements things like repairing your vehicle putting out fires etc this will continue to get worse and worse without drastic push back from the players and it needs to stop and even be reverted if this game wants to live any longer there are many other issues with this game that have been a problem for quite some time the economy is just the biggest one and the most harmful for both new and veteran players alike the tiers of play have needed a comprehensive overhaul for a long time now with players demanding br decompression which would solve many issues with the middle tier grind i now have no hope that this will ever happen as gaijin have straight up admitted to wanting those tiers of play feel so bad that people would rather spend hundreds of dollars then go through that tortuous experience to summarize war thunder is no longer a free to play game the developers have come out in opposition of their players enjoyment and deliberately want the game to feel impossible without players shelling out tons of money more money than the egregious prices of aaa titles nowadays they keep going back on their word adding premium vehicles at every tier ruining the matchmaking and match quality of most upper tiers they keep the middle tiers painful to play to force players into spending money to avoid them worst of all they deny the criticism from the people that keep the game alive and threaten us in hopes they can keep doing their predatory and evil practices to keep making as much money as possible before the game inevitably dies i honestly don t know what to do at this point i love this game and wish to play it for years to come but with the direction things are going i don t think that will be possible there is a lot riding on the next few updates gaijin has the ability to fix the vast majority of problems in the game with little to no effort all they would need to do is remove repair costs and most of the issues with solve themselves i just sadly don t see them ever taking the side of the players ever again and that is unfortunately a very common theme in the gaming sphere lately if you re a new player reading this try the game out see if you like it it is actually pretty fun at least until you hit the massive wall and your progress grinds to a halt don t spend any more money unless they listen and make the economy better it s one of the only things holding this game back
