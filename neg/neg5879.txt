2018 total war games are historically authentic not historically accurate if having female units upsets you that much you can either mod them out or just not play the ca personal who are shutting down forums in which people voice their concerns is the final kick in the teeth stop with the forcing of diversity for diversity s sake game is a terrible sequel to its predessor which i quite enjoyed need to bring back real sieges in all titles the historical revisionism is disheartening no thanks ca you will lose my buisness if this continues just not play wish granted
