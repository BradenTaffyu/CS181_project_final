2017 i ve played this game for almost 60 hours certainly not as long as plenty of other people and certainly not as long as i ve played basically any other bethesda game the great thing about this game is that the combat and weapon variety and customization has been improved immensely gunplay is very satisfying for once and you can play it without vats the atmosphere it must be said is absolutely spot on i love the depth and diversity of the environments in this game it also has or rather had a very healthy modding community with a plethora of awesome mods for just about every kind of player my praise stops here firstly the dialogue there are plenty of people out there who are going to say it was good the dialogue for the player was voiced very well and it was quite consistent however if you played any of the previous fallout games you know that half the fun of these games is the witty inane psychotic and stupid dialogue options and all the extra loot and dialogue goodies you could unlock with a high enough speech skill unfortunately they dumbed down the dialogue to a four choice system you can either ask a stupid question be sarcastic give a yes or give a no yes it s really that boring you don t get to see what your character is actually going to say and sometimes it isn t even what you intended the dialogue is terrible i actually avoided doing pretty much any real quests because the wonderful atmosphere and combat system drew me into the game but every time that dialogue wheel appeared i got taken right back out secondly the melee if you like playing first person and you like playing a melee character good luck mechanically it s exactly the same as playing third person but bethesda up one minor detail the animation allow me to explain oftentimes in melee you can get staggered and you will be unable to strike or block okay that s fine that s fair but in first person all you see is your character holding his or her weapon ineffectually and not responding to your commands for no apparent reason i originally thought it was a performance issue my computer isn t the best so i just gritted my teeth and bore it imagine my shock when i found out it was just yet another bug feature that bethesda forgot to iron out third that piece of creaton club i know i know but frostie you say it will help out modders and you don t have to get the mods anyway wrong and wrong it will not help modders modders make mods either as practice for development for fun passion or because they are trying to get noticed by a gaming company such as daddy bethesda how exactly will modders have fun making mods or get practice by genuinely challenging themselves when they could instead be making their very own very profitable microtransactions and how will anyone get noticed amid the veritable horde of people who will rip off other mods and churn out crappy mods constantly for a quick buck the answer is simple and it is sad as well you do have to get the mods oh by all means i don t have to purchase them but i seem to recall a 2 gigabyte update which didn t actually give me any content while the creation club is a slap in the face to those of us who love the freedom of pc gaming this is the last straw for me i will not clear space on my hard drive for bloatware which i have neither elected to download nor purchased creation club if it is allowed to flourish will completely ruin the glorious modding aspect of bethesda games present and future considering bethesda already basically relies on mods to complete and polish their buggy half baked games they are open world so i usually give em a break it is the most anti consumer option to make those mods pay to use this game was already a mediocre recommend from me because of the lack of rpg elements but with this crap bethesda has pulled with the creation club i can not in good conscience suggest that people play this game find another rpg or rather fps since that s what you re really missing out on and go nuts don t support this kind of anti consumer practice from a triple a studio we need to hold them to a higher standard if we want better games
