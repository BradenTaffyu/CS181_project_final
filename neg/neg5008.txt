2020 disliked so gonna be honest here if this is an issue for you stop reading now this is yet another game that has been chopped up and sold back to you after buying the game you want to play all the content of the game you just bought no pay more money most of the ummm lets call them micro transactions because thats what they are not an expansion or dlc in here should be included when i bought the product they charge you more money to buy content in the game thats already in the game but to unlock it you have to pay played the game 5 min to find the pay to play walls ruined the entire franchise for me ill never buy another total war game again liked the graphics are nicer than rome 1
