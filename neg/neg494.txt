summoners war is one of the best and worst of its genre there is a lot you could enjoy with this game the issue is the repeated lack of improvements in ways that other games discovered ages ago the story is pretty much dead on arrival with nothing to really fill it out more there is no pity so you can very easily go 200 summons before recieving a lack luster monster that you can t quite use yet or is miraculously a duplicate to one you already have i love that summoners war exists i just wish the devs took the time to actually improve features they have been promising for 7 years
