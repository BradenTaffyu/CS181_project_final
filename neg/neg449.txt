2021 worst fallout ever every other fallout you only play by yourself this one you have to pay a monthly subscription to play on your own map wtf would be nice to play a game by myself at least would make more sense to pay a monthly subscription to play on public realms to pay for the servers doing just about anything is dependent on server communication i m on a major fiber internet connection and the lag is real your quests are reversed after re loading into the game made a full set of leather armor made a weapon and dropped a c a m p and built a floor area re loaded and found the quests to be active again to redo everything with the structure still there with a full set of leather armor with the weapon still in hand re placed the c a m p and found that it destroyed all of my structure without recovering a single scrap of wood good luck loading into the same realm where you built in the first place because all that progress is lost you have to start over lost all building material wtf the a i is horrible the dogs that attack you will run sideways npc s with dialogue may literally lock up if they have any planned motion tried to shoot npc s and nothing happens they just stand there like nothing happened must be missing something here because you can t move objects like you used to in other fallout games no option for subtitles for dialogue checked audio settings nothing this game is about 3 years old fix it i m not talking about just the steam release april 14th 2020 this game was released on november 14th 2018 and this pc version seems really broken
