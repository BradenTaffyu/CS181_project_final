2016 what happened to all of the research items the ability to create variants is all well and good but there just seems to have been a massive reduction in the technology tree lend lease has also got a big change in that items such as support or infantry equipment can be used seemingly without issue by any nation regardless of where it was made and where it ends up you would have thought that countries using totally different scales of measurement not to mention design would find it difficult to integrate equipment such as when the germans tried to use the various pieces o captured equipment on the eastern front it was a logistical nightmare because they didn t have the parts as others have commented the ai seems ridiculously simple i am not a particularly gifted player and yet playing as japan managed to coup nationalist china australia and new zealand as well as conquer far east part of the soviet union all without angering any of the allied nations perhaps because i wasn t attacking nationalist china who knows i ve yet to try playing as one of the other major nations i just hope the final result for this game in a year or two is of a similar standard to hoi3 which i have put a considerable amount of time in to playing and hold in high regard on a bright note i did find the ability to restrict which equipment was used by a particular division to be helpful as it meant rear echelon units could be restricted to the basic equipment and preserving the top quality gear for your elite formations perversely of course there seems to be no penalty switching from basic to level 3 infantry weapons which makes no sense because unless your forces are trained to use every weapon past and present in your arsenal how could they so easily switch between them granted there are common elements of all weapons but i fail to see how soldiers using bolt action rifles could easily switch to sub machine guns without so much as an org penalty to reflect the need to familiarise themselves with the weapon for now it s a no but it ll get fixed i just would have prefered pdx to not have released stellaris and hoi4 so close together
