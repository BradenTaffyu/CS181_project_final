2023 the bozos in charge of this game decided to remove the ability to organize specific troops into formations for an inferior system where formations give preference to specific people like those holding shields the key word there is preference so if you re trying to make a shield wall you ll have random great sword users standing in the way getting shot like lepers this change has not only made it harder to plan out battles but it has no justification unless you think humans are so stupid that they couldn t follow orders like i want the skirmish cavalry on the right and the heavy cavalry on the left it s not realistic it s less strategic so it s not a gameplay improvement no one was asking for fewer options so it s not requested yes it s faster to do on the fly so if you squint and tilt your head you could call it an accessibility feature over manually sorting them so what keep both and let players choose what to use don t take control away from us whoever the actual idiot was that decided this was a good change needs to be tossed out like they did this system i m not changing my review until they are or the system is added back without a modder taking it upon themselves to do so edit was for ease of reading and grammar
