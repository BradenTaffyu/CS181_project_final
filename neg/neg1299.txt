2018 early access review this game appeals to the sort of person who reads the negative reviews before buying a game you re thrown face first into a unique d20 system that combines d d s familiarity with gurps s customization this is a perma death flavored bag of salty tubes but your death will almost never be the fault of the rng pretty sure you can run this game off a solar powered calculator the options seem pretty limitless especially at character creation you re thrown face first into a unique d20 system that combines shadowrun s overwhelming layers of specialization with pendragon s obscurity you re tossed into a tornado of proper nouns with no right idea what any of this means the graphics are bare minimum total ass some might say not me but most people would say they re a whispy dog fart inches from your lunch i expect to play this game at least another 50 hours update it s been about three years since my review and i still revisit this game occasionally the soundtrack still isn t old after 200 hours there s not much else like it often i ll hear a song and think that would sound at home in fallout or this sounds like sim city 2000 i ve never heard any music that would go well with c o q that didn t originate from c o q and i listen to a lot of weird stuff the game is still good too
