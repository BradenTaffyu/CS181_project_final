2016 i want to say i loved this game i really do but fallout 4 is not good at the time of writing the review i have 327 hours in the game i have completed the game through every faction yet it is boring the game wasnt even worth playing multiple times because no matter what you do the quests are the same the new dialog system is ok but it lacks options the options are essentially yes what sarcastic yes and no which saying no doesnt progress the quest at all you essentially have no choice in what you do because bethesda was lazy if you loved prior fallout games this game is horrible in comparison the special system is essentially useless as you can improve your special stats every level every single perk is a liniar line under a special score barter speech big guns small guns ect ect is also gone not only that but bethesda hardly even focused on rpg elements and focused on the combat aspect everywhere you go is likely to only be a battleground for you to fight raiders which gets annoying when you want to play as a character who is not focused on combat but the amount of battlegrounds and lack of quests make the game super boring as it makes exploring tedius pros i love the settlement system really good modding community a couple of good dlc it just works much better shooting compared to older games a great armour system power armour design lots of neat weapons weapon mods fully supported modding decent ui plenty of crafting options dogmeat plenty of companionscons preston garvey too much of a focus on the settlements the game is only held afloat by the mods lack of decent quests too much of a focus on combat waay to much pandering towards typical fps players obvious pandering to console players horrible ai uninspired dlc very linear story line boring factions boring npc boring storyline cleche storyline stupid moral situations one companion at a time mod theft bugs to hell and so many more that i got bored of typing cons
