2020 i liked stellaris a lot it pains me to say that i ve stopped playing because the pricing model for the dlc seems consistently excessive i agree with other reviewers that say you shouldn t need to spend 100 to flush a game out it s a disappointing trend when a lot of developers seem to hold back content and charge extra for it later paradox seems to fall into that category as soon as i realized what they were doing i stopped supporting them their other games they publish are exactly the same way it s a crappy way to treat customers especially those that pre purchase before it s out and it s a crappy way to conduct a business
