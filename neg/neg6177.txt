i m going to give this a no simply because while the game is immensely fun there are just too many bugs that are present at the time of this review march 18 2024 i would say hold off on purchasing this game if you are interested in it however if you re a huge fan of the 40k franchise and are willing to accept there are many small and a few large bugs that will happen at one point or another then i say go for it also the further in you get the more the game feels unfinished unpolished there are quests rumors and events you cannot complete without mods simply because the game is missing something just know that some bugs are truly game breaking while most are just annoying inconvenient some might lock you in an encounter and you ll be forced to restart it because it didnt register the end of someones turn others will have missing dialogue options or being unable to complete a quest rumour because it doesn t update properly and the most egrigous one i ve seen the game saying you made major story choice c when you actually did major story choice a ruins your immersion when you re dogmatic xeno hating character is suddenly being talked about like they re a heretical xeno lover all in all i have genuinely enjoyed the game so far but the bugs i encounter and the feeling of the game being unpolished in many aspects makes me say to stay away for now give it some time and maybe they ll have fixed things enough to where i change this review until then save your money
