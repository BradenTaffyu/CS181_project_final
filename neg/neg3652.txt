2020 early access review i enjoy playing this game but i can not and will not recommend it unless the developers start improving things the community has problems with instead of adding needless things or annoying things doing things like removing the superior old crafting system locking the best tools in the game behind two rng recipes and tool parts making an enemy that appears 30 days in that can basically break through the best walls in the game on their own removing simple things like log spikes that were at one point the best heavy duty spikes and only needed wood they are also planning on making traders specialize in specific things meaning randomly generated worlds are harder and they are spreading basic things like workbenches and chemistry stations to random trees meaning they are even harder to unlock as these super basic important things are locked behind one tree which still means you need to divert point from survival to basic crafting you should have access too from the start they also make random things rng like being able to by default being able to craft all types of arrow heads but not all types of arrows you need to unlock the best type of arrows in the game yet steel arrowheads are a random loot this is example isn t as bad as some others as i can see why steel arrowheads are craftable right away because you need them for other advanced recipes you can find but locking a basic arrow type behind rng as well as the best bows even tho they could easily put that at the end of the archery tree as a reward for maxing it out they have not one of the worst things is locking the best level of weapons behind rng at best a player can make level 5 tools weapons and gear but by rng you can just find a level six of any item meaning even if you max out that archer tree the best bow or crossbow you can ever get is pure rng the final point is the hitboxes they are awkward and sometimes feel like they do not work if you play enough you will get a feel for them and shooting heads is fine but trying to melee a zombies head to stun them is much harder then it should be you are best off aiming around their chin but even then you may just randomly miss and hit that wall that is two blocks behind them a quick version of what i think is this game has an rng hitbox and balance problem but i will say it can be fun with friend tho my recommendation for blood moon on day 35 and on in multiplayer just run the demo zombies are not worth destroying your base over get bikes cars whatever and just run cause demo zombies are the most unbalanced enemy i have seen in a long time
