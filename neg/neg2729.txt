2016 stellaris is a game that i really want to like but ultimately it comes up short what we have here is an interesting game engine without much substance all the game features are too generic i don t find myself caring about any other factions there s nothing that immerses me in the universe i m just playing around with generic templates with no real end game there are late game mega events to try and mix things up but they are also rather bland having played and loved euiv i can sort of see how they might have ended making stellaris like this there are similarly generic mechanisms in euiv but the trick is that the terrain i e earth and the real world history behind each nation provides enough flavor and differentiates the otherwise generic cookie cutter nations in stellaris there s no terrain just a big open space with stars scattered around and the other races have nothing to make them stand out as memorable in any way at best this feels like a proof of concept for a game engine that could be used to make a compelling game whether they knew that and are relying on modders and or dlc or if they just didn t realize the shortcomings is unclear to me
