2017 great game i have over 220hrs in the game but i can t in good conscious say you should buy this game the whole paid mods sorry creation club has really tainted an otherwise amazing game i ve seen a lot of people saying just don t buy them if you dont like it that s very true sadly though when you dig a little deeper you ll see why this is such a bad idea in the long run besthesda makes money off of the paid mods this means they no longer have to bring out new content for the game or pay devs to make the content for years users have downloaded free mods and and tip the modders who make amazing mods that extend the life of the game for that user also said tip goes 100 to the modder and not the devs who had nothing to do with the mods you re buying if you buy this game at this present time you re helping destory the free modding community which i was a very proud member of for fo3 and nv
