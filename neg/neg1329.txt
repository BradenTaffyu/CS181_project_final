2022 early access review when bannerlord was announced in 2012 i was in the middle of finishing high school now i ve graduated high school went on a gap year graduated university lost my virginity found a job moved out of my mum s basement changed careers got a new job survived the pandemic and this game is still no way near finished at the rate taleworlds is developing this game it ll probably take another 10 years of development time and by that time i ll probably have a wife and kids with a white picket fence after having so much development time before they even released the game in 2020 the two years this game has been in early access i cannot recommend this game in early access its still too shallow and feels too incomplete honestly all they needed to do was remake warband but give it new graphics and maybe add one or two new features for it to be classed as a new game this game at its current state is just too shallow i ve been trying to hold off from playing this game until it s at least out of early access but at the rate taleworlds is developing this game i ll never get to play this game it s going to be a long wait until harvesting season
