2014 early access review probably the best example of appropriate direction for a zombie apocalypse survival game bleak and ominous emphasized by the game s beautiful musical soundtrack loss of character for failure helps drive a sense of permanence and weight to the world a trait decidely lacking in most other titles however the environments are largely bland and uninteresting the basic mechanics are relatively easy to master and the game offers no escalation in challenge the ui is clunky at best often feeling needlessly cumbersome it attempts to employ rpg elements in the way of independently leveling skills but then perplexingly ties them back to a master level fun for a bit but quickly runs out of things to show
