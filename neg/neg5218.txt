2016 due to the state of the game s current performance i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone warning long review below here s a quick tl dr for the more impatient types despite promises by developers the game is as poorly optimized as ever dx12 is not included at launch and multi core cpu support is no better than before the game also has numerous performance bugs limiting the experience further this poor performance renders me unable to recommend the game since after the release of empire total war in 2009 the total war games have gained a reputation for being poorly optimized especially on more modern computers amongst other things this has to do with the games running on a seven year old engine that wasn t at the time built to make full use of technology like multi core cpus despite the games by their very nature being extremely cpu heavy thus for a great many people the very first question that needs answering whenever a new total war game is announced or released is how will it run in the time running up to the game s release the developers made several announcements promising significant improvements to the engine improvements that would supposedly lead to superior performance by far chief among these were improved support for multi core cpus and dx12 support a few days before launch the developers released a statement informing that the game would not support dx12 at launch after all this will supposedly be patched in at an unknown later date in addition dsogaming com released a performance analysis reporting that the news of improved multi core cpu scaling was blatantly untrue the game is as poorly optimized as ever maxing out only one or two cores this is possibly linked to the removal of dx12 support having tested the game for about a solid hour i can confirm this i can also report a number of bugs and glitches that decreases performance further at least on my system i also haste to add that my computer is way above the official system requirements for ultra game settings according to the developers my computer should easily be able to run a battle with 20 regiments per side on max graphical settings in 60 fps this is blatantly and demonstrably untrue the following are my personal experiences with fighting a number of 20 vs 20 regiment custom battles at its very best and not taking any of the numerous performance related bugs and glitches into the equation the game appears to perform about the same as total war attila both for me and others i ve spoken to this makes sense seeing as there does not appear to be any immediately significant graphical difference between the two titles save for minor spit shines like improved reflective surfaces on metal for me personally this translates to about 30 35 fps when zoomed close to the ground assuming the camera isn t moving and the troops on screen aren t fighting when multiple regiments are engaged in hand to hand combat the performance will typically drop to about 20 fps it can drop down to 15 10 fps if said regiments are clustered closely together for some reason this is of course assuming the game runs flawlessly it doesn t performance related bugs include huge stuttering when the camera moves at any significant speed or in any significant distance fps taking a dive whenever even a single spell is cast and mysterious and seemingly arbitrary permanent frame drops and this is occurring all the time the fps counter races up and down like a rollercoaster in one example i was zoomed in on a m l e taking place between three or four regiments at the far left of the battlefield the fps hovered at around 20 i then moved the camera to the opposite end of the battlefield and viewed the exact same scene from there and the fps dropped to 10 7 when i then moved the camera back to the original position the game stayed at around 8 fps already poor performance made worse with bugs final words the general track record and business practices of the developers combined with the state of the game s performance renders this game something i am sadly completely unable to recommend i am going to apply for a refund and can only suggest that people with similar issues do the same voting with your wallet is after all the only real way to enact change i did not pre order the game and this is the exact reason why i am going to re purchase the game whenever dx12 support is patched in and will update my review accordingly my computer two titan zs in sli latest drivers intel core i7 5820k asus x99 pro 32gb ram game runs from a fast ssd windows 10 pro 64 bit disclaimers my computer is completely free of viruses all other games run fine i have tried verifying the integrity of the game s cache re installed the game twice and made sure all drivers are updated
