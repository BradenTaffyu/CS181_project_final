i ll cut to the chase the design of this game is lobotomized for the sake of being both a mobile game and a gacha game there are hints of brilliance similar to what you see in library of ruina s combat and the art direction is extremely solid however everything else suffers from it being a mobile game the story while competent is broken up into mobile gameplay chunks making the overall pacing drag super badly the combat is either press button to win or built on a system that fundamentally fights your desire to engage with it all that said this game is funding lobotomy corp 2 and potentially library of ruina 2 and potentially future projects as well i begrudgingly accept it but i do not recommend people play it read a story summary after the entirety is finished to get context for the next game
