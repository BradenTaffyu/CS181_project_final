2023 i enjoyed this game but the main story felt very short for the empires included so much pushing online play and pvp but this does not really interest me the news feed updates are always about changes and things being added to the game but sadly these all seem to exclusively be tailored to online play for the price of the game when i purchased it it feels like a kick that new solo play story and factions are being added in dlc only
