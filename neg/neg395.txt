2020 i was initially hesitant to get this game finally did in august i was enjoying it until the one wasteland update the new update added an obscene level scaling mechanic that has defeating the purpose of leveling broken the game for me at level 38 every enemy is now at my level in areas where they should be 10 to 20 at the highest i can no longer have a relaxing session where i can gather crafting supplies and conserve some ammo every enemy encounter is now a struggle mole rats feral ghouls and rad roaches just soak up bullets now this game has been a mess since day one and has now taken a giant step backwards
