the ai is absolutely brain dead on hard my ai ally just ran from the enemy then it had its massive fleet parked facing towards jumping but jumping was not initiated and didnt attack the enemy fleet back while the enemy fleet disassembled it casually i honestly expected better then this also can you please remove the extremely annoying feature of following any target that the mouse cursor for some reason decided to track the game cursor just follows and tracks anything on its own wtf zoom in to cursor is great following anything is very bad
