2019 i hate to say this but i feel like the total war system just isn t doing rtk justice i know the koei versions are of a more inferior engine but the game mechanics and system is a lot more immersive and representative of romance of three kingdoms in my opinion art work and characters representations are inferior to koei s and this games feels more like a western reinvention of the chinese culture all over again its like the brits artist refused to look at chinese costumes of that time from actual chinese historical references instead taking liberty of their own and cook up a somewhat weird chinese looks of their own imaginations is this a good game probably for those who loves total war series however in my opinion i think the romance mode did a great disservice to total war battles which also why in multiplayer battle mode nobody bothers to play it online unlike shogun 2 total war three kingdom has the worst multiplayer features in all of total war series would i recommend this game sure but i personally has regretted buying it because of it bad battle mechanics for multiplayer to conclude this i would recommend people who only enjoys the single player campaign to buy this game i would not find it multiplayer features worth investing a dime
