2021 it hurts me to make this to be honest but im a day one player and ive clocked 630 hours my second longest playtime from my library recently paradox has been pushing updates that have negatively affected a number of games made by them but i will go into that later on the negative section of this review here s what i liked creating a custom empire i love it from both an rp and gameplay view it adds tons of different playstyles and options want to be a genocidal empire do it want to be the melting pot of the galaxy do it want to be holy zealots on an intergalactic crusade do it the civic and government system has come a long way since release and it has been made amazing this is strongly reinforced with a interesting species trait system that once again enhance both rp and gameplay while allowing you to even minimax your species for your empire even the base portraits are pretty nice as are the namelist while these are purely cosmetic and have zero impact on gameplay barring what kind of compliments and insults you get from other empires i m sure many who enjoy rp would like this a nice cherry on top is how mods can add even flavour and variety to all the areas mentioned above space combat the part system can allow for a number of different ships beyond classes support roles glass cannons ships beefier than a spacestation carriers cheap mass produced expensive specific role ships for those who like to minimax this is right up your alley ships sets are purely cosmetic and have zero impact beyond the looks the actual engagement of ships is not complicated like endless space for example but as you play more you begin to appreciate or hate the hyper lane system which can allow you to turn system into a fortress at certain choke points anomalies what a great way to add incentive to explore beyond the hopes of finding and colonising a planet great for the early and mid game small reward of credits and minerals small research buffs lie at the smaller rewards other ends can be boast to planet productions of resources uncovering new special resources that serve important roles in the late game getting a free or some free progress on a tech however some might not actually net rewards or benefits adding a reason to remember the events and the correct paths the risk vs reward is decently engaging this also acts a way level up scientist and gain traits both good or bad now i feel that is enough good points there a few things i m neutral on such as the leader mechanics or lack thereof but now onto the bad dlc ah yes cant talk about a paradox game without talking about the dlc i know what your thinking why is he talking about the dlc in the vanilla review well its because paradox s approach to dlc means you buy the game so you can buy the dlc short take its often a lot of money for mediocre things there are some good dlc s in this game like utopia and synthetic dawn adding some great mid to late game options and more empire customisation these two i would say are a must buy to enjoy stellaris fully the rest are such a bag of hit or miss it is down to you to make up your mind that being said the base game is pretty much complete and playable but its bland without the flavour added in from dlc planet invasions either bomb it to bits if its pointless or just spam a huge number of armies and yes that is the level of depth for invasions updates this may seem petty to do for a review but this is something of a trend across all paradox games i have played the amount of reworks and changes as i mentioned in the custom empire section there were changes made for the better of the government however there have been changes made to the space travel system which was mandatory hyper lanes as before you could chose between hyper lanes wormholes or warp drives each having different strengths and weaknesses the move to hyper lanes for all at the start of the game result in choke points which i said you ll either or love the change that has finally driven me to write an review and a bad one at that is the pop population change back in the old days planted sizes dictated pop so a 13 size planet had a 13 pop cap this was changed as more simple city district system came into place with now pop able to grow until you run out of housing on that planet in order to combat performance issues paradox s recent update has now added an effective empire wide pop cap this results in stifling mid and late game colonisation this means that mid late game structures such as rings and ecumenopolis think coruscant from star wars now have little to no pop growth these mid late game structures have just been made expensive vacant worlds with jobs to spare but no pops to fill you could resettle pops but this means having a negative impact on other planets economies which then thanks to the cap can never be filled meaning there is no benefit to building these expensive or time consuming projects overall stellaris is a good base game made better with some of its dlcs and with the workshop but a majority of its dlc are bad to meh some mechanics are so underdeveloped the might as well be removed and some things needing mechanics dont exist and lastly paradox might update the game which makes it less or more enjoyable thanks for taking the time to read
