2018 i really liked this game before 2 0 and here is why if i wanted to play endless space i will play it i came for stellaris because of it s unique vision of ftl travel and interesting approach to space strategy i really liked testing all three types of ftl travel with different ethics but they dumded it down to hyperlane travel the hyperlanes in stellaris were bad in previous versions and they got even worse it takes too much time to travel and while hyperlanes worked in endless space in master of orion new one here they fail in those games you could actually lock down the entry points with fleets and star bases but here you can not you just run around your fleets in attempt to chase your enemy fleet and it gets annoying jump drive are joke with massive idiotic debuff and those gates are just another hyperlanes but towards other gates that change came because paradox couldn t understand how to balance all three initial ftl drives so they decided to get rid of fun ones up yours for removal my warp and wormholes starbases just what i need new thing to manually configure and worst of all those thing can t be placed at entry points to just you know place a starbase place several support fortresses and here is a choke point in your bloody hyperlane system but no that would be too strategic and they are bloody limited first we got the limits for superstructures which doesn t make any sense because if i can build one why i suddenly can t build second and now we get those limited for strategic usage starbases because we can t build more than something especially if we are large galactic empire the freaking mod with large starbase provided explanation to why you can not build another one and while it was strain to your resources it also provided very large benefits initial recon can now be done with just science ship so why usually i sent out several disposable ships before launching the science one because it could enter the system with dragon pirates or something even worse those little corvettes i could lost are nothing compated to losing actual scientist especially with a high level phd doctor onboard what magical forces of this universe are stopping my military ships to perfrom not so detailed but still recon op ever heard of a normandy from mass effect pretty much nothing stopped that ship from exploring tempest too was pretty much free to roam where he bloody wanted so yeah say goodbye to that 5 6 7 star gordon freeman because he entered right into enigmatic fortress war it s awful because of new claim system and war exhaustion we for short why i need claims in a first place especially when i am devouring swarm determined exterminator fanatic xenophobe fanatic militarist all i want is to challenge another empire take all their women and enslave male population maybe in reverse when i feel to maybe destroy them all because i want to master of orion 2 which came in bloody 1996 had done it better where ai could actually start a war with you while you are at another war or start picking at ai that you are stomping no freaking claims just declare the freaking war and do it but no we need we which is insane if you build a starship you not just built it you made everything for that ship in terms of crew supplies and maintenance so how i fell it is that we is something slapped over that doubles the attrition you already have in terms of minerals and credits it ticks by itself rises too bloody fast and makes no freaking sense and when you are 100 at it you are making white peace automatically preferebly not in your favor so yeah imagine this you start a war make some battles your fleet is damaged you decided to repair it and reinforce and then suddenly your zerg tyranid cosplayers get into white peace because reasons and 100 we which came out of nowhere like rko from randy orton and you lose some systems also we and claims make no bloody sense they are artificial limitations because paradox couldn t make a better solution they made the worse one possible diplomacy is still banta poop master of orion 2 done it better and no freaking game came close ever since no matter how hard they tried i can t understand why just play the moo2 and implement everything it has there and more no espionage two years later from launch master of orion 2 sends it s regards and some spies too to steal your tech again combat is the same instead of a large doomstack fleet we can now have several fleets doing exactly the same doomstacking freaking sins of solar empire had better combat in real time i wish paradox sticked to the vision of tactical combat like in moo2 they even had soundtrack for that battle for supremacy which is awesome maybe they can actually do it in the future real time fleet transition with tactical turn based combat untill those times we have exactly the same what we had before overall 2 0 destroyed my stellaris with zero real additions to the gameplay paradox couldn t handle the problems they seemed to be primary ones and decided to just make stellaris into a breed of europa universalis and endless space because it was done to balance the games it s not balance you changed the core of the game i bloody payed for i payed for dlc s and wanted to buy apocalypse and those overpriced humanoids but thank emperor my money stuck in transition to steam and i played 2 0 a bit to test the features what s even worse i can not ask for a refund and even if i could i i just can t i really love this game and wanted best for it but it s like see someone murdering your best buddy up yours paradox this is not what i payed for this is not why i fell in love with stellaris in a first place i will stick with 1 9 1 version and will not buy anything from you from now on because if you changed the core of the stellaris so drastically what can stop you to change the core of other games for others i hope you can enjoy the 2 0 peace and prosper
