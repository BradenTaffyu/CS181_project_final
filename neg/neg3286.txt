2017 i gotta say i like this game it s a lot of fun especially if you have friends that own it that you can play with it s a good game as is but it could be god tier if the devs would open their ing eyes and listen to what their customers actually want i m not going to do a full review but good god i just want paradox to do something about their dlc obsession christ on a bike have this game s features don t work right too much expensive content lacking dlc they have a huge part of their community crying out for the broken parts of the game to be fixed and what do they do make more paid dlc come on paradox like the game most of the time but the developer not so much so much potential so much but it s squandered by the developers
