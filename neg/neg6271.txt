2023 early access review tl dr game is actually very fun but greedy monetisation changes have left a sour taste in my mouth went from playing on a daily basis for 6 months to not even logging in disappointing marvel snap at its core is a very good game but sd has been making terrible changes to card acquisition for like 2 or 3 seasons in a row now from not following the original cadence of series drop all of a sudden to repeatedly reducing player agency in getting cards and now they have taken away most of the in game currency you previously could acquire from leveling up the very same currencies that allow you to purchase cards and bundles by drastically reducing the amount you get and further randomising the cards you can get they basically want you to use the superior card to play the game your credit card it s funny how they touted the game as not p2w but all the changes have made the game more and more p2w
