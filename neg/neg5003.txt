2019 i ve never seen a company hate its fan base so much and punish free thinking and creativity the direction this company is headed makes me sad some examples are recent price hikes on all older games censoring mods that developers don t agree with and a complete bastardization of what total war games used to be its a 1 step forward 2 step back kinda company
