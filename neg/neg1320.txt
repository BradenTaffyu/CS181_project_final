i love the game and played it plenty but as it stands it is a combat conquest sandbox with little other interaction the in game diplomacy can be generously described as bare bones and interpersonal interactions are more or less not present companions gain exp at a near glacial rate for most skills excluding the slots reserved for specific party role scout quartermaster medic and engineer while i like the weapon forging system and it can be fun to make weapons you like it is rather hilariously broken as once you figure it out you can regularly make weapons that sell for upwards of 40k or more destroying the economy the ai during war times can be rather frustrating having large armies of 600 900 men chasing around a 30 man group they have no chance of ever catching while the enemy could be sieging one of their cities not but a half days march away in conclusion the game feels like the core of something that could be great but is simply missing individual mechanics to make wandering its world feel worthwhile i love the game and wish it were more and i hope someday taleworlds fills the game out to the point of making this review entirely wrong but after 2 years of development with little movement frankly at all i cannot in good faith recommend the game
