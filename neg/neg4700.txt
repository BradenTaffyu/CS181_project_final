product received for free it s an interesting take on the survival genre i have spent quite a bit of time playing this and i can understand why people go for hundreds or thousands of hours on it unlike most other games similar to this you are very limited to what you can do to the world around you building is a weird and unfun experience the combat is also not good you click some buttons on your keyboard then step back so the creatures don t damage you that s called kiting it feels very unsatisfying to fight creatures on this game it barely feels like your attacks are doing anything to the enemies it makes for bland boss battles as you just keep spamming the same thing until their hp drops to zero and they poof out of existence they are more of an annoyance than a fun fight you look forward to it s boring there s not much to do and you ll constantly find yourself glued to a wiki page to figure out what content you can explore here i d look for something else
