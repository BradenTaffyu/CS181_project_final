2017 a good game but not good enough to stay 60 dollars after 3 years i like the game but it s not good enough compared to the other games to stay at that price edit originally posted by welsh dragon it s regularly several times a year on here for 75 off as well as all the dlc meaning you can get the game all dlc for less than the game on it s own when it was first released if you add the game any dlc you are interested in into your wishlist you ll even get notified by steam when it s on sale although i mentioned it s not worth it at the full price i never mentioned that it is worth it for when you can grab it on sale when it goes on sale which i have been told it often does it may be worth it to pick it up good luck with your shopping
