2019 while total war three kingdoms is a great game with many qualities that i admire i feel like no one is addressing some key issues i noticed for one the lack of a true representation of difficulty i have many hours in the total war warhammer games and i can say with certainty that the difficulty of those games is accurate easy is a cakewalk normal presents a good challenge hard is for the comfortable player very hard for the vet and legendary for the insane but three kingdoms is nothing like that why on normal can i only fund one army and the ai can field three in the opening turns of the game why can armies from the ai pop out of no where not appearing from any settlements they own nor finding any routes they could have taken why are the garrisons starving out in a meager five turns without any hope of actually defending the settlement maybe this game is for more experienced players i have over 1200 hours in the warhammer series but only about forty in the history focused titles yet this game feels truly difficult to me and not in a good way if your going to give a learning curve at least give us a difficulty that can actually allow us to learn i don t want to start a new game as cao cao the recommended easy to start faction and lose by turn thirty because i got dog piled by the ai for no apparent reason it s a beautiful game with deep character and stories but i feel it falls flat when it comes to the battles and that has turned me off the game maybe if ca fixes the difficulty or allows for more balanced starts i will recommend this game but as it stands now wait and don t buy it you ll only be frustrated as of now i have won a game as sun jien having his daughter sun ren take over as empress but every single other campaign i ve started i ve scrapped because the ai just runs me over on turn ten still super frustrating as i love this games art but cannot enjoy it
