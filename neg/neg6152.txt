2021 was great until the latest update and now the game crashes after 5 20 minutes every single time i try and play skirmishes or campaign haven t tried multiplayer yet totally frustrating and means i simply can t play it if this persists and the devs do nothing despite so many people kicking up a fuss i ll be asking for a refund totally unplayable right now
