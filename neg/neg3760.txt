2017 early access review it s hard giving this game a bad review as i really love the concept but the persistent problems just give me no other option multiplayer with friends is a huge gamble 7d2d has confirmed multiplayer connectivity issues on all platforms that the developers admit they can not fix me and a friend bought the game to play together and after two weeks of troubleshooting we finally give up more annoyingly we actually managed to connect and play for around 10 hours after witch the game decided not to let us connect anymore and this is a common issue believe me i feel like i ve read all related forum topics since 2014 the devs do not know what is causing this so the recommended solutions range from not user friendly to just absurd adding exceptions to firewall port forwarding your router changing your router changing your isp funnily we tried all of these with no result uncontrolled cheating on servers because of bugs if you want to play on a server you have to look for a hardcore whitelist only one since every other one has hackers and they aren t even hacking the game has an exceptional amount of bugs allowing duping and other single player is probably your best bet your safest bet is playing single player and if you don t have any other desire beyond that you are probably going to have a good time the game is very atmospheric beware the occasional updates might require you to start a new world and lose progress 4 years still in alphait s been too long it s been too slow the game has been funded ton of copies sold and the progress we are seeing is not right the development team is still actively working but they lack the skills necessary to make this a finished game looking at their vlogs you can see theirs priority topics are new textures and playing with level editing new houses for the world witch would be fine if there was not a ton of core function issues broken multiplayer and generally bad optimization
