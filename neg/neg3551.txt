early access review i m giving it a temporary thumbs down since it s in early release tldr it s extremely basic the updates are slow coming given how they don t seem to add much to the game there is no challenge after you figure out a few basic things there are tons of bugs visual and game breaking it has potential to be awesome no challenge every day is exactly the same this was the big one for me there are no thieves there are no events every day is exactly the same there is almost nothing to challenge you except how you organize inventory and buy stuff but even then you can take out ultra low interest rate loans from a bank every day is exactly the same very low content just making everything bigger or adding more products is not much of a challenge there is no technology or advancement tree there are like 3 lame challenges to reach in steam game there are no shopping carts there is 1 light to choose from the stockers and cashiers you can hire are clones who look exactly the same there is no leveling up your staff so they do their jobs better there is nothing to add but foods drinks and cleaning supplies there is no kids toy section no butcher no perishables no customer service no seasonal section no order in which you should place stuff to improve workflow and customer travel no thieves no weather or other related challenges no inventory management employees no cleaning crew it s in a totally empty 1 2 block city no parking lot management no shopping cart decisions or upgrades no security staff or theft prevention equipment no options to specialize in a decision tree no electronics no school supplies no pharmacy option no bathrooms all the customers are cloned from a small pool and they have no facial expressions no delivery trucks or delivery schedules or price negotiations with suppliers or vendors no hvac challenges or repair challenges pretty much no building management or landlord challenges or realestate purchases or options to expand to new shops no fire prevention stuff or meeting local and state laws no taxes it s on par with some cheap mobile game there needs to be challenges like fighting and clearing out drug dealers from the front of the shop getting bums and vagrants and thieves away from your shop drug addicts out of the bathroom toilet paper toilet stuffing clowns graffiti artists corrupt cops there has to be more of so many things the latest patch let you change colors of stuff and re name your shop you can have only 1 save game competitionthis is a good idea but the developer is not progressing fast enough they are sitting on a gold mine picking their nose when they could hire staff and bring this game closer to completion faster we already see people making this kind of game and releasing it on consoles and mobile platforms will probably speed right past the original given the pace of this dev i m not here to promote crunch time or some other corporate slop i m just saying keep the work environment chill relaxed have fun but have more people working on it or whatever it takes to move it forward faster
