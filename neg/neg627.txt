2017 i really wanted to enjoy this title but i can t get into it the new armor system is a let down you can t even taunt targets without stripping them of all their armor points first magic is extremely difficult to use without risking friendly fire some of the fights are extremely poorly designed ship fight between acts 1 and 2 i m looking at you and the devs love to gotcha by introducing enemies and elements into combat you couldn t have known about before starting the engagement much save reload and trial error required the illusion of choice is also especially bad basically you have the way the developers want you to solve the problem and then all the wrong ways feel free to select the wrong way if you want things to be more difficult on top of those things i found the story to be an extremely typical you are the chosen one and only you can save the universe tale some very eye rolling fondling over your character really turned me off of the plot the individual character stories are more interesting but only make up a tiny percentage of what you ll spend your time doing which is mostly wandering around large environments looting barrels and managing your inventory some final notes crafting is a chore but at least it s completely ignorable there s a ton of things to read but most of that is also easily ignored you will likely feel compelled to play one of the origin characters instead of making a custom character because you miss out on content if you don t graphics and sounds are fine but nothing really stands out as outstanding the entire game is voice acted which is great although that voice acting is just serviceable lastly this is an incredibly long game which i suppose means good value to some but to me means bloat and poor pacing divinity lost me in act 2 which is about half way through and i can t see myself playing another 40 50 hours of this
