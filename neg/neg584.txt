2017 i honestly cannot believe that i m writing a negative review yet here i am the first two acts are incredible beautifully polished and complete the third act starts to get a bit weak having a tendency towards very specific paths to continue unlike the previous acts which give immense freedom in how you play and your choices mattering the fourth act is nothing short of a trainwreck critical pieces of information being easily missed a book lying on a table in a completely optional area and in one case spoiling parts of the plot itself by giving me incorrect journal entries ultimately if you can put aside the huge drop in quality as the game progresses it nets to be a fantastic game unfortunately i m not one of those people the later acts were nothing but pure frustration for me and by the time i had finally finished i had forgotten about the fun that i actually did have in the previous acts in short since there isn t a mixed option i have to recommend against it but if you can get over the quality drop it s well worth the price otherwise wait until a sale
