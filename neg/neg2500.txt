2023 this game is 98 great but the last 2 is so atrocious it ruins everything the npc ai will find an infinite number of ways to ruin your campaign they will be going to eat for 4 hours when you switch their job assignment mid day they will spend 12 hours trying to build something during work hours instead of doing the job you assigned them unless you cancel the building then restart it after the employee goes back to work there s even 1 mission where a guy will spawn gravely ill on the edge of your map and the game will ask you to save him and then he just dies while walking to the hospital and there s nothing you can do about it except reload a save file and build a hospital at that edge of the map the dumbest thing i ever saw was when the prison tried to round up some criminals and it randomly chose to send the people in my gravely ill care house to prison and all the gravely ill people predictably died while walking to prison you can tell by my play time that i spent a ton of time playing this game because the core strategy mechanics are pretty fun but it was not worth it
