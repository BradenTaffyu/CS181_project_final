2017 as much as it pains me to do this i have to leave a negative review truthfully this is one of my favorite games and it s become my go to strategy game but paradox recently announced that they were removing two of the three methods of travel that form the crux of this game leaving only hyperlanes as an option removing not changing content is being fully removed from a game that most people play single player not only content a major core mechanic i would love to give this game a full and proper review but i can t condone a developer removing content from a game that we paid for previously each empire had the choice of three ways of traversing the galaxy warp wormhole and hyperlane each based on a classic sci fi trope warp travel allowed you to move to any star within your range but it took a while to wind up and was recommended for new players wormhole travel allowed you to construct special wormhole generators that allowed you to quickly move to stars within range but if they were destroyed you d be stuck this was recommended for advanced players and was truly unique to stellaris the final one was hyperlanes which allowed you to move quickly but only along pre determined paths like star wars warp and wormhole are getting the axe the varied types of ftl was what sold me on this game i watched a video of empire creation and when i saw that even the way you moved could be customized i was immediately sold i closed the video and bought the game and it s given me a lot of fun this was one of my favorite features in the entire game and it made creating new empires feel fresh and exciting i would rotate every ftl type so each game felt different than the last it made war with empires who had different ftl than you interesting it made exploration fun i m so sad to see it go now paradox has decided that they no longer wish to balance the game around alternate ftl types so we re left with only hyperlanes this essentially reduces stellaris to a game of movement across a 2d predetermined grid like every other strategy game instead of a game that feels like space it s a game that feels like a land combat game with a space skin one of the most unique features of stellaris is being fully removed and is never coming back and to top it off the developers have confirmed that they will not allow mod authors to put things back to the way they were and will be removing the code for the old travel method to prevent this from happening which just seems mean spirited i adore stellaris but i can t really recommend a game where the developers remove such a beloved feature despite a huge part of the community begging them not to who knows what will be removed next time as somebody who actively keeps up with development and has loved almost every other change they make to this game i could not be more disappointed than i am now it really saddens me to leave this review if this is ever addressed i ll switch this review to positive this isn t coming from a place of anger or hate this is coming from a place of disappointment in one of my favorite games i hope one day the developers reconsider edit the latest developer update has revealed that the choice of starting weapon technology is being removed as well all empires start the game with all weapons and one of them missiles has been reworked to only fit in a very limited type of slot on ship designs the starting ftl and starting weapon type were the two biggest contributors to empire flavor and now they are no more i could not be more disappointed with the direction stellaris is going in than this i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anybody any longer because i don t know what is going to be removed next it s deeply frustrating to watch the game go like this avoid edit 2 they just announced that the new paid dlc will add flagships to the game something that everybody has been waiting on for a long time what rubs me the wrong way is that they also finally added ship auras buffs debuffs back in which used to be a free feature really scummy to take something that used to be available for everybody and put it in paid dlc
