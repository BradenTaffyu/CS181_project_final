2023 cannot recommend as a fully released game at this time it s fair to remember that cs1 base game sucks but it has been just under a decade since its release that s a long time for updates patches dlc mods etc we all took for granted i ve spent a solid amount of time playing this game relative to its release date so far i can tolerate the performance issues and the bare bones base game limitations given that this is the initial launch that being said this cannot be recommended for purchase in its current state this should be an early access game at this point visual glitches flickering misaligned road decals glitched buildings farm mine hub buildings glitching through ground general balance issues with demand and cost and crashes the worst for last paradox has cast aside the primary reason cs1 was successful the steam workshop paradox s very small workshop in membership and participation will destroy cs2 if it is the sole source for mods cs2 has potential with great graphics and things like smoother zoning densities an attempt was made at creating automatically adaptable intersection markings like a popular cs1 mod offers but there is so so so much left to be desired and if paradox will knowingly anger its customer base and essentially handicap its own development by cutting the steam workshop then all there is to say is save your money for now
