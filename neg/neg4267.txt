2021 spaced out needed to be part of the base game not an additional 13 dlc the game has always been so small and lackluster to me that i never truly felt like i finished a game it just got so boring long before then and then they release more content but you have to pay for it i ve seen what klei did to don t starve with 252 worth of total dlc in the dropdown menu i don t tolerate that sort of nickle and diming especially when the base game itself really could ve used it and i expect no better of them now
