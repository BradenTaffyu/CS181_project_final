2023 i have owned all total wars since the beginning and played thousands of hours in my lifetime believe me when i say i was so excited for the new total war pharoah even bought the dynasty edition since purchase i played 35 hours of this game and do not think i will be playing any more absolutely the most disappointing total war historical game in the total war catalogue map is limited in scope just 3 main civs battles are a tradeoff of melee foot units archers and chariots no creative use of unit types variety of deployable buffs from general the battle maps approx 10 direct copy and paste maps from total war troy and over all the ui is a complete copy of total war troy this is not a new game just a copy and paste of an old game with new artwork never pre ordering a total war game again until i believe the developers have my interests as a player ahead of their own ca is a crumbling shell of the studio it once was
