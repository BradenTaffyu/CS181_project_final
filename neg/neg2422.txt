2022 if your a fan of the old games don t play this my favorite part was that at 19 hours in game about half of it is waiting for the other person to finish their turn i just love sitting there with my thumb in my ass for 20 minutes watching the other player summon 50 monsters on their first turn sometimes its even on your turn just watch others play it on youtube not worth the disk space
