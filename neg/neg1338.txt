i love m b as a franchise and i played the first one in its earliest alpha i remember how excited i was in 2012 when this game was announced yes that long ago but this game is fundamentally broken and the core mechanics only give the illusion of what they purport to do it is unfortunately putting lipstick on a pig i ve played this a lot and it has many qol improvements over warband but the same stuff still comes up and we re in 2024 i m not even going to mention the slew of bugs that have still been in this for at least a year there aren t any excuses any more fighting for a faction is frustrating going to take the enemy s last city oop now s the best time to make peace cheers king nothing and if you don t go rogue and loot one of their villages to force war losing you lots of influence then they ll rubberband and surprised pika declare war when they re back to full strength sieges are even stupider and broken for the large attacks you usually have to auto resolve because you guarantee if you go in yourself there ll be one or two people stuck in a wall by the end big hint taleworlds maybe if it s been 10 minutes without a kill and you have 700 attackers while they have 2 perhaps there should be some auto resolve mechanism but this has been an issue in the franchise for literally 15 years and taking out cities are even easier build a trebuchet then put it to reserve which means it disappears instantly into the ether rinse repeat then deploy all four trebuchets simultaneously they pop out of thin air and you pound the opponent into oblivion it s just stupid hideouts nobody else does anything about them it s a boring whack a mole situation and gets super tedious same with a significant amount of the missions the economy isn t an economy nothing matters or affects anything goods come out of nowhere people come out of nowhere the x franchise may have its issues but egosoft can make an entire self sustaining economy this requires nothing close to that scale everything good about this game is balanced with something hugely frustrating yet the biggest problem is that these are issues that you simply can t have in a single player game the irony is that with all this jank if you had pvp multiplayer campaigns no fast forward no pause just a real time running clock on vanilla this would probably be one of the best games of all time the only real way to balance an unbalanced broken game is to put more humans as enemies so everybody is equally broken and have one of the craziest maddest off the wall campaigns taleworlds have said this is impossible even though a multiplayer mod is currently being worked on and proven in proof of concept it s not the first time that taleworlds will say one thing and modders will actually achieve it that s basically been the formula but in bannerlord taleworlds have annoyed a lot of modders with their behaviour and mod support for this is dying as well
