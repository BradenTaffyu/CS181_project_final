2018 i liked the game before it had it s flaws but it s core was pretty solid lots of choices and options with choices comes bad decisions and consequences that can make the game much harder in the future but at least it was your choice now it seams that this game is going the way a lot of other games are going dumbed down railroading so that whiners that make bad decisions can be rectified this was my first paradox game i bought the full nova pack and a few of the follow up packs afterwards i didn t regret them most of it full price now i feel like they have made a completely new game from the old one the kind of game i wouldn t have invested my money in but it is too late i already bought into it and now it gets to collect dust in my inventory i understand change needs to be made in order to keep a game interesting but the core of the game should never be drastically altered unfortunately that is exactly what happened here i understand that alot of people that like the new direction will find this opinion shallow and narrow minded that is fine i liked having the option of a different form of ftl travel i liked being able to specialize in beams projectiles or missiles sure later on i mixed and matched a little but my core systems were still intact i like being able to focus on 1 or the other type of defensive system i undertsood that later game my focus might be exploited but then i could adapt my strategies if it happened i understood that some forms of travel could be circumvented by others and by defensive strategies but again i could change my methods of deployment now i don t have any of these options well i might later on down my progression tree but i don t want to have to work towards things that i have always been able to start with give me the option of improving them or changing them later but at least give me the initial choice i also find that an already tedious border expansion and war system is now even more so if i am tailoring my ships and troops to long drawn out wars vs short decisive ones why should i have to be penalized if my tactics tech ships and troops have been conditioned to long conflicts there shouldn t be consequences in almost all conflicts the army that has the endurance and the tenacity almost always wins against the quick and rushed one it was already annoying at best to have to constantly micro manage my already limited assets and now it is even worse now i have to invest multitudes more time and resources to accomplish things that used to be a nuisance now they are downright aggravating also now i have to spread my already limited fleets sizes even more thinly because i absolutley have to maintain mutlple fleets i used to have a main armada and then a few smaller quick response fleets now i have a gaggle of fleets to keep track of and babysit instead of three or four i have to deal with 8 or 9 i get that you will eventually need to maximize your fleet spreads but that was usaully mid to late game now it is mandatory right of the get go the pirates where annoying always now they are bloody obnoxious anyways i digress i do like some aspects of the new release but for me the negatives vastly out weigh the positives this is just my opinion and i don t expect everybody to agree with it but at least understand that some change is good but change can get easily carried away and take a relatively good thing and turn it into a terrible thing unfortunately that is what happened here to those that like the new realese power to you and i hope you enjoy it to new people i definitley cannot reccomend this game unless you really really get your giggles from tedium frustration and massive cases of micro
