2017 very shallow and dumbed down from new vegas edit because comments won t post let me at lengththe review i left above was a little terse because i thought it wouldn t get a second glance so i ll go into a little more detail here very shallow the lack of meaningful choice in this game has been pointed out elsewhere but it does need repeating there is very little choice in this game on a micro level and a macro level on the micro level the dialogue system has been reduced to yes yes yes wait till i come back and say yes no options to use your skills to influence decisions because they took out skills the charisma checks aren t really clear why did bethesda go back to this system idk you cannot create options like in new vegas stealing pickpocketing blackmailing lying would usually net you advantages in a conversation hell sometimes you could just kill people outright to move on very satisying fallout 4 on the other hand encourages a very passive approach the game does not let you choose the game does not give you information to make a decision in fact with this latest iteration the bethesda is taking the decision making out of rpg s yay go bethesda dumbed down people take offence at this because of the connatations of this statementfallout 4 is dumbed down fallout 4 is dumb if you play fallout 4 you are dumb i iz smarter than you are you dumm i m not taking this elitest mindset in fact one of my favourite pleasures is playing counterstrike like its quake if you enjoy the game bethesda has made that s cool as theres evidently a lot of people who find the settlement building satisfying me personally i was expecting more of the same of new vegas even fallout 3 i wanted my challenges to be defeating op enemies or reading between the lines of the dialogue for a solution i didn t want to worry about a settlement being under attack especially in survival mode with no fast travel it doesn t add complexity to the games mechanics it s more like a irritating distraction however my biggest gripe is with the writing it s so childish and naive the protagonist is mollycoddled by everybody including his enemies out of the milk of human kindness the railroad faction has no reason to exist save robots when humans are dying all around you everything is either good or bad not the power plays seen in new vegas not the bitter feuds and betrayals of the mojave lore nope you get fairy tales where the hero struggles and prevails for his chosen faction no really tough decisions were made like in new vegas where you would save people one day and blow them away the next because they were pawns to be sacrificed new vegas didn t pull its punches torture rape slavery infanticide were part of the world and you were often punished for bumbling around and trusting people because the dialogue system has been truncated character development has taken a massive hit the story lacks any gravity or involvement because it feels like one big quick time event because it has not developed any nuances or subtleties it feels vapid and unreal yet at the same time it takes itself rather seriously which i find disconcerting in the first fallout game you could kill children not that you d want to don t be a sick f k but the game entrusted you with freedom and let you reap the consequences fallout 4 gives you point and click and a sims minigame i m not raging on the people who enjoy this game but i m annoyed at bethesda for rewriting the franchise in such a high handed manner i ll be voting with my wallet next time they release a fallout game
