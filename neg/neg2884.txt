2022 i was 10 hours into a game and had spent most of my resources towards building up a badass space fleet then one of my planet s starts a slave revolt then suddenly 3 other planets join them and the game offers to go to war with them sure why not i owned those planets and they re broke so what could they possibly throw against my fleet suddenly those broke planets have a fleet four times the size of the one i spent half a century building they just wished it into existence just like all those real life rebellions on earth where some people were disgruntled so they walked down to the beach and threw together a 10 billion aircraft carrier on the weekend let me be clear i like random events i love rimworld and dwarf fortress but random events are only fun if you can use your judgement to react to them screw this stupid cheating game
