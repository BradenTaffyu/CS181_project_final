2018 haven t reviewed this game yet taking the opportunity to thumbs down in light of the recent controversy if someone signed off giving pr responsibility to someone so tone deaf and who thinks it wise to take the battlefield style response to the community think about what other problems plague the studio from art design to content developement what else can we expect next don t take this sale opportunity to buy into the dlc trap a dissapointing situation if you want a gameplay review one of the worst tw games i ve played better off playing shogun 2 me2 atilla warhammer political system is so underwhelming and frustrating it should have been scrapped and redone a half a dozen times over by now
