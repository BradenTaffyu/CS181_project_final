2022 this recent update is far worse than the pop rebalance debacle that we underwent at least that one was able to be quickly resolved by a slider that allowed you to play normally as would be expected of a 4x now they have completely broken the systems numerous x s of the 4x genre are completely unplayable or a massive pain the only way to fix the issues are going be more major changes down the line i do not expect this to be as simple as fixing the numbers or adding in a slider the changes administration capacity has been replaced by empire sizeempire size has an arbitrary soft cap of 100 if you go over this cap you will have penalties applied to the cost of edicts research and numerous other things there is no way to increase this cap things that reduced empire sprawl now reduce empire size this not only feels bad but also causes compounding problems with the other issues below unity has been reworkedunity is now the most important resource as it completely governs numerous aspects of the game that it previously did not interact with the causes the resource to be overloaded and you cannot possibly generate or use as much unity as you would like any attempt to increase the amount of unity generated like making unity worlds increases your empire size and neutralizes your gains your factions now generate unity instead of influence this makes sense as we now require far more unity than influence without this you wouldn t even be able to think of using the new systems leaders now cost unity to recruit and upkeep instead of energy credits this needs to be removed asap this is making early exploration rush one of the x s in 4x impossible now how many scientists you can hire and thus how many science ships you can rush out is dependent upon your base unity generation at the start of the game this also makes it basically impossible to reroll bad scientist perks and it makes buying admirals generals and governors painful the edict cap system has been replaced with the edict fund edicts now cost unity to upkeep and you have an arbitrary edict fund to eliminate or reduce the costs up to a certain point with this system i have never been able to keep more than 1 edict up at a time and eventually i could run 0 edicts due to an arbitrary increase of the edict costs to a point that eclipsed the edict fund the cost of the edicts are arbitrary as i was unable to determine what caused my edict cost to rise 300 within a decade there is no explanation in game planetary decisions now cost unity instead of influence this makes influence even more useless good luck clicking any of these buttons now resettlement of pops now costs unity instead of influence influence is even more useless now i guess it s time to really promote an auto resettlement option planetary ascension is now a thing allowing you to increase the bonus of a world by spending unity a nice thought but will never be touched due to being obviously unity starved megastructures now cost unity instead of influence yes let s take influence from being useless and make it really useless this was one of the few ways endgame to spend influence and now it s gone too with this removal there is effectively 0 endgame use for influence in many civics exceptions are gateways habs and ring worlds because those should cost influence instead of unity for no apparent reason the sad part is that 3 2 was the most fun i ve ever had playing this game and now i wouldn t touch it at all the changes made above have broken numerous mods and you cannot simply roll back versions while also simultaneously using mods tl drnone of this was required or even desired this needs to not just be fixed but reversed and neutralized and this time it can t just be fixed with a slider
