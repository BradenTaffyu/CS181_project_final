2018 vampire coast patch update do you expect your games to be able to run for an hour straight without crashing then twwh2 is not the game for you and btw i hope you like modding because you re going to need a lot to make up for blatant oversights and low effort bandaids from the devs i should not have to wait the better part of a year for fixes to bugs present not just on release but in the previous game i should not have to wait six months for the fix to a bug that has already been fixed according to the patch notes artillery dlc paywalls of vanilla buildings with major mechanical significance on the campaign map should never ever happen bug or not and a bug like that should never ever have made it to the live release it is very clear that ca is running the very bare minimum of qa because they re too busy with too many projects do not support this game until ca supports it
