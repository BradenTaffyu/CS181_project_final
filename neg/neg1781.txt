been playing this game off and on since 2014 i got into it for the planes and dogfights got more into it once ground forces came out it was a lot of fun back in the day but unfortunately those days have passed i only ever take the time to write a review of something if it really earns it and well war thunder now days has definitely earned it i never felt like writing a review for this game but given the current state of things gaijin they wont read this nor do they care and more importantly prospective players need to be aware of the can of worms they re going to open if they start playing this i don t feel that a novel length review is really helpful for anyone so i ll spell out the bottom line for you here and afterwards i ll add some more lengthy thoughts if you care to indulge more war thunder is ruined by 4 main issues currently 1 greedy uncaring predatory and out of touch management developers they don t listen care about feedback from the player base they don t listen to their content creator partners all they care about is milking the cash cow for the maximum amount of money possible i highly doubt they even play their game at all because if they do and they re still running things like this then they re truly corrupted 2 predatory f2p free to play game structure which ends up being the exact opposite extremely frustrating time intensive and grindy game experience which can always be fast tracked if you re willing to tape your credit card to the side of your monitor so you don t have to wear your wallet out this has only gotten worse over the years due to issue 1 listed above 3 extremely competitive sweaty toxic player base which because of this games pvp structure can be living hell for anyone below the level of basement dweller or full time streamer if you don t have enough time to get yourself a war thunder masters degree forget about even trying this game 4 inconsistent frustrating illogical and sometimes down right broken gameplay mechanics there s so many big little issues here that all add up into one stinking pos that martin luther could write a 95 count thesis on why this game sucks well there you have it in short summary thats whats wrong with this game i advise all new or prospective players to avoid this game and any games that walk or talk like it theres better things to spend your money and time on so now that you ve heard my overarching thoughts i am going to add some more context and detail to my opinions 1 well folks wt s dev management team where do we start in my opinion every single problem with wt can be traced back to this root problem cut through all the the gas lighting the predatory greed the questionable and out of touch game management and development it all comes back to this the buck stops at management plain and simple the management of this game does not care about anything other than their wallets and stock profile and their actions speak much different words than their mouths do over the years they have become consumed with the greed and are hell bent on milking every penny out of this cash cow they will try to make you think its your fault the game sucks and make you feel like there s no other option but to pay tribute the only thing that ll stop them is if people put their damn credit cards away uninstall the game and say enough 2 f2p game structure some of what could be said here was stated above so i wont repeat myself just remember it all traces back to the number one issue what more could i say about this games financial model its predatory every single aspect of how this game is set up is geared towards coercing you to get out the credit card they have set everything up to be as frustrating and as annoying as possible because they know if they can get you hypnotized with their promises of shiny new content and fancy premium vehicles that they can keep you hooked a little longer they have slowly been making things worse and worse and recently not so slowly its right out there in the open now for even the least aware players to see they prey on those who cant see through their 3 hyper competitive toxic player base there s not much more that needs to be said about this issue and it really does come down to personal preference in the end as i ve gotten older i don t feel the desire to measure and compete for numbers on a game but this is essentially all war thunder is and has been for a long time it is a pvp game at its core after all and with that always comes the sweats the reason i draw issue with it now is that over time as more nations vehicles mechanics maps are added the worse the sweats have gotten i just don t have the time to dedicate that it takes to compete with these people nor the desire to do so i play games for fun and having to work and grind to compete is not fun i have a life and other things i like to do in my free time besides war thunder and if this is you as well then you re gonna get mopped the higher up the tiers you go 4 last but not least the actual game itself like i said earlier there s a lot of you could get into with this section so i m just going to bullet point a few of my biggest ones first map design this is more for ground battles than air why does every map have be focused around some stupid city or in the bottom of a corridor valley where you re all funneled to the same place its not fun its frustrating and the map design is very heavily biased towards cities and rough terrain in my opinion this ties back into issue 1 and 2 but i rest my case there no room to maneuver getting camped in your spawn by players half the map away i don t think they even really test these maps before they roll em out second inconsistency plain and simple just sometimes does not work even though it worked perfectly 60 seconds ago penetrated a tank with an educated well placed shot location well now war thunder rolled the dice again and decided that its not gonna happen this time utter rng third battle design this one is the biggest one for me this is for both air and ground battles air battles dont get as much hate especially at lower tiers but it does get old when every match of air rb starts with a rush to take off from the airfield followed by a massive furball dogfight and whatever team looses less planes wins its not the worst design but for gods sake it needs some more variety it literally has not changed much since 2012 ground battles two words rage inducing its horrible if you love flying planes go play ground rb sounds kinda backwards doesn t it welcome to war thunder the plane spam in ground rb is just ridiculous cap a point or get a kill or two in the first 5 minutes and you got enough to spawn your plane loaded to the teeth with bombs and just go bomb and strafe with impunity playing an open topped td or spg you are d o n e once the plane spam starts which is usually 5 10 minutes after match start anything with 2 peashooter mgs is gonna come to strafe the out of you and kill you and there isn t you can do about it when ground battles came out i loved the idea of some combined arms fighting but it as quickly evolved into the most frustrating game design i have ever seen anything on the ground is at the complete mercy of the planes your team didn t field as many planes as the enemy you re you killed somebody well now that person is gonna respawn in their fighter bomber 9000 and come drop 4000lbs on ordinance on you for revenge its not fun to play tanks in war thunder when you re always ending up at the mercy of the enemies air force well i hope that gives you a good picture of what this game is if you decide to try it good luck to you
