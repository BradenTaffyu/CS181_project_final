2020 early access review edit it s been a few weeks since release and the dev team has been able to squish a lot of the bugs and mods able to address basically all the issues i had with the game combat issues have been and are being addressed xp issues being worked on and fixed with mods and various systems receiving a lot of love as it stands this is the better sequel to vanilla warband however on the surface vanilla warband truly didn t have much to offer for merc vassal kingdom relations which could be supplemented by mods that fleshed out these systems a lot more m b w provided a wonderful base for other better versions of the game to exist i think that s where bannerlord is at now it s an improved version of vanilla warband with cool systems improved graphics and new features but it s still just that upgraded warband did you like vanilla this is a really fun game were you like me and most of your time was spent in some mod or another this is still a really fun game but it s still vanilla so until the modding tools come out you re sol if you want something more substantial than the usual gameplay cycle original review below this is a really hard review to write considering i ve been a massive fan of the series for years have 500 hours in warband not as much as some i know understand that i m a single player player i don t care about multiplayer i should mention that i have full faith in taleworlds making this game what it has the potential to be however i m not reviewing the future pros after two days the dev team has already released two major hotfixes that fix a lot of issues if they keep this behavior up i m certain this game will be actually decent in as short as a month from now the game is stunning the map is new and very pretty and there are a lot of systems in place that weren t present in warband it s also a lot bigger and the economy is pretty cool even if its not fully functional yet apparently the modding is going to be absolutely crazy we re getting actual mod support instead of just trying to decompile pyc files to actually mod things given how much warband modders were able to do i m super excited for the potential here the new systems that are in bannerlord are interesting like getting to smelt your own weapons do thievery roguery and the barter system these systems fleshed out will be amazing i won t mention the various bugs crashes because they are likely going to be fixed here in the next week or so having 200k new testers tends to have a tendency to make things a little easier to bugfix some notable ones include archers not firing softcap on the number of saves you can save before the file becomes corrupted economy giving you 15k denars day all bandit hideouts crashing your game etc etc etc cons the game has been in development for 8 years and i m wondering where it shows yes the game is gorgeous but the lack of fleshed out systems broken economy bugs crashes and lack of basic systems like fief bartering kingdom management politics many ai issues etc make me wonder exactly what all that time was spent doing they have a custom built engine but i m on the side that says their subsidies from the turkish government for the last decade have left them dragging their feet and i m afraid we re seeing the result of half assed workmanship showing from it many of the systems listed above aren t fully functional kingdom management isn t in yet there are only about 10 quest types and political diplomacy isn t really implemented i m a little girl and am upset that there is no autoblock feature although i expect this to be either modded in fairly soon or taleworlds will cave to the overwhelming pressure to add it back in leveling is really slow compared to warband and there are more strict hard caps to your skills previously there was a skill which raised the hard cap for combat skills by like 70 or so per point invested now it raises it by 20 and you re still expected to reach 275 proficiency on some things even with the much slower leveling combat is slower i can t really tell it s different than in warband same concepts though and my muscle memory disagrees with it it s not even the blocking feature honestly there s just some delay i think this is either because your skills start out very low and are also really slow to level unlike warband where you also start very low but usually plateau in the 150 200 range for a skill in general this may just be the same system but the perception is skewed because the highest level you can reasonably attain in a combat skill is like 70 still out of like 300 mind you or more realistically 40 to 50 this slow combat feature also exists in warband but doesn t matter as much because it evens out once you become proficient in a weapon in bannerlord you re never proficient in a weapon level scaling is off for everything as mentioned the hard caps above basic farmer recruits will already have stats that outlevel your midgame character my imperial recruits have something like 50 1h skill even though they re level 6 i m sitting here at level 15 with my 1h skill hard capped at 40 with the lack of how well the game is actually fleshed out at this point i d honestly recommend waiting a little even a few weeks before picking it up it s not bad and i want its potential to grow but there s still a fair amount of issues with it for now that i find myself going back to warband mods to find a fuller experience
