2022 at one point i would have happily recommended this product to anyone looking for a hunting game sim on pc as there really isn t many other games for competition anyways but these devs have absolutely lost the plot within the past year or two they never listen to community feedback the updates are somehow 10 15 gb every single update no matter how minor like putting in an in game dlc store that no one asked for so screw you if you live somewhere with a low data cap and speaking of in game dlc store the devs continue to pump out buggy over priced dlcs that somehow manage to break the game every time they get introduced there is just no good reason to support this game or its devs anymore hopefully something like hunting simulator 2 or ultimate hunting can give these devs the kick in the head they need to actually give this game what it deserves
