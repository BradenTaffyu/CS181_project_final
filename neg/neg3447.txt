2023 this is a hard decision to make yes or no but in it s current state and price i can only say no if it had been about half the price they re charging for this then it would be a yes but i feel a bit cheated at this price the game feels very beta like they didn t quite get enough testing in before release to add to this compared to cities skylines with a whole bunch of dlc cities skylines 2 feels quite empty i feel like i ve swapped an old ferrari for a brand new kia yes the kia looks more modern and has a few fancy gadgets but it s no where near as fun to drive as the old ferrari bullet points of bad things garbage processing is very broken mail collection is semi broken you have to put a post box on pretty much every street education system figures might be broken especially for college level upwards subways are very hard to build road elevation changes are very hard to build bridges are very hard to build sometimes a building you previously connected with a road and has been working for ages suddenly decides it s not connected anymore sometimes things can t be deleted or moved due to incorrect shape whatever the hell that means performance is horrible and yes i have disabled the things they advise to graphics don t look nearly as nice as i was expecting even when on highest settings a number of random crashes radio glitches out all the time and repeats the same news broadcast exact words back to back sometimes with the same character other times using a different one ports are much harder to build than previous game it s really hard to tell which type of residential zone you have already laid down as there s now i think 5 different shades of green and when you click on the building it doesn t tell you which type it wasbullet points of good things progression system is really nice much better than before building variety is much better variety of road types is much better seems easy to make money even when you re loosing money due to rewards provided map is much better bigger which makes things feel less cramped
