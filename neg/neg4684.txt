2021 before i complain about some things i have to say that this game has a super unique artstyle and atmosphere and i really enjoy the way crafting works and how the building and obtaining of items works in the game the game is fun to play with friends on the endless difficulty since it gets rid of the hardcore penalty reviving people is still a pain but you don t just lose because you couldn t find a touchstone there are also some great mods that make the game a lot nicer like the geometric placement mod that has too many features to describe the healthbars mod and the mod that has every fill out the same map together and see each other on the map so that if you are playing with people that constantly rotate their screen you guys can actually find each other exploring in this game is also fun but sometimes can be annoying since you can lose the world when you die when playing in the default settings however this game has some issues i can t really let go starting with some minor things sometimes the resolution on my crafting recipies is borked so badly that i can t tell if something requires 3 materials or 5 or 8 another thing is that the combat is really uninteresting it s pretty much just memorize than repeat a strafing pattern like you re some robot swing 4 times back up repeat type stuff but the biggest issue is the utterly massive learning curve this game is hardly playable if you don t look up a tutorial beforehand or have an experienced player with you it doesn t tell you how to craft it doesn t tell you how to do combat the better way where you hold a button to attack so if you don t have that bound you can t punch and hitting butterflies basically isn t going to happen without knowing the enemies beforehand you don t know how long their range is and i don t mean like hey they swing wide i mean that their damage area is usually significantly larger than the attack they are actually doing so you kinda just have to get a feel for it whether you are in range or not this wouldn t be so bad if it weren t for the main issue if you are playing in normal settings this is a hardcore game so everytime you die unless you have a reserection device within a minute of where you died you just lost the game and have to start over from square one so the further you get into the game the further every setback puts you lets say you just made it to summer and go to the oasis desert you get hit by a sandstorm then hounds show up and you re too slow to get away from any of them and since don t starve has no blocking dodging mechanic you just die they ll stun lock you and then kill you and there goes around 13 hours of work to get there now you know not to do that so in another 13 hours you can avoid doing that again it is just far far too difficult to learn by trial and error i d seriously advise anyone thinking of playing this game to look up seasonal walk throughs so you know the basics on how the game works otherwise you probably will just get fed up and quit playing
