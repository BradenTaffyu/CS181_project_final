2015 haha now the downvoters of my review are also givining the game negative reviews for the same insanely greedy dlc policy base gamethe best most in depth strategy game i have ever played but due to changes in some patches and the actual price of the game i have to give a thumbs down for it the base game is very limited if you do not have the dlc and want to play the latest patch so the actual cost of the game is 134 93 plus mare nostrum 14 99 if you want it however i would recommend to revert back to patch 1 15 1 with all the dlc up till mare nostrum installed that was the most fun i have ever had with the game it was more in depth than ever before there was finally meaningful content between the wars estates are a nice addition the development and building of provinces is great a lot of people praise paradox for their dlc policy because of the extensive free content with all major dlc and the ability to roll back to previous patches but for a game like this the ability to roll back to previous patches is mandatory as play troughs at least for me easily last for 50 even i have never played through the entire timeline from 1444 to 1820 these long games would not be an issue but most major patches brake previous saves and as i play on ironman 1 save 1 backup only i would never be able to finish any campaigns if i would live a normal life outside of the game and i would play other games than this most major patches such as common sense and now mare nostrum introduce new major features or change existing core features in such a way that you either become handicapped if you want to play the current version without the dlc or also the ai is handicapped to make the game fair but it feels like you are playing in the paralympics while the normal olympics would be constantly dangled in front of your face as a reminder to buy the dlc in common sense this feature was the province development which locked the amount of buildings you could construct in each province this meant that if you didn t buy the dlc and wanted to survive any wars as a small nation the majority of your buildings were forts which crippled your economy even though i very much enjoy the game as it is in 1 15 1 i would not say that it is worth 134 93 unless you have nowhere better to spend that kind of money on sale the price might be reasonable or if you find the game somewhere else for less fanboys will give a thumbs down for any negative reviews but i am just stating the negative sides of the game because most reviews seem to only focus on parsing the game and the developers mare nostrumas a finn i find the cultural changes related to my culture group absolutely idiotic karelian is now part of the russian culture group finnis are now nordic estonian is part of the baltic culture group and finno ugric culture group is now just ugric this would be the same as making the whole scandinavian culture group part of germanic and renaming the mess to german i cannot see any reason to make these terrible changes as the cultures were accurate before i would like to know who was the idiot who came up with this idea and why it was allowed in the game as a finn i simply cannot recommend this patch as the cultural inaccuracy is appalling feelings right after common sense i was not happy the game is because of common sense if you buy the game you should downgrade it to art of war or eldorado this used to be my favorite game but common sense broke the whole thing and sucked all the enjoyment out of it it changed core gameplay features and made it so that you have a severe handicap if you do not own the dlc paradox why u do this to us conclusionbuy the game and all major dlc until mare nostrum on sale roll back to patch 1 15 1 and prepare for the best historical grand strategy game you have ever played
