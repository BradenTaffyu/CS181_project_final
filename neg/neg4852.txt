2021 this is one of the best total war games ca has put out but their pricing model really holds it back from greatness to play on the mortal empires map you need to buy the previous game which is still at full price despite at this point just being dlc for this and the third game that goes too for any dlc from the first game it s a real nickle and dime approach to game pricing looking to squeeze as much out of their audience as possible i waited for the few times each year they go on sale and one or two things i got from white dwarf and i recommend you do too if there was a middle option to the thumbs up down system i would give it since i do enjoy the game but hate this sort of treatment to their customers and fans if that ever changes i ll come back and change my vote but i doubt it since they have my money and that s all they seem to care about
