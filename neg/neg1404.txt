2021 early access review the lag when opening ingame menus is getting worse rather than better with every subsequent beta version things started to get bad post 1 5 6 we are now at 1 5 10 and upon opening the trade menu the game takes 10 seconds to become responsive again while the hdd usage goes through the roof if the developer had the ability to fix this they would have done so already losing hope here that this will ever become playable
