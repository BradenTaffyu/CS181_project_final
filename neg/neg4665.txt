2023 it hurts for me to say so but i dont feel optimistic about the path this game is going before being bought by saber teardown was fun updates cool free dlc new tools formodders communication with players and so on after the deal we have to pay for most likely rushed dlc with two maps thatare not even as detailed as art vandals map free dlc again one new tool ofdestruction that doesnt work sometimes just reskin of all previous tools garbage ui and of course a season pass as unexpected as tomahawk hitting your house workshop is now lookin like maidan as people want to revert at least some of this but sadlythis most likely wont change not without killing this game it was fun while it lasted but all things have ending
