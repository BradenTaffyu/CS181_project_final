2022 tl dr at the bottom divinity original sin 2 is a tragic example of wasted potential it s not really a bad game but i definitely wouldn t call it great it s a thoroughly mediocre game that reaches far beyond its grasp it s also terribly inconsistent despite trying for over 115 hours i never really got to the fun part and the cumulative frustration from idiotic and inconsistent design decisions was ultimately enough to make me give up and i would go so far as to say that inconsistency is the defining characteristic of this game here are some examples story and lore dos2 immediately grabs your attention with compelling characters a mysterious backstory fascinating and tantalizing cosmic mystery and hilariously witty dialog as you advance through the game however things fall apart very quickly and by quickly i mean before the end of act i which is a tutorial island wide swaths of dialog are suddenly bereft of charm and character interactions are instead almost always awkward cringeworthy tripe seemingly lifted straight from a goth teenager s livejournal from 2002 dialog choices for your pc are practically never in character no matter what kind of character they are which is almost impressive this distressing lack of vision extends to the lore which slowly unfolds to reveal a somehow simultaneously convoluted and idiotic story and i say that as someone who likes the interminable lore of the elder scrolls franchise the awkward painful and embarrassing storyline ends in the most offensive possible way soft spoiler with no actual plot detail your actions and choices ultimately don t really matter the ending is pretty much the same for everybody really while events can unfold differently depending on what you choose to do all three possibilities end with the game explicitly telling you that after a while things go to a certain state of affairs and this ultimate fate is functionally the same for every ending with only minor differences great job on defeating the big bad nobody cares and you wasted your time combat fun and engaging with tons of ways to strategize attacks and use the environment to your advantage except for the fact that initiative and turn order are obnoxious and nonsensical i ve quicksaved before a fight and played it as normal and as having re spec d my entire party to get initiative as high as possible and experienced no discernible difference instead it seems more like initiative is a slightly weighted dice roll it s also extremely important to note that enemies are not constrained by the same limitations as you using more attacks than they should have ap for moving more than they should be able to taking turns too often and being able to see stat buffs on you that you can t see on them as if they all had max loremaster gear tons of choices and different builds to experiment with all of which are 100 useless the very instant you level up this is not an exaggeration using level 9 equipment at level 10 against level 10 enemies is an 85 guaranteed party wipe this is vastly exacerbated by the game s economy and leveling system loot a wide variety of loot is available and the world is full of it in thematically appropriate ways barrels are full of food shelves are full of books and bottles and cupboards are full of tools and trinkets but nearly all of it is completely useless outside of being used for the interminable crafting system which is one of the worst and most frustrating that i ve ever encountered and rarely has the ability to craft anything you ll actually want or need to use inventory management this will be short in my genuine opinion this game is a worse and more frustrating inventory system than most games runescape only lets you carry 28 things at a time and it s somehow less annoying than dos2 s inventory experience and economy utilizing a principle of ootb pen and paper rpg campaigns that does not translate to the world of video games at all dos2 has a finite number of enemies to fight an effectively finite amount of gold to obtain and most offensively of all finite amount of obtainable experience points period this is a really bad design choice for a game with an open ended and non linear way to complete each act because you will miss things that become unobtainable you will accidentally complete quests you didn t know existed and miss out on the xp and you almost certainly will have to restart your campaign from the beginning at a certain point why because it s entirely possible easy even to miss enough side content yet advance far enough in the story by bludgeoning your way through fights that you will soft lock your game with no way to contend against your surroundings and no way to get up to their level mathematically doomed to fail the last point is indicative of the worst and most frustrating aspect of the game which is tl dr the game purports to be open ended and non linear with infinite possibilities except there s actually pretty much only one or two right ways to play the game if you go against that it s insanely frustrating especially since playing the game the way larian wants you to actually involves counterintuitively ignoring what characters tell you to do the game is on invisible tracks and may be literally impossible to progress in depending on whether or not you derail which you can t know without looking it up bonus complaint the definitive edition comes with a gift back of special perks you can enable to get yourself some qol improvements in reality this translates to comically overpowered god cheat functions that remove entire segments of gameplay but that s okay because without some of them such as the ability to re spec your poorly explained skills 4 5 of which are actually just dump stats the game is almost unplayable pick your poison
