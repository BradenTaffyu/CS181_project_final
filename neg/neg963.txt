2017 fun as a shooter where you dont give a about the story but it is not the hallmark rpg everyone expected from the franchise edit because people are on me for having over 100 hours played like i said it is fun as a shooter it is not remotely close to being as enjoyable story wise and rpg wise as the previous fallouts i would not recommend this game full price like i paid if you are expecting the same feel as previous games
