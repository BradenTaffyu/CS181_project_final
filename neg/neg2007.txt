2023 skill gap is absurd ui is intentionally difficult to navigate and incredibly confusing stupid economy system that forces you to pay real money to play properly gajin threatened to remove this game from steam because people have been voicing their complaints also insinuating that listing the game on steam was a mistake incredibly anti consumer and tone deaf developers i can t believe i m saying this honestly but if you want a no faff tank game at least play world of tanks that s also on here wargaming tried to pull some similarly shady with that game too but they actually backed off when the community put their foot down proper unlike gajin who are trying to shove the unpopular changes down the gobs of their playerbase regardless greed it s all gajin is do not endorse them
