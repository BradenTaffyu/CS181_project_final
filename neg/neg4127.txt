2019 when the original devs had it this game was awesome weekly updates and tons of expectations there was a huge modding community too after the new devs bought the game the weekly updates instantly stopped everything that was planned was scrapped and they only focused on the dlc the last time i played the game most of the mods didn t work and had stopped being supported i would overall say the game was fun while it lasted and i would recommend it for that the orbital physics of this game is what makes it great calculating the delta v to get your payload from kerbin to some other planet return etc is fun i never really got past duna though mars equivalent since it became rather redundant at that point there s a lot of little annoyances in the game as well speeding up time can be rather bad sometimes the parts that didn t work well for me though were the airplanes i tried almost everything with those i could usually get it to fly but it was so outrageously boring to do so i spent an hour once just flying to do some stupid survey mission it was so bad i still remember it and the thought of a space plane was just not happening for me it s much more fuel efficient to go straight up in the air and i could never stick with it long enough to use a space plane to launch satellites it s just such a waste really and then what fly the plane back taking off and flying isn t that bad landing is hard though there s quite a lack of instruments and radar to say the least i would have given this a thumbs up for sure but i was reading other reviews that complained about spyware and eula nformation collection usageby installing and using the software you consent to the information collection and usage terms set forth in this section and licensor s privacy policy including where applicable i the transfer of any personal information and other information to licensor its affiliates vendors and business partners and to certain other third parties such as governmental authorities in the u s and other countries located outside europe or your home country including countries that may have lower standards of privacy protection ii the public display of your data such as identification of your user created content or displaying your scores ranking achievements and other gameplay data on websites and other platforms iii the sharing of your gameplay data with hardware manufacturers platform hosts and licensor s marketing partners and iv other uses and disclosures of your personal information or other information as specified in the above referenced privacy policy as amended from time to time if you do not want your information used or shared in this manner then you should not use the software iv other uses and disclosures of your personal information or other information as specified in the above referenced privacy policy as amended from time to time if you do not want your information used or shared in this manner then you should not use the software
