2016 tl dr it s so much worse than civ vdon t get me wrong there are good things to this game but it needs major patches or an expansion to be an experience comparable with civ v eureka moments for tech and civics are great districts are a great idea bringing back governments and making it impossible to have cities that are all things to all people are great however there s big problems my least favorite part is the changes to religion the idea of religious combat sounds fine and all but in practice it s horrific you are in a religious war every turn of the game healing units requires going back to a city and you have a whole 3 kinds of units to wage this war with this makes religion a huge attention drain that you can t ignore because an enemy ai will be going for a religious victory let someone else take over your religion great now they must be your primary target for military war because otherwise a military path might just hand the other player the game there s also no way to really get anywhere without a large empire culture you won t be able to house enough great works to matter as the maximum number of great works per city is tiny to increase that you also need religion going back to the paragraph above another mechanic that makes us need huge empires is military an extremely large majority of units require strategic resources to be built nobody is ever going to trade you for them so you must expand wildly lacking an iron mine in your starting area congratulations you have to rush forward in tech and hope the strategic resource is anywhere near you but let s not forget that science makes things more expensive yes folks moving forward in the science track makes creating districts harder so you can end up being unable to do very much because you moved forward in science too fast nothing like creating a new city and seeing that it takes 70 turns to build anything so my veredict is that it s way too easy to get yourself in very unfun situations for the game to be worth it today i m sure it ll be fixed eventually but right now i can t recommend the game
