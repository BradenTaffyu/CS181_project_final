2018 man i could take the bugs the poor optmization the gutting of features of the original release to make it more stream lined for casual players and even thought the inclusion of women generals controversy was blown out of proportion the real travesty is ca think they can insult us as players and still charge 60 for this dumpster fire and thats without the literally 120 of dlc if i could demand a refund i would i m tired of all this anti consumer from aaa game developer if you re going to charge me 180 for a buggy unoptimized turd don t insult the player base with if you don t like it mod it out or don t play screw you ca i bought most of your games if you don t want my money fine i ll save it for something else pro tip don t buy from a game developer that insults their player base they ll just keep insulting you and cry wolf and call it misogyny when peoiple stop finally buying their crappy games
