welcome to total war games where the idea of difficulty means giving the same ai cheat codes abnormal buffs and nerfing the player beyond belief let s face it they don t know how to program computer nations that act like players even after decades of experience it s always been the same tired crap since day one the people that beat the game on legendary sure they re good but they mostly know how to trick the ai by outplaying them it s not skill and it s certainly not rewarding in any sense we should be able to capitalize on the ai making human mistakes such as advancing an army too far by accident one season building the wrong building once in awhile and having to demo and rebuild it forgetting to place the army in the proper mode and gaining absurd attrition nope instead again we get the same old bs of computers that know exactly where your armies are at all times and exactly the optimal way to react to it they don t get fog of war whether you accept that or not because that would break them to the point they couldn t compete thankfully bringing us back to the original point that they don t know what the f they are doing except farming your wallet
