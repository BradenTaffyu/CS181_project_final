2019 the game used to be good like really good one of the best game i ever played now paradox management released a patch that makes it unplayable i mean really you can not play past mid game every feature is broken nothing work as intended ai can not handle the new economic system can not handle the new war system it just stand and do nothing waiting for the player to wype them worse past a date in the game the performances drop and render it uplayable and even if you still want to play if you accept to spend several seconds per day the end game which used to be galactic epic crisis is broken and ennemies just stand by with enormous fleets doing nothing and on top of that paradox has the guts to delete every critizing post about the state of the game on their forums or steam even the ones that just acknowledge the numerous issues even when they are acknowledge by the devs themseleves would that be ea they would crumble under fan negative commentaries i used to be a huge fan of paradox with hundreds of hours in their games thousands dollars spent and was content now i m just under the feeling of beeing a victim of an elaborate scam
