2017 fallout 4 is not a role playing game it s an fps game set inside of a blurry dream that can be considered the fallout universe factions don t make real sense and completely disregard logic or what they were made for characters other than anyone who is related to far harbor are forgettable and most of the times hateable most terrible is a character who is turned into a radiant quest giver which most of the times don t make sense that also applies for the endings which are just 2 with 3 more being a variation of 1 of them the only thing that kept me going after playing the game multiple times after launch day on my xbox one was a gameplay loop which can be summed up into explore kill loot i started playing a looter shooter without realising it i wrote this review again because i tried playing it again on my upgraded rig and i absolutely hated it i could not get past the intro of the game without feeling literally exhausted and or disgusted i couldn t play it anymore i hated it i have some fond memories of this game but until fallout 4 new vegas comes out i very much doubt i ll touch this again the game can only keep you around so many times until it gets horrible
