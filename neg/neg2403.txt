2023 overall review not reccomended for new players or casual players competitive players will need to accept a coin flip meta that embraces a large number of unfair game winning cards pros 1 the game is frontloaded with enough gems to make your first deck with little effort 2 larger playerbase despite continuously dwindling numbers 3 much better graphics ui and music than previous yu gi oh titles 4 occasional once per month events that introduce a temporary change in deckbuilding limits but only stick around for 2 weeks leaving you with little to do in between 5 a crafting system allows players to dismantle cards for crafting points at an unfavourable rate in order to craft cards that they need cons 1 throughout the game s first year konami has continued to fail to utilize their ban list effectively you should expect most games at higher ranks to end in the first two turns usually due to a surrender after a game winning card is played cards that have been banned for a long time for good reason in the real game run rampant here and result in a coin flip meta 2 the card pool is frustratingly outdated while the game was initially marketed as a modern yu gi oh platform and many had hoped it would be a good virtual simulation of the current tcg konami has failed to keep it up to date with the modern game and it trails a good 6 months behind for no good reason 3 the pack system is very poorly handled none of the card packs are available straight away new players will be encouraged to spend their limited gems on the few packs that they unlock and packs are only available for 24 hours at a time 4 there is a significant lack of any substantial solo content such as that included in duel links or legacy of the duelist occasionally you might see a new story added that includes 3 duels against a faceless bot using a slight variation on the same deck once per month this equates to about 30 minutes of content every month 5 once you ve exhausted your supply of initial gems missions solo mode etc you will have no way to farm gems to open packs expect 140 daily gems which will allow you to open a single pack which is unlikely to provide anything useful 6 as time progresses new cards are being rarity bumped before being added to packs with the intention of making new decks prohibitively expensive many newer decks will have at least four times as many ultra rares as those from the game s launch 7 konami has been embracing a gem paywall in a small number of their recent events while releasing alongside them powerful unlimited meta strategies to encourage players to spend their gems to compete in the event during the link regulation event they replaced the casual play for gems format with a much more competitive win for gems style at the same time they left two powerful archetypes unlimited in the event ban list while introducing their new cards to the shop the result is that players unwilling to spend on the two new archetypes had a difficult time getting hold of all the rewards 8 konami has exhibited an unacceptable lack of communication throughout the course of their game and have made efforts to reduce information getting to customers via leaks upcoming events packs banlist changes and even celebration milestones are all left unannounced until they drop leaving players unable to gauge whether they should be saving their limited resources and bored as they wait an entire month for a sign of new content 9 despite now reaching its first year anniversary although ignored by konami the game still has little to no appeal for long time fans of the anime casual players or competitive players of older formats konami s continued failure to implement a classic mode or older formats is one of the many factors that ensured the playerbase has continued a downwards decline since launch a lack of other interesting modes like tag duels and best of 3 matches means that other applications such as duel links and fan made applications like edopro are still the ideal choice for providing captivating games of yu gi oh with regular updates interesting game modes or a modern card pool 10 the nature of the game s marketing and yu gi oh s previously established community means that it has fostered a rather nasty hyper competitive playerbase new players and casual players will struggle to enjoy interacting with long time players of the tcg and ocg playing a casual or sub optimal deck being a fan of the anime foremost and voicing frustrations with the game s lack of balancing or ban list utilization are sure to result in condescending childish or hostile reactions from the playerbase
