2021 early access review i ve followed this game for roughly 9 years followed development since 2011 2012 kept an eye on it bought and refunded in 2015 bought it again in 2019 and come back and play every now and then with that time frame i can say that this game is definitely in development hell feature creep and bloat seems to be the biggest problems with the development of this game and most likely the reason why development is so slow i am not calling the indie stone lazy just extremely slow they are vocal and passionate about the game still updating even all these years later and i still keep up to date with the blog posts i want to see this game become what it was meant to be i love the world the atmosphere i want to know more about the story that has been hinted at and play the survivor stories like bob and kate s story when it gets continued but in its current state i cannot recommend this game maybe when build 41 mp gets added back in so you can play with mates but currently i just can t recommend it tl drgame has been in development hell for nearly 10 years with features mentioned years ago still not implemented
