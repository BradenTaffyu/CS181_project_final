2018 if i had written a review on stellaris when it first came out and after a number of dlcs it would have been positive it was very unique in how it approached some things since that time i feel like my money was wasted not because that initial impression of the game that initial impression was accurate i even recommended it to a lot of people i know the problem is this developer takes a very bad path on how they update already released games they don t just fix bugs they often will completely change and remove game play elements among these changes have often been removing things that made this game interesting now you ll find a vocal multiplayer crowd that talks about it being done due to certain exploits being able to be accomplished so rather than finding a way to fix the exploit and leave the unique features that were there for a long time after release they juist pulled those features initially it had three different modes of faster than light ftl travel that player civilizations could use they were unique and each one you did a little different apparently some of these had distinct advantages that multiplayer players were able to exploit some people also complained about ai in single player which for me i never had issues with i am not part of this group of people that complain about such things i do complain about paying for a product liking it buying dlc and it remaining good and then suddenly dlc and updates dramatically change and remove some of the most appealing aspects of the game recent updates have even removed planetary tiles i stopped playing it before that though this was what a friend told me today as he said he feels like he needs to go back 5 versions to make the game fun again it is very bad design to completely change a game that can be single player or multiplayer in this respect so long after release especially if it really isn t a bug to many people especially if those things are some of the things that made the game unique from other 4x games if you want to make such huge changes then typically that is better left for a stellaris 2 or something of that nature this was one of my favorite current 4x space games since the stripping of the three ftl propulsions and making it like so many other 4x games i already own i stopped playing it i did try playing quite a few games of the new mode with only one ftl that is the same as most 4x it just didn t grab me it wasn t as interesting i also didn t mind someone being able to pop in somewhere i wasn t expecting in the old method that added some excitement and challenge many of you will likely still like this game especially if you never played it before it is a lot closer in design now to other 4x games than it was had i just started playing it now i probably would have said not bad and shoved it in the pile of many other 4x games that play very similar to this the bad thing for people like me that played it before that is to me it was in the excellent category and stood out from that pile of 4x games i own i kept feeling compelled to play it from time to time now i have no such inclinations for me if i hadn t played the hell out of it earlier on this is one of those few cases i am so disappointed in the direction they have taken that i would ask for a refund delete uninstall etc for those of you that never played it before the changes it is high quality in design you likely will not have the problems i am describing as you won t know what is missing you won t be comparing the game play now to what the game play was before if i were such a person myself i may recommend this game so keep that in mind you may like it you will not have seen the uniqueness clipped off after purchase
