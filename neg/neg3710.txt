2019 early access review this game is a toxic relationship we must all collectively eschew to allow something else to execute this concept better yes minecraft with zombies is fun however most of the community agrees that the development of this game continues to go backward just today an update released that broke wood gathering further ruined the optimization and made it possible for your entire base to magically disappear if you attempt to use the forge a core mechanic for crafting even low tier equipment and structures here s the gameplay loop loot some gear build a base get better gear and then by about the fourth or fifth blood moon zombie attack the gameplay is stale and you have maxed out your base and equipment so you put down the game for a while then come back on a whim a month or two later and some update has fixed changed wrecked everything and you have to start again with a bunch of poor development decisions to adapt to mostly in the name of making the graphics better and making the game more stable such as when they removed loot spawns from zombies the corpses used to stay for a day or two for you to loot and harvest resources from now they re gone in a few minutes with less than a percent dropping loot bags to try to make the game lag less yet still you need at least a gtx1080 32gb of ram and a hyperthreaded 4 5ghz quad core to get 60fps on high not ultra settings when hosting a server with one friend for a game that frankly still looks like the lighting always seems a bit off and when the blood moon comes around and i have to lower my settings to get 24fps i also need to drink two bottles of dack janiels to not vomit from the sheer potato that is this game s graphics on anything less than high settings the devs are still trying to figure out what the core gameplay should be instead of trying to add content quests and stability to bring the game out of alpha after six years i ve only played since a15 a18 is current today and i ve seen three complete philosophy changes to the skill system loot system and gear tier system and none of them have been an improvement yet when i get to the late game around day 50 i am still using the ak47 i found on day 10 and the armor i found on day 15
