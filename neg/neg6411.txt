2022 tl dr if you care about story challenge and progression about feeling the passion a developer put into a product then this is not for you if you don t have a car game community around you to play this game with don t buy this however if you care about messing around with cars tuning them to bits drifting for high scores hotlapping etc then absolutely go for this thing just be aware that this game is not created through passion and drive this is a market research product made with crunch through and through there is no soul here just one size fits none and toxic positivity it permeates this game good in my opinion tuning car selection physics trial racing rivals volcano roadsbad in my opinion lack of progression and meaning character cast is sterile and positive unto death limited scope of fun things to do on your own festival playlist fomo zone instancing world feels empty online map emptiness feels like a tourist brochure not a place where people live details the positives of this game is the sheer amount of cars available the physics the driving and the tuning i love how much you can mess with a car and that most every single tuning slider has a noticeable effect on how you must drive i like hotlapping and getting better at driving perfecting sectors and all that jazz i also would like exploring if there was anything to explore the bads are far more weighty than the goods there is no sense of progression at all and this is the main gripe i see people talk about this is a sandbox where there is no fun to be had from the top developer made excitement the only excitement is the stress you feel when you know you ve not played this week and that there are limited access cars available that you re gonna miss this game s entire replay hook is fomo and it feels so unbelievable disingenuous that i refuse to partake in it but if not doing the festival playlist what else is there to do nothing this game is completely void of fun for anyone without a dedicated community of people who want to play this game with them i don t have that i m not a particularly social person online my friends don t play car games this means that all the fun i can have in this game is the fun i make myself since the developer s entire vision is market research based and the game is targetted at the youngest of car game players you know there would have been something to be had social wise in this game but a new feature completely annihilates that aspect zone instancing i thought this was a great idea before release the game would be more alive because there would be more people per zone since the game would make sure that every zone would be populated with players unlike h4 s 64 players per server instance being spread all over the map but this feature is absolutely awful for this kind of game people you interact with with no text chat have a 90 chance of just vanishing into thin air the moment you cross a river because you re sent to separate zone instances the map literally feels more alive when you re driving around in offline mode the map itself has some good parts it feels interesting for the first few days of playing the big mountain and the roads leading there guanajuato the hotel area playa azul and the canyon all pretty places for sure but i found myself missing something quite soon the map is a tourist brochure it is so perfectly procured to give you a sense of mexico at its peak that it feels sterile there is nothing happening anywhere on the map at any time ever the entirety of guanajuato feels like it exists in a separate dimension where robots take care of the roads and houses it feels so squeaky digitally clean that you can t imagine anyone living anywhere in the city combine that with the absolutely awful and non stop cheeriness of the cast and you ve got a world that you can t connect with in any way shape or form it doesn t feel like it was made by humans for humans it was made by market researchers for stockholders it was made to ship units the map is big just to be a selling point so are most of the main changes made to progression from h4 a large point made during the run up to release was the way you unlock events and festival sites you do some stuff rank up and eventually you get a point you can spend to unlock a new part of the game sound fun like something to do but this is over in the first few days you play and it doesn t feel like progression it doesn t feel good or even bad it just is you ll unlock almost every single race event immediately another selling point actually and then it s just accolade grinding or story mission grinding or as it will be eventually for everyone festival playlist grinding there s more i could say here but others have said those things better i m gonna end this text wall here i will still play this game once in a while just to scratch that itch created by nfs underground 2 and that era of car gaming but i can t recommend this game to anyone who likes stories or meaning in games if you like cars go for it this is the absolutely best car game of this style ever made however i m getting more depressed every time i boot up the game to find something cool and fun to do with all these cars my eyes are now scanning the horizon looking for the next big thing in open world racing maybe solar crown will do something for me though it looks far too arcadey we will see
