2023 first the good beautiful maps you can spend hours just walking and exploring the maps always relaxing for me varied prey to hunt lots of different species rabbit birds boar deer bear bison lions and many more weapons you can choose to hunt with rifles shotguns bows or pistols although they don t always feel amazing the stories for some of the reserves are actually engaging and enjoyable mostly really good voice acting as well the hunt for greater trophies there are rare animals that keep you wondering what you re gonna find today is it going to be an albino lion a melanistic springbok who knows you keep hoping its gonna be a diamond though the bad the devs the most important reason i can not recommend this game to anyone the focus is always on milking as much money from the playerbase as they can releasing new dlc after new dlc while completely ignoring bugs that have been around for years if they can t make extra money from it why fix it if you buy this just know what you re getting into and what policies you re supporting
