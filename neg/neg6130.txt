2023 developers when we get into a versus match the level of players are really unbalanced please fix and read the following complaint i left the lobby not the match i m level 40 and i m not gonna play against a level 100 because it s so obvious i m gonna lose there is something needs fixing the thing is players get a cooldown penalty after quitting a lobby and receives a message like this automatch cooldowns are incurred by abandoning matches early abandoning a match creates a negative experience for other players and degrades the competitive integrity of the queue so basically you re saying that i can t abandon the match bc it degrades the competitivity and yet you guys have no balance system for the player levels what kind of competitivity are we talking about this automatch cooldown is completely nonsense even you guys don t know what it s about coz it says abandoning match and i never abandoned a match like in mid game i only quit the lobby before the game starts which btw i have to close the game to do so this needs to be fixed maybe by letting the players check a box saying they can either play against players next to their levels or simply not checking that box easy peasy p s i can play against players that are 10 more levels than me but more than that it s simply off balanced
