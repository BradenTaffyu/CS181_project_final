2022 i would have recommended this game very enthusiastically however they changed the eula years after i purchased the game and now the new eula they want you to accept requires you to sign away rights to the game license for instance the old eula did not include the clause where they can arbitrarily revoke your game s license it literally says in the new eula to play a game you already own you have to agree to allow them the right to revoke your license at any time they want you to go from owning the game to leasing where at anytime after you paid your lease could be canceled and not refunded i consider this a breach of contract to prevent me from playing the game unless i agree to a coerced eula 0 10 i refuse to renegotiate a contract you already accepted my money for the contract is closed unless you want to pay me what i think my rights to the game is worth any attempts like this is coercive is very illegal in the usa
