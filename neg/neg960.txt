2018 i have played fallout 1 2 and nv religiouslly over the years i ve also played 3 and found it meh but fun the thing about the first three i mentioned is that even if you don t bother with the main quest you re drawn into a world with freedom an epic story there was always the urge to replay re create and retry differently this is what brings me to fallout 4 after 80 hours of playing i ve forgotten i had a child don t even care that i do in fact and all i ve done so far is kill raiders and kill super mutants nothing else at least it seems that way at least with far harbour dlc i felt like there was a little bit of a story with decent choices but main game what am i even doing with my life
