2017 i kinda felt a bit guilty about leaving my negative review so long without an update i mean there s been quite a few new maps released and a lot of new features introduced into the game in case you don t know features is code for more bugs often used by long suffering players of the game the previous two maps contained unfinished terrain great swathes of land floating in the sky and the last map had only 15 main missions with no side missions the main missions were bugged for a lot of people so let s concentrate on todays release the new zealand map bought the dlc played it for a bit and then bought the weapon pack 3 download tried to launch it and it crashed just froze my whole pc task manager wouldn t work had to restart ok looked at the support help verified the integrity of the files all ok no change uninstalled and re downloaded the entire game 27 4gb no change changed the launch options to windowed no change disabled my second monitor bingo the game started no problem this last map now requires me to disable my second monitor to play the game it s 2020 nearly 2021 and this software is still as bad as it was when i did the closed testing many years ago avoid run and don t look back edited to add for no apparent reason i can now play it with my second monitor enabled this happened less than 5 minutes after i wrote the review shonky software indeed from stefan community manager let me know what you think about it and how you like it still scuffed sorry further edit with all outposts hides and points of interest opened and all 16 missions completed when ever i try to fast travel the game crashes with cotw f stopped working it only happens on new zealand so for me this map is scuffed too i decided to update my review after the mexico map dropped just to ensure that i m being fair in my criticism that this company is incapable of introducing a new map without introducing major bugs i played the mexico map and did the 12 main story missions and unlocked all the points with no bugs ok the items on the desk mission took a while to recognise it s completion but that was being nit picky i thought yay i m going to have to rewrite my review they finally did it they brought out a map with no bugs then i tried to go duck shooting on yukon and found i can t fast travel to any lodges they have managed to mess up fast travelling now got major audio issues some people have lost all of their progression and you now drop through the bottom of hunting structures and can t get out that was a close call i nearly had to change my review but they came through with their usual shonky software indeed
