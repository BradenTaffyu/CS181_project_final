2019 played planes only after years of developing this game they focused on adding and adding only new vehicles sometimes some new map tons of useless vehicles that nobody asked for totally unbalanced top tiers and whole helicopter battles which are unplayable they have no idea how to make battles more interesting you can play as a fighter plane or as a target for fighter planes realistic battles are not adapted for playing 90 of bombers and ground attackers nation germany which have planes that can climb fast win more often than allied planes which cannot properly use their advantages because on every map mission target is the same climb fast and kill every enemy plane 80 of battles are won by this it is perfectly unbalanced because they are trying to balance planes that were historically different from each other so there is no way game will be balanced when every map target is the same developers of war thunder seems to losing control of this game and they don t really know anymore what they want to do with this game it is just getting more and more annoying shame there is almost no competition for them and people who want to play semi simulator plane game have to bother with war thunder
