2019 after 2 2 i cant honestly recommend this game bottom is tl dr sectors grouped systems for simple all at once management were removed and while the sector ai was lacking there were mods that made it perfectly viable even on the hardest difficulties the game is so micro heavy now that after you have more than a handful of planets you spend more time flipping through planet interfaces with the game paused then anything else the alternative is to have vassals tributaries but the juggling of their happiness so they don t all rebel at once and decimate you usually ends up costing nearly as much as it provides the war exhaustion was seriously ramped up too meaning even if you have the force required to utterly destroy your enemy your empire will get tired of war and you other empires will be forced to surrender and not to the terms of the war cassus belli meaning you can attack to force the enemy to pay tribute they get tired and surrender a useless undeveloped planet that ends up being nothing but debt the new economic changes are very cool but the problem is that they dont need to be there in the first place i was happy with build building to make resource research weapons build ships put on slow mode and watch giant battles that was fine with me its not that the way the micro is handled that is the problem its a cool system the problem is that 4x stands for explore expand exploit exterminate not farmville but there are ships sometimes and that s how this feels also you better have a s hot cpu or you re never going to be able to play late game its extremely processor heavy tl dr forget epic space battles and mighty empires after 2 2 it is about micromanagement and fighting wars with boring ships now that rare resources are required to build advanced ships rather than creating an empire wide bonus on a timer with a prize cost that may be completely random
