2016 i made a single playthrough because i ve been playing the souls games since the original demon souls i love this series dark souls 3 could be the very best yet but it isn t due to a single but overwhelmingly obvious oversight this game is not currently worth the time it takes to play i praised the previous games in the series for giving the player the choice on how to play how to build their soul slaying hero dark souls 3 forces the player into specializing their offensive capabilites but gives them no choice on defense blocking and wearing heavy armor no longer serve a purpose the only viable options for defense are to roll out of the way or parry some people will read this rant and say git gud but believe me i am good i m pretty awesome at this game but i felt like my choices were stripped from me as i was forced to adapt to the iframes given during rolls and the activation frames of various parrys in previous games you could choose to simply invest in equipment load and build yourself a heavy armored tank this is no longer an option as the weakest enemies in the game will stagger you in 1 shot and a dagger wielding invader can stunlock you to death poisepoise is what is missing in dark souls 3poise is a vital part of the series to date poise is the only reason i am not recommending this game if poise isn t important to you or if you were planning on making a light armor ninja esque styled character or a mage in robes then you probably won t notice or care but for those who want a bad a in havels armor strutting around brushing off attacks without a care in the world go play dark souls 1 or 2 they re great games still and they have poise
