until they fix brawl mode which is the only thing worth playing i will keep this on not recommended the draw shuffle system is absolutely broken and the hidden seeds for decks so you never see certain cards which are usually what your combos are is a bs system that needs to be removed get ready to have every opponent waste your time while the game allows people to afk for 5m with no penalties even if you don t have to deal with that your opponent running a 3 color deck will get perfect mana ramp every single game while the system makes you go 12 games in a row getting mana screwed in a dual color deck doesnt matter if you run 40 60 or 10 land cards i main golgari with mana ramp usually 8 creatures with mana tap land search artifacts etc i still get screwed rarely ever see opponents mulligan to boot i usually have to mulligan twice every game just to get something that isn t a single land wotc are ruining this game with hidden behind the scenes bs
