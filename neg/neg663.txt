2023 ive seen alot of people down here complain about rng i haven t seen anyone elucidate on this they just complain about the rng i wanted to explore why mechanically people feel that way first thing s first this game is popular because of it s nasty rng combined with a pretension to universal skill this activates people s gambling addiction receptors while still maintaining moral acceptability high ground ever since i wrote my deep rock review one of the few actual reviews ive made ive slowly began realizing that most of the top hits on steam nowadays im not being reactionary this is just a much more relevant phenom as time progresses if you want older examples of this look at any old golden era blizzard game wow diablo etc operate this way i suspect that a combination of those traits with the fact that procedural generation is inherently easier to produce allows this to flourish now with that out of the way the biggest problem with this game is that the harder you want to go the more rng works against you this is inherent the less of a tightrope you walk the more a breeze will tip you over but it s also mechanical in order to minimize rng per turn you need a small bloatless deck you also need cards to loop continuously this puts you in an oxymoronic state where you need the game to magically provide you with cards that will give you the most value immediately it doesn t actually matter now that the card you need is a 1 in 3 chance or whatever because not only did you pass a 1 in three chance ten times to get the rest of your deck and also to get rid of your useless cards but all 1 in 3 chances were needed to pass the game alot of people talk about win streaks like it means anything again to justify it s acceptibility i just need to git gud but we know that git gud doesn t mean anything to a person who wants to have fun and can t find any watch top players play overwatch and quickly realize that winning isn t inherently fun the social conditions make you thinking winning is fun which is why people voice their opinions of course so let me make this plain i don t care that you can count cards at blackjack no one does i dont care about how you have 2 hours in the game and need to defend it because it s a part of how you maintain your social identity i dont care if you played this game 1 at evo and beat it sub 2 seconds your words cant change the fact that im voicing my opinion that this is unfun and you re scared that im analyzing why you re scared because it breaks your identity in half the same thing you use to try and find friends and create a social circle whether through para social or real friendships if this weren t true you wouldn t be upset that im attacking something you like no one who this applies to will read this anyway the reason this works mostly in something like competitive pokemon is because the game is formatted in a manner to mitigate these losses you play multiple games in the tournament format because resetting the conditions to zero multiple times quickly this is why stall is broken apart by crits demands that rng can t accumulate into a snowball this is the exact opposite in slay the spire not only can accumulate it s extended so it damn near is guaranteed to
