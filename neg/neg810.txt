2016 fallout 4 is just bland the dialogue is shallow the npcs are generic the locations are uninteresting etc i personally found very little reason to actually want to go out and explore new places what would i find some tin cans maybe a crappy legendary weapon i dislike the legendary weapons heavily and would have much preferred them keeping unique weapons the unique weapons gave you a reason to explore in hopes of finding a new one the legendary weapons you can get anywhere this game appeals to the casual audience by itself thats not a bad thing however fallout 4 takes it to a whole new level
