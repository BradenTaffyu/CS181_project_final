2023 i have two reviews for this game if you are a normal gamer you should absolutely get this game if your into a chill game with lots of different mechanics and a wacky story if you are a disabled gamer you should stay far away from dave the diver it not only has no accessibility options it doesn t even have basic gamepad options this wouldn t be the biggest problem if the game stayed mechanically light but it doesn t you will frequently encounter sharks and bosses that require higher mechanical precision and there will be no options to adjust any of it i don t like writing this review because i hate being a whiney cripple and i have enjoyed many aspects of the game but i rarely encounter games this unwelcoming to disabled people maybe they ll improve it in the future there have been regular updates but as of now do not buy
