2021 early access review a good idea with bad developers 8 years for a game to stay in alpha must mean that the game has progressed very far in terms of development right i thought so too but it seems that every update after alpha 12 has been a lazy attempt at making people think the game is progressing in its development even though the optimisation of the game in terms of networking and utilisation of hardware has been completely ignored the focus of the game has been shifted from making it playable to adding pointless things that harm the game s performance and stops it from progressing to beta and release alpha 19 can be summed up by a graphical update for a game that already suffered to run on the highest end consumer hardware released 4 years after the game was released as an alpha the console version of the game is a joke as it is more expensive than on pc is stuck on alpha 14 and has dlcs the only reason i can imagine the fun pimps allow it to still be available for purchase on consoles is out of pure greed as it negatively affects their image to console players a company that has sold over 12 million copies of a game for at least 8 dollars per copy should have the funds available to hire people who can work on the game to hasten its development process 8 years of being stuck in alpha has no excuses especially when the game has generated tens of millions of dollars before even being fully released i hope the toxic positivity of a very small minority of players doesn t let the developers think the game is fine as it is in its current state the game is playable but not great the concept of the game is as close to perfect that is achievable when compared to other dayz like games though the implementation of the concepts leaves much to be desired i don t want to see this game die and become abandoned i enjoy playing the game a lot but only because i play with a friend playing this game alone makes you notice certain aspects of the game that make no sense such as the zombie animations and hit boxes associated with them the amount of network usage that it requires to play online and the extremely poor utilisation of hardware the developers want to add as much stuff to the game as possible without fixing already existing bugs and issues first i disagree with how the game is being updated and maintained but hopefully it becomes a decent game in the future for people who want to buy the game and play it with friends this game will be very fun and enjoyable especially with mods for people who want to play alone don t bother the game is unfinished and even with a bunch of mods it gets extremely boring quite quickly
