2016 the pattern of streamlining for casuals continues sieges are very arcadey deployed right into tower range for example unit formations are gone group formations are limited to a couple of options i don t know if modders will be able to crack these issues if they can then that s my only hope in the meantime i ll probably go back to the excellent eb ii mod for mtw2 earlier tw games had much more detail and more options overall with the exception of ship combat for shogun i mtw i rome i mtw 2 the series has continued to be simplified more and more which is pretty devastating to people who played the thinking part of the series the tw series in general has had issues with ai whether cai bai or dai but little has been done to improve it over the years the focus seems to be more on a cinematic immediate gratification fest rather than a thinking methodical strategy game i was really hoping i should have known better that ca would return to their roots in terms of the combat at least but i was sorely disappointed no open city fighting either as far as i can tell or naval combat for that matter i feel like this is just the way things are gonna be as the series is concentrated on simple accessibility with a lot of flash but less and less substance i won t say the game isn t fun at all but knowing how much better it could have been if it was actually designed as thinking man s strategy game since rome 2 the series has felt like the strategy version of cod in a way when i see what modders have been able to do with the eb ii mod for mtw2 compared to the simplified systems implemented by ca since rome 2 it s obvious at this point that what sells is simplicity if i sound enraged it s because this was one of my favorite franchises as well as my youngest brother s btw but since rome 2 the direction of ca is now overwhelmingly clear cater to the casual because it makes can t blame them from a business standpoint but considering the strategy games i grew up with i have to wonder if it s a generational indicator of where we are now which makes me want to watch idiocracy to reiterate i m not saying the game isn t fun i m just saying it s very very arcadey and even more so with gutting of tactical options sure they added magic but meh that s not really a big deal vs unit tactics formations i still play mtw i rome total war i and mtw2 on a regular basis the amount of detail that went into those games at the time they released was indicative of significant tlc and catered to a different kind of crowd that liked options detail traits etc there is no such corresponding effort from ca since rome 2 and this latest entry is no different in that respect accessibility over substance simplicity over detail limitations over options for a warhammer as opposed to old guard tw fan it is worth it especially if you never played the other tw games when they came out if you re like my brother and i anyway and want it all tactical options improved ai capable of executing sieges with my own planning etc shogun 2 i would say was the last total effort by ca you can have fun with this game but i could not in good conscience recommend it to the old guard
