2018 if you played any other wargaming multiplayer game you should know already what to expect as much as i enjoyed world of warships for a long time i cannot in good conscience recommend it i played way more than the 200 ish hours before and after the game went on steam gameplay is fun as soon as you take a couple of hours to understand the mechanics graphics are fine so are the sounds and music here comes the but devs are using every single trick in the book to coerce you into paying the game is addictive in real drug dealer style at first up to about tier 5 you get the good stuff it s easy to earn credits you unlock new modules and ships every few battles you feel like you are progressing and making a difference and when you re hooked you hit the wall game becomes a grindfest you need to play lower tier battles just to make credits unless you buy a premium account or a premium ship or premium camouflages you have oh so many options you can also buy lootboxes err i mean containers or skip the middle men and just buy credits outright with real money there is a ton of events where you can win premium stuff for free so that s nice but expect to get hit with enormous amounts of grind thats where loss aversion marketing kicks in after all you can just pay and get that prem thingie right now they really outdid temselves in british destroyers event you could earn guineas to get a premium tier 8 british destroyer you just needed to get 50 guineas which you could earn at a rate of 4 per week or buy at i think about 0 75 euro apiece but here s the catch you could only earn 48 guineas by playing if you wanted the ship you had to pay something and i bet a lot of players didn t read the event announcement extremely long because the event was complicated like hell carefully enough to notice that you couldn t earn all the 50 guineas in game this game is the meth of gaming steer clear unless you are strong willed or willing to spend a lot of money
