i really wanted to like cities 2 i really did i bought the ultimate edition for the game as i had felt co had a trustworthy reputation from cities 1 cities 1 is one of my favorite games after all and i ve spent hundreds of hours playing it so needless to say after a botched release and continually over promising and under delivering for months i am voicing my extreme disappointment and regret i don t really review games but this games is so uniquely terrible in execution and with the last updates dlc and announcements i felt the obligation to write this addressing the beach properties dlc refund as someone who purchased the ultimate edition it s infuriating that something i paid for was so bad it could almost be considered a scam that co now has to make it free but apparently that can t be refunded on because i bought it in a bundle with the game of release the inclusion of new creator radio packs isn t what i want at this point to make up for it i am long past the point of being told about any new promises of content for this game until i see it s worth playing in its current state why should i value more content as fair compensation when you ve yet to provide any existing content worth my 90 i don t care if it s 40 of value i may have not wanted to buy them to begin with if they were what was included initially with the ue substituting a product i already bought and paid for with another product that i can t even decide for myself if there s value in i d rather have a refund at this point the ue edition of the game is such as disaster that i don t understand how it can be gotten away with i purchased it with the understanding that these dlc would be added to the game at the time advertised now apparently bridges and ports will be in 2025 i shouldn t just have to wait for co and paradox to get their crap together i bought a product that wasn t delivered on simple as that i wouldn t have bought it if would take until 2025
