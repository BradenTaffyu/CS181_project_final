2020 everyone probably already knows this this game is almost the dictionary example of ea games you pay for the game the game feels empty you buy an expansion to help it doesn t do enough so you buy another so on and so forth except the total cost of all dlc is roughly 1400us now it would be one thing if that was in game currency i ve seen people spend that much before on games hell i think i may have spent around that much collectively on warframe back when i used to play it on ps4 mostly for cosmetics admittedly but these packs are for things that feel like they should be in the base game to begin with imagine paying 1500us for what should basically be the base game the only reason i own this game with a dlc pack or two is because my younger sister gave me the money to get it and she s been the main person to play it i do like simulation and sandbox games but i hate supporting developers with downright scummy business practices like do they seriously wonder why so many people pirate sims games it also doesn t help that they killed so many smaller studios game franchises are too ignorant to remake bad company 2 or a successor etc etc ea play may be a step in the right direction but i ve not experienced it for myself so i won t bother giving them that
