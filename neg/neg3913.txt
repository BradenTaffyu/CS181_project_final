2021 this game is very fun even though i m not good at harder difficulties multiple cells the only reason i downvote the game is because of damage cap if you have the capacity you should deal full damage 5 of all the bosses health is disguistingly low i have to hit them 20 times not matter the damage if i deal damage more than 5 of bosses health i should deal 10 if i deal 10 percent if someone found weapons synergies to deal 100 let them deal 100 that is the whole point of synergies curses buffs and weapons
