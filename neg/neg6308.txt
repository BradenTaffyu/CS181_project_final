2023 i really want to love this game but unfortunately the level of delight at the beginning is equal to the level of disappointment at the end lots of cool stuff but everything feels unfinished animals plants potions useless there are few plants i bought all of them at the start of the game grew them once and did not come to them again save animals cool but really you just put them in your bag and then there is a bug when they just get stuck in a cage cubs do not grow and are no different from adults there are many colors like in pokemon but they didn t do anything about it they simply exist i was expecting at least something from the potions maybe i ll add the ingredients myself or make your own potions like in skyrim no it s about 6 potions and only green potion is useful puzzles exist only for you to spend time on them without them the game would have been quite short tbh at start i liked them but then i quickly realized that they are all the same but on the map there are an insane amount of them and at the end i got a bug that didn t let me complete the collections 139 140 chests now they seem to have fixed it but the taste of disappointment stayed with me locks exist only for you to return to old locations you will get the ability to open them in the middle of the game the story is a complete failure illusions of choice empty characters i don t even want to talk about the end of the game this is a disappointment i don t know who decided it would be okay when i saw hogwarts for the first time i thought that i would explore the world like in witcher don t expect it there is no mystery here i would still give a like for this game i spent so much time there and the emotions that you get at the start are incredible but the end made me so sad
