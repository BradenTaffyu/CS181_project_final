2023 the campaign is okay it is a bit complex and might take quite some time to understand how things work even for veteran players nice graphics ui mechanics and all that the battles terrible in any total war game ever too predictable the last total war game that made sense to me was shogun and in that game you can turn the tides in the battlefield if you know what you are doing in this game however no matter how good you are the ai prediction is always right and i think it takes away the thrill of the game the battle mechanics are also bad there is just something about it that makes it feel so annoying when compared to other games in the franchise the armies are endless which will make you desensitized at some point and you just want to get things over with by using the ai to resolve the endless battles so in general if you want an endless chess like maneuvering of the campaign map then this is the game for you however if you love to play the battles from time to time then you will be dissappointed
