i originally liked this game love the time period and have been waiting for this for awhile i will say that this bronze age niche especially the sea peoples time period was a total war game i dreamed of years ago since the original rome i came out i ve been a fan since then and although the game is beautiful and the unit skins characters and factions are great the dynamics of the game make it unplayable i m glad that uni gave some refund but i would rather they kept my money and fixed the damn game this game is the exact same as troy or warhammer which is a super difficult gauntlet type of onslaught where there is no real strategy but to be able to defeat several armies with no resources available whatsoever even for games like the souls genre the phrase git good can t even apply cause most of us got good with the total war series years ago this way of gameplay is nearly impossible and just stresses people out why have 20 different resources and have each unit take up 80 of it for replenishment or upkeep and of course the enemies don t have to follow those rules why have 20 invasions of your land by factions that still have non aggression pacts with you how come i can only afford 1 1 2 armies and be close to debt while i m invaded by a force stack of 20 by a faction with one ramshackle town that only has a ing well tell me how the hell that s supposed to make sense what s with the legitimacy in civil war if you capture the capital or pharaoh shouldn t you win why do other culture factions band together like zealots while your own culture hates you and no one would even sign a non aggression pact without taking a million gold why is everyone always so damn unhappy in your cities get rid of the gauntlet type fight a million battles with one army while in debt type of crap bring back real strategy and historical accuracy
