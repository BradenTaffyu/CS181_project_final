2017 early access review 4 years in early access i doubt this game will ever get released get in on sale as while it is fun it is still an incomplete and buggy product also they are selling it on conoles as a finished game that is all sorts of shady i had to talk a friend out of buying it for his ps4 because he did not realize it was an unfinished game still in alpha here we are almost a decade later still in alpha still in early access plus a forum thread i made about this got deleted for daring to question why early access was used for a project that has taken 9 years to develop its alpha so questions and criticism seem to be discouraged while people defending this game are allowed to flame troll and insult so much for equal application of forum rules this is still a very hard pass as it s shady as all hell their ethics are terrible and they have no substance imo
