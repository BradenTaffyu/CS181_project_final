2017 product received for free slime rancher currently suffers from serious pacing issues the game starts entirely focused on exploration but that quickly changes the world s areas while fun to experience for the first time feel like they only exist to grab slimes and food to bring home and keep there forever there s nothing that keeps players coming back to what s supposed to be the meat of the game focusing instead entirely on the most tedious and boring part running from plot to plot hauling plorts and food around so what s left to do after gathering 2 new slimes and types of food from one area thorough exploration is punished since the player will run across locked treasures they won t be able to open and unlocking treasure crackers requires an initial investment of 10 000 newbux huge compared to any previous purchase plus a constant stream of plorts to craft gadgets not only that the requirement of simply crafting gadgets to unlock treasure crackers means the player is wasting plorts when crafting advanced extractors over novice ones so if a player is interested in crafting gadgets they have to choose between crafting novice extractors in order to unlock more interesting gadgets or crafting advanced extractors in order to start crafting useful items such as teleporters this makes slime science much more of a pain than it needs to be and the initial price of 10 000 means that by the time it s unlocked it has already lost much of its usefulness all of these problems exist with the other attempt at making slime rancher last longer than it should the 7zee rewards club the first item with a tangible effect obtained from the rewards is the slime toys shop at 18 250 newbux an item that would make farming money a little more bearable the market link is only available after spending 34 000 newbux with prices getting only more absurd for later rewards what s the problem with useful items requiring such high barriers of entry simply you cannot make substantial amounts of money while off your ranch so before having a chance to play with your shiny new toys players will have to spend hours upon hours running back and forth around the ranch planting food feeding slimes and selling plorts there is nothing engaging about this slow monotonous routine day after day sitting on a pile of money that gets bigger and bigger while slimes sit around in their corrals doing nothing interesting as if that wasn t enough of a problem certain slimes quantum dervish require so much attention that going back out into the far far range becomes a dangerous race against time not knowing if by the time you come back your slimes will have eaten all your food and turned into tarr the degree of attention needed in order to have a stable income is such that it limits the player s freedom and that s probably my biggest concern while looking promising in early access slime rancher s release ultimately failed to deliver and while i enjoyed my time with the adorable slimes it has too many flaws to recommend at this time after two major game updates the wilds and nimble valley side missions are enjoyable but they don t fix anything about the base gameplay you ll still be sucking or depositing food and plorts in various containers for too long you ll still be punished for exploring before unlocking every treasure cracker and there is still nothing to do out in the far far range except for gathering a couple of slimes in each area and reading tiny bits of plot after even more updates drones help immensely with ranching slimes but the early game is still flawed as i ve described above locking different levels of treasures behind different levels of keys that you have to grind slime science in order to get goes against the very core idea of exploration you re forced to wait until you ve done almost everything before you can start exploring viktor s slimeulation is very enjoyable and is what the rest of the game should have had a reason to keep going out into the wilds and catch more slimes a reason to watch slimes interact with the environment and each other instead of just being milked for plorts
