2021 great game love it played it for years comes out on steam i am hype install it than i am logged in with no log in or link to steam options to use my wargaming account yet they do not allow you to log into your real world of tanks account hence every single negative review is this one simple thing let us log in to our accounts pc pc aint crossplay you greedy wargaming f s lmao they just want everyone to spend even more by denying any access and force everyone to start off fresh you can use your steam account to log in through the launcher but you can t do it the other way around or link it to steam so if you have never played world of tanks play through steam or else don t waste your time unless you re as bored as i am
