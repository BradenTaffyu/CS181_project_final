2021 oxygen not included have very interesting game play mechanic but failed to polish document the game to make some sense of out it and be able to play blindly without having to refer to stupid online guide when i broke the surface i could not really handle anymore all the hack and quack that i had to search online to figure out stuff that should work for instance how to cool down the radar lets try to put it a metal plate highly thermal conductor with a radian pipe highly terminal conductor running cool water in it well no the correct way would be a place a stupid droplet of water in a corner or release gas to the void to cool it off another frustrating situation was a in same conveyer belt with heat sensor that could not detect the temperature of the item on the belt the goal was to re used the hot temperator of the regolith to heat up the water to get steam for the rocket speaking of the rocket no documentation about how range is calculate or component stack up how distance can be acheived i had the rocket but had a effective range of 0 the game failed to provide in game information of critical item before we build then there is nothing wrong with a complex game but there have to be ways to counter stuff there is probably the selfish frustration of myself not being able to complete the game and rage quit uninstall the game fairwell oni
