2016 ever since the update the game has gone to crap airplanes become paper airplanes with having one to three shots to kill you in the stupidest of moments the game has an unfair disadvantage level 1 tier plane can take down a tier 3 plane within 5 to 10 shots amazing 2 3 shots to cut your wing with any type of caliber the u s airforce might be taking this game as a joke since the b 25 s wing can be cut loose by a tier 1 beginning plane for god sakes pictures of bombers coming back home with bullet holes everywhere and my bomber is taken down with 2 3 bullets a joke of a simulated game and a joke to people in the air force i will change my reviews once you guys look up facts not from wikipedia but from actual us ussr ijaa raf facts
