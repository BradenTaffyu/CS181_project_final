2017 i don t recommend this game especially not to people that have played fallout new vegas this isn t an rpg at all it s an exploration game focused on looting and crafting quests are usually fetch kill or collect stuff and it frankly does not have any worthwhile depth when it comes to player choices and consequences an ocean of content with the depth of a puddle is a good way to describe this game this game relies on the grind for gear xp and quests i m actually kinda embarressed to have played over 300 hours without realizing that this game pretends to be an rpg without actually delivering what was promised the hype really got me man but hey there s awesome rpg games out there fallout new vegas and really nice first person shooters like titanfall 2 that are a lot more deserving of your time than fallout 4
