2021 had very high expectations for this game but seems they went backwards aoe 3 is better than this game currently they just took out a lot of good things aoe 3 had in it no treaty mode no infantry units along side the artillery units loading cannon balls etc can t choose your color you shift click to make a path and it doesn t show you where your clicking or mark it idk this game is missing so many tiny things that aoe 3 had you d think they would add to aoe 3 but instead they just took cool little things away and made the game worse hopefully they make some changes not having treaty mode sucks alot
