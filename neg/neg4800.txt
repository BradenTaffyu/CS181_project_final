2018 33 hours into the game and i think its time for a review okay so i know i am only 33 hours in but i ve completed all the 19 orders or jobs as they really are i ve flipped a few houses like 6 and am already a millionaire i mean really where s the challenge so lets start with the review when i first seen this game i thought it would be really cool a way to kill some time while watching netflix or mixer com ibl live streams the occational twitch stream but gave up on twitch lag and you know what it does that you can casually play at your whim and if you are playing casually you ll like the game i doubt it was meant to be played more than an hour or two at a time i d suggest if you want to enjoy the game play the jobs in your email before you start renovating in order to raise your perk points up first then do one house a session otherwise you will be bored quite easily admitedly i even fell asleep during my game play legit my original review had pros and cons i m changing that up to simply use bullet points to describe all my concerns since literally the only pro was you get what you see in the video and a whole list of cons i don t think using the word cons is an accurate discriptor so with no further adieu here s the list originally posted by iblgames the good the bad the oh so filthy the video is pretty much what you see is what you get except for the demolision it does not look like that you knock down one wall column section at a time but literally what you see is all you get nothing more 20 discount for the game came after i had already purchased it lol what i don t need 2 copies insane the games graphics are meh at best far too few assets to really make a difference the homes in particular the smaller ones are nearly pointless i mean a bathroom a livingroom and thats it you can cut down a wall and add a seudo kitchen but then there s little to no room in the small homes and you can t place anything against the long two window wall i have only once been able to hang curtains and that was because the house i bought had them purchased but not installed curtains are a no go edit after starting the game again i bought a new house and surprise i can hang curtains now not sure if there was apdate last night but curtains now work window cleaning is laggy as hell i mean this needs be a lot more smoother blinds often will not go on double windows sometimes they do edit blinds are working now good on the dev s for fixing this as quick as they did you buy a house with a garage there is a car always the same red hatchback and you can t move it to the driveway lol why the hell not it s still on the property skill leveling is not bad bad it just happens pretty fast houses well there are just not enough of them and too little variety even a small team could have made more assets for this game and realized that some houses are no more than a shack these need to be larger you can not add on to a home to expand it can t add rooms to the main structure you can however knock down and put up walls but the house size never changes even with the perk build 3 wall sections at once you can only build one column at a time pointless waist of perk points why does the tub and shower have a million connections sinks and toilets only have a few steps to install them but you get 2 tubs and 1 shower to choose from and everything else does not require you put effort into installing it except radiators electrical outlets and light bulbs everything else including kitchen sinks and stoves are drop and go edit you can not add a bathroom where there are no hooks that makes adding a 2nd or 3rd bathroom to the larger homes impossible sadly kitchen cupboards do not line up all the time there should be some snap feature here this is the 21st century edit also there are no hookups for the kitchen sinks or stove can t add items to the metal storage racks top two shelves unless you stand on something and even then you risk getting stuck till you remove or move the item your standing on lighting why the hell when i am in a bunker with no windows underground with no lights installed or turned on and all doors closed am i not in complete darkness light bleeds everywhere outside houes where are the ladders how the heck does anyone get to the second floor to wash walls and or replace siding oh you don t you can clean the walls if you are on the second floor from the inside like magic you wash the upper inside wall and magically the outside is cleaned wow can not do any yard management ugly yards un mowed lawns remain ugly and un mowed i have no clue why women are represented so poorly why are there only two female buyers unless accompanined by a male partner there should be as many females as there are males it s the 21st century women buy homes too this is more of a suggestion than anything else radiators while i get the idea they are used in many homes but lets be real central air forced air gas furnace heaters even electric radiators and hot water tanks all these things are real um except in this game all you get is water heating and there is no hot water tanks hahahahaha doh modding there is none and this is pretty much the dumbest thing about this game so far it s only saving gace would be to add community modding let the fans make assets for the game for god sakes if the devs wont let us mod the game it s future is grim this is actually a real issue for me i ve said enough you get the points get it points bullet points lolz the conclusionokay you can kill some time and it s not bad bad it s just over before you can really get into it i ve barely started the game and almost all of my skills are maxed out i am a millionaire and i could not go back in to complete the 33rd hour 32 9 total played at the time of this revierw and some of that was because i fell asleep while the game was still running would i buy it again no would i reconmend it only if you are bored to death and want to kill some time casually if you like these type of simulators car mechanic 2018 was far better price point even though it is relatively inexpensive there just isn t any content in it to say there is value here 5 bucks maybe come to think of it this game kinda reminds me of a mobile app ported to a pc i wonder if that s how it started to the devs well sorry i wanted to write a raving review but as you can see there are issues you need address perhaps for future updates be warned charging for dlc content at this point will be suicide the game shipped in a full release state and there just is not enough of a game here to warrant paying for dlcs not yet anyway keep up the good work tho you are on to something the idea is great could be so much fun if you researched the global housing markets and realize we don t all live in shacks with water heating and magic siding cleaning sorry devs but this one is a resounding bust from this old gamer
