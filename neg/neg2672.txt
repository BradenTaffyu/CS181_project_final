2019 so more than a month ago the company published a dlc bundled with a patch 2 2 that broke the game in every possible way ai doesn t work end game crisises don t do anything etc instead of apologizing and or fixing the game they are currently busy purging threads from the official forum with dev replies that make them look like bethesda in disguise some devs on reddit seem to be personally offended in quite surprising ways do do you think no one knew there were bugs would you actually be happier if we d just never tested the game and were very surprised when people found bugs with this i can t recommend this product whatever positive review you may read about stellaris be aware that paradox will be happy to break the game on purpose to release a new trash tier dlc in a pre alpha state right before some random holiday to get a bit more sales
