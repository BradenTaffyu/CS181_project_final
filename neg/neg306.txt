2023 payday 3 is a game that s very fun at its core with tight shooting mechanics and a great gameplay loop bogged down both by abysmal design choices and a community that would rather take the easy way out and cry if they can t take it as mentioned before the shooting mechanics are great weapons feel punchy and snappy except the signature 40 piece of trash enemies actually respond to gunfire and most importantly the game s actually somewhat difficult at times without throwing massive spongy enemies at you a for these 100 however everything else bogs down the experience instead of having a server browser like crime net instead overkill decided to opt for an online only matchmaking experience which caused the game to be unplayable for about 4 days and lobbies being a ghost town for certain difficulties however this is not the worst of it as a lot of public lobbies have become stealth or leave there s no way to tell someone s in a stealth getup at all since you cannot see your teammate s loadout past the icons and what their primary weapon looks like with the only actual indicator is armor if it s standard or light lining they want stealth issue being the payday community seems stuck in a binary stealth or loud no in between you want to do stealth if we fail for any reason even near the end vote to restart want to do loud should have brought friends idiot this isn t even starting on the questionable decisions for in game and out of game stuff the pre game lobby feels like it was hobbled together in 5 minutes no text chat no unready button it s either stay readied or leave and no inspecting loadouts in greater detail post game is also pretty bad since unless you fail a heist you re forced to disband for in game there s no vote to kick option for rowdy players griefers you either fail the heist or leave someone holding onto the bag you need to progress and refusing to drop it he can do it until he goes into custody or the game ends someone deciding to start slinging insults for something that s their own fault they can complain and go afk for as long as possible either getting a free ride or forcing a fail also since there s no hosts no more host kick either essentially if kick options do come into the game they re still going to be a vote stat ui is also a complete reversal we re back to the bars instead of actual numbers especially with how expensive and time consuming some of these attachments are to obtain we need actual numbers and info not slight bumps on a bar levelling up also is only able to be done through challenges before heists were the only way to level up but the higher your infamy was and the higher the difficulty the more xp you got now it s purely tied to challenges like complete x heist loud x times complete x heist stealth x times etc it s fairly boring and forces players into weird situations to play heists repeatedly or use weapons they don t like in order to actually level up skill points and weapons are tied to your level with the last normal weapon unlock at level 77 and the final skill point unlock at level 100 so if you want to play you have to grind out these challenges or be stuck eternally at a lower level with no way to progress now for in game overkill weapons need tuning there s currently 2 the m32 grenade launcher and the lynx 50 cal the m32 is your default but has an extremely large splash radius ridiculous self damage extremely long reload and bouncing grenades that won t explode unless it impacts an enemy directly or you take a skill that makes it explode on impact no matter what on the other end the lynx one shots every target except dozers which it two shots and overpenetrates targets it also has a thermal x ray sight telling you where enemies are and where center mass is the first option needs buffs while the second is in a perfect position but they both get hampered by how they re delivered overkill weapons are brought in through chopper in the worst locations for no rest for the wicked and gold and sharke it s in the street in front of the bank so you have to run all the way out of cover just to pick them up they re also sent one at a time with a cooldown meaning your teammates can t call in theirs until yours is delivered and the cooldown passes most heists you will go with one or less ovk weapons since they either aren t worth the hassle or you ll be done before it becomes useful for loot however one of the biggest travesties have occured grabbing the minimum is the most optimal yes securing 10 bags is fun and fits into the heisting fantasy too bad those bags were worth 2k each with the singular bag being worth 500k if you want to do heists for effeciency due to the current challenge system get minimum get out it always feels awful leaving loot behind but if you want to max out your build you have to stealth also feels broken as well guards facing one direction but seeing another server desync causing guards to detect you earlier or later than they re supposed to i even had to eat a pager on 99 bags because i was seen while on the zipline despite it not only being the only way to cross but not being able to see the guard on the other side due to it not loading in his model until after crossing the gate pair this up with camera spam like in under the surphaze and you re practically always going to be using a pager on cams to avoid the constant headache of camera pinging ai is just awful as well in payday 2 ai were awful at first but then became pretty busted since they got a bunch of perks to supplement the player meaning not only was solo play better it was optimal since you could interact significantly faster have more health etc here the ai are back to early payday 2 no brainpower dies instantly and repeatedly basically you want at least 3 players for a loud heist of higher difficulty and solo players are in a poor spot due to this to stray away from the negatives it s nice you can stay in casing mode and it still allows you to actually do stuff hell even some heists are 100 doable just in casing like rock the cradle or gold sharke having a separate stealth deployable and a non stealth deployable means you can be useful in both modes if necessary and the game doesn t run like complete garbage unlike payday 2 s massively outdated diesel engine so as far as things go this game is undercooked yes it can be quite fun with friends who know what they re doing however matchmaking is a chore since about 80 of the lobbies i ve done opted for stealth only and either spam restart or cry about nobody wanting to do stealth servers need to be worked upon to prevent desync and matchmaking errors we need the quality of life changes that were in payday 2 into this game we need the game to actually be more refined not payday 2 for 10 years refined but at least refined enough where the game is enjoyable for everyone and not stealth 24 7 in public lobbies
