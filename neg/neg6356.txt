2023 product received for free update i managed to solve my problems by installing win11 instead of win10 the win10 fresh install did nothing with win11 ascendio3 ini changes i m getting 50 144fps in hogwarts average 100 and at least 70fps in hogsmeade all on ultra and dlss quality minus rt this is much better but still unacceptable that some random dude and his random ini changes actually give many more fps and reduce stutter than the devs also this immense fluctuation in fps is very annoying still way better than before though now i can continue playing the game and maybe change the review original review follows i really really tried but this is a performance mess i cannot bear to play any longer at best i m getting around 50fps when looking at a wall on low everything even patched with ascendio2 ini tweaked most of my play time is tweaking restarting being dissapointed rinse repeat i even threw a quick clean install windows into the pen and hell the massive load times including a shader cache refill each effing start don t make it any better settings don t really matter the delta between lowest and ultra means one figure fps gain and guess what enabling rtx does to the frames yup luckily i m no hp fan i even dislike hp or else i d be very upset the whole thing is very cute much love in the details and all exploring the castle is a pure bliss but this is a joke that gives me literal headaches i m waiting for the pirated version now to see if it was denuvo or just bad optimization and yeah it s all my fault i don t know what i m doing 50fps is more than enough my rig sucks you re stoopid the human eye can t perceive more than 30fps etc spare me
