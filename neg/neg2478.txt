2022 well i launched the game bought like 10 packs made my first deck looked up for a game at rookie rank 2 and got otked by tcg netdecks great game and i still got ranked up afterwards lol if you are new at any card game you should not face complete meta or rogue decks at the start in duel links it s also not the case not even in hearthstone and of course it has to be a gotcha game the ingame shop is kinda idk you have master packs which you need to buy to unlock more specific packs for example a pendelum magician or blackwing pack if you open such cards which will be there for only 24h so the game automatically wants to spend you more currency very fast yes at the beginning you will have a lot of ingame currency which kinda let you made every deck when starting the game but it s a gotcha game and considering the real life currency prices you need to pay for ingame currency compared to how much ingame currency you ll get at the start i think the game will get very expensive after you play a while also i gotta say the crafting system is great you can dismantle every card you can craft every card it s that what duel links needed the whole time to be perfect also the game runs very bad i don t know the recommandations but my computer should handle it and the game tells me all the time i have a bad connection which is simply not true but it s release day so might be fixed later but please konami make a mode for beginners make a better tutorial that tutroial doesn t explain the game at all make faster game modes playing a pvp duel takes forever on my first game with my noob deck i faced a shadoll deck it should be clear that i have no chance by playing a somewhat beatdown deck against comptitive shadolls and still the game took like 30mins to play i was not sure if i ll get anything if i concede simply because the plays take so long to do make different game modes there are many yugioh fanboys out there but when it comes to current tcg there is only a minority really playing it maybe like goat format or draft modes hearthstone and duel links had such a success because they are fast games a game takes like 5 10mins it s interactive with smooth animations master duels however feels clunky too many clicks too many interruptions konami should adress that somehow make the game more accessible because if they can t get the casual fanbase into the game then i doubt master duels will be as successful as duel links which i doubt already to be honest which is sad because i really want to be master duels a great game but as far as now i would not recommend it i simply don t see any point yet why not playing stuff like dueling book or ygopro over master duels except you might be a competitive player wanting to join tournaments and stuff edit one year later and the game is dead
