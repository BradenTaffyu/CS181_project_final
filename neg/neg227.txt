2022 i can never respect a game that bullies their f2p and potentially new players this hard into subscribing i ve played subbed a couple times the story is incredible and i love the voice acting and narrative dungeons are fun and dressing up your character as well really feels like the kotor 3 i d have wanted if it was in another medium i hate the game particularly how they treat you the player i understand they need money but so does every other game there are many other mmos who provide you with 100 of a standard game if your free and 200 if your pay via special features and benefits or content this game gives you 200 if you pay 50 if you don t with things like your exp throttled less then 100 as a f2p is it not good enough to just give people who pay 200 nope want to wear a piece of lvl 20 gear that is purple or higher cant if your f2p you ll be forced to have your skill and experience throttled for existing as a f2p on top of much more egregious punishments i am not going to list tldr game is beautiful in story and effort put into it horrible business practices which unlike most freemium mmos who simply let f2p exist and provide incentive via benefits this game also chooses to actively punish you for choosing to play f2p with abusive throttling tactics and oppressive limiitations
