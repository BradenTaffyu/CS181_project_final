2023 updated review as of the patch on july 3 2024 this game has improved to the point of potentially being slightly more entertaining than frustrating catastrophic bugs and poor design choices have been fixed to the point of only being major or mayyybe minor bugs i would finally consider this game a rough beta instead of a barely playable alpha despite this drastic improvement the game is still riddled with bugs and custom assets are not available code mods fix a lot of problems but the game is still extremely rough with or without them you will no doubt have to watch your existing cities decline and rebound as they further debug the economy which makes development of any strategies pointless i do not plan to devote much time to this game until they patch it much further but if you already have gamepass and you really really want to try it i will tell you to go ahead otherwise i still do not recommend this game chances are good that if you held off until now anyway you still should the developer has a long way to go and they spent the first 6 of the last 9 months very unkindly insulting and gaslighting those in the community calling out the folly of releasing roughly a full year too early they would still deserve to get lambasted if the latest version was what they released back in october reward the developer and publisher only when the game is actually working as advertised
