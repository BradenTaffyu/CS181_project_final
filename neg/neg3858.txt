2016 early access review this game has been in alpha for 3 years now 3 years and there seems to be no plan to go to beta alpha 15 is coming soon enjoy 14 7 in the meanwhile that s right 15 alpha builds if this isn t a perfect example of a game developer trying to avoid paying taxes i don t know what is that being said the game is decently fun but gets broing and repetative rather quickly it has also changed directions many times since launch i can t at this time recommend paying for an alpha build that has no indication or seemingly want to go beyond alpha
