2020 simply put it is a fun game and i enjoy playing it but at the end of the day bethesda are greedy a holes and they charge 15 euro for skins that where previously free mods lets not forget the 800 limit on camp and that you need to pay a monthly payment of 12euro to play by yourself they could have easily done what gtav did where you can use mods and trainers on modded servers and offline but the real online you cant people would still buy their cr rap and everyone could enjoy the game on their preferred server without grind and the community would make mods that fix the bugs they cant seem to fix at the end of the day i recommend this game its really fun and enjoyable especially with the npcs but only if you spend less than 15 euro on it
