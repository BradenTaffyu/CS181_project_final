2018 this is an odd review as a general rule of thumb i recommend games that play well i think the graphics in this are good capable of being too much for my 980ti the gameplay is decent and the execution is even good what i cannot and will not recommend is the fact that there are five races which are unplayable until you pay 20 apiece for them which means simply to buy the races to add onto the game you d be spending 100 almost twice the msrp of the game itself and over twice what i actually paid no game in existence should have more value in their dlc than the base game that s unethical and crappy to the player base from looking through the dlcs i see they have free ones which i ve downloaded to offset the amount of paid dlc but you can just look at the 60 game and 100 worth of dlc to see what their business model is and it isn t one that i care to support if i would have known the extent of this i wouldn t have bought it in the first place i thought there was only 1 extra race to buy for 20 which i found acceptable though a bit irritating given that is 20 of the playable races in the main campaign fast forward to the free dlc campaign and it s 50 of the races are paid dlc oh and did i mention for it to be free you have to have warhammer 1 so for those of us that only bought the 2nd game that s another 60 for free dlc how are you supposed to really know how to fight another army unless you ve played that army yourself that s always the best way to figure out rts games not here you d be paying massive premiums to even figure out if you like playing as the new race you unlocked not cool and not something i ll ever support in the future if you re down to pay 60 for 4 races in the main campaign then go for it i d say to wait until it s on sale though because if you get into the game and decide you want the extra races you ll be happy that you saved the money on the base game and could more easily justify spending on the dlc the amount of scheming that went into the pay walls in this game is ludicrous seriously 60 for 4 races 20 to get the 5th in the campaign then they shove a free dlc down your throat to make you think you ll get more races and variety there only to find out you need another 60 game for that and furthermore if you have the 60 previous game then after that 1 2 the races in the free dlc are also dlc it s actually disgusting i m abhored to find out the extent to which they advertised all the dlc content in gameplay hype videos only to hide literally over 1 2 the experience behind further pay walls i ll never buy another game from these people and i ll try to warn anyone who intends to thanks for your time and hope this was helpful
