so after today the garry s mod team decided to pull all nintendo related models and assets from the store because of a copyright troll two decades worth of history are now actively being scrubbed because of their cowardly decision to bow down to such lunacy it s very clear going forward that these developers have no regards for their history and what made them what they are today what s next is activision going to come after you for having their guns and animations ported over here from cod please it seems that the only way to preserve any content from this game going forward is by lurking old forum post archives and or using a free older version of the game depending on how deep this workshop cleansing goes unbelievable
