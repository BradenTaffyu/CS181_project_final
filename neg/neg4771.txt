2019 early access review for a while i was having a great time with game there is something special about getting the satsuma running and tuning and upgrading it while playing hardcore with permadeath however the magic quickly is lost in the menial grind my biggest gripe is the jobs system it totally brought down the game for me earning money in this game is ridiculously boring chopping wood is awful picking berries is beyond awful brewing booze and pumping sumps arent too bad but both are still a grind what i dont get is that you spend all this time and love building your car and the car just to rally it they should get rid of the berry picking and put in like a pizza delivery job or something that involves driving your car for money or something more fun it would be super cool if they made it so you could get a job at fleetari or start a competing business or something as a mechanic the game is kinda aboutt being a mechanic i dont mind having a bit of a grind the whole reason it was a special moment getting your car running was because it was a lot of effort and i really liked that part of that game after that down hill sad to say another issue i have is the fact that you can only carry on thing at a time like maybe a backpack implement you could buy early on or something could fix this this game is worth the money i am not recommending it for said reasons however you can tell the devs put a lot of love and continue to into the game and if you like cars and survival games you might enjoy this like i did it is disappointing in the end but the issues i have could be addressed and that magic brought back there is something special here but its not quite right
