2017 at first they made a few dlcs and with every new dlc they also put out a free patch and the really important features were included in the free patch not in the dlc so everything was fine in the meanwhile they made cosmetic and historical content dlcs for the more passionate players and even though anyone who enjoys the game would also enjoy those things they still did not impair core gameplay so everything was fine then they started making fundamental gameplay changes and delivered core new game features with the dlc and the patches that accompanied the dlcs were merely balance tweaks and were made with the new dlc in mind so now core gameplay features are behind a dlc paywall plus whether you have said dlc or not you get the game version which is balanced around the dlc so you re screwed anyway they did it once and anyway they go on sale often so everything was fine by when they had done it five times you either gave in every time and paid for the new dlc or by then the amount of core gameplay elements that you were locked out of by the dlc paywall was so big and the balance of the game so focused around that that you found yourself with a broken game you couldn t effectively play anymore a game that you loved but now held hostage by around 150 of dlcs blackmail much you used to be different paradox i guess getting bigger has changed you for worse too bad edit guys don t get this review in a wrong way i still play the game and i still did buy most of the dlcs when they were on a 66 75 sale the problem is that paradox used to be different and now they have become very unfriendly to their loyal fan base it s not just the ludicrous amounts of dlcs and the shift from delivering core game elements via free patches to locking them behind a paywall if you ve ever been on their forums you know they have zero interest in the community feedback just like you know there are bugs that have been present since day one of this game and haven t been fixed and so on my negative recommendation is for possible new players if you re new to paradox games i suggest you do not get into them at their current state currently they are a huge money sink and a source of frustration due to bad game design decisions made ignoring community feedback and huge bugs left unfixed
