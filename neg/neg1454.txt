2021 early access review first 100h progressing was stupid classic mnb fun after you assumed your kingdom wiped out one or more factions from the map the game suddenly becomes silly hide and seek game against the emeritus ruler lords that keep escaping and coming back with an army whose funding and influence come from nowhere needless to say there is little to none diplomacy in the game and to make peace with these not powerful anymore factions i even have to pay tribunes yet they still dow me from time to time just pause here for a moment and think about how ridiculous this is seriously have you guys never visited your dungeon what kind of people manage to escape from that and insanely the community is like that s preventing the snowballing oh yeah you mitigate trash balance by throwing more trash into it that totally works almost two years guys after all this time the game is still garbage without mods tweaking it oh yeah and we are still in ea yay tw great job
