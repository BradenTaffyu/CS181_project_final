2016 early access review the development of this game is slower than a shambling zombie the truth is i used to love this game but the lack of progress over the years and the condescending attitude of the forum moderators have ruined it for me week after week we listen to the cheerleaders chanting for the dev s but those of us who have been here a long time know the truth the dev s announced animations were coming soon and close but here we are over half a year later and still waiting they refuse to commit to any eta s because frankly they ve never been able to meet a deadline so they just leave us in the dark waiting and waiting the dev s get side tracked working on features no one really wants or asked for like the nutrition system metal working and tv shows they haven t focused on finishing and implemanting the features that everyone actually wants like npc s animations vehicles and even something as simple as being able to see a back pack on your character s back it s like they have some form of development add i can t recommend this game i ve been following it s progress for several years and what i ve seen is that people are getting sick and tired of an unreasonably slow rate of progress combine that with endless excuses and a cult like follwing ready to rush to the defense with the dev s are awesome and you all just need more patience mantra people have shown an unbelievable amount of patience and i respect that but i feel sorry for the fans that are waiting monday after monday for months even years for any sign of the promised features how long does it take before patience becomes resentment for me it was way to long 2 10
