2023 man i ve played this game off and on for like idk 5 years so i haven t invested an aweful load of time but the fact that i m still only on the second tier is nuts to me i can kill multiple players destroy 100 tanks and even use their free daily boosters yet i get like 1 exp or research or whatever tf it s called it s just mind boggling to me this is a fun game if you can stomach flying the same exact plane for 5 years and i know some people are gonna be like you gotta grinddddd thoooo shut up there is no game where you should be forced basically to purchase a craft simply because their tech tree is so brutally sluggish just a depressing game overall
