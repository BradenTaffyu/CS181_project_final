it was nearly the perfect survival game it gave the tools to make a defensive fort and a reason to actually need it the 7 days system was perfect giving you something to look forward to dread and prepare for so you didn t have to drop whatever you were doing to deal with an unexpected problem plus it had plenty of settings to really tweak the game to play how you wanted it all those mechanics still apply but the recent changes made just wreck the game the system of collecting manuals to basically level up really kills a lot of the variety and choice in gameplay the ability to really dive down entirely different level up trees for a totally different experience is just about dead it s sad to see after so many improvements adding to the game for so long for it to finally hit its 1 o release and just burn out at the end hoping the devs revert some of the choices and go back to making the game as fun as it was
