2018 well the review was based on a very old version so it is probably no longer meaningful however i started to find it easier to compare the logic of p s dlcs as a financial product and i d rather stay away from anything related to finance which i ve never earned a penny from 1 they left only hyperlinks as a valid movement method because they want to have static defense and warp and wormhole make it so difficult to develop a static defense system however they then made the starbase as soft as foam that any marauder event mid late game pirates can chew it like a cake because of course if marauders can t smash your starbase and destroy half of your mining stations and research posts before you reach them what is the point of marauders and by the way the marauders left the other half of your empire untouched not because your ships actually stoped them remember with hyperlinks you ll never reach them unless you are better than ai at path finding which actually you are but you probably need a few s l before you realize that anyway they left because their large fleets were full of treasure and they could take no more kind of like vikings and hordes in ck2 10 10 frustrating2 an empty system is left between my neighbor and i which provides nothing but 2 energy credits i am looking at my neighbor and my neighbor s looking at me and we think meh it s a system to slow me down everywhere and i ll let this guy have it then we get infinite pirate spawn form there and despite that i have a fully armed starbase as the bordering system the pirates always prefer to test their might against it instead of going to my neighbor s unguarded border and of course my starbase s smashed like a paper tiger as what a starbase s supposed to be 10 10 confusing3 my neighbor and i got the borders settled for a while and then i unlocked diplomacy tradition and i said to him hey you wanna be my pal in my federation and he said nay fine i could wait and let time prove my sincerity so i asked 10 yrs later hey wanna be pal and he said nay then 20 yrs 30 yrs 40 yrs and he said nay then 50yrs before i even asked of course he said nay his attitude to me never change for 50 yrs because there s no possible interaction with him to make him like me better anyway being able to see my neighbor having a clear attitude to me and understand that i could do nothing which explains why he does what he does is sufficient to beat civ5 s diplomacy 10 10 annoying4 i waited for 10 yrs to get a mid game tech done well actually 3 mid game techs because they are simutaneous and did not get the techs i wanted in the pool so i waited for another 10 yrs to get another 3 mid techs done which are useless again then again did not get anything i wanted either my tradition progress followed this timeline as well also very unfortunately i was in a truce so in the ten year meantime i was basically doing nothing but staring at my screen because if i didn t the maruaders would come and smash everything before i can s l ops sorry half of everything it feels like playing ck2 without events and decisions especially the raiding or being raided part of ck2 10 10 boring5 a lot of die hard paradox fans keep criticizing any live soft players for criticizing paradox for its policy instead of games so i hide this up if you don t want to read any thoughts on the company paradox seems to be losing the ability to make interesting games and seems to be running a xenophobic attitude when players proudly achieved something through any unintended combination of mechanisms paradox is provoked and have to fix the game against it be it the early wormhole rush in this game tributary ryukyu empire in eu4 or duchyless feudal kingdom empire in ck2 and now their games are filled with fake variety that even an inward perfection game and a driven assimilator game are hopelessly monotonous thanks paradox for teaching me how to play but i believe you should only teach me the basic moves not the full strategistic plannings and tactical operations that s too much of an ego on another issue paradox s reply to chinese localization was at least confusing if not disappointing and humiliating games that have been sold do not count because well they are already sold so you are not obliged to provide a service you offered in the first place which is overriden by your marketing incentive very reasonable but if games sold are games sold and don t count why don t you lower the price of games made 5 yrs ago to meet the demand curve because hey games sold are games sold they don t count and who cares about those people paid full price for a game when they have already paid and they won t be mad at all right when ascension originally a selling point in utopia dlc is made available as a free content everyone was pleased right nobody s mad for people getting something free right nobody s mad for paying for something free right or am i completely misunderstanding the paradox s long tradition of listening to players feedbacks that only games sold to chinese do not count anyway 10 10 humiliatingin summary 25 uncanny 20 materialist fools 20 authoritarian tyrants 10 xenophobic bigots 200 insultdisloyalthis is not a complete critism i would make to this game and absolutely not a complete one towards recent paradox decisions i would definitely not recommend this game to any one unless meaningful improvement is made and i might still hesitate to recommend this game due to paradox s marketing decisions do not tell me the game quality is independent of company policy because my gaming experience is an integral part of my evaluation of game quality and it heavily depends on the company policy but anyway you can respectively disagree p
