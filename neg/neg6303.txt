this is mediocre game some things are great graphics landscapes music voice acting unique atmosphere unique father son adventure decent pc port which is rare some things are bad generic console like idiotic puzzles or mechanics like find a climbing spot 3rd person exploring semi movies with limited camera and controls but the worst thing that took away the pleasure of finishing the game was the hardest difficulty option it is called give me god of cheese aka what hit me therefore i made a list of complete disastrous design choices and errors no other game was ruined in similar way it s like they made this mode to ruin their own creation and prevent you from having fun executing combos being inventive experimenting big lack of damage tools for first half of the game hp bar makes no sense you die to 1 2 hits very rarely 3 might as well be just 3 health dots enclosed fights drop 1 2 healing stones that heal you for 15 again it doesn t make sense optional fun areas on easier modes becoming inevitable tedious long chore farming gear boy becomes your tank and or your main dps in some fight configurations you can barely do anything enemies suddenly switching attack target mid animation from boy to you death some enemies teleport or whoosh away while stunned or in laying pose this looks really ridiculous small and unchangeable fov and enemies at the back death incoming hero model way too big obstructing enemies and hits on the left side directional danger arrows poorly designed invisible and unmarked hits what hit me only few of your actions animations can be interrupted if you need to quickly block or dodge it s a no no death one trick pony enemies and bosses fights are tedious only limited things works most of your battle arsenal is useless or purely cosmetics fights require you to follow that 1 discovered working chain of execution and discovering it is bigger part of the encounters bigger fights bosses etc require you to repeat 20 30 times same thing its boring and there is no winning satisfaction only relief after your combo there is nothing interesting to do while waiting for cooldowns non combo damage output is pathetic no programmed protection on end of finisher and other animations unavoidable and random death enemies input reading 0 time reaction terrible hitboxes not matched to weapons models and attacks like revenant s stick having 5m range somehow some enemies have ability to remove your target lock yes really devs made it part of the game also target lock makes you miss some targeted skills lol and finally the dude that supposed to be god of war and is able to lift whole trees and shatter solid rocks with bare fists dies to 1 hit of tutorial zombie or wolf this was not a gg
