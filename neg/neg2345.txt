2021 early access review a really good game tbh then why don t i recommend it well they ve made a game that they can expand indefinitely however they are a very small team which now starts to show people want updates heck even my friends thought this was gonna be updated on a weekly basis sadly that s not the reality in 6 months we ve seen a small bugfix patch once you and your friends have completed chapter 2 then what the game leaves you hanging in this vast ocean and without any sense of purpose once you ve completed as of today the second chapter i d still play this game if updates were to come out but if they really want this game to become something they have to go from hobby to business and get some more programmers working on this i might update this review in the future but as for now i d recommend to wait i reckon it ll be on sale once if they release chapter 3 edit june 21th the renovation update this did add a lot to the game to keep one occupied and actually making ones boat personal i still however feels it s incomplete due to waiting on chapter 3 but there s also more i still don t understand the end game of this developed game hopefully it ll be revealed later on
