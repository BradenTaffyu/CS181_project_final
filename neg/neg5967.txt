2016 i will expand my review as someone found it probably unclear i really loved this game from the 500 hours of gaming you can see it it is one of the most complex strategy games ever created the huge issue here is the policy of the software house that developed it after the realease that i personally consider nothing less than criminal when they realease a major dlc expansions the add new interesting mechanichs in the game this would be perfect if at the same time they didn t brake some basic mechanics of the base game without that dlc a perfect example of that is territory developement if you don t have the dlc you cannot develop buildings in a country which is a function of the base game that you could use before the dlc and therefore i already bought with the basic game that is nothing less than a theft at the moment this can be a wonderfull game but only if you are ready to spend 100 on expansions dlc after buing the 50 broken basic one
