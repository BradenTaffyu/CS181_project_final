this game is my ultimate form of t0rture p0rn it s just good enough to be playable once every now and then but each time i do i m very quickly reminded why i quit playing so many times before as a combat simulator it s great but everything else with the game is either repetitive chores features lacking any kind of depth or just stuff that s straight up unenjoyable between battles it feels like adventuring across a large liminal space it s like a sandbox but without the sand if immersion and a vibrant world is important this is certainly not a game for you this is not to mention all persistant bugs or the sluggish pace at which the game receives updates some of which bring even more bugs and seldom any new content of value this is a game i really really want to like and i have put a lot of hours into it but ultimately it fails to deliver in any aspect other than the battles themselves i m not content with the current state of the game and considering how things have been managed since its release date i m really not positive about its future either i simply can not recommend this game to anyone
