2019 early access review caves of qud is a brilliant game the world it takes place is huge and mysterious with incredible opportunity for exploration the npcs and flavour text is very well written and the history of the world is well thought out npcs are interesting and the interaction of the various factions keeps thing fresh and interesting the combat too is intuitive and easy to grasp even with the addition of a wide variety of character customization options and items so do i recommend new players pick up this fantastic game no way in hell and that s for one big glaring reason the balance in this game is among the worst i have ever seen it s absolutely terrible out of depth enemies are very common as are special enemies who are much tougher than their peers and with greater abilities who can often one shot you a recent example from my experience is how two runs in a row the very first hostile creature i run into at level one in a low level region is a chitinous puma a level 12 creature that s nearly impossible to escape from due to having both charge and sprint abilities plus being armoured so your options of fighting back will be mostly ineffective this sort of thing is common and it ll take you a lot of experience just to get past level 10 or so yourself so get used to those early areas because you ll be doing the same ones again and again and again and again i m sure longtime players will try to justify this with claims that the terrible balance keeps you on your toes or that it s just a function of qud being a dangerous unforgiving world maybe so but that also makes it not fun and frustrating for new players it s a cheap frustrating way to add difficulty to a game and makes reaching all that brilliantly written and designed content later on all but inaccessible which is a real shame unless this sort of thing gets addressed and i don t expect it will be any time soon i cannot possibly recommend new players buy this game
