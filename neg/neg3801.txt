2021 early access review a20 edit most of below the edit is still applicable some notes pipe weapons are a huge improvement in the early game now if only they had more ammo in early loot so i didn t need to trade something valuable to get some ammo streamlining the building blocks is minor but nice but that was also the biggest source of xp for players xp scaling needs to change as it takes a lot more work to gain levels just to be clear under standard rules getting to lv 300 will take you roughly 1 year of play time before these changes highly recommend mod for this new drone is more like a late game backpack expansion than anything else i d rather just have a backpack slot on my character sheet and have backpack inventory expanders be late game loot than a random drone that i now have to interact with if it participated in combat then that would be a different story late game survival is a little less boring since farming got nerfed to the point that i d argue that you either max the skill or don t bother to maintain yourself on farming alone will take roughly 40 farm plots more if you want variety or some qol foods like red tea this is per person so i wouldn t even bother if playing with friends unfortunately this increases the value of endurance skill tree even more as if it isn t already too strong compared to the others new quest type is mildly interesting i like that they added a new quest type as it is a step in the right direction now give me another 6 types and we d be in a good spot unfortunately it is just a normal poi that happens to use the generators that are in the poi already do the poi once as one quest type and you won t see much variation with any other quest type now lets talk poi s and cities the city generation is a welcome change while this leads to more variety it is at map generation only by the time i get to day 100 on a map those poi s are stale as i ve done quests in them many times by then i won t ask for a brand new different building to be slapped over top of whatever is in the location but the poi s need to be a bit less static if i do one the loot is in the same spot the zombies spawn in the same spot traps are in the same spot it would be better if we could get variations of location on quest reset maybe one variation of that house has a basement but another doesn t and the stairwell down is turned into a closet instead or the path through the house changes with different doors blocked off a20 edit end i would only recommend it if you were bored and liked looter shooters and it was on sale and you looked for mods the vanilla game needs help to be playable the good unique style of game or at least it was unique years ago still different being able to build and defend destructible structures looting a building is a harrowing experience in the early game and can net you some good jump scares there is enough variance in the game loop to make it interesting to change up your style if you start to get bored progression based on your decisions and experience lots of mods very configurable horde nights later game ones the bad devs take forever to update when it is updated it is rarely new content usually a re implementation of something that has existed combat is janky ui is hot flaming garbage late game survival gets boring until horde night world is very sterile yeah buildings and zombies and some fauna but the only event that happens is a wandering horde of x occasionally game can get very taxing on your computer as you progress serious optimization issues for long plays some long standing extremely frustrating bugs they just won t fix i e corrupt character profile bug when you lose your inventory and exp and levels to the void but keep your map i never had this bug happen to me in any other game ever the ugly truth i ve played this since very early alpha i want to say 5 we are on 19 now i ve seen it morph into something more graphically pleasing and the gameplay improve then decline then improve then decline then improve the game is always 2 steps forward 1 step back the devs spend more time on re tooling parts of the game they ve implemented already rather than just picking something and just going with it many of the cons to this game are resolved with modswhat i d like to see more events than bumping into horde of x to make the world feel more alive for example save someone from small horde in a building for a reward find a random survivor who needs an item either a reward or surprise enemy risk random flock of chickens or something different than horde of hostiles get rid of this class system you can control some of the essential progress through story expand that starting quest chain to more stuff so then your workbench recipe is given as a quest reward eventually same with forge and other important ones switch back to the old blueprint model and find the blueprints if you want to make it quests with longer quest lines no reason why this can t be done story would be nice make the zombies dumb again trying to stop people from finding the most efficient survival technique is like trying to end the existence of computer viruses not to mention it would speed up the game and allow much larger hordes since they aren t constantly trying to find a new efficient path to the player final word the reality and i think the devs know this is that the foundation is a mess and they are constantly trying to clean it up before moving forward and it is just stagnating this game they need to just run with a decision and try some new content then take the capital from all the sales learn lessons and make a sequel with a better foundation and more direction than the listless mess this is becoming
