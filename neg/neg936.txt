2019 this review is written typed by jiggly65 s wife fallout 4 is a good shooting game but not a good fallout game now i would say this i did enjoy my time with this game but for me i m not really into some shooters like my husband is fallout for me is good storytelling rpg mechanics and little fun side quests and well these are what i want and expect for a fallout game or just some kind of improvement from fallout new vegas but what bethesda has done is will kinda mix of borderlands and fallout where side quests are about as forgettable as borderlands 1 and 2 s side quests rpg mechanics or about on par with the borderlands series witch i think there not that good and the story my god the story now i would say this i am a married individual but we don t have kids but anyway the feeling of you losing your husband or wife and your baby and you can t do anything about it is really heartbreaking to me but when your character stops caring about the horrible things that has happened to them after words then what s the point there are times whenever you do care about your baby but other times you don t and just f ck off someplace else so i don t understand if bethesda is trying to write a good story or trying to be as goofy as elder scrolls oblivion or the borderlands series as for bugs well there s just too many really shows that bethesda is starting to get lazy with their games when it comes to fixing bugs it even shows more with bethesda s fallout 76 i guess what kept me going with this game is the modding part but most particularly these two mods hey i find anime girls with big proportions to be badass so don t judge lmao either way i think fallout 4 is just mediocre to me as a fallout fan it s really disappointing if you want a good 3d fallout open world rpg then i would recommend fallout new vegas if you want a good shooting game then i guess fallout 4 is ok to get
