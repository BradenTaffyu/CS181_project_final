2016 while playing this game it occured to me that the more time i spent partaking in the tedium and the grind the less fun i had initially tank fights were very fun to play an experience one of few i was able to take away from this game that was positive it was simple you shoot them and they shoot you as i ascended in the ranks of both russia and us tanks 3 0 5 0 that same ideal stayed relativley intact some tanks became more armoured than others but it wasn t impossible to kill them and a miracle shot wasn t something unheard of there were clear trade offs with the tanks some offered more speed with a better gun but less armour as a whole some were more armoured with decent speed but a crappier gun and it goes on no tank was without weakness in major areas and the areas were very clear this added a bit of interesting gameplay and it helped me learn how to turn my tanks in certain ways to block shots or where to shoot tanks to get the maximum amount of damage and i reveled in that it was interesting gamplay and it was very immersive i had spent a large portion of my time playing war thunder at this metaphorical sweet spot then i got my first 5 7 tank and i started to get matched with 6 0 and 6 3 an occasional 6 7 would appear as well i would position myself no different than before and die instantly i would fire away at tanks shot after shot trying so desperatley to find a place to hit but die quickly after i was spotted after causing minimal damage most times i would find fair matches but it was also the unfair matches i remember most vividly i kept telling myself that once i was on equal ground it would be more fun again it kept me going to repeat that then i got my first 6 0 tank long gone were the times where i could just shoot at other tanks and cause damage i was finding myself dying over and over even though i had been doing nothing different than before constanty dying to a single shot even though my shots never got the chance to even penetrate when i did get a kill it wasn t satisfying it felt owed to me and after spending the better part of 10 15 minutes driving my slow tank i felt that it should ve too after some research on why my performance has suffered so badly i learned that the game completley changes at 6 0 with no warning to it s players instead of having huge killzones tanks now had tiny weak spots to shoot and you were damned if you couldn t hit them some tanks were still thinly armored with guns equal to those of the slow cumbersome variety there was no way to win for me but to sit and ambush or invest in these tanks that demanded tedium to drive if i managed to get to a shooting zone that was profitable for me i ended up getting bombed the game was stale it wasn t fun to play anymore the tanks they were wildly cool as an enthusiast i was thrilled at the idea of getting to drive them it s unfortunate that the game becomes so unbearable at the higher tiers becuase i was really looking forward to playing a simple tank game like it was when i started i wanted more than world of tanks but i also wanted less than the complexity this offered i only hope that in the future they make a balancing pass at the game and i sure hope that the ships don t come out like this did i havent even started on the grinding process of this game you will not get far without premium or a tank that costs money
