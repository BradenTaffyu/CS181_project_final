2021 early access review the game has been in early access for a year and yet hasn t meaningfully evolved one bit yes there were performance and qol updates but the fundamentals ai gameplay loop balancing are still completely messed up there is no indication that this game will ever be in a finished state update for 1 7 a few more qol changes while also removing important features like manually assigning troops to different groupings no way to put all the recruits in one group for training purposes anymore good job
