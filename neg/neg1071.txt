2017 i would have to say that my favorite mission in this game is on the steam library you get the mission after you mistakenly enjoyed the game for it to finally resort to paid mods head on down to the library and right click it when prompted with a slew of choices left click the uninstall button and as boring and black and white as this game is click delete or cancel mission complete you ll know if you passed you save a bunch of hard drive space
