2021 playtime 100hrs steam doesn t show real hours because it only launches a game launcher summary insultingly expensive huge lack of content overrated rating system lack of servers sessions bad graphics good physics but still a mile behind acc ams2 and rf2 exploitative racing series layouts forcing people to either not race with content they own or spend 200 on a single series for like 8 tracks first year cost of racing over 300 at least plus the 10 month subscription fee here s how iracing races work there are no single races unlike most other games every race is part of a series every series usually has 12 races per season with 3 seasons per year in a season you race usually 12 tracks which rotate every week or two while the cars stay the same the entire season series usually only allow 2 to 3 cars what effect does this have on racing well it means that when you hop on to race you re required to race that same racetrack for 1 2 weeks which gets really repetitive and boring oh you don t own that racetrack well looks like you re not racing until the series goes to a track you own at 12 tracks per season usually 11 are paid and at 15 track you re looking at 40 subscription 165 for 11 paid tracks 10 per car for a single series season cost of 215 215 for 3 months of mediocre racing and outdated graphics as you graduate to higher license classes supposedly better racing you re expected to drop another 215 per 3 months on that new car and series tracklist since your car will not carry over into that new series and the tracks usually don t either what bothers me the most is that iracing purposely makes the tracklists super inconvenient so you have to pay out of desperation to race since you re already paying for a subscription and paid for the car and don t get to race if you don t drop the extra 15 week for a track to race it feels like a legitimate scam and the community is full of toxic anti consumer consumers who will defend anything the developers do
