2017 early access review on december 20th of 2021 they finally released animation build over 5 years late these features promised in august of 2016 only now delivered not in november of 2017 2019 but dec 2021 there are plenty of reasons to tell you do not recommend the best one is this indiestone consistently hides progress constantly goalpost shifts to excuse their failures to meet deadlines oh but it will be better this way and operates an extremist moderation that issues first offense permanent community bans for even the slightest criticism when too many doubts lead to a bad optics it s how they operate i bought this when the early kate and baldspot story was actually featured when there npcs were in the game this game has been on steam since november 8 2013 my wife birthed three of my children in the time i ve waited for this game to be finished i ve outbred most of the developers at this point these people operate under an extreme interpretation of hurry up and wait in ten years of waiting i ve seen other early access games actually being completed unlike indiestone many of them have small teams even one man teams they delivered a quality product in a timely manner pz developers claim to care about quality spend most of the year screwing around make up excuses and treat their community as a potential enemy they always have something behind the scenes almost ready that they somehow deemed progress then they throw in a gimmick like vehicles were almost a year after promising a new animation set that same formula is now set up for npcs they claim two teams are on separate projects with one coming before npcs patterns of behavior predict future behavior in this case there is only just enough progress to say the game s not dead but not enough progress to show the game s actually going somewhere this is endless development hell when sales get bad they ll finally release something this is their business model this game still sells even after all this time it s popular it s still marketed and their moderators sure as hell make sure you can t read anything bad about the game in the forums it s quite clear they put plenty bread on the table and as a customer you re not going to have anything to show for it except a game you re wishing was better people keep buying this because there s something they expect to get out of it and honestly this is the big problem even their moderators are disillusioned with the entire thing openly admitting they don t care about fans but care about a calm situation in other words no hope getting the ball rolling in my experience games without passion have never been worth buying instead this failed project is treated as a daily income maker and if a game sells that s a meal for the day they constantly insult and look down on the community they ve managed to alienate over all these years blaming them for their development team being emotionally weak and incapable of withstanding any amount of criticism having online thugs that bully dissenters then permanently ban anyone who decides to take the same tone as the moderation does sarcasm and belittlement are great when the moderator does it and sycophants that cheer it on are left alone they see you as a pig that doesn t hunt for their truffles of wisdom google search old topics for project zomboid dozens of posters who asked questions are now banned that tells you a lot if you really want to open up truth and reality of who a lot of these people are open up an old closed thread about npcs maybe title it where are the npcs you will be ringing a dinner bell where you will be attacked by a horde of blind sycophants that go beyond making excuses but try to find ways of insulting you on a personal level instead of even trying to acknowledge the topic this game has a fairly toxic leftover community because if you choose to criticize the slow development progress failure to include promised features or the outright lies promoted and then buried by the people running the joint these angry trolls will stack up their comments which are fully sanctioned by the indiestone moderation at this point someone gets a little rowdy a targeted ban will be issued and the mod will issue a statement we ban our fans too only for that ban to be lifted about a week later it s permanent if you re not on his side there s an easy way to explain the rabid fanbase originally posted by carl sagan if we ve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle we re no longer interested in finding out the truth the bamboozle has captured us it s simply too painful to acknowledge even to ourselves that we ve been taken once you give a charlatan power over you you almost never get it back i ve put well over 300 hours into pz and i ll tell you most of that is modding it exploiting it or laughing at it with friends in multiplayer this game isn t anything special without the input of a third party meanwhile the development team well on their way to becoming the next derek smart collective in how they revel in tiny little accomplishments that you should accept as big progress because apparently if a turtle moves an inch that counts as a mile let s delve into an old part of the original review the biggest missing element of the game npcs indie stone had them in the game at one point took them out made a few false promises like they d come in after the new animation sets then they failed those promises such as never delivering new animation sets it doesn t stop there this development team was so utterly incompetent with their promises that the mods make it a point to emphasize that they intend not to be transparent at this point i mean how many hoops do you have to jump through to get information about upcoming developments as a paying customer they make it a point to lie about not wanting to be transparent with the community because poor lemmy or whomever had to talk to a troll which really was a paying customer who probably saw through their sharade early on when you have a community member that will follow you from a thread to a different situation altogether to harass you for criticising the game the jokes about rabid fanboyism just aren t going to do them justice you know the community s toxic when you have to worry about norman bates tracking you down for your review 2017 me speaks truth when active legitimate topics are being shut down by the team it s time to start being suspicious when critics are silenced you draw a line this isn t a game that you want to invest in you re better than this note this review is with the experience of seeing multiple users shut down and booted by the staff managing project zomboid forums both here and on their own site this includes actions i ve seen happen to others and i am giving it fair justice in my criticism if you wish to debate the merits of criticism through a review i encourage you to look up the definition of what a review actually is if you disagree with this review and choose to personally attack me instead of addressing the points i ve highlighted i m going to delete your comment you can either post again without throwing personal insults my way for an actual discussion or you can find a safe space to vent thanks we re half way through 2018 and not one damn word about it but is it really any surprise old edit lol 2019 how many iterations of battlefield have come out since these mongoloids sorry mondoids started work on this piece of development hell still no npcs in sight still no end in sight edit 2022 review in process of reconstruction
