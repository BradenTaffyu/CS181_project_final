next gen update after well over a year of work includes some content that was made by modders not bethesda zero real bugfixes no actual uw support physx still broken despite nvidia publicly stating how beth can fix it physics still tied to framerate hd texture pack is still trash modders have done more useful fixes to fo4 in the last week than bethesda managed to do with years of work many of which are temporarily broken by the update this is absolutely unacceptable better to have not wasted everyone s time than release a quarter assed update with literally no working fixes and some free modder made content i m not a typical bethesda hater they ve done some great games and do have some actual talented content artists however they really need to take advantage of the resources that come from being part of microsoft and owning technical powerhouses like id there is no reason the game could not have been put into a significantly more modern state for this so called next gen update
