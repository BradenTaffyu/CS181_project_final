2022 on the fence about fh5 i am someone who has played every single forza game coming back from forza motorsport 3 forza horizon has just become a game only for kids on one hand this is absolutely amazing but on the other hand the other horizon games also tailored to kids in its own aspect have you ever went back and watched cartoons from your childhood do you ever notice how now that you re older you understand some different jokes forza horizon was kinda like that it appealed to kids by being easy to pick up fun to drive around with friends ai having their own jokes and it was one of the few games doing something different i would really like to recommend this game but only due to its predecessors if you get the chance to try out any other fh game go for it forza horizon 5 completely removed any idea of progression and throws you into the game as a superstar from the previous forza horizon game which isn t too bad but from the little time i have on this game 60 hours at the time of writing i have over 25m and 500 cars i recently launched the game after about 2 weeks of not playing and i was given over 40 super wheelspins they literally give you handouts for everything i can guarantee you will never have to purchase a car from the auction house or the autoshow i ve completed the campaign all story missions and explored most of the map the map is supposed to be massive and full of life but between the online reliability and lack of traffic even when it is there most of the map is just boring they have evenly spaced out cities all with a single quirk about them and nothing else the story is forced lacking emotion and the devs are so out of touch on the cultures they re trying to re create that it s actually insulting i guess according to playground mexico is literally only uncles building 70 s vw beetles nothing else where s the focus on drag racing on the streets meeting up with friends and baja ing in the desert where s the tuned and riced out cabbies this game has so much potential to be apart of one of the best racing game series ever the only way i can recommend this game is if you purely want an open world fun handling racing game where you don t have to grind at all but to me that isn t fun the fun part of games like need for speed and forza horizon is actually going through the story having to progress to unlock new parts or cars and enjoy the immersion
