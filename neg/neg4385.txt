2017 as hard as i try to like civ vi i just can t civ vi lacks everything which made civ v such a fun and addictive game when i first played civ v i was instantly hooked on the gameplay in my opinion i felt that my game of civ v was a dynamic challenging game where my opponents each strategized and acted in the global scale in civ v i conquered a civ as germany and instantly people were concerned about my expansion civ v was a mix of balancing agressive conquest without ticking off the other civs diplomacy mattered in civ vi nothing the ai does makes sense a warmongering spartan empire will criticize you for taking a city civs will declare war on you for absoluetly no reason and then move no units toward your borders then beg for a peace deal ultimatley you do not feel like your civ is a part of the world civ v had interesting yet understandable mechanics which really made you feel like you were in control of your civ civ vi has a complicated ui which is not helpful i really still don t know what i m doing in this game and feel lost in civ v i gained an unersanding in a few hours i keep telling myself that another game will teach me somtehing that i m missing that will help me like the game more however i do appreciate the attempt to make the civs more dynamic by introducing specialty districts and whatnot however the game is just too broken and not deep the dlc is overpriced and adds nothing but a few civs and some crappy natural wonders overall summary dlc is empty meaningless money grabs that don t change anything and probably won t ever game looks cartoonish and ridiculous and just doesn t work well as an art style with this specific game ai is broken and makes the player feel like the player rather than another civ ui is not helpful mechanics are complicated and not realistic attempt at dynamic civ ai behavior only makes them more chaotic and unpredictable overall recommendation if you want a strategy game that is far worth your money buy civ v complete you can get complete on sale during a holiday event for 12 even at full price i had no regrets too poor and can t wait buy civ iv another great game with endless mods that are a blast i pre ordered this game after i swore i never would again i normally don t feel guilty buing games but i wish i had my 60 back
