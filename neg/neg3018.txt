2018 500 hours and more than 100 spent on this game and all i can say is it is mostly an exercise in frustration with limited replay value 2 0 is an ambitious redesign which i mostly agree with in philosophy but is plagued by bugs nearly 3 months after release i simply cannot recommend this game in it s current state edit as of september 2019 the game still has the depth of a puddle and is still buggy remarkably buggy for a game that isn t early access edit 2 for some reason i keep playing this game it is quite a bit less annoying now however nothing can cure the repetition in events and limited tactical options provided to the player nor has the ai been much improved at least you have some control over the ai s handicap and can probably tailor a game that fits your skill level when playing solo
