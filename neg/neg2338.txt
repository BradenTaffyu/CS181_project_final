2018 early access review what would i say first of all please remember when you read this review that i am writing this during the early access let s start with the good points as far as survival games goes raft have a lot of good things to offer gameplay is quite good and if you played a few survival game before you won t need to learn a lot some resources may be a bit hard to find but you ll be able to cross this bridge easily on the graphic part the game have a very distinct universe and it s quite good to see the music do remind a lot minecraft s one and feel totally adapted to this kind of game so that s a good point too unlike some of the biggest names of survival like ark or 7 days to die there is no manually painted map for you to explore every game is a new map with new islands to discover you also have strictly nothing to see on the sea to help you know where you are going so you will do a lot of your travels praying luck to show you the way it add a very deep and immersive feeling to the game you have no idea of where you are nor where you should go this immersion is improved by the wonderful onceanographic engine of the game you certainly feel the sea changing with the weather and given that you will always be on your raft that s great seriously all that i was hoping for is there and that s great finally you can really create your very own modular ship it s not some kind of pre build thing like in some other game that s also something great survival game is a lot about crafting and this is done here but then why doesn t i recommanded it why good question you brilliant fellow actually there are a few little bad point in the game let s start with the ok this will probably stay and it s not a good news ones the first bad thing is this stupid shark the shark is always near you and trying to eat you like you know a shark and when you re in the sea well that s great that s a great addition and it makes going under sea dangerous and all and that s what we expect but the shark have another function once every so often it goes and start eating your boat seriously and if you don t react fast enough a little piece of your raft is gone and that part is bad first of all it s annoying we re doing something else and suddenly we have to rush to save our ship it also require you to play with the sound on as you have strictly no other way to know that the shark is attacking being disabled the sound is sometime a huge problem for me especially since i cannot have the game sound and still hear my friends on discord so it s either the game or multiplayer and the worst part is that after two or three time you count and discover that even if you manage to turn away the shark as long as you keep a 1 line passing by around your raft it s actually the same price not including plastic but that s too easy to get to let the shark eat what it want and rebuild after that and you don t have to stop everything and run another thing that did annoy me is a small thing but it was really disappointing it s fishing i mean it s a sea themed game there are fish everywhere so fishing must be a huge part of it answer no don t take me wrong fishing is an important part of the game except it basically sum up to left click wait left click no mini game nothing i used to read a book while waiting for fish to catch especially since a very important object can only use 2 out of the maybe 5 ou 6 different fish of the game for a reason that i currently ignore but those two things would not mean no for this game as it s quite small sure i could add that there is a lot of farming involved but let s be honest in a survival game there is always a lot of farming involved and that s the part i love the most so why did i say no well a very important part of any survival game is the amount of things you can do and that s where raft fall short please remember i m writing this during the early access so it may have changed when you buy and test it but as for now it took me a few hours to learn how the game worked then after mayber 5 or 6 hours in a new world i had learned every single recipe in the recipe book and created them all the list is short and although there is a real use behind every single element i feel that after 14h of playing i ve beat the game sure i didn t test multiplayer the thing is as it is i don t feel like making my friends by the game i do like to test early access they doesn t and right now the game is way to empty to be more than what would have been a demo a few years back a pretty good demo mind me but still a demo does this mean you shouldn t buy the game well it s up to you if you like to test a game to see it change to see new things go in then by all means go for it there is nothing really wrong with the game as it is and it s fun to play just keep in mind that it s short played but that it will grow and when it will then you will be glad to have it now if you want a game that you will play countless hours and that have a lot to discover wait a bit come back in a few month and it will be the perfect game for you
