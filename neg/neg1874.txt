2014 edit updated for patch 1 39patch 1 39 has changed several things for one all aircraft are 25 less reserch points it still takes a long time to unloack all aircraft but at least they re making some effort to balance the progression curve 1 39 has also massively dropped the price of aircraft and slightly dropped the price of repairs in some cases aircraft are 1 3 of the lion price they were again a step in the right direction original review content is below most of the bullet points are the same as much as i want to i can t reccomend this game gajin seems to have turned it into a money farm progression was always a problem in the game pre patch 1 37 money was a problem if you wanted to buy all the aircraft of a rank you had to either grind hard or buy premium currency it was a constant complaint on the forums did gajin listen nope post patch 1 37 the problem is even worse money is still an issue only now you have to research aircraft individually other members have done the math on this showing that it slows progression and devalues premium currency by 4 5x the progression curve is broken so broken that it s kind of pointless to switch between countries if you want a jet before your 60th birthday you grind the hell out of one country until your brain melts this saddens me the game itself is wonderfully fun the way the devs have handled it makes me want to puke if you do play play for free don t give them your money like i did
