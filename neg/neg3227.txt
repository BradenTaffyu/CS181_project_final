2021 i love this game the gameplay is fun the sounds music and visual effects are fantastic but wish there was a mid button to give right now for it the balance is horrible and also the matchmaking when you start as a new player you will not know what to research and trust me once you figure out you researched different tier ships you will see you made a really big mistake and should of sticked to one this game is the worse grind ever also because of this yea that high tier ship you could of researched but instead went for a differnt one now it will take forever upon forever to get xp to research ps just a little thing stick to one country and one tier then it will be easier for you dont start this game at first it is cake and fun then once you get up there in hours the matchmakiing starts to be horrible this game literally has rng in it a lower tier ship can destroy you one match you can destroy a higher tier ship in no time while the next match the same ship you just destroyed previous you can do no damage to just like wot they want you to give them the money which is way to expensive in my opinion i get it the game is fp2 but really hey heres a it works the us mass cost 12 750 doubloons 12 5000 doubloons cost 49 50 they do that so you have to spend even more so you need to spend a extra a extra 10 dollars or you could go for the more expenisve doubloons which is like 70 dollars which is what they really want you to do dont think you are good at this game you will be rocked from every side of the map you can literally have your whole team around you and the opposite side will still bomb you first sometimes i feel like there are bots in the game for this reason yea dumb to think that because when you start there are ai till you get a certain tier but thats how it is your teammates will be destroyed once the game starts without even doing nothing and the games can go really fast
