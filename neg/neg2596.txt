2020 edit december 23 2020 since the te awaroa dlc release the bug i mentioned below about the blood and trackings is gone no more problems with that but i encountered a new bug so basically if you are planning on hunting flocks of canada goose you need to stay near the host if you are far away you can see the flocks flying above you but can t spot them they will also ignore your calls no matter how hidden or how good you are at calling the goose once the host gets near you you can finally play normally you can call them you can spot etc to make it clear i was the client when i encountered this bug both me and the host have complete dlc original review below if you want to play with friends or other people multiplayer i am not recommending it clients won t be able to see tracks or blood splatter most of the time if you want to play alone still not recommending it since they have not fixed said bug after all these years it s a sign of bad work ethics i like the game that s why i gave it a thumbs down for this reason only if i hate the game i would just refund and give no fycks
