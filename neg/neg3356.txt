2021 tldr don t buy this game don t buy the dlcs go play a good game and you ll be far happier with your life learning this game was really fun but as soon as you figure it out you realise this game is just unplayable 1 almost every aspect of this game has an overpowered strategy game has a massively in depth system of building ships well the best strategy is to pump out countless level 1 submarines want to arrange your armies and make highly specific division templates with historical accuracy too bad 7 infantry and 2 artillery with some support wins out 98 of the time want to play as the loose term democracy welcome to having far less factories manpower and fun than fascism which contrary to its real life counterpart is extremely overpowered 2 the war participation system single handedly makes the game unplayable you will have tons of games where you quite literally do all of the work and the ai might be on its last legs and yet the way in which war score is generated means you can be in ownership of your enemy s entire country and yet your allies will take all of it in the peace deal this is because the game doesn t even count the casualties you inflict on the enemy toward war score it counts your own casualties this is why every game the soviets will almost die but their loss of 10m men means that they own all of europe the second you capitulate their enemy 3 90 of the time alliances are actually really bad for you especially the soviets your allies decide that throwing their troops against the frontline filling up your tiles with dozens of units so your supply dies and are the optimal strategies and at the end of the war your allies will probably steal 90 of the war score and then take or puppet every core or claimed state you have what great allies puppetting slovenia in the territory i literally went to war for 4 while focus trees may make it look like you have tons of freedom a lot of them really only have 4 routes to go down all of which are pretty much repeats of other countries it s fun but with every new nation you play the fun goes down rapidly because nothing much changes even nations which are supposed to be radically different such as anarchist spain just end up being 1 or 2 gimmicks and nothing else 5 hoi4 devs believe the meme that the soviets just threw their men against the nazis till they won the war and constantly faced shortages of equipment most of the deaths of soviet soldiers were caused by the nazi s genocidal treatment of pow not being killed in combat this is probably partly to counter the fact that the major disadvantage the soviets had against the germans was simply not anticipating the war something which can t be simulated when the player knows how things went in ww2 6 dlcs the game is incomplete without them essentially this game doesn t cost 56aud it costs 250aud and the price just keeps increasing go buy a 20 game and spend 600 hours on that this game is not worth it edit 7 learning this game i said at the start that it was fun and it was in the way that it s satisfying once you learn how to really play this game but there is barely any tutorial for it you end up spending ages watching tutorials and yet still the concepts are over confusing and besides the stupidly simple options mentioned in 1 still overpower any amount of minmaxing
