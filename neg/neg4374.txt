2020 if it were to stand alone this game would be an acceptable strategy game however it has many years of predecessors to stand up to it has many flaws in the way the game mechanics work but as with previous editions i don t doubt that this will only be fixed with paid for expansions the pricing model for buying new races is frankly outrageous the price to buy a single new race or leader to play with is ridiculously high given the amount of content it provides and some of them are notably more powerful than base races so you re essentially introducing a pay to win element into what has been one of the most prominent strategy games of all time do not buy this for a good strategy game do not support this kind of behaviour
