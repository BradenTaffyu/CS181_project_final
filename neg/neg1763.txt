2020 war thunder is an interesting free to play largely realistic third person combat light simulator centered around the pre ww2 to cold war period that can provide a brief degree of entertainment it is held back by an excessive amounts of bugs poor map design and an extremely slow grind that would make gacha games blush as a free to play game it is almost expected that it be a bit of a slow burn but war thunder pushes the limit on what is considered an acceptable time sink while originally designed with only ww2 in mind its content has since expanded in recent years to include a whole host of modern vehicles ranging from those designed in the 70s to more recent additions being as recently created as 2014 these vehicles have all largely supplemented the game s initial developmental focus upon the ww2 era and the steam store screenshots are more than happy to show them off within an instant the showing of these vehicles upon the page is less to display recent content additions and is instead meant as a means to attract an unaware customer the game attempts to lure the player in with these shiny toys and then greets them with an overwhelmingly large page of vehicles that must be researched never fear though progression is quick the player is given a modicum of the game s premium currency which can but shouldn t be used to speed up progression fairly early on and the beginning of each nation is largely forgiving and hands out vehicles like they are nothing this however is not the norm while most nations are largely tolerable for the first half of their respective tech trees they very intentionally begin to slow down after about the halfway point at this point unlocking vehicles will take you days if not weeks in actual playtime no less at a time as the grind slows to a halt the game pushes not only their premium account system which cuts the grind in half effectively but also attempts to goad new players into purchasing premium vehicle bundles that will allow them to skip the grind and immediately get into the real meat of the game the modern tanks while some players may argue that the lower to mid tiers are more fun for the most part they really are most of the game s development effort and much of the community s focus has been upon the modern vehicles for quite some time and this seems unlikely to change moreover this game s learning curve is incredibly steep filled to the brim with poorly explained mechanics and is permeated by a community that is largely unwilling to teach players newer players are treated as punching bags for more veteran players to bully or as fodder to give them a small dent in the monumental grind they have to complete to unlock their next tank default controls are quite poor leaving several gameplay critical components totally unbounded some beginner nations are far more powerful than other ones many maps are poorly designed and even more of them have spots that will allow more senior players to very literally spawn trap and spawn kill players consistently being good at war thunder has far more to do with knowing how to exploit map flaws and sheer memorization that it has to do with something like aiming or mobility utilization as a final addition to a game summary that should have already put you off by now war thunder is infamous for bugs ranging from audio bugs that will pierce your ears to visibility problems defined by one s graphic settings war thunder is an unstable experience new mechanics are often added without thought of the repercussions breaking long standing mechanical norms or simply flat out damaging the game s performance with that said the game is notable for being able to run on just about anything and it is certainly an accomplishment instability is an issue but the game will boot and run on just about any hardware you put it on this is assisted by a robust graphics menu that provides arguably a little bit too much customization over a player s client the most recent patch has lessened this fact but an improved graphics engine is largely welcome to someone such as myself who has fairly decent hardware overall though war thunder is a grind fest slog that puts in the bare minimum in order to retain your attention for your own sake don t give it a go it will try and suck you in and you will be put into an infinite cycle of grinding that will never end none of this game s skills are transferable and you are better off putting both your money and time into a game that respects you as a customer
