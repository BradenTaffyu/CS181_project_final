2016 compared to rome 1 total war i am very dissappointed with the game on a fundamental level the game is too clunky arcadey and many of the mechanics have been dumbed down or removed the most major problem is with the ui primarily rome 1 had a very clean intuitive and satisfying to use interface however in rome 2 this is all reversed the map is horrible the menus obtrusive and disorganised the unit cards ugly the game seems to have been abstracted further with regions of three or so cities and odd over simplified buildings forcing you to make choices when it is not necessary this is obviously in the name of balance making it a more competitive game online but personally i find this direction a bad choice to make and i hoped for more historical accuracy than this i waited a long time to post this review because i hoped they would made some meaningful changes to the game however nothing was major enough to convince me to change my review
