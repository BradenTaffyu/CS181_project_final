2017 one thumb up one thumb down mixed review pros really good atmosphere art voice acting writing music and charm cons terrible design choices in the new armor system 0 crowd control or status affliction chance while armor is up and 100 chance while armor is down makes encounter solutions incredibly repetitive and thus fairly boring as they are too easy to solve via chained 100 success rate crowd control also on tactician there are not more enemies but instead enemies just get huge boosts to their stats armor included making fun hybrid parties bad pushing you to use a more repetitive either all physical or all magical party the first divinity original sin also had more chance involved hit miss chance for both attacks and crowd control which this sequel pretty much eliminated which makes fights very snowbally and predictable and thus somewhat boring towards the mid to end portions of the fight poor lazy loot design choice as every level up your lower level equipment becomes extremely outclassed by current level equipment found by tediously going to merchants and buying their newly updated wares also loot attributes are randomized on most equipment so loot while adventuring feels way less special and lovable as you ditch them frequently for current level loot with higher numbers feels like diablo 3 or borderlands games with the same lazy constant slow drip dopamine design choice only 4 action points without a way to increase them unless using op lone wolf makes fights much less tactical compared to the first divinity original sin 1 in which you slowly increased your action points as the game progressed allowing fun combos in this game you will use your most powerful skills spells at the start of almost every single fight and then your second most powerful skills in the second round also because action points are more sparse scrolls and potions are used less frequently as they take precious action points away from using the aforementioned most powerful skills spells it makes the combat much more repetitive than the first divinity original sin initiative system is botched the turn order is now a round robin system as enemies always get a turn in between your characters no matter how high your or their initiatives are this makes fun multiple character combos less possible as enemies will often move or teleport before you have a chance to perform the full combo example one character casts rain on the floor enemy moves out of the water and your second character can no longer electrocute the water with a lightning spell stats are dumbed down google divinity os 1 s stats and then divinity os 2 s stats and see the difference for yourself small selection of damage dealing magic spells with many of them locked behind the anti fun source system which forces you to spend a few and far between source points to use them conclusion if you liked the first divinity original sin you will probably enjoy this one as well even though most combat mechanics were changed for the worse if you are looking for a superb deep crpg experience similar to the past greats like baldur s gate you may be disappointed
