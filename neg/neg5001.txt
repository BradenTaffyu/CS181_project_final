2019 at its best three kingdoms is an amazing game one of the best total war titles i have played however the gross incompetency of ca has literally in some cases rendered the game unplayable for hundreds of people paying customers who expect a product they buy to work the recent series of patches have fixed some issues but have also caused the game to became radically unstable some including myself who previously ran the game without issue now are unable to enjoy what materially is a competent well polished gaming experience had i written this review two months ago it would have been positive but now my opinion on 3k has turned sour coupling the game s instability ca s crass behavior in response to crash reports and the company s admittedly usual nickle and diming dlc policy i can t see this product in a good light and would not recommend a purchase the pure fact that a purchaser of this title cannot reasonably expect to play without fear of disruption is bad business
