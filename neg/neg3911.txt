2023 early access review edit since the numerous patches and updates have gone through things have gotten better however there are still a few bugs and errors during play1 tames do not stay situated in rafts and can move through walls during raft movement to the point they get left behind2 there are still periodic fatal error crashes during game play3 server ping is very high still causing significant lag 4 i am rather disappointed at the way in which official pve still operates players pillaring entire regions of the map still occurs without actually using those areas and there is no solution to this i personally believe pillaring should be classed as griefing when it gets to a point that others can no longer join the server and build in it to progress in the game out of fear those who would normally no pillar areas resort to doing it to combat those who do our of selfishness 5 getting stuck to tames walls rafts and other objects occur frequently it is good that i have not experienced meshing personally but renders the game as frustrating still due to the inability to move when under attack i cannot change my recommendation status yet until the game has a solid foundation of play through and a solution to the above that does not involve buying your own server when you mainly play on your own or in twos the ark survival ascended team surely bit off way more than they could chew when promising to deliver this remastered version issues identified so far 1 many players experiencing performance issues and crashes even when pc specifications are great 2 crashes result in deletion of progress in personal sessions to the point that most of the game play feels wasted a experienced entire base being deletedb experienced stats reverting back to previous sessionc engrams load in on a previous level or show minus points when leveling up3 the server volume is insignificant to cope with a very loyal niche fan base who have been forced to purchase the game twice because legacy servers have been wiped 4 high ping and latency means servers are unstable often resulting in disconnection followed by an inability to re enter the server due to the number of people trying to get in 5 i have a high end graphics card rtx 4090 and yet there are still unstable graphic elements even though for the most part the game looks pretty i noticed it mostly in water 6 the developers posted this game in early access because they knew the game was unstable and were forced to release it due to financial time constraints and legal terms this should be a huge red flag as far as game development is concerned especially given how many prime examples of over promising there are cyberpunks early release bugs is a great example 7 the developers appear to be enthused about delivering a great experience but it seems their attempts to retain loyalty stemmed from the feedback they had about ark 2 all in all the asa announcement was rushed overall this game is likely going to end up with a few additional problems in the future 1 when the bugs are finally addressed the price will likely go up to reflect the stability of the platform further alienating existing customers 2 as a result of point one those who are tempted to get a refund on this game and buy back in later when it is stable might be apprehensive creating a sense of resentment and feeling conned into keeping the game 3 we have already experienced the feeling of deception when the price was offered at 5 soon to go up to an astonishing 45 we know the developers needed the money to remaster the game but their research and development into ue5 and having plenty of practice and experience seemed to be lacking they would have been better off waiting until they had the expertise to execute a remake efficiently 4 because of this deception in point 3 i m left with the feeling that the promised dlc will end up at our expense too i doubt i am the only one who feels this way how can you guarantee the developers are loyal to their fans when there is already a pattern of changing plans and charging people please please please wildcard and snail games address the above issues and fast you have some serious work to do the end of 2024 before this game is truly ready is an insult you already released it
