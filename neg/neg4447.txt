2016 i ve spent 120 on beyond earth and civ 6 and that s enough i regret the time i had to put into this botched attempt at a civ game in order to come to this conclusion the first 100 or so turns seems cool but as you progress it becomes apparent that there wasn t a lot of thought put into making the game compelling but rather meeting deadlines it just doesn t seem like the developers put much pride into this beyond the shallow and cosmetic the mathematical underpinnings of the game are fundamentally flawed and it shows through painfully once a game gets going i got bored before way i won or lost every game because nothing seemed to matter i have 966 hours logged on civ 5 but i was bored with civ 6 in under 50 hours this game is a big step backward from civ 5 i m not into the mobile wow graphics like many others but further there s a real feeling of laziness behind the graphic assets there is no real variation between units or buildings of different cultures everything is uniform china looks just like mexico beyond the early game it s homogenous and that s disappointing for a game that costs 60 and supposedly celebrates all these various cultures and epochs there are mods made by hobbyists for civ 5 with more depth diversity it s just shallow and very low effort on the part of this supposed aaa studio they subtracted a ton from civ 5 for example my infantry went from musketeers in breastplates to ww2 troops to mech they removed the united nations and replaced it with a diplomatic system that is impossible everybody will hate you and if they don t it means they are about to declare war on you the elegant diplomatic solution that made civ 5 so interesting was just removed as if they had made a mistake with brave new world the diplomacy is brutal and stupid i do like some of the features like city districts and well i do like the districts the fog of war artwork they did is cool the ai is so bad it might as well be totally random which might actually be an improvement it is so disappointing to be anticipating a big battle only to have the enemy force disperse for no reason i m sitting here frustrated by an opposing army as if they were my own crew of ups there s no sense of accomplishment in defeating an enemy that defeats itself almost every ai algorithm in the game is straight up broken and that sucks when you put a bunch of effort into it for nothing i would say save your money and maybe buy it on sale but even then i d say save your time and invest it in a game of civ 4 or 5 this is the junkfood of civilization titles and i m really sad to have to write this negative review maybe it will mature with dlc but after a week i m playing civ 5 again to scratch my empire building itch i dunno maybe since civ has gone esportz i should play some multi player stuff before reaching a conclusion playing against the computer is just too dumb for this to be a pve game on par with its precessors
