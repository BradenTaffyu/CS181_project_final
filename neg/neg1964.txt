2023 russian cope and bias is real here the m1a2 abrams is a prime example the developers claim the m1 abrams armor wasn t upgraded on the m1a1 and m1a2 yet they added 15 tons to the weight as according to the specifications so y all added the weight but not the armor where do you think those 15 tons went they also claim there s no proof that the 5 prototype models with upgraded armor made it into production but yet they ve got gen 3 thermals on the russian tanks because they were tested once yet these definitely never made it to production ridiculous and blatant bias i hope the devs feel good about russia winning in war thunder because that s apparently the only place russia wins imaginary video game land i ll update this review if they ever get real about the equipment they claim to accurately and realistically portray
