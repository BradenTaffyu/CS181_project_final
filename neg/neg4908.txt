2019 i love the three kingdoms era of chinese history i ve played romance of the three kingdoms and dynasty warriors and i think that influenced my opinion of the game as a three kingdoms era game on its own it s decent it does a good job of showing the tumult and chaos of the era and giving you a chance to allow some of the minor lords a chance at glory it struggles with the fact that about half of the map is left barren which reeks of future dlc as a total war game it s a bit of a disappointment the factions are very samey with minor changes to each faction s gameplay unit variation is almost nonexistent and when you come up against even other historical titles the fact that you recruit practically the same units for every faction and i mean literally the same units makes playing a different lord feel not as exciting technology progression is done with reforms and can only be done every 5 turns for everyone which means nothing you do can help you get ahead technologically only the yellow turbans have the traditional tech tree and can actually gain a tech advantage over the rest of the world but then again the yellow turbans start the game pretty much at war with everyone the game talks about epic battles but if you fight single army against single army you re looking at 3 of 21 units being single unit generals the other 18 are not on an epicly large scale but really square up with the size of other total war games if you bring several armies to bear then the battles can get quite epic however this does not seem to happen frequently as the ai tends to send small raiding parties into your lands rather than full fledged armies or they cheat and somehow have 3 full armies with one farming province as their territory i also hate how the ai spams the forced march stance gets a huge movement bonus and when you go attack an army that somehow stays in range of your army they get another half screen of movement away engaging an army is literally one of the most difficult things to do in the game forced march stance needs penalties like the inability to retreat from engaged battles until the next turn this would cause the ai and players to use it more sparingly the diplomacy gets an upgrade with the ability to form friendships and even cause proxy wars amongst your fellow lords this can help you weaken a potential threat so you can walk in and mop up the pieces you can also form coalitions to help defend against a lord who s getting a little too mighty or who will help you forge your path to the throne the diplomacy can add variability and replayability in the game all of this is marred by the aforementioned sameness of the factions not much feels truly unique in this homogeneous world while beautifully detailed and immersive it lacks the pizzaz of titles like warhammer and rome if you re really into the three kingdoms era wait for the game to go on 50 sale at least before you buy you ll get a few playthroughs in before you realize you re essentially playing the same thing no matter who you choose to rise to the throne
