2018 screw this game i gave it a real chance there are some dumb things i absolutley hate it should be a game i really like but just infuriating overall 1 i am never at the top battle rating for the tanks i face i always keep 2 of my vehicles as reserve so 3 are battle tanks i actually use 1 of those is an aa vehicle which is a couple tiers back m16 br1 3 every new tank i get i move up i was fighting dicker max br4 7 with an m10 3 7 so i work my way up to a m18br 4 7 same br as dicker max only now tigers start appearing br 5 7 so i work my way up to m4a1 76 br 5 0 and now panther a br 6 0 starts showing up so i work my way to a jackson br 5 7 and tiger 2 br 6 3 shows up when the do i get to be at the top of the br i cant even pen most of the tanks i face 2 i make a real effort to learn what kills me and how to avoid it the next time and to replicate what others do i read how to use every tank and try to apply it other players seem to be able to do things with the same tank that are simply not feasible for me case and point as us i have m4a3e2 br4 7 facing another m4a3e2 both with our frontal armor facing eachother i cant find a single place to pen with the t45 shot which has the highest armor piercing value i am shotting at this guy every where try hitting the same spot 3 times no pen this whole time he is shooting at other tanks behind me i cant move forward due to tanks that would be at my flank the guy finally shoots at me 1 shots me just under the turret a spot i know i targeted a few times we have the same tank i should have the same ability as him but i dontand it isnt like this is a one time thing repeatedley i get killed by actions i try to repllicate and just cannot feasibly do because the game mechanics will not allow it i just want a fair shot the same action by me doesnt get the same result
