2022 early access review fun game but one of the worst update schedules i ve even seen for an early access game the expectations are set by the price not the size of the team they absolutely owe it to the players to invest in the team games like astroneer grounded craftopia and other similarly priced games have released so much content in the time since raft s last major update in two years all they can release is pretty walls and still call their game early access is a big dump on the players chapter 3 amendment tldr all the new content is on the islands thought this was a game about rafting plus the titanium grind is the worst way i ve seen collecting a material in a video game its long rng tedious and all for tiny amounts compared to what you need plus you ve basically completed the game at the point you get all titanium recipes need to see titanium gathering changed as well as preferred if chapter 3 included literally any new raft feature that isn t just an upgraded tool or component
