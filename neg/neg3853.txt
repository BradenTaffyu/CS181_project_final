2018 early access review it s hard to pick something as black and white as a yes or no review i picked no because i don t think the general customer would feel like this game is a good investment while the game itself is very enjoyable the promised continually evolving title is a flat out lie at the time of writing the last update was nearly a year ago with very little developer communication other than nebulous promises and vague descriptions of upcoming features the development team certainly works hard and i thank them for their continued work on the game but it is clear that the team also needs some stricter project management to illustrate this point tentative release date announced as being estimated in july unity engine updgrade announced tentative release date pushed to late july early august tentative release date pushed to unknown direct quote it will be done when it is done this seems to imply a couple problems one it is unwise to completely overhaul an engine after an announced feature freeze two the project cannot cope with deadlines three communication between the devs and the community is not open whatsoever as for the game itself it is a highly enjoyable rpg tower defense survival crafting game probably one of the best in the genre but i have seen too many games die due to infinite alpha syndrome and i fear this may be another if you re looking for a polished game this is not for you and potentially never will be if you re looking for the quintessential good alpha release this is not for you and without severe shifts in dev style never will be for the general public no i cannot recommend this game it is just too buggy with very little support for fans of alpha indie games no i cannot recommend this game it s an alpha with the release cycle and support of a full release for fans of survival crafting genre yes i can recommend this game just be aware that you should purchase the game with the assumption that it will never be updated again
