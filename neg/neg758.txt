2017 walking into this game i was expecting alot after playing fallout 3 and then new vegas and seeing the massivly fun gameplay that was skyrim keeping me busy for hours and hours on end i was really excited to see this game take off the new skyrim as it were i was disappointed the good better mechanics sprinting combat feels like a fluid fps visuals are stunning the character customization is wow the ghouls are so much more of a unique enemy by giving them zombie like physics it s an good game taken only from those aspects the bad uninspired the game starts out fun spoilers you re given your backstory and you re given a personality you can no longer choose to be good bad neutral totaldickhead you have one voice and four dialogue options that pretty much get you the same place charisma is the only skill that effects how you convince people and 90 of the time the skill is used to get an extra line of information that you could have lived without anyways dialogue and character development is complete ass all other npcs in the game are complete ass there s no feeling to the characters no emotion and it s largely dictated too many unkillable npcs the story isn t yours like it is in skyrim or fallout 3 or fallout new vegas the only positive thing i can say about the world is that it looks gorgeous the map design however is complete ass you re in downtown boston and there is a gang of raiders less than a block away from a gang of mutants are raiders and mutants friends now there is no way that this proximity makes any sense there aren t a lot of secrets there aren t a lot interesting side quests or factions the story is completely predictable and written in black and white and one of my biggest pet peeves about the bethesda games is the disappearing weapons when you unequip this time rather than the unequip going on your back it just vanishes just completely vanishes realism if anyone asks my if this game is worth aaa value they re getting a big fat nope from me i bought far harbor and it was just as uninspired no way in hell am i spending any more money on dlc for this game i finished a majority of far harbor in under 10 hours when it was supposed to be a 20 hour dlc i played through the story twice getting 2 different takes and honestly this game doesn t quite live up to its name
