2023 i m just leaving a negative review in the hopes that with enough people like me doing the same that the company takes the feedback that we are tired of paying increasingly ludicrous amounts of money for games that aren t finished we who are fed up with game company s releasing games with little to no substance or with major performance issues or bugs this practice needs to end we deserve to have the game that was promised and payed for on launch not 1 month down the track not 1 year down the track in regards to the game itself everyone has talked about poor performance so i wont rehash that too much but yes it is can be bad 5000 population which only takes like 1 hour to get a city to this level seems to start taking fps considering my fps on medium graphics which at 30 fps is playable enough on this type of game any loss is significant also game seems to have odd anti aliasing issue where the setting doesn t seem to change any thing thing still appear jagged regardless of setting used also seems like not a lot of effort went into textures game looks extremely downgraded compared to videos clips of the game from publisher we are not paying aud 129 95 for early access so why does the game release like it is still in beta also specs so you can see that this is not a game that my pc should be struggling with running at 3840x2160 medium i get 30 38fps with fsr also game only supports fsr1 0 so it looks like crap cpu amd 7900x3dgpu amd 7900xtxram 64gb ddr5 5600mhzhdd m 2 gen 5 ssd
