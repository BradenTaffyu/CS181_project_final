2022 as is typical for ea you pay quite a lot for a game filled to the brim with bugs and glitches it takes weeks or months for them to iron out the problems with one expansion pack which you pay for separately or an update and by the time that s resolved they re releasing something else that breaks the game the game is playable without mods but for any reasonable level of functionality and certainly to make it enjoyable to play for any period of time cc and mods are what make the game worthwhile but ea treats the content creators very poorly despite the hours of unpaid labor they re pouring into the game to make it a good experience for players and every update breaks most of the mods so every time there s an update you have to decide whether to wade through all the bugs and hope there s nothing that erases your legacy saves as happened to many people in the last update or to just not play for an undetermined period of time until most of it is fixed and the bugs go back to being quirky instead of game ending at the moment i decided to stop playing my regular saves due to the dangerous game breaking bugs and to create a new character unfortunately i was unable to get out of cas without restarting several times and now i can t even save the hours of work i put into creating the sim so my recommendation is to not even get started with the game and you won t feel any disappointment from the sunk investment fallacy
