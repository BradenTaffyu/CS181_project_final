2016 hearts of iron iv is broken plain and simple it s near impossible to review because the ai simply does not know how to play the game the simple basic task of researching along the tech tree and integrating new vehicles into its divisions is beyond it expect lots of infantry and light tanks and not much else the more complicated task of deciding which fronts to send units and in what quantity forget about it expect to see germany conquer france gift france away to italy and spain and then assign all of its divisions to watch the neutral soviet border and defend its african holdings as the allies retake all of france italy and germany s se european allies completely unopposed british conquering ports in northern germany to land troops in barely worth noticing when some patch of desert in africa needs men to stare into it from the border given this it s hard to even assess the other aspects of hearts of iron 4 ground combat seems to mostly work naval and air combat less so but if the ai can t even play the game little else matters the core game is actually very interesting the front system promises and mostly provides a convenient way to organize large quantities of men in a defense or assault when the ai isn t needlessly shuffling units back and fourth from territory to territory and front to front like it s worried that its men will become couch potatoes if they don t constantly march the equipment production system and division design systems are delightful if in a year or two the development team can teach the ai how to play the game this could be a very interesting product i m far more interested in it and it s future than paradox s other recent unfinished dud stellaris for now however give it a pass maybe in 2018 there will be something here worth giving a try
