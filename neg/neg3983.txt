2020 29 mar 2021many updates later physics has improved a bit on the limit of grip i still don t know whether i will spin pounding laps is still not fun network issues sudden lag spikes in network causes framerate to drop and ongoing sector times are lost this results in lap not being counted even if network improves to 100 before the end of lap lot of races i ve actually finished in position 2 5 6 etc but at the end result it shows i finished 2l behind or 1l behind wut thus time spent racing was null and void wasted if you race your laps don t count money and time wasted discouraged if you don t race again money is wasted because only way to redeem your subscription is to race 27 aug 2020tires grip was not felt can t push on the limit so not fun pounding laps some laps when pushing hard is slower than when not pushing sometimes vice versa wut i don t have unlimited source of money to keep goingneed servers in asia middle eastexperience was meh back to rfactor 2
