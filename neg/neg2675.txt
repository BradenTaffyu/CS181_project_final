2021 fun game i very much enjoy it it s great fun and there s plenty to do however without the dlc the game is rather short and doesn t have all too many options for unique play sessions all sessions end up very similar and despite the opposite civic trees like pacifist and militarist the games blend into each other and ends up being quite similar howeverwith the dlc the game is nearly infinitely replayable be a horrific alien race that wants to eat the galaxy alive or a rogue servitor species who because jimmy from programming decided to get some code wrong wants to destroy the universe or be a peaceful mushroom that works too wanna split planets in two sure devour stars causing god knows what yep cause an existential threat with some time bomb bullsh that too there s plenty to do with the dlc and makes every game enjoyable and unique however part 2each dlc does not provide all that much on its own and each dlc is 20 all of the dlc the game plus maybe a couple species story packs its near 150 that is incredibly absurd if each dlc was 10 and story packs 4 5 it might just be worth it but good god the insane prices for the game and dlc both make it very unreasonable in addition any new updates to the game are always paid for and are expansions there are no free major updates to this game anymore and if you want new content it will cost you i like this game a lot but i cannot recommend it due to the high prices of the dlc and the necessity for the dlc to make the game enjoyable update jan 2 2023 just making and edit here to tack on some things that i feel should be mentioned there is modding available from the game through the workshop and paradox s modding section but it is very limited features added or changed are very small like traits portraits or shipsets besides bastardizing the game and making it cursed mods don t add or change very much content there are a few like gigastructures and ethics and civics which can change the direction or content of the game fairly significantly but they are few and far between i should also note that dlc sharing is a thing only the host of the game needs to own the dlc for everyone to play it but empires made with the dlc will be unplayable in solo if you don t own said dlc which is to be expected typically one person buys the dlc for everyone and the cost per player of the dlc goes down by a large margin i still think the prices are too high and should only be purchased on sale for at least half off each dlc contains three main components and while each component is significant some parts fall short like nemesis spy overhaul or the syndicates from megacorp thus i won t recommend this game until the dlcs are at a more reasonable off sale price that better represents the content they contain
