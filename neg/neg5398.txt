i have played the coh franchise from start i have never seen this kind of imbalance in this game having played coh2 for more than 2k hours few weeks ago i have decided to give a chance to this game despite my biases i play axis and the experience in 4v4 games were horrible the allies blob both tanks and inf combined makes the game un playable and yet they receive additional buffs the early phase of the game at the start there is almost no counter to the dingo spam etc and their comparisons for axis is ridiculous the british mortar almost every time counters the germans with their superior ranges german mg is funny to watch at time as the allies infantry walk past by them the stupid allies blob like rangers having their bazookas and flamethrowers can literally destroy a axis bunker having faces to them and under fire and to come late game british tanks ridiculously heavy armored and destroys german i dont even want to mention the armored car or rad they just die to stupid boys rifles like they got no armor i dont even notice them in games because people dont use them allies having free recons and stupidly op flares makes your defense unavoidable stupidly op allies arty destroyed the only proper counter the heavy tanks as axis is panther and you have to get it via commander the multiplayer scene gets extremely unbearable for germans and you stil nerf the faction why dont we have proper tank destroyer like allies stupid marder dies in seconds where is all the german firepower the grenadiers are so bad that they cant even stand and fight on later stages of the game while allies basic rifle units can get all the upgrades in the game
