2023 i m sorry i can t in good faith recommend this game let me preface this by saying stellaris is a great game if it perhaps had a more in depth politics economy system it would literally be the perfect rts but no not for the outrageous price i have internally debated for a long time about the ethics of dlc policies but i ve come to the conclusion that i don t even need to debate it when it comes to paradox their dlc policy is outrageous simple as that they take stuff from the base game move it to a dlc and expand on it in the dlc which encourages you to buy it just to get the full experience 40 dollars is already exorbitant for something that amounts to a double a game to get even the dlc that would be considered the full ish game by most the community mind you it costs about 90 dollars all of the dlc costs about 200 dollars people have already given paradox for its poor business model so i m not going to rehash it but i would not support this even if i did i can t say the price i paid is worth the game i got even though i enjoyed it but hey if you re looking for a good sci fi rts and don t mind parting with 90 to 200 ish dollars all power to you props to andreas waldetoft for creating literally the best soundtrack any space opera has ever received tl dr compound dlc cost not worth it
