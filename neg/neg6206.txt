200 hours into a singleplayer coop power fantasy game they changed the entire game cause people had too much fun now you have to relearn the entire game i can t recommend a game to anyone if they will bait and switch it with another game 200 hours in don t worry though you can have 1 free respec of your entire team with 70 levels on each one to point out how they are developing it now they decided to nerf any characters that had greater than a 50 in a stat 50 if you made characters with a stat lower than 50 you got buffed and if your stat is above 50 you got nerfed they legit just did the equivalent of nerfing any d d character with 11 or higher in a stat how fun
