2023 original review i can t believe this game released in this condition after all the goodwill the community put into colossal order paradox this was a launch on the order of spore not sc2013 bad but not far off this game looks horrible in literally any mode and barely runs in their ama they said we just don t believe there would be a long term benefit in setting the target to 60fps what what world is this that d be ok if it didn t run like hot garbage on the recommended specs they should have delayed another 6 months but i doubt that would have fixed the broken unity engine 50 hour s in review while the bones of the game are fine possibly even great the presentation leaves much to desire no rural train stations only oversized ones by default no subway interchanges no elevated subways only at grade and below grade trying to real size scale objects has instead made them way too large broken traffic simulations means that the funnest part of this game so far is creating picturesque commuter suburbs with good transit linking i call this mode new jersey simulator 2k23 procedural objects and better ways to handle corners and 45 degree angled buildings should have been in the base game you re city is going to look half empty some 1980s bronx aesthetic if you will path finding ai can send cims walking do your train trucks like their gutter punks hitting a ridewhile it s getting better you d be better off coming back in a couple years ala cyberpunk 2077 update march 25th 2024 with their latest dlc they have shown their willing to go even lower not only is the dlc beyond poor quality a record low for them they have chosen to add foliage options to it exclusively by doing so they re locking some parts of the game behind a paywall for landscaping just as things were getting better they did this oh and paradox mods instantly broke in the world of hyper scalable cloud services i have no idea how they managed this this is even more sim city 2013 than sim city 2013 now
