2020 early access review i loved this game but recent changes to a i and damage have ruined the experience for me zombies now with 100 accuracy will ignore all traps and find a safe path directly to the supporting blocks in your base they will ignore doors spike traps guns blade traps everything the developer put in place to help you survive horde night and just go right for whatever will topple your structure regardless of how well its hidden surviving horde night now requires gimmic trick bases that abuse the phd zombie s ai to place them on infinite running loops allowing you to kill them from safety it used to be focused on survival gathering and building a strong defensible position now the winning play is to quickly gather materials to set up a horde trick base as soon as possible edit possibly the biggest gripe i have with the game is that the main programmer madmole states he doesnt actually play the game anymore but continues to make top level design choices that drastically effect the playability of the entire game if that isnt telling about how things have fallen from a16 i dont know what is edit for a19 so apparently the devs hated people trying to ourrun hordes so now they created a new mob that gains 400 movespeed to run you down if you are detected inside of a vehicle during a blood moon no more falling back to other locations but some good they have retooled skills and tools and have given many things some much needed graphical love and they have made several steps to bring home the horror element zombies stare straight at you in a very unsettling manner when they move about not to mention the crafting system has significantly deepened during this time but the game still feels like player vs developers as they just cant let people decide how they want to play you need to play exactly as the developers intended
