2018 honestly i ve been torn on whether to recommend stellaris for a while now i really loved the beginning of each game with the race customization sci fi references and early game quests that take you across the new galaxy there s a really fresh feeling of adventure as you first set out from your home system unfortunately the mid late game turns into a slow brutal grind while you fumble between war goals and waiting for the next exciting quest to begin most of my hours are from slogging to the end in an attempt to experience the late game threats two out the three i got were bugged ultimately i can t fully recommend this game because it has and will continue to change as the devs tweak the mechanics to suit their next dlc this game has been completely overhauled half a dozen times since i bought it and feels like a completely different game now
