2020 the design of this game is pulled in two direction on one hand it wants to be a lightly comical story generator as it says on the menu screen twists and turns watch your people be eaten by geese and fall in love on the other it wants to have relatively tight gameplay about logistics if your planting zones are too big you ve done messed up your optimization these two demands kind of conflict with each other after about 50 hours of play i never really encountered the content freedom that made my runs feel unique like a generated story there aren t 100 bizarre plot twists that occur like weird obelisks that mesmerize you or mysterious wanderers on the other hand the plot that does happen getting sick or a prisoner making a break for it sometimes seem silly for silly s sake and after enough time becomes subsumed to pretty regular gameplay often these happen as tick events as taming an animal takes x tries at y percent of success to reach z quantity not exactly a story generator worse is that the time scale is pretty unforgiving there is an element of haha can you believe my best colonist died because a cougar bit off his hand but then the hours and hours of progression is in danger the game seems to not want you to reload to let things play out but for me the game is paced a little too slowly and can go wrong so fast that it just seems a little off reloading isn t fun but then again neither is accidentally hitting someone with a grenade after 15 hours of hard work setting you back hours and hours another negative for me is that it s a bit too much of a sandbox for starting conditions ostensibly you re running a base of crashlanded strangers on a border planet but you always crash land with the same materials you get to pick exactly where you land you can re roll all your characters for hours if you want if you re psycho like me i tend to like beating official challenges and the freedom here lots of opportunity for meta play at the beginning i e rerolling restarting was not a plus for me and seemed to contradict the story generator sense i eventually installed the prepare carefully mod if you can re roll ad nauseum why not just spare yourself the time this mod lets you create a character within self imposed limits i e attributes worth 1 500 points total overall as my first foray into this kind of game it was accessible and engrossing for a while but 50 hours in i m starting to grow a bit critical and frustrated with the game that being said i ve picked this game up off and on for a while now so it s obviously hit me from an unexpected angle bottom line if you re trying to be careful with the games you spend time with so little life too many games i d consider being wary with it
