2020 early access review after playing this game for twenty five plus hours i can say that i had thoroughly enjoyed raft as a calming peaceful mix between subnautica and minecraft the building aspect and the music makes for a peaceful and relaxing survival game but there are three reasons i cannot recommend this game the first is the shark gets really annoying after awhile the only way to deal with the shark is to either build armor onto your raft to prevent him from tearing it to pieces which takes a lot of scrap and metal ore and or to kill the shark the shark bait is kinda worthless because the shark is never satiated and always comes back sooner than you expect the second is durability and food seems to drain really fast which can make exploring rough sometimes and for some of the higher end items it feels like they are inconsistent with how quick they break for what they cost the final reason is the most deflating if you play on normal or higher end difficulties when you die you lose your entire inventory permanently there is no means to be able to get it back which sucks and some deaths feel cheap for example the death that made me stop playing happened when i found one of the big islands for the first time i had just taken down a boar and was going to collect the meat when something hit me from behind i looked up and couldn t see anything i look around and couldn t see anything and then died i opened my inventory to see all my tools resources and food and water gone so i thought hey let me go back to where i died and get my toolbar back at least arrived at the spot only to find out that it doesn t drop only gets permanently deleted to put this into perspective every other survival game i ve played allows you to at least try and get your inventory back like 7 days to die subnautica starbound etc it was so deflating because of the amount of effort it takes to build some of these items that i promptly closed the game and haven t reopened it since on a side note if you play on easy mode then your inventory doesn t get deleted over all it just feels like its unbalanced on normal mode and there s no warning about it to the developers i want to reiterate i really enjoyed the game but i cannot emphasize how deflating it is to lose your entire inventory after 25 hours of solo play with no warning or way to get it back i think in normal mode it should drop so you have a chance to try and retrieve it as for the other things i mentioned i think a balance adjustment is in order like the headlamp could last longer or have an option to recharge or be fed batteries i also think the air tank and flippers could last longer as well for the resources they need to make or maybe bring the resource cost down or better yet a repair mechanic that allows you to repair these items with substantially fewer materials instead of having to re craft them every time
