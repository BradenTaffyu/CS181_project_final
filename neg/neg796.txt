2021 i ve tried to like this game so many times in so many different ways for so long it took me this long to come to terms with it but i strongly dislike fallout 4 it s aggressively boring and samey with little to no opportunity to roleplay or hardly any meaningful novel decisions if you want a game that s just about wandering around finding a location clearing of monsters and getting some loot sure you could do worse but if you want a story any story worth telling if you want to tell a story to yourself no this is very much the wrong game for that
