2018 i really like this game so it pains me to give it a negative review but since the inclusion of redshell spyware with the game i cannot reccommend this or any other total war game some may say it s is no big deal but the fact they implemented this with outgiving the community fair warning or the ability to opt out is underhanded and in some countries illegal as well we are told the red shell is an analytic tool but what is stopping them from using it to mine our computers and sell the data or as we are all to familiar with the possiblity of being hacked and the personal data being leaked it happened to sony yahoo even the u s government had this happen to them i will change this review if red shell is completely removed from all games but consumer trust is a hard thing to regain once lost sega and creative assembly i hope you see this other gamers as well i hope you see this the only way for developers and publishers to change is if we make them
