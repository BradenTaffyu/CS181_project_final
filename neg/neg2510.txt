2020 first playthrough of this game was awesome edge of chair stressful in a good way action after that first game it falls flat the idea of the game works out well the music and the mood is spot on after that first playthrough you can play endless mode or some other minor not very exciting scenarios feels like not enough content in the core game i have not played the expansions they dont look all that exciting and arent getting great reviews is this a game that can justify a season pass feels like it could be an amazing game if it had more and elaborate content with the core game and idea in place would it take that much more to make an amazing game out of it
