2021 early access review i think it is safe to say that after the amount of time i have put into this game i am now finally and completely done with it i love a challenge but i just think that too many things in this game is just downright unfair i had just spent god knows how long clearing an area of zombies where i am setting up a base a large part of the first day just to go within the same cell and loot all of the perishable food items from the local stores to come back to an equally large number of zombies right at my base location this was the final nail in the coffin for me but what had led up to this point is i am purely a permadeth player so when i die i never respawn and always start a new world entirely but what i had noticed while playing this way was in the last 15 20 games i played every single time without fail i would be bitten within the first 1 2 succesful zombie attacks every single time no cuts scratches or lacerations just bitten i even use the thick skin trait and still the same issue it is safe to say this is broken either the rng in this factor is just plain horrible or it is intended to be this way but alas for me this is a complete deal breaker and is the reason i have just uninstalled this and will most likely never play it again now normally i like to leave the comment section open for people to debate the issue but i am just really not interested in the elitists of this game saying it has never happened to me or git gud cringe or something of the like well it has happened to me and continues to happen consistently so i have experienced something that renders another persons opinion irrelevant which has resulted in me uninstalling not rage quitting and writing this review i will the devs credit though as the usual trope of people saying it is because of the engines limitations excuse that is used more times in discussion boards than somebody handing out sweets on halloween they do have a genuine reason to say this as it is clear the limits this engine has and they have done a great job of exploiting this flaw to their advantage but my issue clearly does not stem from this but the way some of the mechanics implemented are just plain unfair not difficult if the issues that i have stated are addressed and fixed i would give it another go but my experience from many other games in development i have been let down by i am not holding my breath
