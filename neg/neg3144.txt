2020 product received for free over 200 hours at the writing of this review so while no expert i d say i ve tasted a fair bit o the game classification team death match based arcade style drive and shoot with historic or historic design warships summary i really wanted to like this game with its silky smooth controls great graphics and historical feel it seemed like it would be a gem add on to that the fact it s free you d think it s a no brain er unfortunately the game is riddled with problems in much of its core game play loop general issues 1 non intuitive and non historical for the start wwii and later guns were fairly accurate gunnery because pretty much every ship in the game apparently has laser guided shells besides the german battleships you actually want to have your t crossed meaning your front is pointed at their side since that will allow you to do x3 damage most of the time due to the game s citadel system this leads to fights that favor long drawn out standoffs instead of a more engaging experience 2 ap big guns more damage the game really only allows 1 play style baring a few tricks this makes it so instead of every player having a fair chance big ships just bully little ships which in turn leads to a glut of battle ships and aircraft carriers in the match making and battles the big ships can only do damage if the little ships spot for them but the little ships get blasted if they get spotted this makes most people want to be the guns and not the spotters 3 auto pilot not a huge deal but if you can t program a ship to make a single turn around one island all by itself you may wish to brush up on your programming courses 4 so much grind if you aren t willing to shell out for the premium currency expect a very long grind to get to the better ships 5 higher tiers get worse as you progress through the game the problems get worse not better the game is actually at its very best in the tutorial portion and just goes downhill for the reasons listed above and below but the biggest offender is an increasing emphasis on high alpha damage specific issues to certain ships 1 because torpedoes have such extremely short ranges and airplanes make spotting destroyers very safe it s practically suicide to make a torpedo run as a destroyer 2 secondary guns on all ships are jokes pretty much worthless 3 both the defending against and playing as airplanes is very boring in addition airplanes primarily do damage over time and receive damage over time making for long boring fights 4 light cruisers get demolished because they have armor like destroyers almost but can get citadel ed like all the heavy ships unlike destroyers 5 every now and again they have specialty game modes that are actually more fun than the base game but only support them for limited times before moving on the halloween events alone are better than the rest of the game tl dr could be an amazing game but the lack of play style options and generally un fun core game play sink this game p s if you notice errors feel free to comment and i ll try to correct them i will also try to update this review if the game evolves in such a way as to change my opinion p p s see running commentary below if you want detailed reasons on individual points for my thoughts
