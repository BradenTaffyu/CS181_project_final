i wish i could give this game a maybe pros nailed the feel of the universe art and general look of the game is nice for a game in this genre soundtrack is great voice acting is decent with only a few meh bits the locations really feel like they are in the 40k universe and have a good grimdark vibe void combat can be fun especially when you get some of the better gear game really makes you feel the fantasy of being powerful in universe gives some nice attention to a lot of factions that get overshadowed in 40k in general sometimes cons combat drags and is unbalanced with weird swings in how easy and hard it is broken balance certain builds make the entire game trivial lots of bugs especially in the ui i often had things lingering on the screen especially grand tac zones getting stuck often times i would do a quest and the markers wouldn t disappear so the journal was a cluttered mess by the endgame navigation points suck and exploring the full map in your ship is a absolute slog and can tedious bugs in combat for example often times even when using a portrait to target things i would still miss or target different tiles camera would sometimes get stuck or in a bad spot leaving me blinded the last act was a slog of combat for not much payoff ending plot line felt lifted from the nightbringer ultramarine novel pretty quickly the interesting voice acted characters stop having any conversation beats no matter whats going on around them having to run back to a colony for a minor event was annoying and slowed the game down overall it was just ok if it didn t have the warhammer setting really nailed down i would most likely have not enjoyed it that much but being in one of my fav settings really helped out if you are a big warhammer fan go for otherwise give it a pass until a sale or it has gotten a lot of patches
