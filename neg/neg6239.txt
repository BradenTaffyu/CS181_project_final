i really liked balatro at first the game is exactly what it says on the tin it s a poker rogue lite based around collecting jokers with various interacting effects and enhancing your deck through adding removing altering and upgrading cards the game really hooks you with this from the get go building your suite of jokers is fun and managing your money and deck to create the highest combos you can can be satisfying especially with some of the weirder joker combos the ui sounds and art direction ramps it up from fun to surprisingly addictive animations are snappy sounds are crisp and fun and the ui is informative yet minimal in a positive way this combo of snappy presentation and quick resource management and synergy building really hooked me when i started playing but as my playtime grew and i climbed up the difficulty levels the ugly side of balatro began to show itself because the game is based around poker you re heavily at the mercy of rng from the very start the earliest blinds when you have nothing are just playing poker fishing around for high scoring hands just discarding and praying with a 52 cards or 40 with abandoned deck there isn t any real control you can exert from the get go and the control you do get is limited to what jokers and enhancements you have because jokers vouchers card upgrades consumables etc are all located in the shop the shop is the only meaningful avenue to take consistent action in balatro but there s more rng there too you don t control what shows up in the shop it could be crap jokers or early double tarot cards when you want any jokers at all or it could be game changing or game winning op jokers with only 2 slots for purchasable jokers and consumables in the shop at the start you only get a few opportunities to get your deck up and running and to get money to take advantage of those opportunities you need to beat blinds or skip blinds in a way that gets you that money which means early on lucking into good draws and good blind skip opportunities this early game misery only gets worse as the difficulty increases limiting your opportunities to make money and making it harder to survive if you get bad jokers early on even with the early game woes aside the game is just so rng heavy that meaningful skill expression barely exists all that matters is getting good jokers and guaranteeing powerful hands through deck alteration you re at the mercy of what shows up in the shop which you can only take advantage of with money which you get good amounts of from winning blinds in a the fewest hands which you can only get from the mercy of your deck drawing good for you or you can skip blinds when the skip gives you money but that s also luck the difficulty system in this game only makes this worse in an unfun way gradually cutting away resources one out of three blinds gives no innate money faster scaling point requirements less discards less hand size etc but let s say you love balatro and you power through how do you consistently beat these increasingly harsh odds what do you value and what do you do well since all you can really meaningfully do is shop at the store you look for three things chip generators mult multiplier for the chip value generators and mult multipliers you look for these three things every single run and as the stakes rise you increasingly look for early scaling versions of all of these what this means is that most runs turn into some variation of the same things beat or skip the early blinds with good value by drawing well or lucking into good blind skip rewards manage your money until you can luck into some scaling in the shop and or luck into some mult multers in the shop and just make sure you don t run into a boss blind effect that can kill your run how do you do that well there s a boss reroll voucher how does it show up in the shop at random my final few hours of balatro consisted of two things one getting really fun and powerful wacky combos that got obliterated by a boss blind debuff because it either killed my strategy or i uncontrollably drew poorly and i never saw the boss reroll voucher two winning because i lucked into godly jokers that fulfilled the above criteria or my wacky combo never got hard countered i watched some youtube videos of people playing the highest difficulty of this game and noticed that they tended to pick the same jokers pretty often and that often the only skill they expressed was judging odds to draw a hand from your remaining deck managing money and recognizing good jokers that s it that s all you really get to do in this game and i don t even think i consider two of those real skill as much as just things to consider for me to really recommend balatro as something more than a vampire survivors esque dopamine factory it needs to change in a major way there needs to be more for you to meaningfully do in a run besides fish for good jokers and count your dollars and the higher difficulties need to meaningfully spice up the formula instead of primarily just making your runs worse as of right now i can t recommend it unless you re content with a flashy well produced and addictive but ultimately shallow experience
