2023 tl dr exponentially increasing grind and costs year on year progression that s possible to go backwards with great participation premium account and paid boosters gaslighting and zero communication interest in critical issues by devs important game mechanics that have never worked and will never be fixed read on for more detail while war thunder is one of the more realistic combat sim games available it is unfortunately marred by a greedy studio rapidly getting more and more unplayable to both free and paying players where even players running premium and boosters come out from a high participation win with less currency than they went in with gaijin don t listen to their playerbase at all except when sufficient blowback from the playerbase occurs as it is now they have been steadily increasing the cost of playing over the years so much so that the majority of the playerbase only run 1 vehicle in a match and leave as running any more only increases the costs not the profits even when they listen it s reactionary and their responses and actions usually show little attention to the actual problem rather simple attempts to distract from it they recently pushed a major economy overhaul that would reduce costs on average unfortunately for them players whipped out the spreadsheets and quickly worked out that it would significantly increase costs and grind yet again the playerbase made their displeasure heard with public posts on multiple platforms well before the release of the update but gaijin we heard you entertainment didn t seem to hear them and went ahead with it the playerbase then made it even clearer with a wave of negative reviews and suddenly gaijin seemed to realise there was a problem and reverted the update however not before posting an article attempting to gaslight the community telling us we just don t understand their intentions or our own happiness when the fallout predictably got worse gaijin put out another attempt at gaslighting the playerbase claiming we don t understand how f2p games function with their attempt at educating us flying in direct contrast to doing it right f2p games such as warframe even using an xkcd comic to try and explain it s only a minority of the playerbase that don t understand and that the majority are fine with it the reviews and years of complaints from tens of thousands of players show otherwise their article also tries to play on players emotions about a hard done by multi billion dollar dev studio barely scraping by that needs this level of grind and gradual progression turned up so high that it s actually possible to go backwards in progression with amazing battles and publishing multiple games including mobile all with monetisation and grind turned up to the max and a cash only internal marketplace selling lootbox keys just to stay profitable their article however is written in a way that inadvertently comes across as poor management and greed they end with an attempt to educate the playerbase about review bombing and how they d prefer us to post feedback on reddit which they don t read the steam forums which they don t read or their forums which they don t read and bug reports negative feedback are ignored locked or outright banned claiming that negative reviewers are just out to hurt the game even threatening players with the false shutdown of the game to evoke emotions and directly stating they re not going to reduce their greed in response to negative reviews in a vain attempt to stop the flow they ve stuck their finger in a crack while the dam s already burst radical revolutionary changes in games that have been around for years are always very difficult to make there s nothing radical or revolutionary about consistently increasing costs and reducing income year on year while adding new cash purchases to partially combat them it s a standard and well documented aaa business model war thunder s entire income model depends on a few hooked sunk cost whales and drawing in new players that inject cash before realising what they re getting into to replace the daily exodus of players that have had enough negative reviews directly impacts that flow of unsuspecting new players and is the only thing gaijin cares about as in this case bad game studios publishers constantly try to discredit negative reviews as review bombing and make it seem like it s just a vocal minority trying to hurt them in actual fact it s usually a last ditch attempt at communication from a playerbase that knows what the game could be and all previous attempts at communication have been ignored misunderstood in a world of aaa publishers forums full of posts taking about exponentially increasing grind and poor communication tends to have minimal effect on their bottom line and are easily ignored 27 and dropping fast recent reviews however makes prospective new players click the back button that gets noticed if you re a prospective new player and managed to get this far know that the playerbase has had enough your only use to gaijin and the game is your wallet bots official and unofficial make up falling numbers social participation contributes nothing your purpose is to give them money play for a week month leave and make room for the next sucker that s the entire business model keep an eye on the game but just don t play until gaijin actually makes it playable again you ll have fun seeing tanks planes boats explode for a bit then realise just what you re in for all while giving gaijin the ammo they need to say they were right and not change for the better the usual and well documented pattern of behaviour for studios that stepped in the doodoo after the gaslighting step is deemed a failure is to put out the same or similar change couched in friendly terms then when that fails make some minor changes that are talked up in their news and by sponsored influencers hey we listened look at us doing stuff come back and play but don t actually change anything only after they re really hurting will they actually realise they made an oopsie and things get fixed whether that s before or after the game s a write off is up to them however it s a popular genre and others will always rise to fill the gaps as soon as the monopoly steps aside thanks for hanging on through this 100 true and 0 attempting to hurt the game review and have a good life 3
