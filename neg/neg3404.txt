so after over 400 hours and 50 hours since last update i m furious with this game i ve never seen so many different unrelated glitches in one game i never leave reviews but i had to get this off my chest the longer you play on the same map the more glitches appear which is so frustrating i spend hours and hours working on one single city and by the time i get to a population of 100k the entire city is so broken it becomes unplayable things that were working fine when i started a map start breaking the land itself starts glitching a wall of dirt will appear around your city the buildings wont level up the ocean level will magically jump 10 feet flooding anything close to the water when i say its a broken game i mean its broken
