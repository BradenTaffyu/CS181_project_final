2016 kinda boring lack of real choices hated the minute men quest line after so much anticipation and pre buying i expected something more on the lines of fallout cannon instead i got a skryim mod walking generator learned my lesson and will never pre buy a title again sorry fallout hopefully next time they will treat you with the rpg respect you deserve if it was only wasteland 2 and skyrim child then it would be a 10 10 so plastic so fake stick with fallout nv instead
