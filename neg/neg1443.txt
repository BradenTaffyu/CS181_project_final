2021 early access review i played warband for 7 years and was really looking forward to all the things bannerlord would add but i regret to inform anyone that you might as well get warband as it has just as much content and a better combat system the game has been out in early access after 8 years of development yet sieges are terrible no point in using siege towers they all just cram themselves up one ladder ai path finding is terrible they should of just copy and pasted the combat from warband as it is far better then bannerlords i have no idea how they managed to mess up something which had so much potential well i guess ill wait for 20 years until this is completed
