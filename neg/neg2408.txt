2022 tldr master duel is a fine yu gi oh simulator but i wish konami would finally implement a banlist of some sort to change up the meta limit problematic cards the game is very playable without spending money just don t expect to create too many decks while relying solely on free gems i wish there was an insta queue for unranked pvp instead of for only ranked games lately people have created bot accounts to either automatically play consistent ftk decks or to farm duel pass levels by not even playing the game edit 4 24 22 konami just announced first forbidden list update to launch 5 9 22 banlist update but block dragon and eva dodged a screenshot of yu gi oh master duel by 11 it only took 3 months to create a first banlist update and it s a good first step but seems to have missed the bigger problem meta cards genre yu gi oh trading card game simulator with unique forbidden list gameplay master duel simulates playing the yu gi oh card game digitally two players match up and enter a coin toss whoever gets heads chosen at random decides to go either first or second from there the gameplay is the usual yu gi oh standard of alternating turns drawing standby phases main phases battle phases end phases etc you can toggle options during duels for how often you get prompted to respond to an effect with a chain if that is bothering you aside from the duels themselves you obtain cards to create decks by either spending the game s currency gems for booster packs or by crafting cards using cp corresponding to the rarity of the card you want to make e g you must spend 30 ur craft points to create 1 ur card or 30 sr craft points to create 1 sr card gems are obtained by completing limited daily missions and unlimited missions permanent progress tracks or by participating in limited time festival events craft points are obtained by deconstructing non legacy pack cards weird dev decision or by making progress on a battle pass graphics performance master duel looks very clean and the various menus are presented to be easily readable e g click the graveyard to view all the cards in the graveyard in a vertical list on the right you can spend gems on buying cosmetics that change how your field looks or the card protectors your deck uses you can also view an ingame log through a button that documents every action being taken in a game historically and in real time story you can play through single player exhibitions that explain the lore behind certain archetypes of cards such as the lightsworn or the gladiator beast cards these begin with a small cutscene of lore continue into a practice session explaining the gimmick behind the archetype cards and then follow into duels against an ai deck to challenge you to use the archetype to win completion of these exhibition duels rewards you with currency to unlock more duels in single player sometimes gems and sometimes deck master decorations strengths game presentation is top notch and presented so that new players can understand the flow of a duel you can make several decks without spending any money just not all at once pvp ranked queue matches you instantaneously 90 of the time most boss monsters have cool summon artwork animations the real time duel log keeps track of the game history very nicely to inform you of every interaction since the start of the duel weaknesses konami isn t really communicating their roadmap for the game s future updates usually just drop out of the blue unannounced master duel s card pool is not fully up to date with the tcg ocg yet a banlist update is heavily needed as certain decks are just too consistent master duel is a best of 1 not a best of 3 there is no side decking you have to strictly build your deck to fully commit to either going first or going second there is no auto queue for unranked play the only option is to create join open lobbies and then wait for other players to enter and agree to duel master duel could use more ranks in the ladder platinum rank is filled with the tryhard meta decks with little variety few rogue decks so i have chosen to stay in gold for the past number of seasons edit 4 30 22 new diamond rank just added above platinum level of tryhardness this season to be determined there are many bots playing the game in the form of ftk decks or not playing the game just to farm progress on their duel pass it is very underwhelming when you want to just duel someone else and you run into several of these bots within a play session you can t break down legacy pack cards into crafting materials shop booster packs are only available for 24 hours at a time and you need to unlock its availability first i don t have a problem with the modern yu gi oh meta but i think it is objectively terrible you either go first and try to build an unstoppable board filled with negates to anything your opponent tries on their turn or you build to go second and watch your opponent spend 5 minutes no exaggeration comboing their cards into the unstoppable board and then proceed to use all your going second resources to solve the puzzle they set up making a going second deck is a commitment since master duel is only best of 1 and most players will opt to go first in order to go through their lengthy first turns hoping that the second turn player does not draw the out to their board as a result some people will simply close the game upon losing the coin flip and seeing that their opponent has chosen to go first since their deck probably isn t built to properly go second edit 4 27 22 update just got announced so coin flip abusers will receive a loss upon reloading the game chain link animations could be sped up pc crossplay with mobile is terrible apparently mobile players are constantly being disconnected and since they can connect to duel with pc players pc players have to suffer watching the opponent constantly disconnect with every game interaction slowing the game to an incredible halt every second limited time festival events are weird because even though they use unique banlists konami makes weird decisions to leave some annoying decks as the meta to play e g not playing synchro in a synchro only festival profile cosmetic customization could see more variety numeric score if you care 6 10konami please just curb the number of bots and change the banlist more often checkbox reviews are lazy copy paste bullsh t ascii art reviews tell you nothing let s be honest i only wrote this review for awards is a waste of everyone s time if you are interested in genuine detailed game reviews feel free to
