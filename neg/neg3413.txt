i bought this game shortly after launch despite its initial flaws i held out hope that the devs would provide patch updates that fixed the issues with game play now despite months since launch and several patches released the game remains virtually unplayable patches meant to fix the game bring about other larger issues somehow and it remains painfully obvious that the developers had no business releasing this game when they did cities skylines 1 became popular in no small part due to the flawed release of another city simulator and they apparently learned nothing from that situation i cannot recommend this game
