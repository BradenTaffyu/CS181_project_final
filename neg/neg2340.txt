2016 i ve been hyped for this game ever since ats was revealed it shows great potential and i m looking forward for the rest of the game to come out american truck simulator has two trucks two it s got two states 4 of all of the usa when euro truck simulator 2 came out it had way more cities and trucks from the get go it felt like a finished game that didn t need any improvement i paid 30 for ats and i m very underwhelmed with what i got american truck simulator feels like a demo it upsets me when i go to the map and see that i can only drive through nevada and california i ve heard that scs will be adding the remainder of the cities and trucks into the game but if they decide to charge money for those other states and vehicles i m done the other fourty eight states should have been released with the rest of the game to begin with they have plenty of time to do it right and i would ve patiently waited another 2 3 months for a full game to come out rather than a small portion of it don t get me wrong though i like how the game handles it runs smoothly and the scenery looks great there s more action in the backgrounds tumbleweeds cross the road jet fighters fly past you at breakneck speeds and helicopters patrol the area the game is fun but not that fun it s mediocre i got a taste of ats and now i want the rest i can t recomend it to anyone until the devs put the rest of america into american truck simulator
