2014 i came from this game as a sort of noob of the franchise when i say noob i played napoleon total war i thought it was good good ui a nice setting alot of units for the major factions so i was pretty eccited for rome 2 due to its trailers and its overall sense that ca was going to do something very good and groundbreaking a sequal to its most beloved game and that they woudl do a good job i was wrong i was very wrong while i did not play the original or medieval hense me saying that i am a sort of noob i could tell that this game sucked it s ui terrible its ai beyond bad its units unimaginative its so called new naval aspects was so porrly done that i barely used it a full naval squadron highly paid professional naval troops could be anihalted by a transport fleet of mobs the cities unimaginative the generals near useless the political system non sensecall the diplomacy confusing and entirely luck based at least for me yet the worst part for me was the units the units this hasn t been truly touched on by some reviewers at least to my knowledge the only factions that they put effort into was rome the selucids carthage maybe parthia and thats about it the barbarian factions the iceni arverni suebi were identical to every other faction they bordered even their high tier troops so that when you reach late game a random tribe that played no historical importance becomes ruler of germany gaul britania etc they didn t add arverni troops that dual wiedled battleaxes as badass as that would be or cool eastern parthian infantry like dismounted parthian cav or master swords men or anything that would make every faction interesting or balanced but that not a problem the ai s so dumb that in every one of my non rome playthoughs rome barely expanded past italy at all all in all this game is a poor exuse for a game a sad addition to a good franshice and a game that just made everyone who bought it regret it
