2017 if youve played other total wars you ll be dissapointed this game severly lacks content if your not willing to crack open your wallet again and again calling this a game is a joke without dlc this game is also a step back in terms of specific unit abilities like shield wall or formations while graphics are much better than other games it pisses me off every time i open this game to see how much of a cash grab it is it honestly feels like a free to play mobile app with all the little purchases it requires to have fun i expect pay to attack settlement in the next total war game
