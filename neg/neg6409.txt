2023 buy forza horizon 4 instead it s pretty much the same thing they really f ed up with this game and it s been nothing but disappointment technical issues glitches recycled content boring dlc and that stupid playlist model that locks you out of content if you don t play the game every week for christ s sake they even lock you out of songs to listen to while driving oh you like x song but you didn t play the game in a specific time period sucks to be you and on top of that they can t even deliver the dlc on time doesn t matter if an important chunk of the playerbase paid for it in advance when the game released stop giving playground games your money they don t care about you
