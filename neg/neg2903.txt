2018 i liked stellaris i really did it was the best sci fi 4x for solo roleplaying almost anything that you could imagine but v2 killed this game for me even in 1 x the greatest flaw in stellaris imho was it s slow pacing and now everything is just sluggish stellaris v2 brought tons of cool new features but you just can t get to them cause the game now makes you sit idle for 40 60 minutes doing nothing waiting for something to happen like building a station or getting fleet from a to b it was supposed to be a game ffs not a japaneese garden it is jist not fun anymore
