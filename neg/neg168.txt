2018 despite this being an incredible game i can t recommend it due to the terrible port and the fact that no patches are forthcoming to fix glaring issues after a year of the game being out if you want to play this play it on a console it s not a pc game and square enix probably won t ever make it into one the game won t play in my screen resolution every time i alt tab the game goes back into windowed mode and pops halfway off screen and has to be fixed the mouse cursor constantly appears in the top left of the screen when using controller and just snaps back there even if you drag it off screen game ui switches back and forward between keyboard and mouse prompts and controller prompts loads of other tiny issues like this that all add up to a frustrating experience most of them are fixed with an unofficial patch but honestly they really shouldn t have to be this is supposedly a game from a aaa studio
