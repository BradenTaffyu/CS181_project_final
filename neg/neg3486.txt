negative review until co remove the tile upkeep paying a maintenance cost for empty land is both not realistic and bad game design the tile upkeep is now higher than my public services challenge should come from road and service cost not from an artificial cost to own that land instead of forcing efficient road paterns or service placement it incentivise to play on a cramped lot let me use the map as i want and actual stuff cost money and no unlock all tiles doesnt solve the issue because it remove the challenge of the economy patch and disable achievement behind an unfunny challenge
