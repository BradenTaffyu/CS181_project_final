2017 this is my first ever product review and most likely my last the game is ok at best in its unmodded form this is where the problem starts so you download a bunch of mods over time and have your game the way you like it really enjoying playing it even then bethesda deciding they need paid mods again release an update that breaks a lot of your mods causing the game not to load crashing and breaking saves with a lot of time and effort in them so then you can t play until those mods get updated best case is they do eventually get updated worst case the modder has quit modding and they never get updated see the problem you pay for something then bethesda makes it unusable to you due to greed i have been a bethesda fan for a long time but after all this fiasco i m pretty sure i m done with them as a company as for steam removing the option to control our game updates thats just a bad business practice as far as customer service goes considering this and all the unfinished money grab pre access alpha that steam pushes and allows on their store i think i may be done with them also sticking to aaa publishers programs like ea ubi battlenet ect which is to bad i used to love bethesda games and i used to love steam as long as we keep giving them money nothing will change and most of us work to hard just to give them our hard earned money for the terrible service they provide us so the game fallout 4 its ok not great this all being said i cannot recommend this game or any other bethesda game to anyone
