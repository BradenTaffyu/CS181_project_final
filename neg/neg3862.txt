early access review for new players here is the gameplay you can expect log in get a janky tutorial hope you aren t in front of a zombie that automatically gets you as you run out of stamina trying to survive probably will be infected ah well find a house to move into for a time go find a trader start one of several amazing quest types fetch clear fetch and clear woohoo restore power dig up treasure canned food and junk all at the same pois over and over again get 5 tiers of this same quest then move onto another trader go back to up one step as they have the exact same quests find out the place you are living is a quest poi possibly destroy everything you have build a new base lose base to a bunch of demolishers spawning move underground deep underground have a zombie sense you at the very bottom at the bedrock and have the hoard dig down to your location and leave a 5 block tunnel hole that you need to dig out and replace all the blocks in that s it that s the content if the dev s spent even a minute fraction of the time making content as they have trying to ruin the players this would game would have a dozen dlcs and an 80 hour long campaign instead the devs do almost nothing no optimization no story no new characters no new interactions that are actually fun and instead make water harder increase cloth costs across the board by x10 and then don t touch cloth dropsd remove and break leveling and skills and make it rng based with non working if you spec for this book it will drop except it doesn t 90 of the time skill leveling breaking of vehicle nerfs changes to building etc the devs have spent 10 years trying to actively make the game worse for players this isn t even talking about their scummy behavior of stealing bits by hijacking and taking over another groups work on an overlay for streamers as a note people saying they are getting all the book drops are generally playing solo and taking every single book without looking but after months on a server we found that the specs did not matter at all and the books we got were random so i don t care about people saying otherwise as i can only deal with what myself and every person on the multiple servers experienced enjoy your single player world all in all you spend 20 hours and literally experience every single thing this game has to offer multiple times the only reason people have tons of hours is they are simply grinding and spending literal days digging up metal i was needing tens of thousands of resources just for bullets because of blood moon and the amount of zombies that spawn due to multiplayer or simply deleting things and starting over from zero time and again because they don t get bored of doing the exact same thing over and over and over again with zero variation if that s you go ahead and buy it when it s on sale for 6 usd if this isn t you just don t bother with this game these devs don t care you can check back in 40 years when it maybe hits beta
