2018 while i appreciate that other people might enjoy the game in its current state and with its current heading this review is my personal opinion as a fan of other paradox titles and in evaluation of its merit as a strategy game stellaris is incredibly shallow in its mechanics and gameplay options there may be a to new players overwhelming ammount of options and choices a player can make throughout their gameplay but unless you re playing to min max they will not have any significant distinguishing effect on campaign progress ultimatelly leading to repetitive gameplay different species and governments do not feel distinguished in any sense beyond appearance as apart from some very limited changes to diplomacy with species based on ethical alignment the players objectives will always be to a expand your empire and b expand your fleet the only real consistent strategic tactical aspect in the gameplay of stellaris lies in its ship design system which will revolve purely around building ships that counterplay those employed by the ai the choices that go into fortification deployment may at first seem like they would offer a significant strategic challenge or at the very least opportunity but with the games sporatic ai combat devolves into a game of whack a mole with brief intermissions to repair your fleets of course if you want to roleplay then this game might be for you but it does not offer much of a tactile experience in that regard considering a the lack of flavour events that you may have come to expect from similar games or if you want to play another linear 4x game in line with the likes of civ 6 then this game may be for you but at its current price point given that dlc is required for late game content and lack of strategic depth i would not recommend it as a strategic experience
