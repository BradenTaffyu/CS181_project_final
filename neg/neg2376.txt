2023 the game itself is great ubisoft connect is terriblethis is the first anno game i ve tried and it s a nice blend of city building and resource chains with a dash of competition and conflict thrown in the campaign has a decent story and does a great job walking a new player through a good portion of the base game progression when creating a game you have a lot of control over the aggressiveness of the ais dial it up if you want lots of competition or select easy opponents and disable the pirates if you just want to chill and build your islands the various gameplay dlc packs add a lot of new elements new regions resources buildings etc none of them feel essential to me but quite a few are nice to have and i can see how they would add a lot of variety in future replays these dlc packs are grouped in sets of three as season passes roughly speaking if you want two of the three then the corresponding season pass gives you the third pack for free similarly if you want three of the four season passes then you should consider buying the complete edition instead of the base game ubisoft connect is trash it needs to connect back to ubisoft servers before it will run the game which seems to fail about half the time even when it works perfectly it adds about 20 seconds to starting the game it adds no value that i can see i don t care about syncing my achievements or finding other players online and if i did then steam has already solved those problems in a much less intrusive manner why do publishers insist on putting obstacles between us and the games we want to play
