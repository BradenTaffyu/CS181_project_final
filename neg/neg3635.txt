2022 early access review i love this game but the direction of the game makes no sense to me each alpha is either the team updating the skill tree crafting system or updating older looking models don t get me wrong i like having updated models and graphics for the game but that shouldn t be a focal point of an update the biggest complaint that i think most people would agree with is the lack of actual content there isn t any end game content at all we have been promised bandits and other npcs and only now are we actually receiving what we have been asking for bandits were announced around alpha 2 afaik i hope that this game will eventually transition out of the alpha stage and into a release product so that the team can finally stop changing the entire skill tree and crafting system it gets old trying to re learn the game for the 6th time because someone on the team wanted to change the game again with that being said for the first 35 days or so the game is really fun especially when you consider the mods like darkness falls i do recommend that people try this game out but be wary of asking for new content
