2017 a typical wargaming game it has everything that made wot frustrating and some things are even worse in that regard the gameplay is fundamentally decent but the game ends up being more frustrating than fun due to the way it s monetized and and some of the design choices that went into it f2p players technically can get all advantages that paying players can other than some ships which are good for grinding credits and commander xp but practically the economy of the game will force you to grind credits in order to afford all consumables that give advantages expensive consumables are strict and significant upgrades from cheaper ones after you buy a new ship you have to play a gimped version of it against people who have it fully equipped for a decent amount of time before you can play a proper version of it needless to say there s an option to skip that with money there are frustrating amounts of rng when it comes to accuracy of guns the same perfectly aimed barrage can either oneshot the enemy ship or completely miss it depending on how lucky you are in the long run better players have better performance but this causes tons of frustration that s on top of all the natural luck that this game has since a lot of your success depends on accurately predicting both mechanical things like where the enemy ship will be in 15 seconds in order to fire guns at it or in 45 seconds to fire torpedoes as well as more high level things like which positions to take there is no skill based matchmaking plenty of matches are blowouts unless you have a highest tier ship you are going to play in matches with ships of higher tiers than yours which will just have strictly better specs than yours within the same class if you played wot before this all sounds familiar if you didn t just know what you are getting into i uninstalled it to preserve my sanity
