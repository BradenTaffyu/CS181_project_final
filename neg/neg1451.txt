2021 early access review i really like this game but can t recommend it until the ai during battles especially during sieges is just even a little better my biggest gripe one that almost makes me want to just quit completely during a siege when attacking your troops have a couple towers with three ladders each your troops will only use one ladder and even then only go up a hand full at a time which means they get immediately killed by the couple enemy troops waiting at the top the rest of your troops are just kinda jumbled at the bottom of the tower all trying to climb the one ladder even though there are two more right next to it i ve even tried to use my character to push them on to it but that doesn t work either i know its early access but it has been a year
