2022 hadn t played since 2010 but decided to give it a go again here s a list of issues i ve gone through in the last 3 days 1 all of my previous characters are just gone no big deal i wanted to play through all the content fresh anyway but still 2 bought 30 day subscription from steam would not activate had to contact swtor support and wait 2 days for this to get fixed 3 in the meantime i bought another 30 day sub direct from swtor it activated immediately but then i log in and am told to play any level 20 character i have to validate my email i downloaded the security key mobile app and made sure all of my account info on their website was proper but still have to do this even after support finally got around to adding the steam sub purchase to my account 4 input my email address in game to send the validation email wait hours and still no email 5 do some googling and see swtor forums and reddit threads about this exact issue no one ever receives the validation email from swtor 6 find a fix that says go change your primary email to a brand new email validate then log in to the game and type in that email once again to validate a second time 7 receive the email that says you have changed your email address but no validation email to validate and obviously no second email from in game 8 check the swtor website go to my account page email address is still the old one even though they confirmed that i had changed it checked to make sure my security key is still active and working it is 9 wait more hours still no validation emails hit reply to my support ticket over the steam purchase 10 still waiting more hours no support reply no validation emails still can t log in and play my new level 20 character it s like bioware ea doesn t want me to play their game doesn t want me to continue to spend money on their product s what i played of swtor up to level 20 was good and obviously i want to keep playing it but i m kind of over this nonsense and will not be subscribing purchasing any future game time nor any ea games something i ve avoided for the last 8 years already will maybe finish up my 60 days of game time since i paid for it and cannot receive a refund without an extreme amount of hassle but my gaming will always feel tainted and i absolutely won t continue once my subscription is up would not recommend even bothering with this game at all
