2022 early access review 7 days to devouri played this game nearly every alpha and had lots of fun with it keeping in mind that was early access and still is after several years of waiting and observing in which direction this game goes i think it is now time to write a review no more early access bonus after 8 years here are my main critics living off the land is now tedious this game is a caloric intake simulator just eating and eating all the freaking time i would like to concentrate on other aspects of the game sometimes too and why do you need 5 meat to get one grilled meat or 5 plants to get one seed if the developers do not want us to farm and despise the possibility to go vegetarian vegan simply remove farming hunting is much more efficient anyway water is still a big mess after 8 years of development swimming too especially when descending ascending no fluidity at all our vehicles just vanish sometimes using le to list entities in vincinity teleporting there helped us finding our bikes again first they were teleported into the lake then mine was 5 blocks beneath the surface always in vincinity though not very fond of the melee combat either no blocking just back tracking as it was at the beginning years ago no development here some functions are not available when the item is not in your inventory but in a container like modding this feels cumbersome and not intuitive always needing to invite your friends when they join your game is annoying especially when your friend s game crashes a lot shared quests vanish too resetting pois is one extreme break of immersion i understand that doing so makes it easy to just stick around and do quests but why not make zombie infestations and the zombies drop loot is it about resources which have to respawn additionally holes in the terrain appear quite often after resetting a poi for a quest there have been of course many greast improvements like electricity and world generation but if the developers don t start focusing on the problems written above i don t see any reason to play this game anymore changing systems back and forth is the main problem the developers have as they simply do not know what they want it seems ignoring the factor fun in the system gameplay and simply listening to the hardcore players from the forum this is what you get
