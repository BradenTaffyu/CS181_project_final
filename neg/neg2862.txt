2023 this is the second time that i have been mid game and had my strategy take major setbacks because the game creators decide to change things on live games instead of letting a functional game run its course and forcing the change on any new games i have really liked this game but i am seriously tired of this if you bought a house from someone you wouldn t appreciate them coming back a year later and remodeling your bathroom it s like they re doing this in the game it s a single player game leave me alone i don t want your forced update that will ruin any game i m partway through playing
