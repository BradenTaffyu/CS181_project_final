2022 bannerlord taleworlds didnt deliver on their promises there is no criminal enterprise no diplomacy the world feels empty the ai is pure and your settlement cant become anything but a settlement even though it was said that settlements would become castles and castles would become cities they have been lying to us since the start and it is now very obvious that they tricked us its just a dumbed down version of m b warband with less features if one were to buy the game i reckon waiting a year or two would be the best option because modders will by then have completed the game for taleworlds the full release of the game is sad and disappointing taleworlds employees should feel ashamed no one said stop at any point of the development just kept running like a hamster in a wheel and killed a franchise good job
