2023 can we please get more dlc s 40 bucks for a game that looks like an unfinished product without buying the dlc s the dlc s themselves consist of important features that would only make sense to include in the base game there s literally missing pictures and textures unless you buy the corresponding dlc some overkill mechanics that ruin gameplay in my opinion at least and overally make the base game look like a demo version you also can t achieve a big chunk of the achievements and it s super hard to get many others unless you have the dlc features and every youtube video regarding this game assumes you already have all the gawdamn dlc s cause they know it s unplayable without them paradox really knows how to split games into puzzle pieces and make you buy them all in order to enjoy them
