2018 a really fun and immersive hunting sim a few gripes really bad multiplayer connectivity there are a lot of bugs in multiplayer that people have experienced including myself for example my friend and i were not able to use the atvs in my multiplayer game without one of us randomly getting disconnected also originally my friend would see a huge flickering version of myself overprinted in the sky and across his view field when i was within like 100 m of him also it seems they are going the dlc route with this game so if you want more weapons it looks like you re going to be paying for them the original thehunter classic game had a lot more variety in weapons this game you are pretty limited especially starting out sadly for the reasons listed above i cannot recommend what could have been and still has the chance to be a great game in a very limited market
