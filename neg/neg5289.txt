2023 mtg is hands down one of the greatest card games ever created but it hasn t been doing so well lately i installed the steam version just long enough to give a review for those that happen to find this but i have probably around 1k hours in mtg arena played lifetime i had even more hours in magic online and a zillion times that irl haha regardless i ll stick to just talking about mtg arena since that is what i am reviewing here i ve been playing since beta and used to be a regular pt grinder while the glory days are long behind us mtg arena gives us a simple way to play from home or our mobile devices the smooth looking playing field and things all happen easily and automatically despite this i really can t recommend mtg arena as it s way too predatory expensive grindy and somewhat rigged i explain this towards the end unbelievably expensive if you aren t already a top tier player who has at least a few hours a day to grind out a draft or two assuming you even like drafting which luckily i do i can t imagine what a new player is expected to dole out to attempt to enjoy anything here without being slaughtered by those who play all day or spent thousands grinding out win quests takes forever for a menial gold reward modern crossover sets aren t as interesting as older sets that take place in the mtg universe a crutch and a constant cash grab are now a permanent part of the game not every cross over will be interesting or mesh at all with the previous one the game suffers from brutal power creep and the more modern value creep this is what basically killed standard getting a high rank just means you get a few extra free booster packs at the end of the month big whoop best of one is a lame way to play the game and basically overly rewards playing aggro and going first most formats are best of one no social engagement at all every opponent is just some random screen name with an avatar and a pet you ve seen 100 times where is the gathering part can t play any custom rule sets or any way you want for example once pauper is gone it s gone until they decide to bring it back now the final issue the rigged factor a lot of people complain by saying it s rigged but they never exactly explain how it s rigged it s mostly just people who recognize something is very off with mtg arena compared to magic online or irl magic this is interesting because the other online magic the gathering game doesn t have this issue magic online is very old and plays like old accounting software where the economy is ruined i mean run by bots don t play modo either it sucks in a whole other way although it is a zillion times less expensive the problem here is understanding how it s rigged and why this manifests itself in such a way to understand this we must understand how mtg arena works note every claim here is substantiated by wizards themselves via twitter etc you must understand how eomm match making works a 50 win loss ratio is scientifically proven to cause higher consistent player retention and therefore create more possible revenue also consider increased time played increases the sunken cost fallacy of time spent on the game which therefore causes players to stick to just the game they spent the most money on eomm basically works on the same principle that the near miss trick that carnival games use or those snip the wire or stack the blocks arcade type games near misses cause retention to try one more time since you were oh so close if you win a lot it will try to adjust your win rate by making you go second more often on my quest for rank 1 mythic when i finally achieved this i was going first around 36 of the time it tracks deck strength and tries to match you up against a deck of similar strength but this is very subjective and once you get bubbled as good against mono red you ll never play against that deck again you never want to get bubbled as bad against x since that s where you will get matched up with and you will need to adjust to cover your weakness the best decks therefore either have low apparent deck strength but high actual deck strength or are adaptable to various scenarios for example it doesn t consider your sideboard for upfront deck strength so wishing for cards in your sideboard gets around the deck based portion of the upfront deck strength calculation just keep in mind you will still get bubbled good against deck x if you beat the same deck over and over when playing draft make sure to also consider which cards the game considers high deck strength cards probably based on that cards win rate across all draft decks it s in so a somewhat powerful rare mythic creature that is splashable in your deck may not be worth taking since your deck strength will increase significantly which will in turn increase the average power level of decks you ll be matched up against and they will also likely have just as many rares or mythic rares as you do since you can t guarantee you will draw that card every game to combat this it often times makes it not worth it to take instead consider a common or uncommon that is also powerful but keeps your draft deck as low deck strength as possible you also have to consider how often other people draft a card and actually win with it there are a lot of undervalued rare mythic cards that are good but people never play them and don t actually win with them therefore they actually have low deck strength abusing this knowledge leads to much easier and consistent wins which leads me to my final section of this review now you know the rules and so do i how to use all this to your advantage make sure you build decks that go second well and mulligan well once you re deep in going second almost every game territory consistency becomes key if your opponent always goes first but has to mulligan it s no longer a default 60 40 in their favor for draft this means defensive cards for the early game and card draw becomes more valuable for the decks you play as well as cards that can turn around a game consider whether a card is worth taking not only for how good it is but consider how much it will increase your upfront deck strength value no reason to take a card that you ll draw a few games to be forced to play against better decks every game in constructed including certain hoser hate cards can altogether stop certain match ups from appearing this is insanely effective if they are main deck but you can be tricky and get them from outside the game wishes since the upfront deck strength does not see cards in your sideboard you can then alter your sideboard once those decks stop appearing and focus on the match ups you are now seeing keep track of which decks you play and what bubbles mtg arena has likely marked on those decks does your mono white deck stop mono red make sure to note it likely has good against red mono red decks meaning you can focus alterations to it towards other decks regardless of all this in best of one aggro is still king a smooth well balanced secretly low deck strength aggro deck will always come out a winner over every other deck archetype finally always remember skill still matters i can t tell you how many games people should have won but they just screw it all up and lose every draft of mtg arena i win at least one game where i should of been dead years ago but they just keep making mistakes until i win even in the higher ranks i hope this review was worth your time to read go on and adventure forth i recommend playing magic the gathering in real life with friends as that is the best way to play the game and feel free to play the format or way you want mtg arena will never fulfill any of that unfortunately mtg arena is essentially yawgmoth if the only thing he craved was the money in your wallet
