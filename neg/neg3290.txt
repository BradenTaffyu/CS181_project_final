2017 being a big fan of paradox grand strategy games in general and hoi since hearts of iron ii i bought this game plenty of expectations however i have to say that i ve been quite disappointed not only because it is compared to other games from paradox like europa universalies iv crusader kings ii or victoria ii much simpler but also because it is much more silly than the previous versions of the very hearts of iron i ve been playing thousands of hours to all paradox s games and hundreds of hours hearts of iron ii and iii over more than a decade hearts of iron iii was a great improvement over hoi2 when hoi4 was announced i really expected the next step in the same path of europa universalis being more complex and controlling more and more aspects of the management of a country with all their unseen interactions but sadly hearts of iron 4 has gone in the opposite direction of course i wouldn t expect to have religious burgers and nobility estates but i expected some more complexity in the overall game money is not existing economy in general is not existing politics is almost nonexistent technology is quite straight forward you have very little to do apart from driving your armies to the front as an example the game engine is made so simple and silly that they had to force spanish republic to be communist dictatorship what never happened just to allow the ai playing the ussr bring aid and volunteers to spain that s the level of silliness yes you may not care if you never play spain but that s gives you an idea on how much the game engine has been simplified i wouldn t be exaggerated if i say that it is basically a fancier version of civilization timeline events are non existing you have some goals that drive you through the game but it is light years away from the amazing and captivating complexity and replayability of europa universalis iv or even hearts of iron ii or iii to be honest if europa universalis iv was chess hearts of iron iv is tic tac toe some people would say that it is simpler to play easier to play that s true but if i wanted to play silly strategy i would play age of empires or civilization if i liked all paradox s games was particularly because of the challenge they implied to be learnt and mastered because every play was different than any other even choosing the same nation and i feel that hoi4 is deeply diminished in this aspect maybe paradox games has become a mainstream studios focused only in revenue and profit and the last game that was really worth it was europa universalis 4 if this is the way they re going to do victoria iii probably i won t fall in the trap of buying it and yes some may say that we should wait until all the money squeezing dlcs are released but then any buyer should wait until the game is complete and it can be purchased for an affordable price according to what it is let s stop this spree of releasing unfinished unbalanced games for the price of what used to be a complete game
