2018 i love this game but between all the bugs and the horribly unoptimized performance paradox really should have focused on fixing all of these issues first before they ever thought of releasing a single dlc considering how all the same issues are still persisting while their new dlc is on its way i am going to have to give a negative review for their obvious lack of respect for the gamer s experience and their unhealthy obsession with making more money through dlc they can earn their right to charge more for additional content once they fix all of the issues present with the base game first
