2020 this game is relaxing to play but what messes it up is that every house and pieces of furniture has issues i recommend this game if you can deal with the frustration there are so many bugs from the room layouts to registering different pieces of furniture to the categorizing in the catalog examples are room layouts you can place a sofa and a table as stated and it will not register as living room 6 to 22 as the measurements kid s rooms rarely ever register you can have a kitchen and a living room and it qualify but if combined they no longer count as a living room with kitchen registering furniture many pieces are listed as sofas but place as beds and turn the room to a bedroom coffee tables don t count as coffee tables and etc cataloging is so utterly annoying you aren t able to pull up all the things in a category with the search bar and things are scrambled you ll have some computers under home electronics but not others speakers under speakers and some not sinks don t even pull up all sink options over all the organization is a mess it definitely could be updated for easier and more practical use by the user the gardening as well is pain staking considering they make it near impossible to get even lines in turf etc and pain staking to place to gates not being properly alignable easily ya ll need to fix these issues seeing as everyone has had problems with them it s straight up lazy by the developers ya ll know there are issues and what they are but they d rather just advertise dlcs which i would purchase if ya ll would fix all the kinks to vr i d also buy if there wasn t so many kinks but nah they d rather settle for 20 and disgruntled players for 2 years apparently
