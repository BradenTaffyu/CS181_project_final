2017 270 75 that s how much it costs you to get all this game s dlc this would be fine if you could pay the game without dlc but you can t now to be fair some of that is just music packs and unit packs still doesnt justify the price of the other dlcsinstitutions better hope you bought common sense so you can develop your provinces don t worry devastation is a free mechanic prosperity isn t tough better pay upyou see that ages thing up there it s there to server as a trigger for some events we could hide it sure but we wanna remind you that you re missing out on this dlc where you can use the ages mechanic fullynation designer better buy rom otherwise you ll see invisible ruler traits that you can t useif you want naval missions a small interface change to make navies more manageable better pay up for mare nostrum and you seriously lock the diplomatic macrobuilder a basic interface change behind a dlc you really force players to pay for cossacks just so they can grant provinces they don t want to their vassals expansions alone cost 155 base game cost 40 and the oldest barebones outdated dlcs like conquest of paradise still cost full price also even if you do pay money for all these expansions you won t feel you got your value for the price you paid even art of war the best dlc in my opinion isn t worth 20 compare that to mare nostrum that also costs 20 and is barely worth 5 in short art of war common sense rights of man and mandate of heaven are mandatory dlcs that the game feels broken without consider the 40 an entry fee and you re already happy to tell players how you ve got another dlc coming up guess it s okay tough since it s just an expansion pack and will probably only cost 10 on the bright side tough atleast the game s not on ea levels of dlcyet consider buying this game only if it s on sale a k a when the next dlc drops they fix this godawful dlc policy
