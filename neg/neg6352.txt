2023 product received for free i m just surprised how it s more expensive than baldur s gate before the discount but so much lesser content and it gets so boring after a while like do i really wanna solve the same puzzle for the 50th time and make the same potion over and over again for no reason because the bosses and enemies are all the same the story is interesting but the characters are so bland i hope they ll compensate their players in the future lots of content was cut last minute hope maybe they ll put it back one day but for now i don t think i d be going back to fight the same mediocre enemies and puzzles if you want to experience the story just go watch youtube videos the endings are good or bad and has little impact on me
