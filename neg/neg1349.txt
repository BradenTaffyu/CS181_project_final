this game s combat is really fun but overall compared with warband bannerlord is just a disappointment for me it s really sad to see the amount of mechanics that warband had that were erased in bannerlord camps ships unique companions books etc to be fair the game has a lot of good aspects like gameplay items combat and sieges but it missed on history npcs possibilities non combat mechanics playing the game every npc has the same dialogues in every city it doesn t have memorable encounters no one with deep background just generic stuff if you want you can summarize the amount of npcs easily it s not a bad game it s just an opportunity of greatness missed
