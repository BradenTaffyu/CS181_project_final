2014 the worst game in the total war series gimmicky butchered in dlc uberpatched to death lacking any optimisation at all and with an angering stupid ai this game truly is the pinnacle of greediness as a diehard fan of history enthusiast of strategy games and longstanding follower of total war i can t help but feel frustrated with a game that had so much potential and raised so much hype total war rome ii is the very definition of disappointing it doesn t only invert the title from rome total war but the series overall as empire proved to be a hard buggy step rome ii is just pure misdirection maybe the first game the first rome wasn t historically accurate at all or had any nice animations but it was really enjoyable i would not recommend this game to anyone not even to fans and especially not to newcomers it is a complete catastrophe
