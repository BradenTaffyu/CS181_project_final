2020 tl dr what made me decide to not recommend btd6 is it s unbalanced state its grindy and near unachievable achievements and its microtransactions after playing for quite some time i have come to the decision not to recommend this game don t get me wrong i m not writing this negative review because i hate the entire game in fact a lot of it is quite charming and fun most of the time no i m writing it because there are some really shady and frustrating stuff going on in the background 1 the in game microtransactions yep that s right there are quite a bit of mictrotransactions in a simple tower defense game aimed primarily for younger people which you are quite often reminded of in game this is on top of the fact that you already have to purchase the game up front 2 the achievements are absolutely ridiculous if you re expecting to farm some achievements or to 100 this game you can just about forget it there are a lot of achievements for btd6 but most of them are just ridiculously grindy or near impossible to get 3 whenever there s a strategy going around on the internet that finally makes a higher level challenge do able without powers insta towers there s a good chance that it ll get nerfed some time in the future i ve searched for many guides and builds some from years ago others from just a few months ago but most of them just don t seem to work anymore so what i m left with now are a lot of advanced expert challenges that i just cannot complete anymore i ve replayed them so many times trying many different builds but nothing seems to work 4 perhaps most frustratingly is the matter of tower and enemy balance which could really be a lot better there are certain towers like the ninja and the alchemist which are clearly better than other towers they are often nothing less than must have s in your builds then there s also certain bloon types like camo leads and d d t s which are just so packed full of special properties that they become way too obnoxious and frustrating to deal with overall you just have to deal with too much of everything on a budget that s too small
