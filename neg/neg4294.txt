2017 a direct downgrade from civ v with a predatory dlc policy and inability to reliably use workshop content the goodciv vi s district system is in my opinion a great innovation in city management as it means that one city can t produce everything for the empire the fact that wonders now take up a tile slot adds to this and the result is that turtling isn t as effective a strategy anymore and one city can t house literally 90 of the world s wonders district management means planning is paramount the badthis game launched with few leaders some of whom were near reskins of existing ones firaxis has decided that it s okay to ship the same civ with a different leader which only changes one of the unique characteristics of a civ and call that differentiation the game is also unbalanced if you don t have dlc you will always square off against either sumeria or scythia in the late game because they are extremely powerful civs if you do have dlc you will face whatever civ is a dlc civ each game feels hardly different than any other because the civ variety is so low each game feels like you re fighting the same seven enemies with the same two always coming out on top the uglyciv vi employs a predatory system of dlc release dlc civs are objectively more powerful than base civs making civ vi essentially pay to win a single civ will cost you 5 since it comes bundled with a bunch of useless crap like scenario packs that you ll never play furthermore and this deserves its own paragraph sid meyer s civilization vi frequently encounters frustrating crashes with any form of workshop dlc including ui mods you ll notice that my profile has 99 hours of gameplay in civ vi at least 5 of that is just bug fixing here is a list of bugs i have had that is in no way complete but what i can remember off my head crashing from launch screen build culture bottom right button not working at all units not moving to the space i click on almost every single patch to this game will require you to not only disable but uninstall from the file folder every single piece of workshop dlc content you have ever downloaded and chances are you still won t be able to use dlc content even with a reinstallation unit icons not displayingand lastly the single most ugly thing about this entire game worse even than the frequent crashes predatory dlc policy and inability to use workshop content after an entire year and two major updates this game does not have production queues every single time you complete a production you need to do another it s incredibly micro intensive but wait i hear you say i can just get a ui mod from the workshop to fix that to which i say no you can t civ vi won t run workshop content without breaking instantly go buy civ v edit to those that are saying endless legend started the district system they didn t at least not as it s used here endless legend s districts allow the city to utilize all benefits of extra tiles or adjacencies there is nothing preventing you from building any building you want in any city in el civ s district system is innovative because it prohibits building certain buildings without the prerequisite district
