2021 omori is a mixed bag the art is amazing the music fits perfectly the cutscenes and horror elements are unsettling deeply evocative and strikingly memorable but the gameplay and pacing oh god the pacing it s awful i can see why omori has overwhelmingly good reviews the ending is amazing the real world section of the story is excellently executed extremely interesting and ends satisfyingly if most of the game was like the ending omori would be a slam dunk classic i was actually so hype finishing all the endings of both routes they re a lot predictable if you ve been reading horror games for a while but it s just presented so well i didn t care yet here i am not recommending the game because it s only the ending that s good the majority of the game is extremely boring the pacing is awful dream world sections feel dull and lifeless and they make up most of the playtime the beginning maybe 2 3rds of the game has actually nothing of value happen at all seriously i went back and thought about how much i could skip without missing anything and it s the majority of the game you can ignore almost all the npcs theres sidequests but they have almost no reward and have no real life to them i felt like it wasn t worth playing through hours of boring to get to an hour of hype the gameplay is boring you re going to spend a lot of time walking super slow through boring areas with dead useless npcs then fighting super slow battles the combat is uninteresting for the majority of the game you don t unlock interesting strategies other than sad stab omori until far later making every single fight until the endgame feel identical seriously almost every single fight is the same for bossfights where you might want to take an alternate strategy you don t have any indication coming into the battle so you re probably going to walk in with the wrong skills and it s just sad the last bossfights are actually fun but nothing groundbreaking the postgame bossfights are actually really good but you re basically going to need a guide to access them since they re so far away from everything else the puzzles are awful they feel like they re there just to waste your time i didn t feel special or get a a ha moment the entire game you get a walkthrough on how to solve the puzzle then you just go through the motions the horror is good the main story is good sadly the majority of the game is bland uninteresting unimportant and undeserving of your time if you want good psychological horror play some other game or watch a youtube video of someone playing the prologue then skip straight to the endings if you want a good rpg omori won t deliver
