2023 i ve been playing civilization since it first started i worked at software etc and purchased civilization on release in 91 have been chasing one more turn ever since and have every single civ game ever released including my original boxed civilization i believe civ as a series is the greatest game of all time no other game series has commanded more of my time none however civ vi is just not good there are myriad reasons but it just isn t too many bugs ai is god awful trying to find the right combination of dlc mods and what have you to get it working sort of is just too much quite simply this game just isn t very good
