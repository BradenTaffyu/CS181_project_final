2019 can we just all agree that this game starter to go in a downward spiral ever since 2 0 from a decent 4x game that actually felt like a good space empire simulator with a space warfare that actually felt like a space warfare now we ve got a very watered down eu4 wannabe with broken ai broken mechanics and uninteresting gameplay devs had been stripping us from many vital mechanics of this game that made it interesting in the first place in exchange we got stuff that only feels tedious boring and unbalanced the late game lag is still present and actually got worse now ancient bugs are still there and i don t feel it will change anytime soon
