2018 encountered a lot of cheaters invading ineffective anti cheat and twinkers exploiters galore sours the pvp experience since the only way to opt out of pvp is to play offline or unkindled you miss out on co op as well playing offline isn t so bad but you do feel you re missing out on a large portion of the game since all covenants are online based and such truly a shame because the game is great no idea if fromsoft is going to do anything about the cheating at this point addendum if you are only interested in sp and don t care about online features then the game is fine tldr for commenters with comprehension problems i like the game but cheaters ruin a fun portion of the game and fromsoft doesn t seem to be doing anything about it so this product gets a thumbs down for pc the end other than 1 or 2 constructive exchanges the comment section accumulated to much stupid ain t nobody got time for that
