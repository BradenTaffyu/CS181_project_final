2022 has a game breaking bug where you get a diplomacy offer that you can t close out of tried force closing and loading the save before it happened hoping it would resolve it but the same stupid offer came up that was bugged and i couldn t get it to close or go away effectively blocking any progress in being made do not buy until or if they ever fix that stupid bug hours wasted playing just for it to get stuck by itself
