2023 i want to say yes i really do but the community of people defending the abhorrent progression system need to have a lobotomy for some of the egregious choices the devs decided to do solid gunplay with modders making the aspects you want changed be as such stealth being leagues better than pd2 s overall the gameplay is great and i want more of it its the backend of it is what is mostly wrong with this game the servers being down constantly and the devs giving half hearted answers to not even slightly relevant questions about the game are always a great sign of things to come this is going to be one of those games you shelve for a long while cause the team that made this game managed to redo the mistakes of pd2 s launch and now want to retread that path all over againi also want to add for the knuckle draggers that want to say the progression is better with it being challenged based yes all your time is spent doing challenges to gain rank not your traditional system but an mmo mechanic that requires you to play certain ways to earn progression no its not slow but its not any faster than had it been a normal system that everyone is familiar with there is no incentive to play the game normally so now you have kill challenge farmers giving up on playing the game the amount of people on copium saying they played the game normally and still managed to have high ranks is appalling to say the least they are just liars trying to get in good with the devs
