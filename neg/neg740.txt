2016 seven years of developement right after fallout 3 and we get fallout 4 i say fallout in quotation marks because this is by far the worst fallout game the good gun combat is actually not a massive chore unlike how it was in fallout 3 and new vegas even though they had to have former bungie employees to do it guns finally work at least for video games like guns should work where if you and the enemy are standing still and you shoot them right between they re eyes it will actually hit them and not bounce off their forehead character customization and character models are much better in 4 than in 3 and new vegas npcs and the player s character dont look stone faced anymore settlement building is pretty cool you can basically take any item and scrap it to build your settlement you can also do the same with weapons it s pretty cool being able to make an op assault rifle from some random junk and that s where all the good things about fallout 4 end the bad the game is absolutely horrible in terms of being an rpg if anything it s a shooter with rpg elements skills are gone perks have also been butchered instead of skills you have perk trees in which everytime you level up you only get one perk point this can lead to a ton of grinding just about every perk is for either combat settlement building or crafting there no perks that effect dialogue either speaking of dialogue fallout 4 has the worst dialogue out of all of the fallout games every choice boils down to yes no yes sarcasm it s not even sarcasm just poor attempts at humor also yes being rude yes or asking for more information yes the only thing that effects speech in anyway is charisma and even that doesn t occur all that often in dialogue choices adding insult to injury bethesda didn t even bother getting good voice actors for your character let alone the majority of npcs throughout the game many of the characters speak either in monotone no emotion or overexaggeration the story is pretty bland they love to milk synths to death in almost every conversation everything also revolves around you trying to find your son there are no clever allegories or anything to the story it s unapolgetically obvious that it s heavily based off of us history on the east coast role playing is almost nonexistent you can t be evil at all continuing on from fallout 3 there is no faction reputation no one cares what you do to anyone only when picking a faction to join does the game actually care about your choice there s not more karma system no one cares if you do anything good or bad it s not like you won t be able to do certain quests because you did something to upset said faction it s only that you sided with a faction that another faction didn t like and now they re out to kill you graphics are still a joke as well there s still bad lighting bad textures you name it the patches either have done nothing or have caused more bugs a game with the graphical fidelity of a 2008 game shouldn t struggle to run on a gtx 960 even on the lowest settings the world is very big and there s a lot to explore yet it s all the same shoot the baddies loot the goods and that s it just like all of the quests i need you to shoot everyone and report back to me to shoot some more people no of course there s no other way are you kidding every major npc in the game the only memorable choice that you ll ever make in the game is the name of the faction that you sided with there s not more weapon degredation speaking of weapons there are almost no unique weapons whatsoever and the ones you do find are very bland at least todd howard managed to not lie about one feature of the game and it s that you can squeeze 400 hours out of it by doing radiant quests yippee yawn so fun to literally do the same thing over and over again for the same amount of caps and xp the endings are pathetic aw man bad things are happening it s reeaal bad i destroyed said faction but it s okay because war war never changes that s literally every single ending for every faction and every side quest nothing else that you do in the game matters other than which faction you blew up other thoughts recently bethesda managed to become even worse by reimplementing paid mods you know like the ones for skyrim s workshop that got a ton of backlash only this time they re calling it mini dlcs 30 can get you either ripoffs of mods on the creation club that you can get for free on nexus or it can get you fallout 4 at it s current price which would you pick if you realy want to support the modders just donate to them via paypal or patreon if they have one bethesda has yet to explain why that option isn t good those mini dlcs sure do look alot like the mods on nexus that have existed for a much longer time than creation club has maybe because they re complete ripoffs i have no doubt that bethesda will either get all of the cut or at least most of it instead of the modders still scratching my head wondering how this got game of the year edit well would you look at that bethesda does get all of the cut from the mods right after they pay the modders between 200 or 1 000
