2020 early access review mount and blade player since 2006 5000 hours on warband spent most on native but also in other modules huge fan of m b like most of you i see most people here giving good review but they only pointed negative things from me you will hear the real truth game is bad 10 years of development for nothing graphics for 2014 2016 game not 2020 and even high end pcs have issues with performance if you wish the game to perform well you should put graphics on low medium but even there some of you will still have problems i didnt play singleplayer yet only multiplayer but from what i hear not many changes in ai and quests game crashes often and things missing i tested custom battle with 1000 units in battle type and it was somehow playable but when i tried siege with 1000 units my player couldnt even move multiplayer is broken also only 3 game modes not even battle or duel few buggy maps that you will get bored soon crashes often matchmaking bad and when you coming close to combat the game lags 6v6 skirmish i even noticed more than 10 fps drop in 1 map and if you try siege in multiplayer even worse also javs and pilas are op and 1 hit kill even if you wear good armor or have a heavy armored horse javs pilas and arrows can hit through shield block i noticed that million times died and also killed many this way and 7 sword hits are not enough to kill a sergeant and many many more developers dont care to fix anything on multiplayer they only added some maps for team deathmatch lol only kids and bad players of warband napoleonic noobs and pw farmers mostly take this game seriously cause is soo noobfriendly are you serious tw 40 euros for this piece of i payed 40 cause i owned the previous title and now it costs 50 avoid it and dont read all good reviews from idiots please the game should be worth buying after 2 5 years of development and only if price will be max 10 euros
