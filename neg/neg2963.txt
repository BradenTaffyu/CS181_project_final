2018 hey paradox when i buy and play one of your games it s because i like it so it would be great if you stop changing it completely every three weeks if i m being honest i really liked this game when i first bought it i have almost all the expansions and i played it once every couple of days at least i m not saying all of the changes were bad i mean absolutely adored utopia i was a little annpyed by the starbases and limiting travel just to hyperlanes but you also added wormholes and gates which more than made up for it and i understood the rational for it but i logged on today after getting downloading the megacorp exspansion and you had completely changed every single administrative aspect of the game and my first thought was that it wouldn t be that hard to learn i mean they might change the layout a bit but surely core mechanics are the same they were not there are so many buttons that i just do not know what they do and i tried to find a tutorial online and the shortest one was an hour long and it barely scratced the surface your ui was simple and efficient and now i have a dozen different resources i m supposed to be managing at the same time and frankly it s just ridiculous
