2017 as a die hard fan of fallout 3 and fallout new vegas this game came as such a huge disappointment pro upgrading the game mechanics and overall graphic quality are great way less bugs to deal with looks greatcon storyline is not fun factions are absolutely lame minus synths both previous fallout games were much better in this regard settlement building is such a let down you can only change so much ex lots of buildings and items are uninteractable destroying ultimate creative freedom and placing items is the most annoying thing ever after shifting around a large object to make it fit took about five minutes just slightly inching it about in every direction it finally allows it to sit in the most awkward half on the ground half floating way imagine the sims but instead of feeling the joy of creating your own environments you just get frustrated and accidentally destroy half the objects you spend time looking for thanks to the awful storage and scrap confusing options i can t stress enough how much i feel like bethesda absolutely flopped this feature voice acting for the main character was just such a bad idea i used to love making a character with a certain personality in mind and playing through their actions to fit their personality ec psychopathic killer character who says insane things and generally unpredictably violent absolutely not a possiblility to enjoy that anymore they give you one set personality two voices chick or dude wow just wow my idea for improving the depth of the game would be to add a third option to just not do the voice acting and go for a third design where you can actually have freedom to say and do things accordingly to how you feel your character would actually act them out i could go on and on about my disappointments but if you care to hear one persons honest opinion get it on sale if you really want to play it absolutely not worth more than 30 on a good day also if you haven t played fallout 3 or new vegas try those first they may be a bit older and not look as sharp but mods can help that easily and your overall experience will be much more interesting
