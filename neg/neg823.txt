2016 bethesda made fallout 3 and fallout 4 so there s no point in my opinion comparing it to nv or fallout 2 fallout 3 had superior rpg elements to fallout 4 the characters the storyline the way things were handled in fallout 3 was far better than fallout 4 in fallout 3 i was immersed from start to finished i even played the whole game in thirdperson and it made me feel like i was there you talk to the people and see how they live it was obvious it was a post apocalyptic world you come across tough men thieves and people just going insane trying to escape the dark world they now live in your actions seemed much more serious the game didn t see it as a joke for blowing up megaton in fallout 4 it s a joke no i don t want my enemies to explode in caps thank you oh okay i just got out of the vault and suddenly i m wielding a minigun while wearing power armor trying to kill a deathclaw what the hell am i supposed to be intrigued by the action filled galore like many others have said fallout 4 is an action game with next to no rpg elements i don t even remember what sort of rpg elements are there oh maybe you can level up right that s role playing huh i enjoy it for what it is just another video game where you shoot for fun like cod but with more variation in weapons you will not be immersed you will only enjoy the shooting and you will always be reminded that you re just playing a silly video game
