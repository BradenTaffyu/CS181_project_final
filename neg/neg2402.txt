2023 i love playing yugiohi love the way master duel is designed visuallyi love the fact there s a solo mode so you don t have to duel playersi love that the solo mode starts with an in depth tutorial that taught even a complete newbie who hasn t even seen the anime how to play the game enough for them to make a functioning toon deck and start enjoying the card game i m so passionate about but unfortunately it s designed that you should duel players that s what yugioh is for and that s really the only way to get more stuff anyway and it shouldn t be a problem in a well designed online card game with skill based match makingbut god i just want to rip my hair out every single time i play this game 224 hours in and i think i ve lost more hairs to pulling them out in frustration than i have to accidentally getting my hair caught in a blender in fact the feeling of having your hair put into a blender is more enjoyable than this the biggest issue the ranking system is pointless there s 6 rankings beginner bronze silver gold platinum diamond and master and of those once you start really playing there s only 3 platinum diamond and master because you can t drop below platinum so there s physically no point to the others i play decks that i find fun decks that aren t necessarily meta because this is an easily accessible game and if you ignore the micro transactions you can get decks you want to play in a day or two of playing early on but over a week or so once you get past the early stages where they give you gems like halloween candy but with the way the ranking system works i should be down in bronze or silver but i m up in diamond i m fighting the same floodgates spright tearlaments synchro negate spams mass interaction and ftks that everyone is fighting but because i m using a deck i enjoy rather than a deck that s meant to counter the meta or is the meta i m losing 80 ish of my games and several of those wins are my opponent losing connection or misplaying before i ve had a turn and then surrendering or just doing it because their hand wasn t good enough i m not fighting the decks more my level i m david fighting goliath and i have to hard draw into my sling or i just get ass blasted like my opponent has some deep seeded rage against someone trying to have fun or get lucky and hope that goliath just walks away and goes home the banlist is also very problematic and constantly is too one deck doing too good for a month fine we ll hit like two cards and then release a new deck which causes even more problems and not get around to fixing it until two months later when everyone has spent money to get the deck in order to have a chance to compete tearlaments are a perfect example of this practically unlimited full power tearlaments for nearly 3 months all the tear cards all the ishizu s all at 3 if you wanted to stand a lick of a chance you either hard drew dimension shifter in your opening hand or hoped they drew 3 crymes and 2 sulieks it was practically impossible to beat with anything other than a lucky opening hand or a better opening hand going first in a mirror match and once konami was absolutely certain everyone was tired of tearlaments and or had paid top dollar to get a full functioning tearlaments deck they hit them with a ton of limits so you had to dismantle all those extra copies of cards you got with no benefits and sure they re still seeing top competitive play because they hit a lot of cards buuut they didn t hit enough kitkalos is still around all of the ishizu s but one are at one and the one that isn t is the strongest one at 2 etc etc but they aren t the only problematic cards in need of bans or having had too much time unbannedmaxx c is at 3it took them far too long to ban cyber stein who was a consistent ftk enabler though all that time and other problem cards like sales ban rhongominiad are also everywhere up in higher tiers because they thought it was a good idea to ban the enabler and not the problem when nobody wants to use the problem but many people would like to use the enabler for other things sure it s a double standard ban cyber stein the enabler but don t ban gossip shadow the enabler but when you look at it case by case which konami should be it s pretty clear why maxx c is at 3there are tons of decks that can still semi consistently pull of ftks and even a 50 chance to win the game with no way your opponent can stop it is stupid because if you flip a coin 100 times gaining two points for each heads and losing one point for each tails is still a profitable chance and if you surrender your rank doesn t go down meaning these ftk decks just flip that coin until they get heads and leave every time they don t like it never happened maxx c is at 3something desperately needs to be done about the ranking system and make a better way to punish and reward players if a player surrenders make them lose points if they surrender too many duels in a short time span punish them with a time out make it so when you go up a rank you can still fall back down to the rank below it so you don t end up in platinum on a fluke and win one of every 20 games while permanently stuck there not getting the chance to do dailies because you just end up dying before you get a chance to play ban cards that only see play in decks that are designed to lose the game so they can drop ranks just do something because all they ve done is add a new rank because players were complaining that the ranks didn t go high enough and then limit the ranks you can drop to by another one effectively making the whole thing redundant there s still 3 ranks all you ve done is make more room for players who play the game twice a month to not end up with all of the tryhard sweats that make the game unfun yes a lot of this is me complaining about me not playing the better decks and saying the meta is op i get it it looks like a git gud able moment or a skill issue but that s just part of it i shouldn t have to ignore 95 of the cards in the whole game to be able to play it and enjoy it i shouldn t have to sit through turns that take 10 minutes of summoning connection delay summoning connection delay summoning connection delay just to start my turn draw a card that doesn t help me and then surrender wasting all that time this is supposed to be fun i want to play a deck i want to play say some goofy ah summoning chants to myself whenever i bring out my boss monster and win lose games 50 50 with people around my deck s strength level until these issues are fixed i think it s safe to say the 224 hours i ve spent playing this game have been completely worthless unless you re a hyper competitive yugioh player who doesn t have the money for irl decks or a complete beginner who s only here for the tutorials this game is a complete waste of time and brain cells if you re going to play master duel just know you re not in for a fun time unless you re willing to constantly keep up with the meta abandoning what s fun to play what s good and hey if that s how you enjoy your time using the best possible set ups to ruin others days i say go for it but please please don t drop ranks to screw over people trying to have fun with your meta master duel is the ideal game for beginners and casuals alike cool animations semi auto functions and understanding of problem solving card text that makes things function as intended and the only way it can be kept like that is if people stop ruining the game for others i really want to keep going cause there s so much more i want to address but my head hurts already tl dr master duel isn t worth your time unless you re playing it for the tutorials or are playing hyper competitive the game could be made better but as it stands it s not worth the time or space
