this is my first ever review for a game and not surprisingly it has to be 2k i would highly recommend you buy this game on sale this is not a 70 game it is at least 30 at best as of right now the shooting is horrific i have spent hours toying with different releases cues animations speeds and nothing ever changes the only difference that actually works is playing on rookie or semi pro mode this goes for both mycareer and myteam shot meters for shots near the post and some layups will not work or be bugged totally throughout your matches the delay for animations such as rebounds and steals is so delayed that it is not practical trying them in game getting caught on players whether on defense or offense is so bad that you have no choice but to play off the opponent as much as you can the ai opponents in myteam have some of the worst advantages i have ever come across in 2k the amount of layups and shots they make when you are actually playing good defense yet the coverage feedback says they were open is nefarious to say the least it is so difficult to be rewarded for playing great ball in this game for reasons i have no idea about pick and rolls are at the best 40 effective teammates never really roll to the basket or fade off of a screen they commit about half way and will either roll off of a fade or fade slightly off of a roll also the cut to basket input is awful unlike previous 2ks i remember distinctively holding down y and your teammate will make a 100 full commitment to cutting to the basket in this game it is not feasible at all which sucks the amount of issues with this game out weigh the purchase price value of the game in total wait until is goes on sale you are not missing out on anything i know the game recently just released but they do this every year it seems i took a chance this year on the game after missing the last 3 years but unless this game receives some major patches and fixes this will be my last 2k purchase
