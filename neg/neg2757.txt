2017 this is one of those games that you fall in love with from the start only to get frustrated and disappointed later and i can pick 2 major problems in this game ai and ui ui in this game might seem fine from the start but with the game going you will get more and more problems want to build a fleet on 20 planets you have to go to each one of them from the map and click every single ship on every single planet no list of all your planets or shipyards no templates for building or fleet no templates for anything hey but 20 planets are not so bad you will say yes 20 is more or less managable what about 100 what about 200 for a super long game oh and let me point out that you have resource storage of the exact same volume both for 10 planet and 100 planet empire why who knows but if you thought ui is bad behold the ai this joke of intelligence does not develop economy does not implement any tactic he may even just ignore you capturing his planets while chilling out on the next planet and as a fix for it to pose any thread ai cheats the last game i played i had about 90 of 600 planet galaxy maxed fleet for my limits ai depite having pathetic limits compared to mine had 2 times the fleet i had and in this game you have upkeep and the more you go over it the more you pay after trying to figure out how much he has to pay in maintance i was pretty shocked to get a number that is bigger than income of the whole universe we were playing in and here is a cherry on your pie you are forced to give your planets to governor ai as stupid as usual yet in this case he does not cheat i have been waiting for ai patches since 1 0 devs announced 1 9 and no sign of ai improvement if you plan to take this game prepare for some heavy modding to have at least some fun from this stupidity
