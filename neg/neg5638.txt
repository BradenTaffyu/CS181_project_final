2018 i have to give a major negative review for ca s response to this while i do like women in my games and don t mind that so much the sheer gall of ca rep ella telling people you have to accept this or don t play mod it out echoes the arrogance that ea did with battlefield 5 my biggest hit against this game is in response to ca s tone deaf response to the community they could have easily made this a free lc or dlc content with the option to turn it off and on instead of forcing this revisitionist history on people who own an old game if this was a game i didn t own i could easily vote with my wallet but being that i already bought this on release this is literally like a bait and switch tactic that i would demand a refund for if i could and considering the game still has bugs and problems that haven t been addressed since release and that they spent their time and effort adding women to the game in a non historical way this game gets two thumbs down and i recommend no one else support such stupid activist like decisions they are a company that makes an entertainment product first and foremost i get a historical game to play history not to have sjw crap or female cyborgs or african american samurai during the days of the roman republic that is what is called authentic
