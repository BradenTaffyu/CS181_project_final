2020 i decided to give it a try again before the release of la resistance it isn t that it s a bad game it s just that it s an over complicated and flawed game made worse by paradox s obsession with dlc they don t fix they add and this game desperately needs some fixes the focus trees are interesting especially the alt history stuff but they don t update them why is portugal getting a new tree when the soviet union s and italy s still suck the tech tree is fake choice and far too simple boring the economy is boring i build civilian factories until i start building military factories woo so much excitement the information presented to you is overly complicated and largely meaningless i guess the meta is 20 width divisions so there goes most choice not to mention that you can t really change things until you re in a war to earn much experience and by then you re probably not messing with templates i have no context for what half the stats that change on a template are or why they matter or if they matter i can bump up this or that on a specific piece of equipment but with no meaningful feedback i have no idea if agility on a fighter or reliability on a tank matter at all air control seems all or nothing and i have never found anywhere that tells me how much the equipment i use in a division matters in a strategy game the entire game seems to be built around the idea of removing control from the player air war click a zone click a mission naval war click a zone click a mission ground war draw a line draw another line click a button if the strategy element of a strategy game is too complicated to be managed by the player the solution is not to take away the ability to control it at that point why am i playing to manage the joke of an economy the diplomacy that is pointless the politics which don t matter the front line ai is horrid if you re going to take away my control do it right why are a quarter of my divisions constantly rearranging themselves around an encirclement instead of wiping out said encirclement why do i have to stop repeatedly to redraw lines because they have become a jumbled mess why do entire armies suddenly lose their front line even though they have an offensive line why are my defensive units constantly rearranging themselves and losing entrenchment instead of you know defending i can micromanage to do breakthroughs and encirclements and what not but it just becomes frustrating to fight against the ai to do so the peace deals suck why does casualties seem to be the primary factor for warscore why in a war i declared in a country i conquered alone in a country i occupied is the country being puppeted by someone else just because the war got rolled into another one just because nationalist spain lost hundred of thousands of troops invading canada does not mean they should be able to puppet belgium why can a country recreate austria which willingly joined germany out of northern italy why can the soviet union which didn t do anything in europe except get defeated by turkey in georgia create an italian puppet state why would germany let an enemy both sides have war goals on the other and they are only in the same war because a bunch of nations siding with italy create puppet states out of their occupied territory it offends me on a logic level and it frustrates me on a border gore one i want to enjoy the game i really do and i keep on trying to play it because somewhere deep down there is a good game but at this point i don t think paradox is going to elevate it above a mediocre one they don t want to fix things the front lines are just as frustrating as the last time i played the naval system seems worse since i last played it the only improvement is the new alt history focuses
