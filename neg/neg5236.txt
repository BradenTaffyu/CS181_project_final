2019 mere shadow of what total war games used to be fantasy warhammer universe lords battles are a bit too fast hp pool of units just seems stupid no away to adjust taxes at all agents spam too many dlcs very few playable factions and even less in base game without any dlcs armies must be under command of a lord and you are also being penalised for having more than a handful of armies very annoying if you play as the empire you just have to leave your lands exposed at some point and you will get raped by hordes sooner or later blood and gore dlcmany of these problems can be somewhat fixed with mods but i m reviewing the game that s being sold still for 60 after 3 years overall don t buy it unless you can get goty edition with all the dlc around 30 40 or you are diehard warhammer fan
