early access review after 12 years animations are still horrible after 12 years crafting has gone back and forth so many times i lost count of how many iterations it has gone through after 12 years there are still no bandits in sight after years of promising to implement them into the game after 12 years performance is still bad even on brand spankin new computers that can run far more complex games after 12 years there s still no story after years of promises after 12 years it s still in alpha after release it ll still be in alpha claiming that this game is the crown jewel of survival games like they do in the video clearly reading from a teleprompter is just plain wrong it s just not that s what the white knights are saying because that s what you want to hear not the majority of people who ve been following since 2012 i haven t heard that term being used by anyone but the white knights who ve been continuously defending this game for years harassing anyone who dare criticize the devs even if it s actual feedback on things they don t like or thins they want to be changed for the better other games much larger in scope that have spent less time in development with smaller teams have proven tfp wrong time and time again with the already slow update process i m thinking we ll have to wait another 5 10 years for the game to be feature complete if it ll ever even reach that state i m doubtful that it will leaving early access after spending 12 years promising and never delivering on anything major with more promises for content updates they promised years ago which they still haven t delivered on is just mind boggling going from alpha straight to release with all of the above in mind is just a massive red flag to me as someone who s worked for 20 years as a game tester i definitely do not recommend this game as it will most likely never be feature complete
