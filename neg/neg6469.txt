2020 love the dark souls series love this game lots of great challenges loads of good lore lots of good times on multiplayer why am i leaving a negative review hackers have ruined the online experience and for me online play is a huge appeal in these games but after years of playing and over 100 hours logged a single hacker throwing hacked items into my inventory has banned me from online play nevermind the fact that i hit alt f4 immediately after i saw this happening nevermind the fact that i loaded a backup save from before i even encountered the hacker no bandai doesn t give a a hacked item touched my account for 1 second now i m deemed a turbo hacker in bandai s eyes and i can t play with my friends which is why i came back to this game in the first place i will change my review if and when bandai decides to not punish players who make active strides to circumvent the efforts of hackers and want to play the game legitimately
