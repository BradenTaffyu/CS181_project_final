2023 i ve finally hit milestone 20 in a city so i can give a review of the full gameplay experience in its current state i cannot recommend playing c s2 over continuing to play c s with mods the game s got a lot going for it and is certainly a worthwhile standalone product it fundamentally stays true to the vision and gameplay of the first game but with many of the mechanics having been overhauled or reworked in a novel way i love the freight cargo lines and road tools which offer much more precise control over how cargo and traffic flow through my network i love the milestone progression system because of the agency it gives me in what i choose to unlock the maps are huge specialized industry is so much better than the first game however there s many issues with this game as it currently stands progression past milestone 10 is utterly pointless the game suffers from major performance issues and the simulation begins to break down around milestone 15 buildings will intermittently stop sending out vehicles when off screen editing public transit routes will take a long time due to slow pathfinding the zoning tool will lag and get stuck in a painting state which can result in rezoning half your city by accident beyond the bugs and simulation issues though there s no gameplay reason to progress past m10 you don t unlock any new buildings services or mechanics you merely receive increases to your loan cap which you probably won t need to take by m10 by m12 i found i d unlocked just about everything i actually wanted for my playthrough there s no achievement for hitting m20 nor any in game reward the aforementioned performance issues slowed the game s tick speed so much that roughly half of my playtime in my m20 city 30 40 hrs was just spent on grinding out the last 4 milestones by m18 180k pop for me triple speed time would result in about 15 seconds per in game minute it really feels like the game was designed with 10 tiers of progression in mind and the other tiers seem tacked to bloat the amount of progression co can boast the traffic ai is just as brainless as c s if i build a roundabout interchange vehicles will prefer getting off the freeway going around the traffic circle and getting back on over simply staying on the freeway vehicles all decide to swap lanes at the exact same spot causing massive traffic jams at major junctions and interchanges vehicles are super reluctant to enter traffic circles even when the lane they want to go to is free pedestrians acknowledge no higher powers and will cross where they please the path info view from c s is gone this tool was incredibly useful for figuring out traffic flow issues allowing you to click a road to see the paths of all traffic whose paths include it i can t imagine why it was removed from the sequel the lack of mods is what really kills the experience for me i m baffled that co didn t pay more attention to the most popular c s mods where s my parallel road tool why isn t the lane connector from tm pe in the game clearly players desire that level of control and why are they planning to use their own platform over the steam workshop maybe this is just bethesda ptsd but i fear they may be planning to introduce paid mods overall i wish i d stopped my playthrough after m10 but regardless having reached the final milestone i can t say i feel much desire to start a new city it makes me feel much more like booting up c s and checking out what s hot on the workshop between performance issues bugs and half the game s progression feeling pointless i can t recommend this game in its current state i know co is currently working hard at improving these issues and hopefully i can update this review to reflect a more positive take this game is so so close to being great and i m optimistic that in time it will be
