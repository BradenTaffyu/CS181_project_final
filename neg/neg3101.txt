2019 not for vrif you use vr move along to another title as this is a hot mess even if you have the best hardware i run i7 8086k 5 3ghz all cores and a 2080ti you will not be able to maintain a steady 90fps with a grid of cars and if you add weather effects rain and spray from cars in front your vr experience will be almost unplayable and this is using medium low settings which make the image look blurry and just subpar there s too many fanboys on here who will angrily defend a title that s simply broken for vr and often you will find these outlandish claims of flawless performance on much lesser pc builds many use asw locked at 45fps oculus which isn t a good experience as half of the frames are fake maybe in 6 12 months this might change but i doubt it given that you can go to the ue4 developer forums and you will find unanswered questions going back multiple years
