2017 each patch makes the game less and less playable it is amazing how such a big title is releasing patches which introduce more issues diplomacy is becoming less and less logical by the minute i ve seen ghandi talking about nukes around 30th turn in ancient times i m aware that writing an ai may be hard but when you charge 60 euros 5 euro per civ you should at least try while i m a huge civ fan and still hope for civ 6 to become amazing i m really pissed at the moment on what is happening with the current state of the game and as well like the others i m waiting for a dlc which will at least rework somehow the religion cause it is boring as hell although is some sense it is realistic as religion is boring irl
