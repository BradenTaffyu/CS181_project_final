2019 i sincerely apologize to 2b 9s and all the rest of yorha squad members that i rated this game a thumb down unfortunately it is just well deserved for its state on pc since neither platinum nor square enix seems care about this title as long as it makes them one off profits and as if their service has been terminated once the title has been delivered to your hands now you may curious about how i hold such grudge towards this game well the yorha edition was born like a few days ago but not the entire nier automata and i did not see platinum put much efforts on this goty version apart from implementing all the past dlcs into it well it s a goty version it is the least i can think of the version should have not the most i have 2 gaming pcs one has 1050ti installed the other one has 2080ti installed i carry 1050ti one more often with me and i thought it is good enough to run this game smoothly i was wrong with maximum settings on which suppose to be none issues the yorha version encounters several game breaking bugs like random crashes white screen with audio still being played on background during cutscenes that made me can t even pass the prologue simply because this game stupidly decided to have 0 save point in prologue my first day with nier was i had 2 crashes on boss fights in prologue each one took about 40 minutes or more to get there and the rest of the day i made 0 progress in game but spent most of time on forum to look up the performance issues i had and the possible solutions only to find out these issues have been there since march 2017 with absolutely no official solutions from neither platinum or square enix i was almost going to refund after wasting 2 hours to repeatedly playing prologue again and again until i found far a fan made mod that fix all kinds of performance issues within nier automata i tried it then all the bugs have gone with the exact same maximum settings the yorha edition finally runs like what it supposed to be unbelievable it is a fan mod these genius folks who made it don t work for platinum nor se and they don t get the shares from the sale of nier automata so what the developers have been doing during the last one year and half then this is your attitude towards players who love this title and waited a year and half to get it on pc then there you go eat my thumb down i will also be blunt i do not support pirate but even pirate version has all dlcs and they don t have performance issues like your version has if you think doing a pc version is too complicated and you can t promise either to make sure the game has no issues on variety built pcs when release or doing hot fix when major bugs are reported that infected many users in community just say so and stop making pc port keep it on console if someone likes this title might just buy a console to play it at least the game s repetition is saved se you think i am not hurt when give nier a thumb down do you have any idea why i ve waited that long for this version let me remind you back to 2017 upon nier automata s release you rose the price for per ordering in asian region because of the unexpected overwhelmingly positive sales i was in asia even as a foreigner and this dishonest business practice resulting multiple rejections from the nier fans i was one of them now the yorha version is presenting in front of me like this well i don t know how much you hate your own title or just using it as an one off money making tool this is what you will get i will blackmail all your pc port titles in the future now you get what you want from me happy after a hundred hours playthrough i got every single achievement in this game found 90 loots unfortunately because of this completion i ve seen it all that is exactly why i still can t give nier automata a thumb up for some reasons personally i will explain below in short nier automata absolutely did its best to make me love it this much meanwhile it also did something i hate that much which resulting me putting myself in a hard position to judge its value for recommendation nier automata is best for its outstanding story known as the world of nier the addicting soundtracks which can be listened again again and again and possibly the best voice acting you can find in the modern game industry here specially refers to the english casts since i don t understand much japanese so the entire playthrough i had till the end was based on the version of english audio and i was amazed for na s storytelling experience i can give it a 95 100 however that s not all of it unfortunately it is a game after all not a novel the thumb down comes from its gameplay to be specific it labored itself as an action and adventure hack slash genre but it was poorly designed to suit the environment of its own first of all the game never properly teaches players how many different kinds of actions you can perform in the main game here specifically mean the jump actions there are varieties of jump actions you can perform which will make your characters jump higher and further in order to reach some difficult areas the game offers they require combining weapons actions in use however they never be shown in the tutorial they never even being demonstrated once in the game they are nowhere to be found unless you randomly test it yourself until you somehow learn it is okay if you only stick to the main missions and don t bother to get some rare equipment or items because if you do then you will suffer there are levels clearly equipment items side quest requiring the precise combined jump actions to be performed in order to get the rewards as one of the foundation actions of an aa game i can hardly think about why they shouldn t be told in an obvious way a good example is i ve seen some youtube videos perform these incredible jump techniques and then i spent the whole afternoon trying to learn any of them but ended up with failure and no clue at all in my opinion regarding the action elements nr has it couldn t compare ubisoft s prince of persia series back to 2000 which were very old games some nier s level design reminds me of prince of persia worrior within a typical famous example for its hard action difficulty however ppww did tell me what actions i can do in the tutorial section in the very beginning off the game it also clearly showed inside of the action list in game which nier has none what i need was the countless practice to make myself to master them nier automata in the other hand the tutorial was all i know where you can check controls and these pieces of important information are excluded when i tried to get some difficult to reach items i don t really know what actions are capable for me to do so all i could do was randomly jump with pod throw and dash to get there by luck sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t i ve got everything in game now but i still don t know how to perform a middle air jump as 2b if this gives you an idea about how poor this game was designed as an action adventure genre second there is a common misunderstanding i believe about the game genre of nier automata from trailer it certainly looks like a hack slash game however this game involves a variety of different genres to play i think half of the battles can be described as a hack slack genre the other half is more into a bullet hell genre especially in the later game the hacking system is purely a bullet hell mini game and there are larger number of bosses fire projectile like crazy if you play higher difficulty you would probably dare to melee them in combat often
