2018 i liked this game at first for quite some time but as you learn more and get better you realise how broken this game really is you can have three huge fleets in the english channel consisting of over five hundred ships with over two thousand fighters and a thousand naval bombers supporting them and yet the enemy can still sink your troop transports with ease denmark must have had a chronosphere for it s little tiny navy then you have stuff like you drop a little old nuke on a square with 18 infintry divisions and all they lose is a little bit of a supply not one division is lost you what now a i only seems to go so far as well before it just goes numb and does not know what to do i gave italy and germany full 50 bonus or whatever it is and they smashed most of europe germany took all of russia italy took most of southern euorpe and half of south africa and then they stopped they just ran out of scripts i guess with what to conquer they just let norway sweden denmark and finland sit there i ended up getting bored waiting for them to jusitfy against me united kingdom so i went fascist and started trying to invade other countries but you get stuck with these weird real historical ties which prevented me from even trying to get military access with germany because of reluctance in 1952 when we are both fascist lol the paid dlc are a little dissapointing as well they add good content for the tiny amount they add but most of it should be free in updates to be honest its a shame because for quite a while in my earlier days i enjoyed this game but it just gets too broken and has so many limitations put on it you can t really do what you want you need to meet this that that that that that and that objective to do this piss off and just let me do what i want and i will suffer the consequences edit 22 11 2018 will be interesting to see if this next dlc makes naval stuff a little less broken but it has been saying coming soon for ages
