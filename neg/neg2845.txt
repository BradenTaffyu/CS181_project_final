2016 this game drags a lot most choices have only tiny implications so for most of the time you re sitting around doing nothing especially if you re winning i e when you re in a position that you want to be in i ve been playing a game for two days and i would say about sixty percent of my time has been spent sitting around waiting to integrate a vassal or waiting to be president of the federation so i can declare war it can be very exciting especially during warfare but there are huge gaps when you literally have to return after about an hour before you can do anything that is remotely fun you d think that a galactic empire would be bustling with activity but as this game stands there is not much to do
