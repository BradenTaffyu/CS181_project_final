2020 great game in general but only for a few campaigns once you have actually beaten the game by becoming emperor one and only and you try out a few other factions you realize every run will play out the exact same way the units you use will be the generic ones that stuck with you from the start with high veterancy cause apparently swapping them out for elite units make you lose all exp on them and is very expensive so it is better not to upgrade them at all and it ends up killing the usage of unique units of every faction entirely conquest is chaotic there is really no real efficient way to hold and defend anything the garrison is too weak to stop anyone you can use your army to hold down a city but why would you do that running around and out sieging the ai is more efficient than trying to fortify your heartland for real and you get more money that way too with these in mind you can see every run becoming repetitive you will use the same few units composition you will basically use the same grand strategy it s the same start conquer nearby stuff get money and build more armies conquer more stuff get money build more armies until you win generally i start to lose interest every run around mid game where i am close to becoming one of the 3 major powers
