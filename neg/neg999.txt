2019 well well how can i start with this let me be clear the game in general it s decent enough yep decent it s not excellent but it still has something that makes you enjoy this title but that doesn t mean it doesn t have big problems either okay with this being said i will start with with my review of why this game it s a bad fallout but a fairly decent rpg game first point the dialogue system is pure garbage in fallout 3 or new vegas we had a very nice dialogue system which made us enjoy it and the jewel of the crown you don t know what you character will exactly say second point and this doesn t have any connection with the rpg system of the game per se but i warn you this game runs like you can see my pc specs in my profile and even in high this game gives me problems and you can say why you are complaining if you can run this game on ultra or high well because this game has mediocre graphics when you see the textures up close looks like it s like everything is washed out huge ps3 era vibes third point and this is has a connection with the rpg system we have a talktative character yes and you can say what is wrong with this well if for any reason you don t identificate with your character s voice you don t have any chance of eliminate his her voice added to an incomplete and dialogue system well you can expect the results fourth point the system of factions we have 4 factions that we can join well this give a nice small variety on the story and our adventures in this desolated world but like everything else this have a little big problem their side quests are literally the same preston gives us missions like help the colonists help x settlement in bos they give us missions like clear x zone with a child included ffs and thus this is a vicious circle of missions and yes we have a couple of nice main quests on these factions but talking about the reputation system well the game hasn t a reputation system like new vegas it doesn t matter if you help a 100000 million times you will always be in the rank that they granted to you five point the endings for not bringing spoilers to the table i will limit myself to saying this the game has 4 endings yeap 4 ending which 3 of them are the same nice job bethesda for the rest the game is an enjoyable rpg game but as a fallout fan this game quite disappointed me i ll give you a tip install mods and the game will improve a lot to sum it up buy this game on sale but don t expect a good fallout note this is my first large review in english sorry if there are mistakes in the text edit the mistakes in the text were corrected edit 2 almost 2 years later and here we are i corrected every misspellings on the review tbh i fell in love with english an amazing language that thankfully i can now understand pretty well
