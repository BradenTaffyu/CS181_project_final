2019 i ll start with saying that i legitimately love this game i really do the grand strategy and the battles are wonderful and the growth of your characters as you play through is sublime however that review is from when i could play the game for more than ten minutes at a time the last time i started to play the game it would allow me to get so far and then gone crash to desktop with no warning i reported this on the games forums back in november and was told that the issue was i progress and that they hoped for a fix i also saw that a lot of other people had the same problem i took a couple of months break to see if it would get fixed letting steam keep the game up to date sadly having tried it again today the game now crashes almost immediately in campaign mode certainly within the first ten turns while i could persevere and restart my machine constantly to play the game in ten minute chunks i am not going to do that until the crash bugs are fixed i would definitely not reccomend this game if they fix them however this will change
