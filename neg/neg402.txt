2020 skip to the end for tldr fallout 76 is quite fun when you can get a few people to play with it feels like a decent fps mmo with very similar game play to fo4 with added multiplayer fighting questing and even the camp building no more settlements needing your help yay are the same as they were with fo4 complete with annoying placement bugs for me the major thing holding the whole game back is the inane that is the stash size limit 800lbs this includes all your scrap armor aid weapons sale items and so on this limited space wouldn t be that bad if you could say sell everything you don t need off to traders but of course bethesda saw to that by making it so every vendor in the game shares the same amount of caps 1400c and 150 legendary scrip and only resets every 20hrs irl player vendors and displays are also as of this review temporarily turned off the limited stash was stated by bethesda as a technical limitation due to server capacity however they are now offering an unlimited scrap only stash for 18 99 cad per month along with a still not offline or moddable private server the game had has amazing potential but bethesda keeps impeding their own progress by creating problems and selling you the fix if you enjoyed playing fo4 and can get the game on sale 40 cad or less with a few buddy s you may be able to enjoy it through its faults unfortunately due to the shady business decisions by bethesda i cannot recommend the game in it s current state tldr fallout 76 has improved considerably since its incredibly bungled launch but fails to improve on the technical limitations bethesda is either unable or unwilling to overcome pros fun with friendsfallout narrative with wastelanders decent combat mechanics vats is a little odd at first but you get use to itcontinuous updates to the game and worldtons of exploration and quests eventsphotomode is more interesting than expectedbase building and schematic huntingdiverse s p e c i a l buildscons limited stash sizelimited vendor currencybugs so many bugsserver lag and instabilityshady bethesda overpriced atomic shop and subscription
