2018 rather than being specialized port for pc like bloons td 5 no iaps special keybinds it instead is just a direct port of bloons td 6 mobile that means there is still a full menu to buy upgrades and cash with real money every mouse button works as a mouse click with now mouse hover you must hold the button down like you d hold your finger down on mobile it also misses all the menu tweaks that bloons td 5 had edit apparently there are keybinds for all the towers they just aren t labelled anywhere at all
