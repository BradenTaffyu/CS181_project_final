2023 good game bad sales practice i enjoyed the main campaign and wanted to play mortal empires i load up the game after installing the free content but then i am immediately hit with a pop up that says warning ownership of total war warhammer 1 is required to play the mortal empires campaign i was fortunate in that i discovered this during a total war franchise sale so the whole ordeal only set me back 14 99 i am putting this out there so that i can hopefully keep some of my fellow players from falling into the same trap if you are okay with forgoing the expansion or shelling out more money i would recommend
