2020 i rarely submit reviews but with stellaris it seems the only meaningful way to give out feedback up to and including version 2 1 stellaris was quite fun and playable 4x game it s heavily rooted in well known sci fi lore and themes and being a sci fi fan myself i can recommend it to every other fan of this genre unfortunately starting from version 2 2 the game transitioned to new model for representing and managing population this isn t bad in itself what s bad is that ai seems woefully inadequate in managing this new system bringing out game breaking problems that are left unresolved since december 2018 the two most glaring ones are sector and planet level ai that s supposed to help player with managing their growing empire either does nothing or makes dumb decisions that cripple player s economy this leads to the need of massive micromanagement once you have more than a dozen worlds under control the endgame crises which all involve some powerful enemy to defeat do nothing they just spawn conquer 10 systems if you re lucky and then sit there waiting to be defeated it s truly baffling how the end game boss can be so passive thing is those appear only after one plays the game for significant time and the beginning experience remains as rich and awe inspiring as it was so the game sorta tricks new player into giving a positive review before revealing it s ugly face later of course it s a shortsighted strategy but for now it works there s no confirmation from paradox that they recognize these issues despite community bringing them many times to their attention it doesn t feel that paradox has a serious commitment to keeping the game stable and playable apart from churning out new dlcs all in all i can t recommend the game in it s current form
