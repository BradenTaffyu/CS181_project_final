2020 here s my honest review after 850 hours in ats and 350 hours in ets2 what s to like 1 it s a brilliant truck simulator the level of detail is amazing with a small investment in a wheel thrustmaster tmx pro and a 18 spd usb shift knob coupled with thrustmaster s th8a shifter you get a 100 legit experience driving a big rig as real as you can without actually getting your cdl and being out on the road in the meat world this game is that good it s the thing that kept me coming back for hundreds of hours 2 the modding community it is vast like the prairies and deep like the ocean if it weren t for the modding community making up for many of the shortfalls of the vanilla game i d have never put in all the hundreds of hours that i did there are some seriously dedicated modelers who upkeep certain truck models such as the freightliner flbb my all time favorite 3 it s easy to lose yourself in the sim you can pick it up for 15min at a time or play it for hours on end 4 head tracking and vr supported brings game this to a whole new level i d argue buying vr just for this game is a monumental waste of money however and now for the hard part while i absolutely loved this game what s not to like 1 the modding community it is vast like the prairies and deep like the ocean i often feel like scs has relied on the benevolence of the community that so loves this game to make up for the many shortcomings this game has from cosmetics to truck models desperately needed negine transmission variations freight variation playable maps thank you promods to ownable trailer types ffs the list literally goes on and on an on i feel like scs just makes maps collects money makes more maps collects money releases a new model every once in a while but never any functional improvements always it is the modding community making the game better than the base game and it has been this way since ets2 and has carried over into ats 2 little has changed in the years since it was created jobs are still pickup freight from point a and drop off at point b there are no ltl less than load deliveries or delivering to multiple customers out of one cargo haul no contract jobs haul x amount of freight fot a customer within a certain period of time no such thing as freight lanes you can reliably plan on how in all these years do we not have this yet freight variety is also severely lacking this isn t such a big deal in the reefer dry van because you don t see it but on the flatbeds i get tired of hauling the same 4 or 5 loads 3 you can t sleep in your sleeper cab in parking lots that aren t designated as specific resting areas in the real world drivers often sleep at their shippers receivers if truck stops or rest areas are full again this is an easy thing to implement yet here we are years into development without this option i can t even pull into a hotel parking lot and take a snooze for a couple hours it has to be a full sleep cycle this became such a pita that i turned off the sleep requirement because it was so poorly executed 4 fleet management building a trucking empire is quite honestly a joke once you ve learned the game and how to get a solid start you can quickly amass a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars with no way to spend it stop lights pfft who cares if you run them weigh stations i just roll right on by because there are zero tangible consequences money becomes monopoly money at that point and the only way to make things a challenge again is you guessed it an unofficial mod from the community that drastically changes the money you earn for jobs this is all a symptom of a larger issue in the game ats ets2 is purely a driving simulator and not a trucking business simulator just imagine the possibilities here folks and then realize what we re missing and feel that deep regret 5 let me take a moment to talk about the severe and utter lack of ownable trailers yes we get a new trailer once in a while but it s bad it s really really bad how slow the implementation of this has been to date we need someone at scs devoted to this singular task of making new ownable trailers and freight to go with it otherwise this game gets boring fast and i mean fast 6 the traffic ai in the game is t e r r i b l e in so many ways from coming to complete stops before entering an empty freeway to stopping in the middle of the roads for no reason at all complete inabilities to merge with other traffic etc etc it s laughable 7 weather it does not exist in this game unless of course you use one of the community mods while their is rain it has no functional purpose other than to obscure your driving vision it does not affect road physics or driving dynamics at all a real lost opportunity 8 truck maintenance upkeep not really a thing here there s no fear of blowing an engine if you accidentally downshift into the wrong gear no fear of overheating and blowing a block from overworking an engine you can cook a trans from running it too hard up hill no blown tires for driving off road no maintenance schedule even to follow and or consequences for not doing an in frame rebuild within a certain mileage absolutely nothing look at a game like il 2 sturmovik that has real consequences if you push your machinery too hard for too long these trucks have all these fancy dials and gauges that do absolutely nothing yet another lost opportunity let me be clear i have over 850 hours in ats and over 350 in ets2 and i continue to play them when i get bored of everything else in my library the likes and dislikes listed above apply to both and while i have loved this game tremendously genuine development of the game has basically never been a priority and fallen upon the community of dedicated modders to keep the game fresh and interesting for someone like me this game could truly be an amazing game worth any price tag as it stands right now i d only buy it when it s on sale 75 off or more without the mods i d maybe have a hundred hours in the games combined
