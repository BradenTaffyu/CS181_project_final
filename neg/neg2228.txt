2023 i must join in to support my fellow gamers my hours are not all included i ve had another war thunder account and also an xbox account i have logged some hours into out of curiosity i have played on and off since before tanks were released i can t remember the update watching phly and baronvongamez i have waited in eager patience hoping one day this game would be what i dreamed i realized that wasn t going to happen after years of asking for new game modes the lack of actual gameplay improvements and the steadily declining economy do not believe a word these thieves say i mean it all too well that gaijin doesn t care about what s said or done they think we re going to bend the knee because they have a unique product to offer the market i will never return to game with gaijin i will never give a penny to them and i will never support this title as a release until there is a major change in who is running the company not what they say or even do any decisions they ve made that the community recommends gets shoveled straight into the dump when they replace it with their own money grabbing mechanic or change i know there are people here with more hours and more to say than me and probably more constructive too i don t care because why are they going to care it s like trying to sway a cat to a pen you re playing a fool s game uninstalled and never will be installed again this behavior from a company so blatantly awful shouldn t ever be promoted again i recommend all do the same simply because you won t ever get the time back i learned that the hard way for anyone who thinks that i am drawing too many conclusions i am also posting a link to another review with the most braindead developer response i ve ever seen these people are insane i m sorry but it s game over for this awful product i put away the rose tinted shades of love i had for this game and saw how rotten i felt playing it
