2017 great game but way too greedy and lazy developers there s no longer a 75 sale for even the 4 years old dlc so all the newcomers have to sell their houses and live in a carton box to be able to play this game with every dlc and keep up with the upcoming expansions i may exaggerate a little but you get what i m saying right it would all be fine if the quality of the game and the dlc were as high as the price but we still swim in the ocean of bugs suck on this paradox you greedy bastards another negative review for you
