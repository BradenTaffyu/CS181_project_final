2017 limited and poorly construed maps are the thing i find most irritating about this game compared to version v it really feels like they shipped out a product they ran out of time to finish the computer players act irrationally and often without any decent strategy if you select a small map fill it up with civilizations you ll discover you ended up with a large map after playing for a while the setup wizard is lacking appropriate settings to make the game a joy if you play the one map and size avilable of earth you ll never find yourself starting anywhere other than in the americas i d love to know what it d be like to play in eurasia or africa but after restarting 20 times i always started in south america and on occassion north america despite trying several different civilizations the setup tool never remembers what you selected previously so if you have to click everything to get what you want there are no scenarios unless you play online in multiplayer not a one but i they just released the vikings for an extra 5 how ridicules you can t create your own maps scenarios or mods there are a lot less civilizations as well i will say one thing for this game because of the limitations and what i spelled out above you will not find it addciting as earlier versions i d wait to buy it until after all their b s of trying to ring extra money from you for something as petty as a single civlization e g poland is over with this game feels unfinished and the lack of maps ability to edit and make maps and scenarios makes it a bore maybe in a couple years it d be worth buying
