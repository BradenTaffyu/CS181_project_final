2019 this game is a lot of fun you will spend days weeks playing it it is one of the most in depth building resource management games that i played that being said i am leaving negative reference for this game the reason for that is the lack of tutorials or in game wiki that explains the game while playing this game you have two options 1 make an assumption about how things fit together spend hours days building it only to realize that this is not how it works and your whole colony is in pain due to that 2 spend hours reading reddit steam forum comments or watch youtube for hours to understand how things fit together a game of this complexity needs better tutorials and in game instructions i got tired tired of spending days to build things only to let them die because oh this is not how it works
