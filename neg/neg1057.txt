the game itself is ok however if you want to play it on a modern pc like i do it s painful borderline unplayable without some intervention or using mods if bethesda microsoft are intent to sell this game in 2024 and it looks like they are since there currently is a sale as of jan 2024 the least they should do is to remove the fps cap that ruins the game if modders can do this they can do it as well i cannot recommend the game in good conscience without having this fixed
