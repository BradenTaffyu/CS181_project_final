2022 great afk game start duel and if you re 2nd you can go read a book watch a movie and make a meal come back and it might be your turn 10 000 unique cards and only 5 of those are used spend hours building a deck and crafting go into duel lose coin flip wait 30 minutes for opponent to summon entire deck place monster destroyed place spell negated special summon returned to hand end turn and lose best of 1 so can t build alternative deck for counters cost of decks is too high for little resources gained from story and crafting at this time i d probably recommend against this game or don t keep your expectations high if you don t play one of the handful of meta decks used you won t have a good time unless you re a masochist then ignore everything i ve said and it enjoy your time thanks for coming to my ted talk
