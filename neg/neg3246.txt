2019 the game can be fun and i have certainly enjoyed it however do not buy full price games from paradox unless you enjoy paying for being a beta tester we ve come to the point where i have to share my general dissatisfaction with how the developer has been managing the game and the reason why i cannot recommend anyone to buy it at full price here we are 3 years after release and the game is still experiencing fundamental issues with ai other aspects of the game a release breaks the front ai completely and the developers do full radio silence it s been around two months but we still have neither an acknowledgement or communication on when a fix can be expected in the meanwhile some people in the community seems to have been able to at least hotfix this paradox has had 3 years to work on the ai but it s still dumb as a rock the whole design and in general the paradox business model seems to be based on releasing a beta product and then making people pay for fully fleshed out core parts of the game in dlcs bug fixing is slow release testing is inadequate and feature implementation feels often lazy and thoughtless
