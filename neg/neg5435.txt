2023 so i tried playing through the north africa campaign and it was as dull as ditch water honestly didn t make it past the 3rd mission quick summary it s coh 2 5 in a nutshell they haven t given any thought to anything other than competitive play and it shows the maps are all open and designed for small unit engagements instead of maps where you can turtle up or try and build up any kind of force no one is playing atm i m seeing maybe 10 lobbies at most once again i think this will be saved by the modding community and the most popular maps will once again be maps from coh1 the factions are kind of half baked and the sub faction assets you can buy using commander points are very weak i m not impressed so far 10 years we ve been waiting for this and it feels like a very good indy copy of coh2 with some aspects of coh but nothing of substance
