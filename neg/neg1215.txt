2016 fallout 4 a bad game experience for me should have written one ages ago but here goes obviously some spoilers ahead now this is a point of view from me ok get the thought out of your head that this is somehow personal towards anyone major spoiler alert all in all fallout 3 and new vegas was better i played them twice or even thrice barely completed fallout 4 mostly due to its poor story line i mean saving mankind at fallout3 and deciding the fate of nevada and las vegas with big names from the ncr and legion the vast emptyness and desolation loved it but looking for my son is just so meh who the cares i dont care about my fictional son the least single given but getting to know the railroad and the institute rested so heavily on a straight out boring main quest that dragged on and on now for my biggest dissapointment after 5 6 games of different fallout games going back to fallout fallout tactics fallout 2 fallout 3 new vega and fallout 4 i finally got used to the dialogue system the way it worked with speech skill and traits this was a main factor in my approach to the fallout game many people loves getting their guns out and shoot people in the face i also like to do that but on my 1st games on every fallout game i was always the smooth talker diffusing situations with the advanced narrative that followed and the complex reprisals to come either right away or in the future in fallout 4 this was reduced to 4 ways of saying the same thing my favorite example is this main character is going to talk the word is what what wat sarcastic what huh that was just a big let down personally many found it probably liberating to now not go through that complex speech dialogue mechanic but i did not find this new development making the gaming experience any more furfilling the exact opposite happened and it felt they removed a key aspect of the game now that aside i continued playing in good faith gathering materials for upgrades liberating towns establishing and building defenses bla bla bla but even that got really boring and redudant npc boring as my followers useless as all fallout games except dogmeat love dogmeat 3dlc s i have season pass played automatron laughed my ass off as i realised i got ripped off as bethesda dlc s usually have some flesh on their bones refeering to skyrim series and fallout 3 and new vegas wich got colorfull dlc s that enriched the lore and gaming experience overall and added alot of extra time to the gameplay but this for fallout 4 its a joke a cruel joke of a game and dlc content pisspoor nuka world seems fun and all that but i lost my patience and trust in bethesda all in all bethesda and especially todd howard get your shiii together or go home leave the next game of the fallout series to whomever handled and created fallout new vegas that right there was a proper game with all the core elements fallout so much stands for
