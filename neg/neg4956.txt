2019 i wish there was a meh option rather than thumbs up down i think three kingdoms is way overrated there are serious improvements to the campaign map and ai over previous games however the tactical combat is just plain boring there is simply too little variation between different units a spearmen is a spearmen and an archer is an archer and they are pretty much uniform across all factions to make matters worse there is little variation between factions even at the strategic level to me the unique races and mechanics of the total war warhammer series make it far superior with far more replay value
