early access review played ase for a number of years and was excited to try this especially as it currently stands with the island scorched earth and the centre it doesn t feel like it was worth the money or the time investment honestly the only reason i ve played this much and will continue to play at all is because i enjoy spending time with the people i ve played with for years and who have migrated to asa as a community i also think it s a little bit disgusting that it already has a 45aud dlc package and a 7aud dino not a full dlc a freakin dino only you add to the fact that this game is not at all likely to house the same truly long term communities that its predecessor had in no small part because there s not enough new content to keep the hardcore ase fans as interested as they were in ase and too expensive for both new and old players to keep investing it s such a shame the route this game has been put on but i honestly can t recommend it even though i d like to
