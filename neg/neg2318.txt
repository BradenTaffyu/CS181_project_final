2017 i bought this game when it first released with high expectations and the hopes of an amazing game i knew what i was getting into with limited content and i accepted paying that cost to help support scs make this game into the awesome game i know it can be the problem is i expected some progress on this game i sit here writing a review a year and a half after the games release with no real progress made at the current state that ats is in we have 3 states all that were promised to us as part of the base game and took 4 months for just that to put in the third and fulfill peoples pre orders now we are slowly coming up to the 2 year mark and in that 2 years we have basically got what we were promised when we first bought the game a pointless rescale of the whole base games map which people are soon going to find is going to royally f them as the game develops later on down the line but wait and see on that one not to mention we are hoping the first real piece of dlc content in new mexico will be releasing later on this year and before the 2 year mark this is for state number 4 out of the 44 continental states they still need to complete do the math 44 4 x 2 gives you a grand total of 22 that means at this rate of progress this game will not be completed for 22 years if it has no delays let s summarise before the 2 year mark we have our pre order bonus fulfilled had a unnecessary rescale and we are hoping to have the first real piece of dlc come out for this game before those 2 years are up and a current progress of game completion in 22 years not the significant progress i was hoping for this is before i get into the fact that the developers seemingly have a sheer lack of interest working on this game at the moment and would much rather work on there predecessor game of ets 2 want evidence of this let us do a comparison on what has came out for ats vs ets since ats has been released ats has had 7 dlc s come out for it all cosmetic dlc s apart from one of them being map content and that being the free pre order map bonus content of arizona now compare with ets 2 that has had 1 map release with france 1 that will be done before the 2 year mark which is italy so i am counting this as 2 map releases and 22 new cosmetic dlc s released primarily paint packs in the year and a half that ats has come out 7 dlc s for ats vs the 24 ets 2 dlc packs or 23 if we do not count italy so please people who try to critique this review tell me how that does not show them focusing more on ets2 i now state clearly because of the above there is no way in my right mind i can tell people that this is worth the 14 price tag at the moment in it s current state with a current progress for the full game to be done in 22 years and a lack of interest by the developers i mean if you are a diehard fan of the truck simulator series then sure pull the trigger on this game but be under no illusion this game is deprived of content and expect a lack of any real content for i would say a good 2 to 3 years while scs wrap up everything on euro truck simulator 2 if on the other hand you are totally new to the truck driving simulation games and were thinking this would be a awesome place to start stay away from it for now come back in 3 years when more has been added or better yet go and spend that 14 on euro truck simulator 2 and you will get way more bang for your buck this review will be subject to change if and when new content releases for ats and we start seeing the developer become interested in making this game again
