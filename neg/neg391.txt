2022 no matter what new thing they add on it just keeps on sucking i ve played a lot of hours of this so you might wonder at the thumbs down i do too pros at lower levels it s kind of fun people are helpful the various quests are silly and amusing making a camp is a genuinely diverting time cons all other parts of the game it s a huge map filled with no one there s some npcs now because of backlash but there s hardly no other players things swing wildly between way too hard and stupidly easy no fun if you are playing alone it s lonely overly hyped and most of it is trying to suck you into spending more money to get cool hats or things for your camp most of which aren t even new just brought in and out of rotation i am an old i have limited time and grinding is no fun for me at least
