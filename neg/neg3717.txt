2018 early access review one of my favourite survival experiences unfortunately ruined by developers who take a year to do minor updates you don t just need to take my word for it other reviews are saying exactly the same thing the future of this game looks about as bleak as the update timeline and after expressing concerns of this on this they had to shut down the thread because so many people were against what they are turning this game into save yourself some money and don t get it till you re desperately bored and it s on sale
