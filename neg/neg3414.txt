being an absolute fan of cs1 i m unsure of what exactly i was expecting from cs2 in all honesty i shall try and be concise with my thoughts and feelings here are a couple of things i thought one would be getting better graphics improved performance smoother game play in general with a choice of difficulties for different rps more content i know the idea behind it was to do it via more dlcs but bare with me please than the original cs1 and speedier launch of dlc packsand pretty much anything else would have been a bonus however the promises that were made quickly shattered the glass ceiling that was announced prior to launch not only one was fronted with performance issues in general but the content promised expected was either delayed or put on hold sadly we had a game lacking in content with issues both in terms of technical performance but as well as in game economics etc i do think that having been spoilt for choices with not only a decade of dlcs but also mods creator assets from the workshop initially the game was kind of fun but quickly became dull and unexciting i don t want to speak bad of the developers as i am sure they would have liked more time and perhaps money to get the game where they wanted it to be at launch sadly the game did not meet my anxiety filled expectations at launch then there were controversies behind delays on promised dlc content as well as map editor and the in app workshop i do blame myself for pre purchasing a deluxe version of a game it is at the end of the day my choice to do so but co had my trust considering the years we had all spent on cs1 happy to see that a year later some work has been done to repair the initial issues but sad to say i think i will probably wait a year or two before touching this game again with the hope that more work is done on it as well as more content becomes available so of course feel free to give it a try for yourself but if you don t mind my opinion then wait a while and buy it when it s on a massive sale get cs1 if you don t have it instead and if you do enjoy it as i am sure you will have way more fun that playing cs2 for now it is with great sadness on my part with all this said it is a thumbs down for me at the moment
