2023 aimlabs used to be a really great tool with a ranking system which updated with each task you played it was the perfect way to be always tracking your progress in several different categories like tracking flicking spatial awareness and multiple others since i last played most of this was stripped in favour of a rank system which only counts a very small number of pre selected tasks the ranks no longer feel accurate and no longer actually track improvement progress they also scrapped most of the rank categories leaving only three for whatever reason there s a competitive season now as well which is the only place the new rank system applies or tracks completing a task also used to give plently of useful info like saying you re weak on the left side of your screen are over under flicking etc but this has all been taken away in place of just wow you re doing great and other generic encouraging messages to my knowledge all this info is now hidden behind a paywall for a subscription with very bad reviews aimlabs is fine as its free and still has all the old tasks it had before plus new ones added by player made content it does what it supposed to but just not as well as it used to do it
