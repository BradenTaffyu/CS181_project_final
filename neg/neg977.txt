2016 no just no this is more of bethesda dumbing down their games stupefying it to the lowest common denominator there is somehow less feeling of depth than skyrim and the npcs and companions are less interesting and feel even less real again somehow worse than skyrim with the exception being nick valentine being one of the most interesting characters i ve seen in a bethesda game make no mistake this isn t an rpg this is a shooter with light rpg elements sprinkled on in the same way that skyrim isn t an rpg it s a fantasy adventure game with rpg elements sprinkled on i find the most egregious part of this game to be the randomly generated quests and settlements in general the quests are endless if you keep going to preston and there are three types of quests related to this 1 this settlement is under attack 2 kill all the enemies in this nearby location to a settlement3 a settler as been kidnapped to this nearby locationit s worth noting 2 and 3 are pretty much one in the same as they use the same locations and i ve even gotten the same location a number of times in a row for these sad excuses for quests i also put nearby in quotes because i ve gotten quests from settlers saying raiders or some other type of enemy is camped out nearby and harassing the settlement only to travel more than halfway across the map on top of that if you can get away from preston after turning in a quest and before he gives you another because it s automatic eventually you ll get a warning on your pipboy that a settlement is under attack anyways and if you ignore that damage is done to the settlement so unless you want your settlements getting messed up you re constantly strong armed into saving them constantly distracting from your exploration or questing some get messed up so fast there s no time to go save them unless you immediately drop what you re doing to go save them furthermore settlement system itself seems like it was tacked on at the very last minute with incomplete tilesets a strange lack and selection of objects to build bizarre boundary and placement restrictions an extremely finicky snapping system odd restrictions on what you can or can t remove from a settlement for example some structures and objects such as beds or part of a house in an inconvenient position and absurd material requirements for the inventory space you get this game is already tedium incarnate but trying to get materials for all these settlements with the inventory limitation is insane and no i m not calling for the removal of the carry weight limit the whole settlement construction system feels like what you d expect from a modder not a professional triple a game developer the weapon modding system is actually pretty great and it does seem like there was effort put into this and i wish more games that have weapon modding had this level of choice the dialogue system felt like the most lame and flaccid way to interact with characters in the world every conversation turns into a mini cutscene as you get up to four responses to any statement typically just a yes or no type statement and usually some form of further questioning or sarcastic reply most times it doesn t seem to matter which you pick it s like how in telltale games no matter the choices you make always leads to the same conclusion so many conversations are like this like the one when you first reach diamond city between the mayor and piper i got the exact same response for picking all four dialogue options why even give the option if it changes nothing all four come out with the exact same response this system also does not show exactly what your character is going to say and is often really unclear i ve picked what i thought was a genuine response only to find out it was some snarky sarcasm this also takes away some of the more amusing dialogue choices from previous games such as fallout 3 what few puzzles that are in this game like skyrim s puzzles felt like they were designed for toddlers while skyrim had the insultingly easy picture matching puzzles the only real puzzle i ve encountered was involved in finding the railroad faction what is supposed to be a secret underground group that is difficult to find consists of following a very clear and obvious red line instead of interesting clues and figuring out they were stupid enough to use their own name as the password for their hidden base the factions are all completely uninteresting and stupid the brotherhood feels like they were pointlessly shoehorned in this game because there needed to be some sort of connection to the rest of the series and this time they ve taken on a far more militaristic role and are intent on waging war just because the railroad felt useless like their only reason to exist was to help with one very specific instance in the main story the institute likewise felt stupid in that they were propped up to be this big evil villain but we hardly see or get much motivation to go after them except for the fact that they kidnapped your son i would also like to point out the absurdity of their whole base of operations being this beautiful pristine facility with technological wonders in a world where everything has to be scrapped and salvaged and the availability of the energy needed to run such a place would be impossible to attain i wanted to finish this game before writing my review but in all honesty i just couldn t take it anymore i find there to be little of interest to this game and none of the hooks that kept me playing previous bethesda titles like oblivion fallout 3 new vegas yeah i know obsidian did it and especially morrowind even skyrim kept my interest long enough for me to finish the main story and faction questlines despite how boring it was there is no real depth to this game all you get is the illusion of depth this game is an insult to all long time fallout fans no the fact this game can be modded isn t an excuse for the problems i ve mentioned and no amount of modding can save or fix the base game
