2017 fallout 4 failed to capture the atmosphere of the first and third game or diversity of activities and fun quests of the second game and new vegas it still has it s good sides like settlement system although it s still far from perfect or upgrading the gunplay while the best in the series is overshadowed by watered down rpg aspects such as complete removal of skills which instead were replaced with perks special was also made less meaningful as those sweet stats don t directly affect your ability to use specific types of weapons anymore rifles both automatic and non automatic were turned into a single thing another change to roleplaying part of the game is the protagonist you can obviously customize them as in previous two games and give them your own namerad poisoning was completly changed yet again unlike the fallout 3 s and new vegas stat reduction fallout 4 s rad reduces your maximum health to me it was just a mild annoyance and wasn t as impactful as stat loss in previous two games however the introduction of gamma weapons really brought some interesting changes to the game those gamma weapons just three variants in the game unfortunately that idea wasn t explored too much deal radiation damage while the flat damage with bonus health reduction isn t that interesting it s really cool to see such weapon healing rad friendly enemies such as ghouls another big change is how power armour works it s absolutely overpowered but requires you to fuel it with fusion core you cannot swim in a power armour anymore too which obviously makes sense but this was never a realistic game to begin with therefore power armour which is acquired barely hour and half into the game feels really cheap and makes further experience and equipement gathering not as satisfying as new vegas or original fallout fallout 4 has unfortunately the worst writing in the series main quest is a joke and leaves a lot of important questions unanswered barely any side quests are worthwhile as they usually feel forced and way too easy there are obviously exceptions but they are overshadowed but pure badness of majority of the game in my opinion this game was worth the money and time i sunk into it but anyone with actual taste who looks for a fun big world to explore and enjoys some good roleplaying i have only two words stay away
