2018 this might sound weird for someone with so much play time but it s mostly cause i want it to be good and even more that i really love exploring all the focus trees in the different mods and stuff whenever it comes to the actual warfare part it s either ludicrously fiddly or ludicrously easy the game almost forces you to let the ai play out the wars but either you re so powerful you can just do a single offensive line and have the ai do it all or you set up a front line for every army group which will get screwed up constantly so you have to fix it draw out a proper plan which you ll have to re do every few minutes and even then you ll probably end up just manually moving your soldiers but you have to do the ai plans because otherwise you don t get the extremely important planning bonus the ai is totally braindead it doesn t understand how to use the focus trees so it ll end up doing really ridiculous things like having germany declaring war on the ussr while it s barely even started attacking france for some reason it doesn t understand battle odds so it ll suicide itself onto your entrenched forces over and over until it runs out of manpower and equipment and loses this doesn t just affect your opponents because the same ai controls your forces you ll have to keep babysitting your troops so they don t do it the division template system seems cool but it s extremely gameable and if you re not trying to game it it s totally opaque the naval system is also a fiddly mess with no obvious strategy if you do get it do what i did and just play kaiserreich it s also very messy but the attention to detail and reams and reams of alternatives make it really fascinating to experience it can t save the actual game but at least it s interesting
