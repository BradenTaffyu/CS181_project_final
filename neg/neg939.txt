2018 i think it was around hour 70 when i really just started feeling dead inside you explore every nook and cranny hoping to find some secret stash of rpg staple goodies but you just keep finding the same junk over and over fallout iv makes for a beautiful world but oh goodness is it full of fluff and cooke cutter content and mediocre writing bethesda you have the budget to hire writers so please hire writers i had a pretty good time with this entry no doubt but in the end i mostly feel like i wasted my time that i just turned my brain off for 115 hours until i finished all the content i could find i liked far harbor
