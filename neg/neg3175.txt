2023 i have spent a fair amount of time in game playing various ships i have acquired multiple t10 ships premiums etc i have to say that i really enjoy this game or better have enjoyed it wargaming is actively trying to milk players out of every penny they have and all the decisions are made based on that while i understand that time they ve spent on developing a feature is costly and now they might want to implement it but they shouldn t have done so the submarines are a pain to play against aircraft carriers as well if not even worse i strongly advice against playing this game as it brings more and more frustration the more you advance it needs to change and until wargaming acknowledges it and changes for the better it s not worth playing this game
