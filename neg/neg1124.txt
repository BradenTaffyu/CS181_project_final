2017 the creation club a 2gb patch to include a store page in a single player rpg a patch that downloaded every mod they have on offer straight to your hard drive taking up valuable space for content you don t even own a patch that breaks the f4se thankfully fixed at the moment and if rumors are straight will again when they add more to the store a patch that adds an obnoxious and overly large creation club news panel on the main menu of the game why it s 5 for a suit of armor 4 for what amounts to a laser musket reskin gun runners arsenal cost 4 dollars on the xbox store 2 dollars on steam atm and added multiple unique weapons ammunition types and weapon mods skyrim immersive weapons and its sister mod immersive armors adds 244 weapons and 55 sets of armor respectively and they are both free i like this game when its modded if you break my mods every time you update the store and i can t play when i want because i have to wait for f4se to be patched it s very frustrating i still want to play this game after the release of the creation club but i most definitely will not be taking part
