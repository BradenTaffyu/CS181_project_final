i ve put a fair few hours into this ignoring the greedy practices creative assembly sega have pulled with the series there is just a so much annoyance here things like retreating armies rolling a dice for which direction they retreat in there is a friendly province settlement right near us lets march in the opposite direction shogun 2 was able to do this properly but for some reason not here combines with razing a settlement where your army will pick another random direction and saunter away from the settlement having your army literally banging on the door of the settlement you want to attack but oops no movement points left so lets just camp right outside no grace with a well you got close enough anti player bias wait you are only at war with one faction and you are winning can t be having that lets have this random faction nowhere near you declare war for no reason have fun when their army shows up in 10 turns combines well with enemy factions only having 1 2 provinces but can pull out 2 3 fully stacked armies meanwhile you are still struggling to upkeep the half stacked 2 armies you have friendly factions with just a non aggression pact ignore your borders and go for a jolly through without asking for access you do it to them and all of a sudden you are the bad guy again shogun 2 didn t have this problem have a reinforcing army on a city defence well i hope that garrison can last enjoy your units being drip fed in one unit at a time with no choice over the order what do you mean you wanted your archers to defend a walled city why would you want those they can come through last there are many more but you get the idea it leads to tedious gameplay and frustration the redeeming features are a fantasy total war and playing in co op means you can overcome a lot of the annoyance and have a good time
