2020 early access review well i have been playing this game from alpha 17 i love this game sure the graphics look bland and the terrain is usually the same mountains and hills and caves placed all over the map but the game itself was very intriguing i play with a group of friends and yes this game is perhaps one of the best games for survival things i do not like after the public release of alpha 19 1 game sparks is a third party data collection company which utilises your personal data without your consent i did not even realise this was a thing pushed in this alpha until i came across recent reviews of some other players the thing that caught my eye was that fun pimps has not even advertised their association with this company there is no disclaimer at the start of the game to inform you of this change new players or veterans will not be aware that their data is harvested systematically during playtime 2 the only way and this is a change that the devs did was add in an opt out option in the game this btw is not in the default game rather in the launcher option where you can uncheck gamesparks no one usually goes to the launcher maybe once in a while you would to switch rendering launch commands etc this shows another attempt to deceive users in my opinion 3 the loot system change is garbage if you are level 1 you can not find a level 3 ak because you do not have the level required you open a safe and find level 1 stone axes and spears is not worth the time this kills the survival element and in turn favours the rpg element of the game you can just farm some levels and go looting which not only kills the exploring the map part but also negates the basic game idea the devs have said the change is to prolong early game in games but the fact is it just is a major hindrance to the playstyle of the game they really need to rethink this change imo 4 the hitboxes on zombies need to be reworked they are too wonky and weird i would say the melee combat suffers from this as a result and that too quite a bit things i do like about alpha 19 1 the change in lighting has really brought a new face to the game its very pretty now kudos to the devs for that 2 the zombies look much more immersive and good quality 3 the optimisation has been good overall i have a high end pc and even my friends with average and min spec pcs have said there is an improvement 4 the ui change is a welcome one and minimal instead of opening the menu to look at food and water status bars can show you how much of each resource you have left 5 actually fixing force field and the slope glitches to make the game actually more interesting 6 zombies swim and not walk underwater things i wish they had added in alpha 19 1 more vehicles or a rework of the existing ones a 4x4 with two people is kinda impractical at times when you play with 8 people or more 2 the gyro needs to get a co pilot or passenger seat it would be very handy like in rust 3 an overhaul ammo crafting brass is a big problem at times when you cant get enough or you can not sustain the use crafting 9000 bullets and then another batch of 9000 and your stores take a huge it i wish there was like a mining element to it to make it a bit easier maybe add an alternative low grade ammo darkness falls mod steel ammo that degrades guns faster but is cheaper to make 4 add water based vehicles 5 fix the lag issue when the game does not render the map on the server but renders on the players system your ping can go through 100k to negative 80k no idea how that works 6 some other glitches and bugs that have been asked to fix but still haven t 7 added new pois and new buildings with interiors 8 npcs thoughts it a very good update in many ways but also falls short on certain basic characteristics of the game which sucks i will keep playing the game albeit it will be a different game from the core mechanics i love this game but i will rate is down because of the breach of privacy issue i mentioned earlier
