2016 edit oh boy paid mods and fake money fun bucks and a file format that explicitly stops large worthwhile expansions or quest mods by limiting the number of records items objects npcs dialog lines to 4000 per mod which will get eaten up in no time by building a properly cluttered room or two let alone any talking npcs in it do you want bad press because this is how you get bad press i loved fallout 3 and new vegas but i can t feel that same love for fallout 4 at this point games like stalker have more rpg elements than it does and still beat it at what it s decided its new core focus is which is telling seeing as stalker s an open world fps and that seems to be the goal of this installment interesting sidequests varied player characters and the ability to affect the world take a backseat in favour of settlement building and borderlands style loot grinding sure the movement s less wonky the shooting s more fluid and the graphics are shinier but they ve been paid for with depth of content and interesting things to do using those mechanics which renders the trade a bit of a moot point ever want your singleplayer game to feel like an mmo farcry don t delay buy fallout 4 today a might have for people who pick up the shiny new box on the shelf but if you were a fan of the previous games you d be better served waiting for it to go 75 off as there s definitely not 40 fo fallout here
