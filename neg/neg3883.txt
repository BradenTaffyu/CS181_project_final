2016 early access review 7 days to die appealed to me initially as i liked the simple crafting building and scavenging aspects the game presented i enjoyed just picking up after a few hours or few days and continuing on with what i was doing foraging hunting building exploring running i loved having a tower defense taking on a hoard with my iron siding wooden spikes spiked logs sniper rifle and if necessary the ungerground tunnel to flee in i enjoyed the game so much that the lack of any real story was fine looking at the hours i ve put in this game well justifies the money spent to me getting at least 1 hour of entertainment per 1 spent good buy where this game has driven me away is the updates i understood this was a game in progress i understood that at times there would be changes made that were to improve the overall experience but may leave my game unplayable and a new one would need to be started after several new starts the latest upgrade is enough total change in how the menu works how you do things how you fix build i opened this game one day eager to get back into my japanese style fortress only to find that nothing worked the underground portion collapsed and my character generated underground in a small location that used to be a barracks with no way out blocks no longer reacted in the same manner as before the shovel i was using degraded so fast it became frustrating the menu was so different from previous that i looked at it a little bit and then gave up i didn t want to spend the time it was going to take to re learn how to use the menu or how to construct or cook or what have you i realized that at that point it wouldn t matter because the very next update could be another episode of game break re learn the menu re learn how to build construct cook i have gone from my intial love of this game to abosolutely despising it the fun pimps have taken this game from it s simple menu and basic game approach to burdening it with so much garbage it just isn t fun anymore i will miss the time i spent in this world early on before the fun pimps sucked the fun out of it i m not sure they have and end goal in mind with this game anymore if this game is ever complete i may attempt it one last time i fear however that the fun pimps have turned 7 days to die into 7 days to kill by update update 9 3 2017what was i thinking gave it another shot spent hours building a huge underground lair another update another broken game buldings magically floating in the air most placeable items upside down i guess this is the end of my story in 7 days to die update 11 2 2019fun pimps stop updating the game quit adding changing things at some point call it done and work on adding things you want in a 7 days to die year 2 sequel update 12 31 2021why oh why do you insist on forever updating this game breaking save games undoing hours of playing just to add some detail how can you possibly have a game in early access for 10 years how does steam allow this to continue even though i can choose to go back and play and earlier version you re constant updates means i have to go back and reset key mapping to my play style i m done got my monies worth sort of and mad that i ll not play this anymore but i m done with your torture fun pimps good bye
