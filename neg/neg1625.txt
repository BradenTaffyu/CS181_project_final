2020 early access review i cannot recommend this game having been a fan of warband since about 2012 it s not like my standards are very high however they copped out by going ea we waited so many years for a sequel and it comes out at near full price with almost no more features than upgraded graphics broken story constant crashes and poor execution of new features of course as with many games these days the modding community saves the day and is trying to piece this disgrace together into something alright if this game had been in development one maybe two years and released as an early access game with no prior entries in the franchise it would be fine that s not the case and this is a poor overpriced followup on what was a foundation of many people s gaming history
