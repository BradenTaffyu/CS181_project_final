2013 really disappointing game concept and legacy are promising but after 3 months and 7 patches the developer still hasn t managed to fix the terrible frequent crashes horrible frame rates and graphic glitches this is not because of my system it s community wide the ai is a mess and the game fails to entertain in the long run the multiplayer is plagued by desync issues as well not recommended at all
