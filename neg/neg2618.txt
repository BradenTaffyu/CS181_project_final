team builder finally cleaner menus new announcers franchise mode makeover player likeness for some players which is noticeable and pretty accurate rb fights for yards and falls forward actual qb sneak game play feels sluggish compared to previous years ai defense is terrible per usual players just don t play their zones and don t take realistic pursuit angles user has been nerfed even more on defense i know we don t want madden 20 superman lbs back but at least make the user feel like they re a difference maker especially with how atrocious the ai defenders are oline still broken but better than in madden 24 receivers still don t go after the ball probably my biggest gripe about this game skill moves are nerfed so much that it takes the fun out of using the ballcarrier still get sucked into animations occasionally marketed as physics based tackling which is just not true play a game of ncaa 14 to see real physics based tackling when editing a player it takes you into a separate loading screen that pauses menu music small critique but noticeable if you spend a lot of time in franchise menus overall it s a step up from madden 24 i would give this a positive rating compared to previous maddens but overall still negative nowhere near what we should be getting from a football game in 2024 ea still has the exclusive license to nfl simulation style football games so until that changes this is still the best football game on the market and if your a madden fan your likely gonna buy it anyways like we always do lol also ea refused to put college football 25 on pc so another big middle finger to us football fans i m looking forward to maximum football this year and hoping they can finally challenge ea s mediocre monopoly on football games
