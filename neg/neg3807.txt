2014 early access review this is without a shadow of a doubt the best survival game on the market crafting is in depth the new hd graphics pack is awesome and random maps adds to the immersion however this game has more cheaters and hackers than any other game at the moment if you like korean flybot rpg kill temas and base destroying duping gropus daily then this is for you it is hacker v hacker warfare at the moment and all public servers are infested at the moment its a negative review until the game is stabalised
