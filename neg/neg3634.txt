2020 early access review i ve been playing this game since alpha 7 since early release on steam 2013 its a decent game but overall the devs just keep changing their mind on what they want the game to be the hoard nights are just silly you can t even make an underground bunker in a zombie game why cos hoard zombies can find you no matter where you are and the hoard zombies just auto spawn to where ever you are if you die on the hoard night then they will just auto spawn to you the game movement and graphics are a bit stiff and tacky but if you like minecraft you ll most likely not mind those issues as i enjoyed minecraft and had no issues with those parts of this game also if you spend 10 100s of hours in the game and come back 12months later expect to completely re learn how to play with even basic concepts like leveling up your in game stats save worlds and games become unplayable as well overall it feels like the devs are making a gaming engine by testing all these random things they can later sell to other devs i m sure that s not what they are doing but after 7yrs that s what it feels like in a big way avoid buying until the game is out of early access and is in full release they have enough money from sales to finish the game 7 yrs for a zombie game and the worst part is instead of adding new things they just remove parts of the game or change some minor feature over and over and over and over again like some kind of playable groundhog day edit 2023 10yrs and still in early access going around and around and around in circles
