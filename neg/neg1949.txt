2022 bought a year of premium with the pandemic deal offered in march 2020 played the game quite a lot and enjoyed it for a while but despite 600 hours in the game i still have not reached top tier in any nation the grind even with premium is simply a bit too much especially considering that you will want to have both planes and tanks if you play ground forces now that the premium time is up i have given it a few tries but the game is unplayable without paying for premium you constantly lose sl the currency used to purchase and repair vehicles when playing at the higher levels and the gains in rp research points for new vehicles are not only 50 lower than with premium it also feels like they have been made smaller and smaller over the time i ve played the game more kills and points should mean a higher average rp count but this has not been the case meanwhile more and more tanks are added with higher rp costs which makes it even harder to reach top tier unless they seriously change the earnings there is no way i would return to or recommend the game to anyone else
