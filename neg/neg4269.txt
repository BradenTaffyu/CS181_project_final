2019 sorry but the primary difficulty with this game is the absurdly terrible ai your workers will pick up an item to store while standing next to an empty storage container and for no reason run halfway across the map to put it in a different container if you order them to dig an area above them they will for no reason whatsoever do by climbing above the tiles then digging below them until they are trapped with nowhere to go they will sit down for a snack while suffocating in an area with no oxygen when there s oxygen a few steps away the ai constantly makes absurd inexcusably stupid decisions not based on your base design layout or the resources you make available but just because they are for no reason absolute morons
