2016 it is a great game the biggest problem is that to truly enjoy the game to its fullest you need to spend an absurd amount of money on extremely overpriced dlc simply put the dlc does not offer enough content in each one to justify their price look at rights of man for example it really only adds like 2 somewhat big features and about 4 or so other very small features and it costs 20 dollars insane only buy the dlc on sale also still waiting for that apology paradox
