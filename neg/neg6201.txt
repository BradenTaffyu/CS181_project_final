do you enjoy getting towards the end of games only for large balance patches on your single player tactical rpg that messes with most of your party s builds leaving you in a situation where you re having to relearn your combat approach instead of enjoying finishing the game if so then this is the game for you if not i recommend staying away for about another six months to give owlcat more time to finish messing with things
