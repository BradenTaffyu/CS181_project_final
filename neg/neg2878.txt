yet another game ruined by some launcher login credential reinstalled after a long absence and there is some new nonstandard window popup that just says get started in the middle nah boss i already got started been started and bought the tee shirt years ago i sure as do not need to get started for and giggles before uninstalling and writing this review i clicked the get started button and it took me to an account login creation page there is no way in hell i am ever creating a account for some game especially a single player offline game like stellaris is when i m playing it i didn t agree to the new tos but i ve effectively had my purchase removed from my account time to go sail the high seas i guess hate having to do that but just like crusader kings here i am unable to play the game i legally purchased on steam due to new tos and gatekeeping and other i really miss the days when you bought games on physical media and the publisher couldn t reach into my house screw with my existing purchases and me in the ass
