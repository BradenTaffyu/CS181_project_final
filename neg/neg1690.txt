2022 this is the first generation in the series that full on disappointed me the butchery of the game into microtransaction sized chunks really watered down the experience and made it less and less accessible to folks on a budget the irony being that the sims is such a wonderful escape into a world where we can afford to build and live somewhere beautiful which real life doesn t afford us the sims 3 at least didn t require you to open up the godforsaken origin launcher thing i m so tired lol
