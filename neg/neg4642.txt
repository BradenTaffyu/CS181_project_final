2018 why play this when you have civ v after another 100hrs of playing vanilla civ 6 is alright still prefer a lot of mechanics in civ 5 but it s still has a lot it can hold on its own the only reason i can say as to my continued play is because i really like the mods in the workshop more than civ 5
