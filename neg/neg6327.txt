2023 hogwarts legacy is a game filled with content and variety of activities but it is also a perfect example of why you should go for quality over quantity when you absolutely have to make that choice almost every activity in this game ranges from okay to pretty good for the first couple of hours after which it becomes unbearable boring and tedious and that coupled with the fact that there are hundreds of those activities that really takes a toll on you the side activities are boring the combat is kind of unique but extremely repetitive as it really doesn t matter what enemy you are fighting the puzzles are mostly childish some of them are okay though the open world is needlessly huge and feels incredibly dead the story and characters are cringeworthy thank god you can skip the dialogues and the rpg mechanics are tacked on and completely underdeveloped which is why the get in the way of having fun rather than reinforcing it it is not all bad though hogwarts itself looks amazing and genuine and it really feels like the poured their hearts into designing it hogsmeade is also decent and the season changes were a nice touch the room of requirement and the whole vivarium gameplay was also a cool edition but that kind of customization is not interesting for me personally especially when it doesn t feel rewarding at all as the combat even on hard difficulty is pretty easy the unforgivable curses are properly overpowered and fun to use but as the choices in this game don t matter at all those curses are treated as everything else in the game and that was disappointing the looting is also stupid as it is completely random which more often than not robs you of feeling any sense of reward after exploring something hidden and hard to find at the end of the day this game wore me out completely even before the halfway mark and i had to force myself to get to the end of it which i really shouldn t have done so i personally recommend this game to only the harry potter series fans who only wanted to have a huge triple a open world hp game where they could just fly around explore hogwarts and perform some iconic spells for the rest of us who are looking for a unique fun open world experience this is not it my friends if not for the amazing hogwarts design i d say that this is a proper ubisoft style open world title as all the same tired tedious and boring tropes and design choices are in full throttle here
