fun game being run by one of the greediest companies ever they drop 1 overpriced undervalued bundle a week then drop a 100 whale bundle each season they release 3 or 4 new cards then 2 seasons later they nerf it so you buy the new season pass to get a new op card to fit into the meta just for the cycle to repeat
