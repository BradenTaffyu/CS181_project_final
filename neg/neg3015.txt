2018 i used to enjoy stellaris it was introduced to me via a friend who is a fan of alot of paradox games ironically he wasn ta huge fan of stellaris we played at launch but i was and as a result we played alot many many hours often too longas it d get late or we d end up forgetting dinner as of recently there was a controversial update regarding ftl in the game i respectfully understand that there are people that like and or don t mind the change i hope that with this others can t respect that these changes have ruined the game play experience for me personally and my gameplay partner i really looked forward to the patch where the ftl changes were introduced i was really hoping to build my doomsday machine and essentially erase as many planets as i possible could in a game cleansing the galaxy as well as to some changes to how other mechanics worked like unity choice changes and edicts etc the ftl changes were not on my mind fast forward to game 3 of me trying the new changes not yet realizing the ftl impacts due to not surving very long with an entirely new playstyle i finally get a good game going and some of the new ftl changes become more apparent and honestly it was just boring something as simple as moving around was daunting travel at the beginning of the game felt slow managing multiple fleets at this pace was a bit unfun i also didn t enjoy being forced to use this version of ftl but its okay i kept going due to other changes one misstep and traveling back the way you came is 10x longer all in all as a result of the changes to ftl i can t enjoy the game anymore i gave it a chance multiple chances i stayed positive despite my game partner having a dismal outlook but he played with me anyways but it just wasn t fun for us anymore and we haven t played since i miss playing i even thought about playing on the previous patch to this update but i want to experience the new changes too and its saddening to play the older version and fantasize about what it d be like to have the new features because my recommendations for any game are based off my own experience from them i can t say that i ll be recommending stellaris anymore to my friends who enjoy these types of games
