early access review this is a cash grab by studio wildcard i guess to pay all the high profile voice actors that they got to read their explorer notes because the money certainly hasn t been invested back into the game i don t know a single person who can play this game on ultra settings i can run star citizen at a consistent 30fps but even on minimum settings i m lucky to get that for this game in se especially storms and loading in areas can cause the framerate to drop to single digits completely unacceptable their community posts are spent almost entirely highlighting paid mods expecting people to dole out even more cash for a broken game the price point of the bob s tall tales dlc actually made me laugh out loud you ve got to be kidding me for the non content it adds which is in the base game whether you buy the dlc or not but you ll find things like treasure maps and explorer s notes locked behind a paywall and there s no option to disable them so your world is cluttered with things you can t use unless you drop the full price of the game on that content the server browser is infinitely worse and doesn t allow you to save your previous sessions in any way so unless you remember to memorize the name of the server you re on you ll never find it again when the join last session button inevitably fails you there is little to no new content or bug fixes almost all of the same problems in the original ark are still there still glaringly bad but now little baby dinosaurs sometimes follow the adults around so cool sit s clear the devs just got tired of trying to fix the old game but desperately needed funding so they could continue to work on their paramount show god knows whatever happened to ark 2 at this rate if the sequel ever comes out the only way i d ever spend my money on a studio wildcard product is if it received rave reviews the news comes out that all of the dev leads and the ceo were all fired en masse absolutely shameful go spend your money on games where the devs care this isn t it 0 10 you d be better served re installing the old game if you already own it or have it on game pass or something
