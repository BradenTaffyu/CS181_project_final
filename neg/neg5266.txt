2023 short version this game is basically tw troy set in egypt with workforce added its not worth the current price tag so this game reuses so many things like most of the major or minor settlement maps from troy that there are is only 1 explanation out of the following 2 they rushed development to make up for the hyenas cancellation or they plan to add a third entry into the future and combine troy pharao and whatever into one big map like they did with tw w3siege battles in its current state are broken in my opinion certain towers do not have a firing arc and as the attacking force you just have to mouse over each tower to see which ones dont work and attack here units pushing ladders or towers are fine they move the equipment up and then move up to the walls if you command units to scale the wall by an already placed tower or ladder your unit might just stop moving and decide somewhere in the next 10 60 seconds if it will follow your order or keep getting stuck if your and enemy troops start bloobing on the wall your cpu will go crazy and even though the general framerate is smooth there are constant stutters happening field battles are mostly fine even though i feel like lightly armored units sometimes are way too fast and feel more like a slower cav unit chariots where responsible so far on my end but i only used them in open field so i cant talk about the pathfinding when paths get narrow enemies always sally out of settlements even if its a major one to fight my superior force on the field for whatever reason sea people are just a nuissance to me and dont feel like a real threat but rather an annoyance that attacks smaller settlements the game crashes quite frequently on my end i reduced the amounts of crashes by switching to windowed fullscreen this was an issue in previous total war entries so no idea how it happened again charger units felt more useful in troy in my opinion especially as a moral shock unitthe default campaign settings lead to a mostly scripted campaign where you know who will declare war on you next haven t tried the random start position option with random personalities yet the only new or rather improved and good thing is the campaign customization i would recommend against getting the game at full price and especially do not get the upgraded editions since we do not know the scope of the content at the moment and if the player base and copies sold stays at a lower end they might just use a skeleton crew to make minuscule dlc s
