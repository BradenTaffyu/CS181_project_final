2021 i love this game i really do but the fact the developers backtracked on mod support and seem to want to ring out as much money as possible makes me very hesitant to recommendthe reason i feel like modding is such a stickler for me is theres a lot of ideas that could be built on to the game new building new laws new events stuff the devs seem unwilling to add onto even after 3 years now mind you i think that last autumn is amazing and i wish more of the content they added was like it with a more diverse law options compared to order faith which feel too samey to matterif they opened it up to modding so much could be built onto this game and seeing as development seems to have been dropped i cant see a reason why not
