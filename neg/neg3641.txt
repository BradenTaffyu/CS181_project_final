early access review i ve played 7 days to die on and off over the past 10 years every time without fail the developers have made the game worse don t be fooled this is not the survival crafting game that was marketed to people this is a looter shooter you enter a building with a difficulty level kill the zombies get to the loot crate at the end then hope you found better gear rinse and repeat they have continually made the game less friendly to players that want to survive in a base my most recent playthrough after clearing one of the dungeons i decided to set up my base there i set up a campfire to cook and my character needed water i had settled right next to a stream and went to collect some water so i could boil it and drink it this is how the game always functioned i was then confused why i couldn t do anything with the water i couldn t collect it i couldn t find any containers to put it in as it turns out the developers decided to remove the ability to collect water additionally removing containers for water as well you now have to find water as loot in the dungeons or buy it from a trader they ve done this with everything you have to loot skill books you have to loot weapons you have to loot crafting benches you cannot do anything on your own without at least first looting it from one of the dungeons i don t know if i ve ever seen this level of purposeful incompetence from a dev team the entire purpose of 7 days to die is that you had 7 days to build up a base and defend it from zombies then it continually became harder every 7 days to keep the challenge up now you will find an assault rifle in the first house you loot but will have no idea how to make a crafting bench until you loot the recipe first fun pimps if you wanted to make a looter shooter why didn t you just make one why did you create a zombie survival crafting game and then trick people by making it into a looter shooter later
