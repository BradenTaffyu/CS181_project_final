i ve been playing since release and as negative as i am i have to admit the game has improved since launch it always had a solid foundation and now there s some new heists and dlc so how are things going you ask well there s currently a bug that lets any given player crash the game for everyone in the lobby it s still always online the ui is still horrendous you still can t skip intro cutscenes there s only single day heists gun mods take several seconds to equip and might not even show up individual gun stats are unclear matchmaking still takes a while without crimenet or an equivalent system melee weapons still don t exist there s effectively 4 types of primaries and 2 secondaries with no ammo selection builds are still extremely limited many maps punish players for playing solo looking at you dirty ice there s still no unready button or planning menu updates have been extremely slow and they confirmed months ago that they ll be adding microtransactions in the form of payday credits so at present all we really have to look forward to are three new heists once the other 3 pre announced dlcs drop and the eventual addition of 2 suits 5 suits and a 10 mask they re already in the game files prices and all recently there was a change at starbreeze there s a new game director for payday 3 they apparently play the game a ton hopefully this means things can improve though i doubt it ll happen anytime soon they need all hands on deck to fix this personally i doubt it ll happen soon enough
