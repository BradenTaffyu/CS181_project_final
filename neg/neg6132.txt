2022 it is very clear at the moment that relic is out of touch with the community they wish to go down the route of ranked competitive which is what the minority of players do and they wish to pursue this at the expense of what the majority of players want all the basic features of previous aoe games and new factions they have just released their season 2 and 3 roadmap and after 8 12 months they will finally be able to offer players the ability to change their colour and there is still nothing for factions i m done this game is uninstalled and relic can go die in a fire another of my favourite series ruined by this company and potentially killed off for good
