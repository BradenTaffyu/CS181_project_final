2019 it had all the promise of a decent relaxing game but the devs ignored glaring gameplay issues bugged missions broken dlc equipment and quickly turned it into a dlc farm without a second thought i haven t played this game in about 6 months and within that time frame they ve manage to release around 10 mini dlcs they d rather release new items every few weeks for around 4 bucks a piece than stop for 5 seconds to assess and move to fix issues that have been around since launch the fact that your saves can corrupt for no reason is insanely frustrating after about the 10th time i lost enough progress that i stopped caring when my saves corrupted i have taken to modifying the files since my saves have been corrupted so many times i have no issues awarding myself the max amount of skill points and weapons so i can continue to play the game how i want without worrying about losing more progress every time a save corrupts i re add my skills and levels i had a few dlcs and most of the free content i can honestly say the remaining 10 or so dlc that i don t have currently look like they don t add much besides features that should have already existed at launch with a 60 game the base game is great but you absolutely need the atv dlc so you don t end up frustrated walking everywhere in the absolutely massive maps it s pretty obvious this was a core feature ripped out with the intent of repackaging it as additional content as if the devs wished to trick us into thinking they were doing us a favor by adding a required feature for overall if you re still interested play thehunter classic it s free to play but also a dlc farm if you really want this game wait for one of steam s seasonal deep sales on a posistive note one of the nice features about this game is you can host a lobby with dlc your friends don t have and they ll be able to join and play the dlc items with you but as soon as they disconnect they lose access to that dlc
