2020 can be fun but hard to recommend for various reasons firstly i will just say its not p2w or russian biased it is pay to grind less or not at all with extreme greedy price model mid to high tier tanks cost the price of a aaa game for one tank after 250 hours split across all 3 modes i feel the devs are taking the mickey lets cover the modes aircraft now imho as someone who s got thousands of hours in il21946 ignore steam stats owned 3 copies in total including 2 stand alone prior to it beign on steam and have 3 installs only one runs through steam i feel that its just not there physics wise and look at the age of il21946 go play that a newer il2 dcs etc etc as they eat this for breakfast the naval battles are absolute garbage and feel like a token throw in with no effort put into any parts of it just dont bother only good thing i can say is that it prompted me to try w o w which is the polar opposite so if f2p naval battles is your desire look there last and the only reason i can be close to recommending this is the tank battles when itrs right its a lot of fun reminds me of the heydays of tank battles in red orchestra the issue is its hampered by some sever flaws intentional or incompetent i cant say for sure but i lean towards the former you know feels like the devs went to a certain seminar about whaling as they have been present for so long with zero attempts to rectify the major one is the br uptiering where you get slapped against much better tanks of higher tiers getting your rear handed to you not hard to fix they claim split player base but thats garbage as there is no shortage of players to have more fairer br compression the map designs particularly spans are aweful you often spawn facing wrong way or on a incline you cant drive up theres also some very poor balance on certain maps and or certain game modes oh you don t like map or game mode you cant choose what you want to play why would you want to do that and remove frustration that encourages marine mammals to open their wallets span camping is a huge problem with little to no protection in order to advance you have to earn rp to get this its desirable to win problem with that is the average players seems not to grasp this and instead hunts kills which give you a nice score and coins but not much rp and doesnt help your team in general again the devs know this and do nothing really makes you wonder why once you get past about the middle tier it becomes very hard to pay for damage ammo even when winning so you have 2 options go play lower tier to grind coin or pay real coin theres also some lovely bugs present for years such as invisible tanks and ghost shells ever present to ruin your gaming experience go look for videos on yt to understand in short the only reason it survives is theirs no competition at least as far as tanks go the other modes there is so go try tjhem instead if you want tanks give it a go but expect to stay in low tiers forever especially without over priced premium account which i tried for a month myself but wont be paying them a single cent from now on and i highly recommend you do not either its a shame because there is great potential in the tank mode but far to many issues to recommend it in any serious capacity
