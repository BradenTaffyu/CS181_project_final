2023 i m sure many of you have played gta 5 i m sure most of you loved the story and it s gameplay i loved it too i think it still stands as a standard of quality you would expect from rockstar games but i want you to remember your time not shooting and being disturbed by trevor but rather remember exploring it s world more importantly driving through the streets and highways of los santos speeding through the tight alleys i want you to remember exactly that i want you to remember how much fun you had aimlessly just pushing the throttle on your car and letting it zoom and swerve around the intersections i think we can all relate with the fact how enthralled and immersed in the speed we were how much mindless fun it was now i want you to ask yourself have you ever felt the same in forza horizon 5 that same fun that same speed that same thrill have you ever felt like you really just want to go out and explore the world see the details and drive around mindlessly for hours in this diverse mexico personally if i had to answer that i d say no and you most likely would probably too so why is it that horizon 5 the game that received 10 10s and unblemishing praise from all over fall short of a decade old game which it s priority isn t even driving and mind you would still be amazing if it was completely removed i mean racing playlists in gta 5 have more players than both horizon 4 and 5 combined it s pretty distressing but why is it this i ve been thinking about this a lot actually and it s pretty funny because horizon 5 on paper does indeed look very flawless amazing visuals check a world that is detailed one to one to real life mexico check car physics that are in the perfect middle ground of simulator and arcade check as much as i and the next person want to admit that forza horizon 5 is a bad product it really isn t it is a technical marvel at all levels but as i thought more about it i actually think being that being a technical marvel is the reason why it s such a boring game let me expand see from the moment you complete the starter race that introduces you into mexico you re given the option to pick a car from three choices and like usual nothing is wrong with that every horizon game except 1 has done this but what i want you to focus on are these epiphic cars that are being offered these cars consist of the corvette stingray ford bronco and toyota supra now there is a trait they all share in common you probably already guessed it they are all brand new cars with models only reaching back to 2020 for comparison look at the forza horizon 1 starter car or the forza horizon 2s hell even forza horizon 3s was a fairly common selection you d see on a day to day basis in the real world i think you realize there is a pretty big issue sprouting from this because in horizon 5 you are starting with cars that are exotic prestigious and rare you re no longer building up to these new models the new stuff that schould be achieved you are baby fed it right at the start i ve always seen people in the community say that the end game of forza horizon 5 is bad and that s very true but the problem in my opinion isn t just the end game it s the entirety of the game the whole progression right from the start as soon as you get opened up to the world and do a few races the game throws high end content that should be hours into the game right at your face so much that it even overwhelms you withing my first two hours i had a million dollar house lamborghini huracan a mclaren p1 and also can t forget the 2021 corvette stingray that i got as my first car it doesn t only break the progression but also breaks the value of the cars themselves sure there are over 750 cars in the game but i m only ever going to drive the top 20 top 30 at most as ther is no point in getting in a garbage volkswagen when you have a koenigsegg agera sitting in your garage just after a few hours of playing the reason why this is so prominent is because the progression is no longer based on the races themselves it s based on a bunch of unnecessary systems that only fluff it up for example they added accolades which are apparently for extra progression but in my opinion there is no extra progression added it s just a shortcut that makes it even easier to get better cars or even the car collection bs that has no reason to exist other than giving you extra rewards for the cars you already collect and of course i can t forget the wheelspins that have been even more cranked up than the already crazy and dangerous forza horizon 4 s we re to the point now where you can literally get a few million credits in your very first hour of the game if you re lucky enough there is so much unnecessary and easy progression that takes you to the finish line of the game before you even really started remember when racing games used to be about starting in common mediocre cars and slowly doing races ranking up and really connecting to those cars that you would use and when you finally got your first super or hypercar it was like a true achievement you really felt special yeah well here in horizon 5 exotic cars are no longer treated with the same mystery and privilege they are like priuses roaming in your town there is no sort of car or even thing in the game that may make other players say wow or be impressed everyone has everything and unfortunately by that it loses value and reason to have those things what this in the end does for the bigger picture is that it provides no meaningful progression after the first two hours of playing after you ve got a couple of hypercars that control all the same there s no real reason to keep playing hence the big drop in player base after initial release it s not only the progression that makes the whole game feel boring and a waste of time but also the world s atmosphere and you may be surprised at hearing this as forza horizon 5 s map is usually praised but i think the map is the reason why it feels so incredibly lifeless and dead primarily due to the forced stuffing of it there s pyramids a whole giant stadium in the middle there s a sprawling jungle there s a desert area there s a giant highway there s even three whole towns for that alley way close to close racing action and it does once again on paper seem very flawless but the thing is none of these places really feel integrated into the world it just feels like they were put there just to be put there for the sake of filling up this giant map with no real reason or interesting exploration to contribute for it and honestly that really destroys the whole atmosphere of the game and what the whole location should really feel like horizon s maps were already huge and making the roads wider putting bigger stuff everywhere not only makes 300 km h feel like 50 but also it does not help it feel more alive it does not help it feel more memorable what matters is how well designed and detailed those places are the reason that stands to explore and race in them that s what really matters in the end putting everything into one map will surely give a nice first impression but after that first impression the map will feel as shallow as a puddle and as thrilling as dirt honestly when i think of forza horizon 5 in my head i can t imagine any sort of single image that describes horizon 5 s world to me the whole map doesn t feel like any place it doesn t feel like it s mexico it doesn t feel like any location and that s a big problem becsause if the map starts to feel more like a big arena than an actual living breathing world the whole atmosphere of you driving in this world will start to feel fake i have no more space left to write i m tired and incredibly disappointed please let s make games again that are actually enjoyable games that don t make you feel like you waste your time playing them
