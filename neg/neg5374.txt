whoever is saying it s much better after steel shepherd want to coax you into this hell hole with them i played the beta and bought this on discount during the holiday it s still a frustration to play the devs basically dig the grave for themselves by introducing 4 factions on release and divert resources to console every 5 to 10 matches there will always be some sort of frustrating bug like vehicle getting stuck in building vehicle stopped moving the truck can t even tow weapons properly there is so little quality of life compared to their previous title as if their whole team is made up devs that lack experiences their community manager is basically corporate attempt to hide their bad side and make like they engage with the community but we all know it s basically their attempt to make up for the losses relic is very corporate like don t forget they prioritize microtransactions firsttheir dlc is lackluster as it s an f you to consumers so they didn t get into trouble for introducing premium edition on release don t be like me don t buy this on discount this game does not make your money worth spent it somewhere else
