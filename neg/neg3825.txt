2018 early access review the latest patch a17 made it into a forceful mmo grinder where it s more about looting and bashing zombies than any crafting a complete polar opposite of what the game had been up to this point a game where freedom of choice was the key selling point drop boxes quests and exploration was a good supplement to your base building and now that s simply forced upon you along with a less in depth simplified leveling system and skill system that s from my subjective reality puts the game down the drain loved this game ever since i bought it even with the world resets and what not but now me sideways and call me trump i ll just go and beat the devil out in another better game now staying well away from this bait and switch until things are back in order if ever
