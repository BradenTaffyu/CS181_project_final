2016 i played one full game to completetion and multiple to the glacial grind point as it stands the game isnt horrible but there isnt enough variety for more then maybe one full playthrough i am going to describe my full playthrough experience so a bit of spoiler warning here the early game is great you survery around get your mini quests situation log and major quests which gives you a drive to finish and see what you get you encounter probably 3 4 neutral aliens prismatic ameoba void mining and the gas grazers learn more about them get trait specific options to resolve those quests you research is quick lets you branch out and see what you focus on then you run into another alien empire which essentially walls you off from exploring or questing this gives you three options go explore somewhere else amass a fleet to eventually attack them to get them out of your way or ally with them which is basically the same as conquering them you talk to the empire which is pointless unless you want to trade embassies and wait till you can form an alliance which having one early makes it easier in the late game but ill get there the mid game is alright at this point you have run into a few more alien factions started colonizing other planets to expand your borders and research is starting to slow down they will start offering to trade star charts which ends up being a trap while it is nice to be able to see more of the galactic map and resources they hold it also removes the option to survey those worlds which means no anomolys quests once you see more of the map you start to see that you are now boxed in by alien factions leaving you only two choices ally with them or attack them since the diplomacy screen is basically do you have an embassy most of the time you wont be able to invite them into an alliance but usually that first alien you met will likely join up with you so now you build your fleet that at max consists of 4 different ships corvette destroyer cruiser battleship based off of your shipyard level only 4 for every race faction granted you can customize each ship trying to make a more well rounded fleet with different weapon types but you will fall into hitting the auto best option because you cant counter the different types without knowing the types the enemy has anyways you built your fleet then look at the diplomacy tab to see if the person you are about to attack has equal or less then fleet strength and you declare war you set your war goals anything other then vassalization just means your going to have to war with them again ally ai is set to put thier fleet ontop of your highest military power fleet so now you send your death ball into their system you see thier fleet is numerically lower then the combined fleet of you and your ally and you clash you get to sit and wait as the ships just charge and swirl around each other until one fleet is dead your warscore goes up a bit for winning you need at least 70 to win a war since you decimated thier fleet there wont be anymore fleet battles so now you have to build an army to take planets sit your fleet over a planet until the plantery defense number hits 0 and drops troops if you have a higher number you win and planet taken based off of how big the enemy empire is you will have to repeat this until you win the war you win and now have a vassal which means you now have another ally to help you fight wars the late game and it is terrible research now takes decades even with all the research buffs you can muster you have expanded colonizing frontier posting or integrating your vassals which takes exponetially longer based off thier size one vassal took roughly 100 years entire map is seen you cant finish some of your quests precurser alien quest and some end game event happens mine was the prethorian scourge invaded the galaxy at some point a quest to seize their queen appeared but it bugged out and i couldn t finish the quest the prethorian scourge was systemactically infesting worlds and conquering empires it was a cool event which spiced things up until i realized that the ai factions didnt care about stopping it it was just another day in the galaxy to them so i was like fine i will handle it myself until i realize that the prethorian scourges planets cant be captured or destroyed i had to systemactically go to every planet they had and leave a fleet in orbit bombing so they wouldnt produce anything anymore with roughly half of my fleet capacity left to endlessly bomb unkillable ai i looked at the victory condition page only two options colony 40 or kill off everyone else which essentially boiled down to the same thing declare war on everybody who wasnt an ally or vassal at this point is where the game reaches it most boring and it will happen for evey game you play since there are no other victory conditions build battleships and train armies declare war demand vasslization kill enemy invade planet systemaccally taking over the galaxy which may sound fun but it boils down to number battles you spend more time building then fighting eventually you will win and it will be unsatisfying tldr pros and conspros turnless civ game in space very pretty anomolys quests cool research options for the most part early gamecons diplomacy and everything about it influence could have been an awesome diplomacy resource just ends up holding you back mid and late game end up a boring repetitive slog differences in races and ships this kind of a big one all races and ships are basically the same aside from appearance give me something that plays different no purely robotic race no zerg plethorian scourge should have some sort of playable varient one of the fallen empires has a ring world system i want it why can i not have it final verdicti can t recommend because after one playthrough you just wont want to play another because nothing really will change i have tried ended up the same every game especially the end game which is a snorefest the game has a solid core to build upon and from what i hear these developers actually do stuff so i look forward to the future where this game is a must buy recommended changes more and varied research paths with faster speeds or make a gameplay speed button measured in years because days doesnt cut it more and varied quest missions more victory conditions espionage and better diplomacy use influence an even faster speed up option more and varied base starting points make different empires play differently more and varied ships and weapons wouldn t a militaristic have more then pacifists do something with armies who pays attention to moral
