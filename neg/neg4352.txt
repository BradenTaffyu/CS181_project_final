2017 i waited nearly a year to buy civ vi on sale hoping they d have all the major bugs worked out only to find the game crashing for me after capturing an enemy settler i can tell you this if you like your gaming companies to be competent people who don t try to sell you a million dlcs when basic functions in the game are still broken a year later then firaxis are not your guys if firaxis is wondering why civ vi is selling so poorly maybe they should look to themselves and realize people really hate it when you sell a broken game edit came back 2 5 years later to review againin any case i cam back bought the new dlc on a steep sale and frankly it still sucks not crashing this time but since civ iv there s been a really really stupid trend towards trying to discourage the player from expanding the ai i m pretty sure is cheating and is able to somehow produce more settlers than me while simultaneously growing their cities faster which doesn t really make sense but more importantly is the absolutely idiotic settlement system so a rival is like 5 tiles from a strategic resource i wanted so now i can t settle there and the dumb tiling system means i can t buy tiles from another city until i reach it the system seems designed to curb your expansion while discouraging violently beating up the ai to make it stop forward settling your space it s not really a fun exploration game when the ai continues to forward settle in every single civgame and this kind of thing has been going on since civ 3 i hate the ai so much and i still don t recommend this game unless it s on sale and i only bought the new dlc on sale because i got a fat tax refund and trumpbux so whatever and the stupid continental system still isn t fun every single continent is basically connected to each other in civ 3 you could get these cool maps where you d be isolated on a small island in the sea and have to rush pharos lighthouse to get the early sea exploration to find out if you were just a borneo with other islands nearby or if you were a new zealand distant from pretty much everything else all of the maps in civ vi are frustratingly similar even when i randomize all the settings early 2022 4 years later came back again still randomly crashes
