2023 this game has better graphics than payday 2 but matchmaking is currently uselessly bugged not really a surprise after the terrible release of the payday 2 237 update that got slogged down the community s throat the developers don t ever take feedback from the community seriously or they would revert epic game servers from payday 2 and add an offline mode to this garbage chute of a game everything you want to do in the game is behind a massively annoying leveling system cannot recommend the game overall update weapon leveling glitch on 99 boxes removed so painstakingly leveling weapons is the only way to go there is now some level progression per heist but it s fairly meaningless the developers seem to be intentionally ignoring the wants and needs of the player base as it has been at least 6 months since the failed launch and yet no crime net similar browsing feature for servers no way to distinguish or set preferences for loud vs silent gameplay and absolutely no offline mode in sight shame on starbreeze and the devs for continuing in their short sightedness update 2 game is getting better in some respects the servers sometimes connect you to a map different than what you selected which is odd i hope they fix this bug and add in indications for whether or not players are wanting to play stealth or loud on a map i just spam road rage as a loud only map because often when i get into other maps people want to play stealth and i don t find that very enjoyable myself we are still also waiting for the offline mode we ll probably never see some improvements but most of them are not community driven developments they are developments determined by the game devs i ve switched to payday 3 primarily because payday 2 crashes more often for me now that they are on epic s garbage servers go figure
