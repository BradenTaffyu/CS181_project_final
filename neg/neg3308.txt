2017 tl dr pros lots of replayability countries feel different from each other you can play historically or play with crazy things happening like the us becoming communist very big science tech trees with tens of planes tanks ships special infantry etc for every country co op and multiplayer is very fun and makes the game twice as fun in my opinion since players are mostly smarter than the ai and are more interesting to play with against strategic things are taken into account in combat logistics aerial superiority terrain and the likes cons game gets very laggy in mid late game when countries have huge armies moving everywhere only real way to play is conquer everyone different countries vehicles and tanks etc have few if any differences techs trees and the like are similar with most countries form alliance with these countries or get reasons to wage war against them every country has closely the same infantry air navy tech ai isn t very intelligent peace negotiating is very poor dlcs contain things that should be in the base game though you can download mods to get these features for free hearts of iron iv a great strategy game you can play as any country basically in the ww2 era and the differences between countries is tremendous every country has a unique tech tree although most have the same type of setup it s interesting how there s 3 main factions battling each other most of the time allies axis comintern and you can choose to be any one of the 3 political stances democratic fascist communist or then neutral if you want to avoid getting attacked by huge alliances co op multiplayer i found to be super fun and i d say the game is way better if you have someone else to play with at least for a few playthroughs you can forge very powerful alliances or get a big friend group to play against each other the game basically revolves around war though and it s not really possible to play peacefully or defensively it s just not fun whatsoever the combat system might be underwhelming for some since it s just a bubble showing whether your troops are winning or the enemy your combat effectiveness is decided by logistics terrain support from air forces and of course how advanced your troops and weaponry are you can play the game from 1936 where the game will not follow history mostly and there can be some very interesting alliances and events or you can start from 1939 if you want a more historically accurate game if you play with germany vs playing with a small south american country you re going to have vast differences in gameplay so you can choose how you want to play the game some want to start with huge amounts of factories and manpower and be able to take over countries instantly and some want to fight against all odds with a less influential country you have to take into account land air and often sea to gain an upper hand on your opponents you need to have fighters anti air to counter your opponent s airforce bombers to help your infantry gain an upper hand infantry obviously to capture areas and cause the heavy casualties and ships to block off the enemy s supply convoys foreign aid destroy carriers and whatnot in the late game though the game becomes almost unplayable the lag becomes so bad that it doesn t matter whether you re playing on the fastest time setting or the slowest because they both go at the same speed peace is in my opinion done very poorly you d think that the 2 major things in the game are war and peace but even starting a peace negotiation is impossible 90 of the time the ai is definitely not as smart as you d hope in a game all about strategy and how intelligently you play your country most of the tech tree is the same with all countries but even the ones that have differences like the models of your tanks the vehicles still have largely the same stats as other countries eg russian tanks having the same stats as us ones overall if you can get the game on a discount i think it s worth it but the game has a lot of things it could improve on hopefully things that are going to get improved later on and not with 20 dlcs rating 7 10
