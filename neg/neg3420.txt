2023 the novelty of the experience has dissipated and the enjoyment in engaging with this game has waned i have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the simulation if one could generously term it as such frankly this game appears to be a substantial misrepresentation even in light of recent updates upon reviewing the weekly developer videos one is left to ponder whether they were addressing an entirely different game it strains credulity that any of the developers have successfully managed a city exceeding 100k in population below i enumerate a series of grievances cargo possesses the ability to teleport indiscriminately from one location to another obviating the necessity for any form of vehicular transport absence of toggleable zoning on roads a manifestation i classify as a bug the statistics panel menu displays only half of the chart canines are inexplicably abandoned when a simulated entity utilizes public transportation to a destination beyond the city limits frequent crashes to the desktop occurring approximately every three hours influxes of taxis originating from external locales converging on an arbitrary point idling and subsequently departing the city via ostensibly the most inconvenient route characterized by its protracted duration or sluggish pace occasional inexplicable surges in the waiting on a hearse phenomenon without corresponding spikes in statistical data inoperative post and mail sorting systems hospitals and clinics perennially devoid of medical supplies resulting in diminished efficiency inexplicable preference for exporting over support for local businesses persistent pollution of water bodies unaffected by the passage of a decade despite strong water flow shifts in wind direction notably the barrier island experiencing inland winds leading to the dispersal of pollution over the city discordance between chirps in game messages and actual occurrences within the city the need to mute the radio after 25 minutes due to its repetitive nature devoid of relevance to the city s development paradoxically the game operates at its maximum efficiency on the 1x speed setting while higher settings result in slowdowns rather than acceleration i e 0 5 or 0 2 the inability to sustain a 15 minute simulation run before encountering graphic glitches specifically lod level of detail flickering a discordant and unappealing city soundscape rendering the developer s claims about audio in the trailer incongruous public transport lines sporadically reverting to the default color the flatten terrain tool fails to render the land truly flat leaving undulating hills and bumps in its wake an anomalous phenomenon of building on water in the absence of proximate water sources issues abound in both vehicular traffic and pedestrian behavior surpassing the deficiencies observed in the first iteration of the game vehicles mysteriously despawn while moving at full speed ongoing utilization of a removed pedestrian crossing by simulated individuals peculiar stop start behavior in the traffic ai s interaction with roundabouts at full speed last minute lane changes by the traffic ai involving abrupt stops and 90 degree turns proliferation of illegal u turns throughout the city inducing frustration
