2018 i m going to start with the positive character creation is awesome and fun character progression is awesome and fun being able to return to your base and respec is super cool incase you get bored and just don t like the direction you went in several levels ago now for the badthe first 1 4 of this game is super fun i loved it i thought it was awesome then i got to act two it starts going down hill there by act three its starting to go down hill faster and faster act four it just crashes into the ground and burrows in deep the farther you get in the game it seems like the less the devs actually tried the story is interesting but also convuluted and can be at times kinda hard to follow there are several factions and you have a very goldfish like relationship with them that doesn t make sense one moment a faction is trying to turn you into a mindless zombie and the next moment you are doing quest for them becasue they are good now the combat becomes a mess the way the system works is that you have physical armor and magical armor cc abilities have absolutely no effect unless the armor type they coorispond to is depleted form your target this isn t a problem early game when targets don t have that much armor but late mid game to late game don t plan on using cc any time soon unless that cc is provoke which is devestating when your enemies use it but worthless when you use it let me explain so provoke is an aoe that works even if the targets of it are full armor when you use this on enemies most of the time they were just auto attack the person who uses it when the enemies use it on you however all of your characters will blow all your important cooldowns use all your limited resources and waste all your consumables all those super hard to make get potions you were saving they will just start spam drinking them like they were water that ability that refreshes your cooldowns at the cost of source source being a limited resource for casting certain spells welp you just used it even though its round 1 and you have nothing on cooldown killer charm is also another absolutely worthless effect when you use it but super devestating effect when the enemy uses it the spell charm is worthless because it costs so many actions a turn to use and at best the enemy will auto attack once and then pass turn at worse the enemy will just reposition themselves so when the charm wears off they have a prime spot for destroying you when you get charmed however prepare to watch your characters blow all your cooldowns and go balls to the wall on your teammates with no restraint its just not fun its not fun at all so initiative is based off your initiative score and your wits stat loading points into wits i could still never get first go in any fight at least 1 most of the time 2 enemies always went before me and since the game always makes you group up in a tight square at the start of every fight that is enough for those enemies to just unload aoes on your entire party and leave you nearly dead if not dead npcs will always also have more action points than you i ve counted spells and checked ap costs and yea most of them start fights with 6 ap which is 2 more than you which is a whole nother spell most of the time being how most of the time the enemies will out number you by at least 1 if not 2 in some cases much more this makes fights nerve wracking messes the final boss fight in this game is a trainwreck i can t go into detail about how screwed up it is because its just that screwed up again outnumbered by npcs that are stronger than you and have initiative over you even though you are the one who starts the fight its actually two fights in one and it goes immediately into the second fight after the first fight so any downed party members are gone and health totals armor totals remain what they were before but its a new fight so of course the enemy gets initative over you to spam aoe on you in this barely living state there are also other problems with this fight that i won t go into because they spoil story things but needless to say its not fun a lot of the quests just end a lot of them are very buggy and end without telling you they are over so they are in your log indefinately some of them end bcause you did something that failed the quest however the game doesn t tell you that you failed they just remain in your log unfinished a lot of the quests just have no direction and you are are supposed to make leaps in logic that are just nonsensical unless you read it from an online guide the farther you get in the game the worse this problem becomes by act 4 just don t bother with the quests because they are just aweful messes crafting is aweful in this game complete crap its like they started it got about 30 of it done then called it a day the only thing you will ever really craft are potions arrows runes i mean you might craft food to to an extent the grenades really aren t worth making weapons and armor you can craft are jokes and not funny ones you can craft spell books but chances are it would just be less of a head ache to buy them most of the time most of the stuff you ll be crafting you ll be looking up the recepies online for them because chances are you won t find them in game or at least not before they become to weak to bother with its just frustrating gear this is another big point the loot you get seems to just suck more and more the farther in the game you get what ever random system generates what stats gear have is dumb most of the time you get combinations that just don t really benefit anyone about 95 of the loot drops i got were so so for 2 3 of the people in my party but not exactly great for any of them like when it comes to magic certain schools compliment each other and certain schools kinda contrast water and air go together well because water leaves pools and puddles behind and lightning from air can apply shock through the puddles earth and fire work out because earth tends to leave behind oil or poison which is combustable when you mix it with fire so its head scratching that most of the items you get are something like this armor require a high finesse score to wear not int which is what mages mostly build but doesn t have any scoundrel like boons on it insteal it gives you plusses to opposing magic schools like 2 to air and 2 to earth because those stats just work out so well with each other now i know with the customizable options you can very easily have a character with points in all of these for one reason or another but they wouldn t be your main focus nor what you would want on their gear and even when you get to level 21 the game will still insist on giving you crappy level 16 18 gear that just makes you sigh and shake your head the worse part about all of this is that at the end of the game it just seems so small and empty the first two acts do take some time to get through but the third and fourth act are probably shorter than the first act even when you combine the two the game just gets weaker and weaker and weaker which is unfortunate there is also a finite amount of xp you can ultimately get once you clear out an area its cleared out for good i guess that is fine but ultimately it makes the fights limited and such which may not have been a bad thing being how the combat system gets worse the farther in the game you go i have started a new game several times to try out different combinations i find myself getting past the first act though and then i just stop caring after that i know that its just downhill from there
