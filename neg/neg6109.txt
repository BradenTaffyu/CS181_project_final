2021 i really want to like this game and i do get enjoyment out of it but the only reason this buggy unbalanced garbage would get game of the year is because the state of the industry is so atrocious right now that an unpolished overpriced mess like this still stands above the rest this balance patch should have come out within weeks of release they fixed one of the major balance issues that plagues the game and though they fixed the relic duping bug they introduced bugs which make the abassids the best faction in the game it is not playable because of this crap and any dev worth their salt would have hotfixed it out the very next day here we are nearly a week after the patch and they re asking us to vote for goty for them this is not exclusive to aoe4 it is simply the state of the industry
