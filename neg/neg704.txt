2017 this is in its own right a good game why do i not recommend the game simple and you probably have already gotten the message paid mods the addition of paid mods in a way that breaks the fallout 4 script extender every time a mod is added is inexonerable and disgusting along with the complete disregard to the community s opinion on the matter i may have a large amount of playtime on record because as i have said this is a good game just well not at the current moment i am unsure whether or not the accidents that bethesda have done will be redeemable unlikely ultimately do not let any sales coax you this game should not be purchased right now give bethesda the right message that these actions are inexcusable p s bethesda even if you do redeem yourself in the next es or fo game we shan t forget what you have done
