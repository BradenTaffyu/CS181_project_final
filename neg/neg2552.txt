2017 i have thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in the hunter cotw so far but i do believe the route they are taking this game on is a disastrous one they currently released tents as a 4 99 dlc pack that lets you buy tents in the game place them and allow you fast travel and outpost options i have no problem supporting game companies but you can see how this is going to go down in the future you want a new gun how about 6 dollars how about new bullets that are better than the polymer and soft tip combined 8 it leaves the developers an insane amount of freedom to charge ludicrous prices for things that don t take much work and moves this into a micro transactions based game if i wanted that i would go play candy crush boom beach or some other ios android game i understand the company needs to make money but they are going about it the wrong way they need to focus on larger content releases that are bundled together make a new hunting reserve with 10 new animals 6 guns tent features etc and then charge 20 for this that is content people are wanting and would pay for and you might see your reviews go up because you are asking people to pay for a reasonable amount of content just imagine if sky rim followed this model you start off the game with 10 enemy types iron steel class weapons and armour and 2 major cities if you want glass dwarven daedric armours you purchase the bundle for 5 each separately you want to fight 8 different enemies how does a 10 dlc pack sound oh you want access to the other 4 major cities and their quests 20 each fast travel 5 horse riding 5 it can go on and on however you include that in the base game and you get great reviews and more game purchases i wish the developers the best but until they follow a less sketchy business model they do not have my positive vote for the game i will change my vote if they change their business model and hold true to a game not based on microtansactions
