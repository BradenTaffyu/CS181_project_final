2018 great but what s with the magnetic animals with no fear this is it s biggest downfall the game has many good points but i am going to concentrate on the deal breakers for me number one is the animal behavior for instance i come upon a drinking spot and for some reason the animals have timeclocks and punchcards because it s active between xx xx and xx xxx and sure enough it really is they must be getting paid a fortune to turn up because they will come back in their dozens for their chance to store your bullets in their heads really what i shot every buck out of a herd because they apparently would rather die than go without water for 30mins shoot wait mere minutes watch all the dumb buggers come back to the exact same spot on the drinking hole actually walk over the dead bodies to get a drink get shot again rinse repeat really this is how animals behave i don t think so that is the number one problem the animals don t stay spooked for long enough and it is really really easy to just clobber them all at these need zones i love wandering around in this game it s very atmospheric with a great sense of being there the problem is the animals are way too easy i remember old hunting games like some of the cabela s stuff where you could go for an hour without seeing anything and if you were foolish enough to fire a shot and miss they would run for miles and you would never see anything not these animals i am sure some of them are geriatrics and need to turn up their hearing aids they have all been to the vet too and have had the following consultation vet to patient now now mr moose it s all in your head you just have a little anxiety problem take two of these happy pills with water and have a nice lie down in your favorite rest zone yup it s all in mr mooose s head alright my nitro express round after he gets it after only running 500 meters from my last shot apart from the animal silliness there is the trophy system or no trophy system shoot what you like when you like because it s of no real consequence you will get your weapon xp in any event shoot any dang animal you care too it makes no difference if you shoot one and let it limp off in the the trees to die a miserable death you will just get a little tap on your score and we will forget all about it once you harvest the next one that is apparently integrity jebuz the game engine and the animals apart from the above are beautiful really really nice top marks for that it s a pity the game is just not very enjoyable for the long haul needs something to keep you coming back and not just xp i would love to be able to play for hours and hours and only ever catch a glimpse of a really magnificent animal that i now know is in the game and will have to spend a lot of time hunting down the herds are all the same one or two hards or very hards the rest minors the hard animals are no different to the easy ones in most cases they go down just as easily the only excepton i have noticed is with the bears they will charge you if they are hard and they do seem generally tougher overall a very good game but with no long term gotta keep this one in the favorites list category
