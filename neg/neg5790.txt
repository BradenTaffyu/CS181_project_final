2018 i really did not bother that much with rome ii after they up the launch back in the day but did abstain from a review but now in the light of the sjw pandering which is depressingly plagueing the industry i want to sincerely express my disdain for the way ca has handled the whole issue aggravating your customer base the way ea did with bfv is a stupid stupid stupid idea stop forcing such annoying agendas down our throats with flimsy excuses and tread carefully with other peoples opinions the first patch introducing female generals went largely without any negative feedback but now you totally overstepped shame on you wtf
