2017 early access review i do not buy early access games anymore because of games like 7 days to die not because i hate it but because i hate the business practice this game was released in 2013 its 2017 and still in alpha with no end in sight at this rate this game looks to be in a constant stage of change the developers vision seems to not be focused this is the problem with too may ea games they never seems to have a end goal 7 days to die has sold about 2 4 million copes of the game on steam alone the company has made well over 30 million dollars not including xbox sales yet they are unable to deliver any type of end results yes the game does get updated but at this rate it will be in a permanent state of alpha keep your money stop spending money on empty promises and ideas support games on release if they are good early access has become cancerous to steam as for the game itself its fun the building aspects are strong the survival aspects are solid enough but the ai is woeful update 2020 the worlds gone mad and i got nothing better to do than check out to see whats going on with the game installed it played for 20mins uninstalled the game has gone nowhere the graphics are terrible worse than before do not buy this game it will never be finished edit 20 05 2024game is releasing out of early access in the state its in that is so hilarious what a clown world we live in2024 twenty twenty foureleven years of development and this is the release product loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
