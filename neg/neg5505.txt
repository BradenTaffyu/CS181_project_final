2018 i could stomach over 600 hours of this flat note follow up to the landmark rome 1 but here s what i can t stomach 1 historical revisionism and or authenticity 2 holier than thou game developers if this update is ca s idea of historical strategy and if ella mcconnell s response is ca s idea of managing player relations i m happy to take my business to other developers such as paradox or warhorse i was debating buying three kingdoms as a preorder or on release but given the rocky release of this title in particular and the overall downhill quality of total war since mtw2 i can t recommend purchasing this or any other ca game especially after this and the red shell controversies thanks for the fun ca but i guess we have grown apart
