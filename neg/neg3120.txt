2019 if i could i would give this game a maybe review rather than positive or negative but in light of my experience in game i am leaning more towards negative pros can be fun with friends variety of ships nations visualscons community is really unfriendly although there are exceptions no sense of teamwork completion of objectives among random players certain tier gaps in ships are unrealistic historic ships such as uss arizona uss enterprise and others are locked completely behind a pay wall in regards to tier gaps carrier ships cv are available only in tier iv vi viii and x the amount of xp it takes to research carriers from one tier to the next example tier iv 68 000 xp tier vi us considering that on a standard account even if your team wins you get about 1 500 xp you get the idea for all other ships once you get to about tier vii going to tier viii is really expensive in terms of credits about 5 000 000 when you consider that on a standard account even with a victory you get about 100 000 depending on performance keep in mind you also use credits for repair after a battle as well as for resupplying non basic modules edit based on feedback regarding community being unfriendly i do not mean toxic i mean negative yes there is the rare case of absolutely toxic players that i have encountered but that s about 1 player per 100 or so generally i meant that random people prefer to do their own thing and whenever someone suggests a strategic move they are mostly ignored or completely rejected basically the first two cons listed go hand in hand and yes i agree that it is ridiculous that you can report toxicity where there ins t necessarily any tldr the grind is real overall there are good things about the game but i don t think it is worth it for casual players like myself
