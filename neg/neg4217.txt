2021 this game has a lot of potential the big killer for this game was the enemy a i they spot you from a mile away even if you are crouched and moving slow they shoot with pin point accuracy and will hit you even if taking cover behind rocks they don t even take time to work out where the shot came from or take cover they just turn on the spot and start shooting straight at you if the a i was fixed then i would give this a go again in the future
