2019 could ve been a better fallout game kind of disappointing as i feel like it had way more potential especially after the masterpiece that was new vegasnew combat mechanics and things are okay i guess not sure why the guns look so goofy tho somehow they downgraded from fallout 3 and new vegas to look like cartoon guns if anything they should ve gotten more advanced customizing your gun is pretty cool thodialogues are lackluster generic not as immersive as fallouts previous games the writing quality downgraded for example you could build massive settlements and help factions and people will reiterate the same few dialogue options such as i hope you re not a synth to spy on me also lack of special skill speech checks feel like the factions lost their original ideals lots of inconsistencies with the story anyways a fun good game but just a bit lackluster as a fallout game
