2018 alright honestly i have played a lot of total war games such as rome total war rome 2 total war shogun medieval empire napoleonic i have played those for one reason which was to have fun but there is one thing i hate most in any entertainment thing and that is the inclusion of political things and mentioning of problems that are in the world now i think the reason people are truly mad and down voting this game now are because of your staff member named ella it was handled wrong and should be talked about people aren t mad because of female generals and soldiers but because of the increased rate it wasn t common to have that and the people i know who play it play it because they want to do something that wasn t achievable in real life the introduction of female generals was introduced about 6 7 months ago i believe and i didnt really care that much i think it would ve been wise though to put an on or off button for them though however recently it has become to where it is more common and it has upset a few people i am down voting this game not because of the mechanics but because of your staff and the way it handles things blaming the people who hate the game on them hating women and being mysogynistic is the wrong aproach and should ve been handled differently i know this probably won t happen because of the diversity issue but i probably would ve either asked the ella to make a formal apology for her actions or would ve confronted the issue and fixed it but instead you chose to start blaming others i hope in the future you make better choices
