2017 in short a refreshing new title to the genre of 4x stellaris introduces new concepts and is fun for a while however because of its very slow pacing progression it doesn t have the fun factor and staying power of better titles in the genre it s a good game at its core but some design decisions ruin it for me it will be frustrating if you are a gamer who cares about fun time ratio or just want to feel like you made progress in a play session you will feel like it s a game you d love to love but you never manage to truly get into it because of its slowness and that feeling of playing chained it gives you the good a real attempt at innovation mechanics like immigration population can move freely between planets and empires if enabled robotic synth build able population randomly generated races including how they look anomalies you discover in exploration enlightenment think of it as making city states out of barbarians in civ uplifting genetically engineering pre sentient species to make custom population types with traits you want etc are new and a truly fresh and welcome additions to the genre on this aspect alone the game should be applauded great graphics aesthetics love how planets stars and black holes look a huge time sink which is good for a lot of people but not for everyone since it mostly comes from a diluted experience but if you are the kind of player who likes to stick with a single game for a long time then this is a good investment for you big on exploration it puts exploration back into 4x finding anomalies new alien races derelict ships ancient artifacts and stories of ancient races etc many varied events spice up the discovery of the universe the bad extremely slow i am 75 hours in my first game and i haven t won yet i will probably need twice that to win a single game everything takes forever and is not necessarily fun because too often you feel like the game is doing its best to slow your progress thus a very strong feeling of playing chained keep in mind i am playing on max speed and only pause to issue orders when necessary too micromanagement intensive it is strange to see so much micro in a game that has the universe as a playground it feels like a missed opportunity to focus on macro mechanics tedious and repetitive on some tasks like controlling survey ships system by system and no automate workers option like in similar titles note yes you can shift click to chain commands but you lose the queue each time you find something like an anomaly so that s not practical you will also eventually find a technology to automate survey ships but that s gonna be way down the road and an expensive tech at that when you have better options some extremely unfortunate design decisions one example is that building takes always the same amount of time with no option to accelerate or speed up the process no matter your level of power of technology a planet that has 20 population and every upgrade will build a new power plant in the same exact speed as that other new colony you just built and that has 1 single population if that wasn t bad enough if you have mining network level 3 you can t just build that right off you have to build the 1 then upgrade to 2 then upgrade to 3 each of them taking months of fixed time that can never be made faster not even through buying the damn building with credits like similar games this means that the game starts slow and stays slow no matter how powerful you get this is quite bad because in most games in this genre we accept the slowness of careful building at the start with pleasure and anticipation knowing that playing it carefully well will lead to a spike in power later as things build up into a snowball effect in stellaris you never quite hit that now watch me soar phase it s just a full game seemingly stuck in slow settling phase tedious victory conditions and only 3 of them 1 own 40 of habitable planets not just habited but all habitable planets and the universe is quite huge 2 subjugate all other empires that s a lot too because war is extremely slow i ll explain why in the next point 3 have your federation allies control 60 of habitable planets meaning even if you ally and conquer absolutely everyone there s dozens or hundreds of planets for you to colonize still colonization being capped by influence which generates very slowly and is capped at 1000 storage meaning you can t even stockpile it for the right time tedious and there are no creative victory conditions like the science or cultural victories in civilization just tedious conquest of the whole space one planet at a time even players who absolutely love this game will confess they rarely finish a game because it s so tedious to clean up for a victory warfare is usually where you get to blow off some steam and get some blood flowing in this type of games but nope not here warfare is as tedious and as plagued by slowness as everything else first travel is very slow and traveling back and forth takes forever because your warp engines heat up and need to cool down at every jump and they need also to build energy for a jump second you can t outright capture planets even if you invade them the enemy will take them back automatically at the end of the war the only way to capture planets is to say you want them upon war declaration and there is a point system that limits how many you can demand you can t demand more than 4 or 5 planets each war costs 17 25 points per planet and your maximum points are 100 which makes it problematic and a chore to take down the bigger empires and you can t outright vassalize bigger empires because the score to vassalize is too big over 100 you have to make them smaller first and that goes through slow conquest a handful of planets at a time so you wage war take a few planets have to wait 10 years to be able to declare war again rinse and repeat and this for every empire in the game tedious not to forget that even after you do this you still have to colonize habitable planets that nobody took shoot me in the head please little sense of accomplishment at every play session this is what absolutely kills it for me ok so you took a day off you played stellaris all day and then you go to bed feeling you did absolutely nothing you wake up in the weekend and do another full day of play thinking ok yesterday was slow but today i will make progress nope not happening none of the 4x titles or strategy games in general make me feel like this and it s not a good feeling buy or not stellaris is a gem but a very flawed gem at the moment most of its issues come from a single source the feeling that the designers were singing make it slow make it slow in my mind in the rhythm of let it go from frozen while making it the good news is that this is a paradox game and it is still being worked on will they fix it do they even consider this slowness a problem i have no idea but in the meantime the slowness is the biggest factor deciding if you will enjoy the game or not if sinking hundreds of hours in a single campaign is not a problem for you you will probably like this game it has enough innovation and eye candy to be likable but if you actually want a game that has a pulse and decent pacing and energy this game will frustrate you and you will move on to other titles relatively quickly i would still get it on a big sale just to see the innovations it brings but i definitely don t see this game as having the staying power of better titles like civilizations and endless space in its current state it is mostly something you would buy if you already played and are tired of better games like civ and endless space
