2017 my steam time isn t representative of my play time in this game i had a direct client account from 2013 that grinded ussr up to tier 5 tanks and other nations to varying lower tiers all without ever having a premium account likely 1 000 hours was invested there the good beautiful engine that is able to handle air combat tank combat and soon naval combat all in the same single game client and sometimes in the same game mode no hp bar vehicle internals and crew placement are simulated armor thickness relative to angle is simulated if your shot penetrates and hits something critical it matters if it passes through empty dead space within the chasis it does nothing tier 1 through 3 5 is fun especially in tank combat varying authenticity levels available arcade is fast paced while simulation and realistic are slower with more difficult controls the bad the sense of progression slows down immensely beginning in tier 3 5 tier 4 there is a tarpit in the transition between late ww2 and 1950 s postwar tech in tier 4 5 especially with tanks if you get downtiered against earlier ww2 tanks your late ww2 tank may have a small advantage but if you are uptiered against post war tanks they will easily outperform you in every way and farm you for kills progression xp requirements and repair costs increase exponentially due to being outclassed at least half the time it becomes difficult to consistently earn repair currency or any xp without either dropping back to farming lower tiers with a serious xp penalty or buying expensive post war premium vehicles arcade may be the fastest paced game mode but it also attracts the lowest quality players they troll by ramming friendly fire teamkill via call in bombardment or bombing and complain constantly in the team chat there is a report function but it never seems to be acted upon by moderators the ugly as a company gaijin refuses to let you change the email attached to your login for any reason they don t care if it was your isp email and you switched providers they don t care if you used yahoo 3 years ago and want to change it to secure it after the recent breaches they don t care how much time or money you invested in the account management decided no exceptions because they are scared of people abusing tech support to enable the selling of accounts even though you can look at google and see that account farmers just sell throw away emails with the game account so the policy is futile do not link an email to your steam war thunder account do not give them a cent in premium purchases if anything happens to your email you cannot recover the account and they will not help you the game is better than world of tanks but the company behind it is anti customer and for stupid and ineffective reasons at that if you play it only play it for free
