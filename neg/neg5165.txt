2016 its fun for a bit but the game lacks the depth and content of previous titles i find myself having almost completely lost interest in this game the battles themselves seem as simple as throwing your units into a scrum any sense of tactics or implementing a grand plan usually get thrown out of the window as soon at the units engage added to this the drm questionable dlc policy pricing practice plus the likely limited mod support meaning that the game will have a shorter shelf life gw will likely sue you for even making 3d model in the style of the universe see gw v thomas valenty for these reasons as much as it is nice to see models of your childhood portrayed in a modern and good looking engine the game cannot justify a positive review pushed id give it 6 10 should of continued my boycott of ca products25 11 16 well the dlc campaign is much advanced now and more that comes out the more i am left with the feeling that this was planned content stripping there has been no further balance brought to the game and whilst i can pick this up for a while i soon get bored again still pushed and with fuller content now released would give a 7 10 but only on offer or game of year edition full price this dlc is a rip off
