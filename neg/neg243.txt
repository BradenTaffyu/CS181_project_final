original thoughta rough start for vision of mana a hopeful glimpse beyond the flawsi ll admit giving this game a thumbs down was a tough decision but the cons just outweighed the pros despite the game s potential its flaws are hard to ignore i m planning to explore more and holding out hope that a wave of patches will sweep in to fix these issues first let s talk about the good stuff combat and exploration feel solid and the story has its hooks even if it doesn t stray far from the usual jrpg anime clich s the dialogue can be a bit on the juvenile side and our hero seems blissfully unaware of the chaos unfolding around them just drifting along without a care in the world but hey who needs self awareness when you ve got oversized swords and magical powers right now for the not so good this game isn t a aaa title but it s being marketed and priced like one the textures sometimes look like they were pulled straight from 2015 and some of the effects are questionable also don t get me started on the overall geometry it s quite light on details luckily the amazing art direction and the over architecture shine through any flaws the game might have and makes it quite nice to look at especially the big city after chapter 1 the real kicker for me is the ps4 compatibility we re years into the ps5 era and yet here we are stuck with 30fps cutscenes minimal graphic customisation and pc features that are basically nonexistent no ultra wide support no steam deck resolution it s as if they forgot pc gamers exist square enix in classic fashion seems more interested in raking in sales than delivering a polished product and seriously in 2024 30fps cutscenes not cool having to hex edit the game just to get proper resolution support and pressing f11 twice every time to get cutscenes to run at 120fps is beyond frustrating that s not something any gamer should have to deal with i m willing to change my review if square enix steps up and patches this release but until then it s hard to recommend vision of mana in its current state small updatevision of mana is a game that delivers an enjoyable and engaging experience especially if you re a fan of classic jrpgs the combat while a bit on the easy side is undeniably fun and addictive the wide range of character class customization options adds depth and keeps the gameplay feeling fresh this is where the game truly shines the artistic direction is another highlight despite the technical shortcomings the character and environment art is quite appealing with a dreamy nostalgic vibe that captures the essence of what makes jrpgs special however the game is held back by some glaring issues the textures on background objects are kind of ugly sometimes and the lack of terrain geometry gives the game a dated feel reminiscent of the ps4 era this clash between beautiful art amazing background and poor technical execution can be jarring as for the story it s generally enjoyable but leans heavily into the anime side of things characters often behave like children with the main cast being overly single minded in their goals lacking the complex introspective thinking that would make them feel more like real people rather than just video game characters in general i m favorable toward the game but its technical flaws are hard to overlook players often find themselves tinkering with files and mods just to make the game more appealing coupled with its 60 usd price tag it s hard to recommend a day one purchase unless you re a hardcore mana fan if not it might be wise to wait for a sale
