2018 president john henry eden was right the enclave did nothing wrong bethesda is the true villain and obsidian entertainment is our unsung hero these radical malcontents don t care about you they don t care about america all they care about is fulfilling their own selfish desires the so called brotherhood of steel don t be fooled by their pseudo knightly nonsense or supposed connections to the united states army these power armored boy scouts are nothing more than common criminals with access to some antiquated technology criminals who have had the audacity to claim this country s most important military installation the pentagon as their own personal clubhouse and don t be fooled america those who have left the brotherhood of steel branded outcasts are just as dangerous even more so being in exile the enclave acknowledged the raider slaver super mutant and ghoul issues in the capital wasteland yet were both misguided and held back from doing anything meaningful to rectify these issues by none other than bethesda s shoddy storytelling the enclave was presented as the ultimate evil of the capital wasteland with this notion fueled most notably by our introduction to colonel autumn autumn is a man who is not afraid to kill to get what he wants or to dispose of people once their usefulness has been outlived we the players have the choice to a kill everyone inside raven rock b cause president eden to self destruct and destroy raven rock or c sweet talk the guard meet eden and escape before autmn s orders get you killed leaving everyone inside alive there is the choice not to give the access code to colonel autumn to give him a fake code resulting in somebody s death or to give him the real code which results in your own death to his 10mm pistol what an right we also have the choice of poisoning project purity with eden s modified fev virus a good plan in theory yet this cover all solution would end up killing nearly everything that drank the water save for the enclave and residents of vault 101 unfortunately for the lone wanderer they are not immune to the virus as despite what eden believes they were born in the jefferson memorial and not vault 101 you can choose to let colonel autumn walk away despite everything he s done beneath it all he s just a sad man who let power get to his head now my first time playing i completely eradicated the enclave based on autumn s impression he made them all seem like pricks after forming an educated opinion years later i choose to spare them and instead destroy the citadel in broken steel why you ask elder maxson unfortunately this is not even a real choice as maxson is canonically alive and cannot die in the citadel therefore you cannot prevent him from diverging from elder lyons goals in fallout 4 destroying the prydwen is doing them a favor exhibit a maxson s brotherhood of steel exploited rivet city for its power supply as you know in order to get the prydwen rapidly to the commonwealth i had my engineering team pull her older power plant and replace it with an updated fusion plant we pulled from that aircraft carrier wreckage proctor ingram let s face it where is the closest aircraft carrier in the d c area exhibit b maxson s brotherhood exploits commonwealth settlers for their crops requisitioning them by force most farmers won t be too happy about donating their crops so watch your back out there if you need a little extra persuasion to help with those farmers i got plenty of tools here you could use those farmers give you any trouble i trust you know what to do etc proctor teagan hell even veronica santangelo knew the brotherhood was bad news as in some of her endings she says that their aggression along the i 15 and highways 93 and 95 removed all doubt from her mind that in leaving them she had made the right choice and deep down she understood that it meant their end would surely be soon to follow additionally a bunch of shut ins who scorn outsiders and hold technology over them gee where have i heard that one before also the enclave were responsible for ed e being in the mojave arcade gannon and the enclave remnants were good people too doc henry replaced rex s brain on the institute it feels like a wasted opportunity even if you become the director you can t actually use their technology to change the wasteland for the better and what do they even have to offer anyway synthetic gorillas discount laser weapons fancy furniture teleportation big mountain s already done that oh yeah and who hasn t done fev and why hasn t the enclave already exploited the institute surely the commonwealth institute of technology would have been known to them continuing on big mountain had much more to offer than the institute nightstalkers cazadores and

while a chunk of your brain is cut out boring plot involving a bastardized version of the children of atom vs harborfolk vs synths rivalry between a ghoul and a mad scientist with a group of tribals worshipping fruit you get the point lookoutobsidian entertainment poured their heart and soul out to make fallout new vegas they were unable to get an 85 on metacritic which if they did bethesda would have paid them royalties for their work i find it incredibly ironic how they missed their payment by one point and that one point came back to haunt bethesda look at the score right now and tell me that isn t karma bethesda wronged obsidian and they can only pray that they get them back because they desperately need them tl dr the enclave is better than the current brotherhood of steelthe enclave was held back by bethesda storytelling wisebig mountain technologically surpassed the institute with its only flaw being not having enough manpower to keep the place running properly there will never be a fallout game as good as the one made by obsidian addendum bethesda hq what job do you have here what else i m in charge this whole operation depends on me no todd howard no fallout got the whole fanbase suckling my teats and it feels so good those pricks can all get on their knees and worship at the altar of god howard
