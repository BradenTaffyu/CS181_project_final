2018 edit after i gave it anopther try i grinded my ass through t5 7 and now am at t8 carrier and bb it wasn t pleasant and now the tier divide is even worse as a t8 carrier you very often wont be able to reach t10 ships before they shoot down all your planes at t6 vst8 ships it was possible and very doable but t8vst10 is just impossible and the very opposite of fun can be fun until you reach a tier v 5 ship maybe like 5 8hrs of gametime after that the matchmaking kicks in putting you against tier vii 7 ships not to mention that from tier v to the next tier you need more points than tier i 1 to v combined classic bait and switch tactic luring in with a promise of a light grind and ok matchmaking before tier v you can only meet ships that are one tier lower or higher than yours and thats ok and playable but then after you invest some time you get shown the true nature of this game don t waste your time with this maybe try war thunder but its not that good either the matchmaking is miles better but the grind is tough from the start on
