2021 early access review i will probably be shouting to the waves here in my opinion this is a great game but an unreliable not all of them dev team they seem to constantly get sidetracked railroading into other ideas adding small cosmetic things delaying updates for weeks with little to show all the while showing off good fun and small easily serviceable bugs and a big oh boy this is a hard one thrown into the mix the blogs are so predictable i m barely excited for them anymore build 41 entered beta on october 16th 2019 the pandemic of 2020 gave them ample time to buckle down and release multiplayer i get it they also spent time being safe and with family and i can absolutely respect that but i also believe working from home also makes it easier to work on your videogame yet still only comparatively small things are ironed out with each passing update blog and with this newest one march 11th 2021 now it seems the next reason to excuse any progress is the new noiseworks partnership even though they said they wouldn t be actively talking about this for a while and for what sounds for the wildlife that doesn t exist outside of small creatures who don t even exist as entities and probably more unreasonably lag inducing weather effects and i quote from two weeks ago we currently have a roadmap plotted out for noiseworks over a period of many months and their work will not be appearing or mentioned in blogs for quite a long time it s only been two weeks and i don t much like being told information to distract me from thinking about the laziness of this game s development cycle they should just not say anything until their updates actually bring progress to the people who paid them to play their game and if you re not new this isn t the first time this has happened but for now it s the last time for me i m bummed out playing this amazing game in single player or split screen claims that you want to test it with your development team and then openly posting gameplay with random modders is pretty lame at best you tell players to report bugs so it seems counterintuitive to lock such an integral part of the player experience to the devs and their choice people to be played only two times a week maybe i m just jealous or a pessimist but i loved this game and it s essentially on long pause until the developers get their heads out of the dirt
