2021 people who bought the game before the year of the yorha came out aren t being upgraded to it and there is no way to buy the upgrade i wrote to steam about it they told me to contact squareenix who in turn told me to contact steam and only then steam proposed to remove the game from my account so i can buy it again another instance of squareenix treating fans of their games like garbage and making misinformed decisions that only piss off people who actually care about the products they are selling
