2022 it s almost been 4 years since the release and servers still lag and sometimes crash pvp is almost unplayable mainly because they never removed legacy weapons from players inventory weapons with op effects that are no longer obtainable in any fair way pve quests aren t numerous and you won t find it easy to immerse yourself plus most of the times quest choices won t really have an impact perhaps just 2 or 3 times and you will actually notice graphical glitches aside some quests are still buggy to the point where all you can do is just start them over cooperative stuff gets boring and repetitive quite fast and getting the equip you want with the rolls you want requires a lot of grinding because they re totally random drops not to mention materials farming which probably at some point won t fit in your stash anymore being nearly forced to buy the subscription pass for 12 99 a month just to have a dedicated scrapbox to put them in endlessly you will need to repeat the same 3 4 daily quests for a month or two just to max out your reputation with both settlers and raider factions thus unlocking interesting items you couldn t buy from them otherwise sadly despite the big potential of this game bethesda still decided to not care enough
