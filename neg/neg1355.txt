2022 early access review been following the game since it was announced and supported the second it released numerous hours spent playing and enjoying the content available but most of my time spent was bug chasing and trying to help with the ea and development dozens of features that were promised said to be intended or planned have simply been abandoned the game lacks any real diplomacy the marriage and lord system is incomplete there are no feasts or previous features from warband the main quest still is not finished well over 2 years later smithing is bare bones and exceptionally janky not only game breaking for the economy but also awkward to level and unlock specific things only minor improvements have been made the devs have outright lied whether due to incompetence or willful ignorance we can t add smithing armor the game won t support it this far into development there s a mod that does it we can t add sailing or ship combat like in viking conquest the game won t support it there s a mod for that we can t add visual upgrades to castles towns villages or seperate upgrade systems you guessed it there s a mod for that there s numerous other main features like criminal gang elements and duels or upgrading workshops that remain place holder and untouched the entire ea with no sign of improvement or even mention in the dev notes the multiplayer is bare bones and imbalanced while the game can be fun it s really just a combat simulator with a basic over world map with some very strange ai choices cavalry have all but been nerfed into the ground where they rarely if ever connect with their weapons completely rendering them useless and archers horse archers are basically an instant win in any sizeable numbers you are much better off playing warband with all the great mods that finish a game that was also quite barebones making bannerlord seem even worse in comparison if you really want bannerlord for the upgraded graphics but barebones systems i would wait for a sale and at least a few months after release so that the mods that will undoubtedly fix and save the game are released and stable
