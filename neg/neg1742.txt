2021 you know i never leave reviews but i can t sit idly by while gaijin continues to do this even though it only says i have 190 hours i have closer to 4000 spread over a few accounts a few years back i would have given this game the biggest thumbs up that could possibly be received i loved it i played it day in day out it was my favourite game and will likely hold that spot in my heart for a long time to come however recently gaijin has been taking some steps towards monetization in what is arguably the most scummy and you method to the playerbase that i have ever seen in the gaming industry yes worse than ea not only that but they seem to not care about the opinions of the player base but continue to appeal to the wallet warriors only as seen when they refuse to fix bugs that have been in the game for years but continue to add copy past planes for 60 usd see all f 5 variants the core elements of the game that used to be fun have been ruined their continuining desire to add new things to please the wallet warriors has led to planes that have that been in the game since the beginning such as the me 262 getting its kicked in as it has to face jets that are as old compared to it as you to your parents they re totally disconnected from the community and currently they are trying to implement more features like adding an expiration date to items that we the players have been collecting over the years why is this important you may ask because the only way to get these is to get them from loot boxes that you have to buy and they re trying to get us to do that i really love this game no other game feels like this one does but i cannot in good faith recommend it to you at this point in time gaijin does not care about you and i don t think you should waste your time and money on them
