was disappointed and regrets with the purchase i have a thought that i feel like maybe give them sometime the more i play the more i feel like the game is incomplete especially on the later part of the game few months after launch i feel like nothing much was done by devs and even no mods support till now which the core reason why cs1 was a success then palword released and shows how the early access games should be with the fraction of the price cs2 shouldn t even be released or even as early access as the game feel so rushed and not ready for public yet
