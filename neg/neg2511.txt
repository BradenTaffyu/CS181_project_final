2023 this is a great game and a novel concept the main reason why i don t recommend this game is because it is kind of a rip off you get measly 4 scenarios for the price of the game yes that s it they are hoping that you will pay 10 more for each new scenario that is just insane i ve tried the endless mode and frankly it just gets boring fast the beginning is good fun but then it s just the same over and over so if you can nab this game on a huge 80 off sale go for it it s fun but it s so short
