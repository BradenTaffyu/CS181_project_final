2016 this game is very good i really love everything about it why did i not recommend to purchase this game well just look at their scummy dlc policy and you will soon realise that to get the whole game which you paid out of your ass you need to pay another 60 for current and future dlc they did this in atilla and now they are doing it in warhammer basically they are saying you give me more money please do not purchase their dlc vote with your wallet lets show these corporate scumbags that they can t milk us anymore otherwise the game is very good i always wondered why people use piratebay well it is because scumbags like ca sega you have learned well from ea
