2021 early access review this game is not full of bugs this game is one huge bug literally i d rather donate that 40 euro which i ve spent on this game to whichever charity organisation i would find maybe singleplayer is worth looking at for 50 or 100 hours although i can t even launch the game somehow even after checking integrity of game files
