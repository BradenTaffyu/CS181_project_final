2023 great game ruined by the unnecessary scumbag decision to make the game online only update 9 29 now that i ve been able to put some real hours into it since they fixed their servers i can say that the gameplay is very fun i m having a great time playing when it s working however i am still leaving this review as negative for the following reasons 1 progression only being tied to completing challenges is dumb i have to constantly sift through the unorganized challenge menu to figure out what challenges i can complete to level up you don t get xp just for playing the game in general because of this leveling up is too slow to feel rewarding 2 the loadout system personal weapon inventory mask customization and cosmetics in general all feel like a full step down from what they had in payday 2 i m sure that they ll add more content down the line but the way the ui looks and feels i don t seem to have as much control or freedom in how i customize anything as i did in payday 2 3 i still have the same gripes with the game forcing players to be connected to their servers and forcing solo players and friends to still use matchmaking it s working right now but as we saw at launch it could fail and render the game unplayable it s also just completely unnecessary initial review play with randoms matchmake makes sense right matchmaking with other players over the internet that s fine crime net was better but okay play with friends matchmake would make more sense to have a client host and invite people which worked great in payday 2 but i guess we ll just push through the lagging and the connection drops from your servers play by yourself also matchmake really why why can t i just play offline i m lagging and rubber banding in a single player game this makes no sense starbreeze you already have our money why hold us hostage with your crappy servers and unnecessary nebula accounts please let us host our own games please give us back the crime net menu payday 2 was much better because of these things
