2019 this game isn t bad but i m at the point where it s just infuriatingly tedious repetitive and dull 70 hours in and i m still doing pretty much the same stuff i did at level 2 sure you unlock more stuff but all your stats and equipment are just x increase to your damage playing the skills off each other is great but you unlock most of the ones you ll use repeatedly pretty early you end up with so much gold it s basically worthless which by extension renders half your non combat skills worthless thievery bartering telekinesis lucky charm to an extent the characters and story are good there are many unique ways to interact with story elements eating limbs talking to animals unlocking cabinets but that just means that if you re a completionist you ll encounter the same quest prompts over and over so you ll think ah ha finally time to put that skill to use only to just repeating the quest directions again so yeah repetitive and demoralizing the plot progression is just spread so thinly over so many hours of gameplay it just isn t rewarding graphics are fine but the camera maximum range is zoomed in frustratingly close there are several points where the difficulty spikes with no warning and a few fights especially near the end feel cheap
