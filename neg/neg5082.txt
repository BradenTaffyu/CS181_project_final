2018 first of all to get the complete base game you also need to purchase the king and the warlord and the grim and the grave dlc they contain units that have been cut off from the game some of which are crucial to their factions especially corpse cart and mortis engine for the vampire counts many other dlc had their prices inflated by being bundled with extra short campaigns that nobody asked for and hardly anyone ever played the game itself currently functions as a dlc for tw warhammer 2 required to play the mortal empires campaign
