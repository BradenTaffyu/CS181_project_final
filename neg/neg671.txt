2022 as one of the first of the deck building games this stands tall however there s just enough rng that only a small percentage of games will ever be victorious most of the time when you get into a good rhythm you start crafting your deck just so but if you get that one boss it doesn t matter some bosses are engine and hence game killers end of story you get mismatched such that your deck requires you to plow through a ton of cards and can but the boss hard caps you at 12 there s nothing you can do about it and maybe just maybe you had half a backup well one of the randomizer effects takes that one out swaps it for something entirely useless and nixes that so as a history lesson this game is great but if you re looking to feel like you re in charge and can meaningfully prepare perhaps not so much it s also frustrating that you know you ve lost because the deck isn t optimized but instead of the game allowing you to say as much if you forfeit you re penalized by what starting effects are offered c mon devs why waste people s time like that
