2019 i really really want to love this game there are so many things about it that are amazing but after hundreds of hours playing it really feels like the only way to progress is to look to the oni community for explanations and designs that work this game has an incredible amount of effort put in to the physics but very little of it is explained in any meaningful way within the game the solutions the community recommends feel exploitey or counterintuitive if you want to dive really deep into the forums to get insights into the hidden mechanics this may appeal to you but if you plan to play through this game without copying designs from other people you may run into a point in the game where logic won t get you any farther
