2022 i adore this game and clearly i ve enjoyed it as i ve put some time into it nothing beats the feeling of taking your favorite car wrapping it in a cool livery and going ham on the roads so why am i not recommending it well there are a few reasons and it all has to do with how the devs are running the show the devs will ban you for dumb reasons like making livery that s somewhat political in nature perhaps but then they don t ban the clear cheaters on the leaderboards there are speedzone records that are legitimately impossible without glitching the game and yet the devs seem less interested in going after those guys there are bugs that cause physics rubberbanding bugs that cause visibility issues but the devs would rather release multiple patches to make it harder and harder to obtain super wheelspins they straight up removed the super wheelspin masteries from several cars because they were too cheap to obtain the harder level ai is absurd and does not obey the same physics which bind the players they will rubberband up to the the player if behind but you as a player can almost never catch up to ai ahead of you there s a running joke that you have to ram the ai off the road or else you can t actually win the rewards for a lot of the weekly seasonal challenges are garbage like horns and crappy clothing items speaking of clothing there are a ton of them littering the wheelspins and you re probably more likely to get a pair of socks than a car the game would rather license yet another italian exotic than license actual interesting d c and b range cars there s a glaring lack of european cars and yet we have a ton of ferarri cars and yet somehow we don t have the testarossa where are brands like alfa fiat and lancia and i haven t even scratched the surface of the issues point is if it s on sale or you really enjoy driving and just wanna have fun it might be a good deal for you but i just can t recommend it
