2017 after playing this for a while i feel like this game should have been an expansion pack the vortex campaign is fun the first time through but once you understand the mechanics behind it the fun factor quickly dissipates and the whole thing becomes tedious rather than strategic furthermore since there are only 4 playable races you d find yourself ditching it in favor of the mortal empire campaign and never coming back to the vortex campaign which is supposed to be the main selling point for warhammer 2 i find myself asking could they have simply given us 4 new factions and expanded the old map a bit rather than make a whole new title to sell it for full price unless you re a huge warhammer fan hold off buying this title until it s heavily discounted alternatively wait for warhammer 3 when that game comes out no one will ever touch this one
