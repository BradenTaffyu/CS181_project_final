2013 oh garry s mod 13 why did you have to ruin everything gmod used to be a great sandbox game with a few bugs here and there but then that dreaded day where gmod 13 came out changed everything the game only went downhill by that point for some reason they decided that removing half of the props was a good idea those really cool and useful tools that you use all the time nah we re just going to remove them for you got some pesky bugs in your single player map we don t care since gmod is played multiplayer more than singleplayer you used to be able to build pretty much everything imaginable with the old addons and possible extra addons that you could download from e g garrysmod org but sadly that is now no longer possible obvioulsy you can still have lots of fun with all these new online gamemodes but singleplayer just ain t what it used to be anymore
