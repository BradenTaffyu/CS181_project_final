2021 i would wholeheartedly recommend this game to newcomers at full price were it not for the pricing structure of the base game and its dlcs if you wanted to buy the entirety of the game as it exists today it would cost over 200 as good as the game might be that is obviously a ridiculous price to pay for a game and its dlcs let s say that you ve only bought the base game for 40 it should still be a satisfying experience in itself right in reality what awaits you is a significantly neutered version of a potentially great game and your experience will be akin to playing an extended demo this wouldn t feel unfair if everything in the original game as released was wholly intact in the base version and not locked behind dlc purchases it seems the developer got greedy for dlc profit and decided to neuter their own base game essentially turning it into a demo if you decide to further purchase an expansion for 20 you get a small section of features and content and can look forward to continue to pay much much more for the whole of the game it becomes hard to enjoy what you paid for once you realize that you are actually just playing a small part of a very very expensive game imagine having to pay 10 or 20 extra every time you want to play a new race or try a new ship type or try a new strategy all the way until you ve paid 200 dollars it becomes just a bit ridiculous i m happy to pay a premium price for a great game but 200 dollars is the equivalent of 3 or 4 fresh triple a titles each costing studios hundreds of millions of dollars developing don t be fooled by the pricing scheme of stellaris base game and its dlcs it s nothing more than a disingenuous attempt to wring more money out of you than what the product is worth greedy developers like these make gray market websites seem justifiable it s a great shame because the game itself is quite enjoyable if you can buy all or most of the game on a massively discounted sale 70 or more or an otherwise cheaper method i would say it is worth your buck at full price there are many many other games you should play before buying this overpriced demo base game and its myriad of dlcs that make up core parts of the gameplay
