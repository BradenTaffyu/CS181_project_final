2019 three kingdoms delivers exciting revamped total war gameplay but lacks delivery and replay value to be clear there is no three kingdoms starting point huge kudos are deserved for the upgraded diplomacy features diplomacy is no longer about your very first alliances in game but is now more complex with the ai becoming more intelligent and fluid on harder levels battles are no longer of the time consuming rtwii or medtwii days but look and feel fluid my main issue is with the units themselves there are an overwhelming number of units with countless variations and stats i m still trying to figure out the differences among the number of unique crossbowmen units the reason i write this review is about it s lack of replay value the the fall of the han three kingdoms eras are some of the most well known periods of ancient china numerous warlords rose and fell over the near 100 year period that covered the yellow turbans in 184 ad to the rise of the jin dynasty in 265 ad yet players are only given one period of time to play in the yellow turban era replaying becomes dull as players have to deal with the same yellow turbans and the same petty warlords no matter who you choose each time recruiting legendary heroes to your side becomes more rare than water in the sahara they are extremely expensive when available or already serviced under some unknown warlord across the expanse of china total war should take a note from dyn warriors europa crusader kings even previous total war games and give players the choice to start at a variety of time periods specifically players need the three kingdoms era with cao cao liu bei and sun quan as main figures just about every hero known to players is accessible serviced and set to their ruler until then there are just better more complete games to play
