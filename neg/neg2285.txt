2014 after around 150 hours of flight plus tests etc started without steam client then moved here long post incoming and a bit of rant after the break beware read comments for updates premise part of the negative review is due to the free 2 play model and company moderator policies towards customers community paying and non paying the other part was for having the prices of the packs go up during or just before steam summer sale not a smart nor respectful move if you ask let s see if a negative review hits the soft spot more than a comment cancelled and a thread closed on the main forum to keep people at bay and show only one point of view f2p model not a huge fan of f2p but i gave it a try since i like flight sims this f2p is not pay 2 win but it can get your money out of anger instead of encouraging you to pay for the fun you had oh and to avoid the grindy grind but this seems fair enough like being competitive from the get go based on your skills only not in this game well almost i also don t like this f2p model in particular riot lol is a lot better imho but probably won t work in this game too much advantage if you use some money in the early tiers gamplay levels out in mid tiers after some hard times trying to face paying players at the beginning you can compensate with experience just touched a glimpse of pre end game and it seems to get there again face experienced players and pay to have some advantages or not be at a disadvantage with crews that can only be bought with real money you can also get more strategic choices with planes lineup and some planes unbalanced in many subtle ways that will probably get fixed in the end hard to be sure because of the many variables but i had the impression that as long as a match is between non paying customers some hints on how to recognize them not 100 sure it s balanced otherwise you re facing a veteran player or a paying player in short money can substitute experience as i said not a fan of this model but not game breaking too just pretend you were against a veteran or pay for the product you re using about game modes arcade is quite fun and can be enjoyed without any special equipment typical of the flight sim genre so if this is your case sure give it a try less skill based than other modes just less waiting in queue and more action in game badly unbalanced at times bomber gameplay broken and game breaking matchmaking is questionable at best if you do good it will penalize you with worse teammates some bugs here and there and improvements to be done collisions hitboxes and kill assignment but also positive development on interface features polishing realistic battles are too much of a compromise to me but this is quite personal they can be fun with a friend and spending some money not to be at a disadvantage with crews and upgrades just a warning for all the joystick users you have to just go directly to simulator mode here or might have more fun with other flight games because of the mouse issue arcade realistic battles with joystick vs mouse users if you like a tough challenge mouse users have a sniper rifle joystick users have a knife sure you can win a round or two in close quarters battles but err yeah simulator they re apparently shifting from the simulator aspects towards an almost arcade oriented game i might be wrong but this is not bad per se simulator is tough to get right and is a money sink also not fun for the big audience some really good premises but slow progress on this game mode mainly due to lack of interest by the server population not gaijjin s fault they have a limited but good team on that just lack of interest in this mode though i have to admit that most of the simulator crowd bled away in the past months due to this already starting shift in priorities and some game breaking issues not getting attention bomber s gunner view and sniping precision for example you can stop reading here still with me then probably you re interested in why i gave a negative review the game is good it is fun sometimes not but others have to win you know the 50 win rate rule in competitive games pretty solid server infrastructure the community is a bit harsh on some points but you can almost ignore this aspect and just enjoy the game until until the company policies and forum policies gets in luckily we have a right to post our concerns on steam otherwise the impression given by the forum would be quite far from reality for the average joe let me explain better complaints and criticism are not met well even if expressed in a respectful and hopefully mature form plenty of posts cancelled and or edited for example my second post on the forum got cancelled seen happening the same for at least 2 other people in less than 2 weeks i m feeling bad about not having freedom of speech but you know it s an overrated privilege p example prices for packs on steam went up just when the steam summer sale started so they were 1 euro more expensive even at a 25 discount than before sale started i just replied to someone pointing out that gaijin had the power to fix a matter brought up by the steam summer sale less than an hour later my post was removed and the hot thread closed with people mocked and insulted by a senior moderator for gambling on the sale i mean who wants to pay more for less if i know a steam summer sale is coming i can wait a couple of days to see what i can get complaining for a wrong policy might have been too much but suggesting to evaluate if it could be handled in a positive way is another thing or at least i thought so anyway i perceived the price change as a bad move and i expressed it result i was told i gambled and lost but my money are still in my wallet and they lost 2 sales not sure who gambled here want to do f2p get it right or beat your community to get money from anger instead i don t get it but i might be wrong only time will tell sure i learned a lesson and i am curious about the future of the company and of the game to conclude the review on more game oriented negative aspects almost exclusively about the air combat part of the game ground forces are not my bread and butter many things that can improve gameplay a lot are not top priority matchmaking balance planes battle rating balance flight models and damage models apparently for financial reasons to create artificial shifting gaps that attract money this is not big news i ve seen masters of this strategy in the last 15 years and gaijin is just making some experience in the field if it floats their boat they re right to do so emphasis on new planes sometimes with completely broken flight models might be good or bad depending if you like a good polished game or a dynamic one with frequent news grind is a bit tough but can be accepted if you have patience and dedication progress is like hitting a wall in the late tiers approaching endgame but i admit that i agree with them if you get there you have to pay for what you got honestly i was in the process of doing so just thought that with the sale i could buy 2 packs one for me and one for a friend who played with me up to here just got a bad feeling about this i m going to buy one pack anyway probably because i feel guilty for the fun i had before i just wanted to point things out so they can at least see it i know they don t care but i never lose hope in mankind p other people might be interested as well before committing to the game thanks for reading through hope this puts things in perspective for a game that has so much potential for the flight sim genre and for gaming in general wolf
