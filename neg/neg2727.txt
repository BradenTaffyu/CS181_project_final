2018 let me clarify first i love ed stellaris i played over 250 hours and i enjoyed every single one of them until recently apocalypse 2 0the good addition of titans planet killers is fun and certainly enriches endgame new border expansion system is great and you can finaly precisely build up your empire adding resources to every system new starbase systemnew reactor slot the bad new fleet cap mechanics are certainly interesting and could be great but as it stands they are mostly annoying and limiting fleet limit is hard capped at 200 even if you have endgame research which allows you to potetialy go much further endgame crises are now completely disbalanced with fleets being much more expensive to maintain you can t possibly reach fleet sizes of 1 9 however crises strenght remained the same as an example i had strongest fleet in the galaxy when contingency started one of the nodes spawned inside my empire with main fleet being 3 5x size of my combined fleets and 2 support fleets each had pretty much same size and my fleets together tldr fleet cap got nerfed drasticaly but crises strenght remained the same civics are now just boring and uninteresting expansion ascendency perk got nerfed to the ground moving fleets takes forever and there is no way to respond to immidiate threads in time automatic ship retreat is just meh and it s pretty much rng based the terrible war exhastion or at least it s implamentation is just stupid in 1 9 everything was simple you picked systems you wanted to take you attacked any of the sides reached 100 and war was over in 2 0 most of the time there are 2 was you wars end up 1 you claim systems you attack war exhaustion reached 100 and nothing happens enemy is practicaly defeated and war just drags on and on without any reason 2 you get attacked and enemy comes with bigger fleet and takes several of your systems before you can build up your fleet and or react war is over because of war exhaustion and you lost half of your space pirates are just annoying as hell you can kill as many of them as you can and the just keep comming back with the fleet movement nerfed and fleet upkeed increased it s just really annoying to permanently fly from one side of your empire to another just to kill few of them while bleeding income not to mention to kill theese pirates is completely unrewarding it s just lazy game design if khan faction spawns next to you you are basicaly screwed right from beginning at first they will either raid you and kill half of you resource stations or they with fly through your empire trying to reach someone else while again killing half of your resource stations not to mention when they awake they will expand to every direction and at time it happens there is not much you can do to stop them to summarize even tho 2 0 and apocalypse bring few good upgrades to the table most of new features are either really badly implemented or just plainly annoying not to mention some are completely gamebreaking for now i strongly suggest to stick to 1 9 and wait until paradox fixes these issues or more likely until modders fix our beloved game lancastor out
