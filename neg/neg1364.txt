2022 early access review devs just announced the game s full release in october this product is the final argument in favour of never pre ordering or falling for the early access scheme no matter how beloved a franchise is regardless of the devs previous work i supported the game s ea funding based on many promised and showcased features that will not make it in the end it was supposed to be more than a step above warband we were shown many possible forms of strategic and tactical interaction that breathed life and would have made for a living world with towns featuring notables with their own agendas gangs of bandits staking their claim over areas of the towns themselves a real economy that if hurt through interactions other than do battle would result in enemy lords seeing the quantity and quality of their troops diminish significantly as a result as it stands none of that promised different ways to play the game have any noticeable impact and what new there is only appears late into a character s progression usually by which point they aren t needed anymore smithing your own quality weapon you ll be so rich you can buy twenty of them by the time you can craft just one after grinding thousands of other weapons with a limited stamina system resembling mmorpg crafting grinds except even worse early access means such promises are not set in stone i ve heard that bs excuse too many times but what is by far the most jarring is how broken or lackluster everything else is ai units who still don t know how to climb ladders during sieges groups of ai soldiers standing still and not reacting to the pc approaching until two three of them get killed ai lords on the campaign map dragging their allies into suicidal army battles due to bad positioning and random walk maneuvering tournaments being only slightly better than in warband i ve played warband mods that made them a lot more engaging and interesting early game progression still being a boring slog in certain regards even worse than in warband the companion system being definitely worse than in warband generally speaking the design and execution of this game follow a warband idea with the player having the same goals and methods as in warband but without a superhuman hero of a character who can keep swinging a greatsword cleaving through several enemies tirelessly like a war machine lots of half baked ideas poorly implemented if at all is how i d sum it up the only good thing coming from the release will be the possibility for players to make their own game via mods and inevitably fixing this game s bugs and technical failures instead of the devs because they cannot do in 2 months what they haven t been able to do in 6 years lastly regarding my playtime i ve had fun for about 1 5th of the time i ve spent in it mostly it was regularly coming back to check the state of the game after several major updates coming away very disappointed each time i m sure that in time thanks to mods i ll clock in a lot more playtime but a triple a pricetag for what is essentially a base for modders to work on is most definitely not worth it wait for after release and buy on a major discount
