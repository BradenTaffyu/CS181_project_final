2023 this game has turned out to be a very shallow experience it doesn t excel at anything it attempts the story is mediocre with no emotional moments or pay offs the characters are uninteresting and as black and white as they can be the story is very predictable you have your typical villain and his lackeys who are bad and yourself and your friends who are jolly good there is no depth to anyone your choices don t matter in the slightest the only difference is you re either incredibly well mannered and compassionate or slightly sassy the open world is nice and shiny but in a true ubisoft fashion it is filled with countless repetitive uninteresting tasks which you have to do a hundred times over every treasure vault is just a chest with a generic item you sell 99 of your items anyway the tiers of equipment are useless the mechanic of hidden attributes which you have to uncover in the room of requirement is redundant the lockpicking system is atrocious the amount of craftable items is small and the game is easy enough to not really have a need of them anyway little events in the world such as a suit of armor destroying another one for humming happened every single time i went through the area because of that you can t appreciate it as a little secret detail if you see it for the twentieth time facial animations are pretty bad the puzzles are not diverse enough combat can be fun at times but the variety of enemies is so small and they only have 1 3 attacks per enemy type the order in which you do things doesn t influence any dialogue options finding a fetch quest related item before accepting the quest isn t met with an alternative voice line oh i already found it instead you have to go to the same place and pick the item up again to hand it over the lack of thought that such situations could happen is what differentiates a great game from a bad one it s all about the little details and they just couldn t pull it off here using unforgivable curses results in no consequences for you hogwarts legacy was all hype it benefited greatly from nostalgia but failed to deliver anything but a mediocre and forgettable experience which offers zero incentive for a second playthrough
