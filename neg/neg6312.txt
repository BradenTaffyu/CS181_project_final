my feelings are complicated is this a fun rpg yeah is it a great harry potter game that will make fans feel like they ve had a fulfilling hogwarts role playing experience nope not even close here s some compliments the combat is amazing and strangely violent it reminds me of ac valhalla s crunchy unforgiving combat you don t subdue or knock out enemies you obliterate them gives dark wizard simulator vibes and i enjoyed that the flying is amazingly fun and it s nice to have so many clothing options most of the puzzles and dungeons are fun and just challenging enough the enemies you fight are fun as well especially the trolls hogwart s environment has a good ambiance you have ghosts about and peeves being himself around every corner the suits of armor coughing or the gargoyles having full gossipy conversations is amazing there really are some small details that just bring it all to life the main storyline is perfectly fine most of the side quests are fun however the sebastian storyline really let me down which takes me to my first complaint you are given the illusion of choice in most cases but no matter what you choose to say in any conversation nothing is really going to change i mentioned how nice the customization is with the clothes however most other things are lacking there aren t many eye or hair colors or hairstyles in general and some of them are unusable if you want to wear hats or you prefer to have hair that doesn t clip into everything and that is a major problem there are a lot of details that feel so lazy constant clipping the robes splay in weird ways and clip into themselves certain hairstyles won t fit in certain hats they ll clip out of it on pc the game is constantly losing fps inside the castle it is also frustrating that the actual facial mapping and animation feels more like a 2013 game than a 2023 one and here is the big reason i don t recommend it it s an awful hogwarts roleplay you get to the sorting hat and you basically just pick your house no fun little questionnaire nothing that requires any sort of effort on the developer s side just which house do you want you re sent to your common room and get a dorm to sleep in except you don t sleep there is literally no use for the common room at all it s just set dressing you can go to the great hall but why bother you can t eat there or sit with your house you don t even sit with your house at the end of the game you just awkwardly stand by the door again just set dressing at the end when your house wins the cup they didn t bother to have the voice actor announcing it name your house as the winner it would have just taken a few minutes in the vocal booth to add this not to mention no quidditch whatsoever why do that when they can charge you for the new horrible looking quidditch game being released soon there are also just things that let you down in a wait this is a 2023 game wtf way one of those includes diving missions you just swim to a glowy part of the water press f and your character disappears underwater for a second and pops back up after finding something also don t bother with all 90 of the merlin trials you get nothing but an achievement after doing 40 of them i ve also noticed that there are a few things kind of lifted from the ac rpgs like the constellation minigame and some of the puzzles not exactly a bad thing but if you re imitating make it as good as the thing you re imitating this would be a 10 000 word essay if i were to list every aspect of the game that i found very disappointing it was a let down and it does not deserve the praise it got for every thing that i found to be cool and fun there were two more things that deeply disappointed me i think a good direction for future games would be to have them set in other places in the universe you hear so much about all of these other schools or have a game where you play as an auror the possibilities are kind of endless but it s wb so it probably won t happen
