2019 very limited quest line the game is focused on the base building feature added to the game but resources are scarce and the building system is buggy after playing new vegas this was a big let down the monsters are repetitive and based on your level so there is no real reward for leveling up because the monsters never get easier they tried to stop the community from modding this game in an attempt to cash out on dlc and microtransactions bethesda basically took out everything that made fallout a great game series i swear to god if preston garvey sends me to another settlement being attacked by ghouls i am going to lose my damn mind stop lying to us todd howard
