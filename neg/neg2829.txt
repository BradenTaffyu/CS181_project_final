2018 before the 2 0 patch i hesitate to call it an update as that would actually imply adding to the game rather than removing everything dropped i enjoyed this game before the 2 0 patch dropped i would have defended this game to the last before the 2 0 patch dropped this game was fun unique and interesting alas no more i bought this game back when it used to be unique back when you really felt like you were commanding a unique alien civilisation with their own culture and this all stemmed from being able to choose things such as their preferred travel method warp wormhole or hyperlane or their preferred weaponary missile laser or ballistic in 2 0 however they cut out everything interesting about the game in order to dumb it down and we re left with a bland mess that is just the same as the other hundred 4x space empire games that are on the market all uniqueness gone everything that made it stand out gone what baffels me is why when they butchered the game they picked the worst most boring stupid and overused i can think of at least 20 other space games that use the same stupid mechanic warp mechanic to keep and chucked the more interesting ones away if i wanted to play a game with hyper lanes i would choose sins of a solar empire or one of the other better 4x games that i have in my libary hence why i stopped playing this game all the fun and excitement has just been taken away for me imagine this scenario sovereign your lifetimes are mesured in years we are infinateshepard you need a casus beli to declare war on us noobsovereign that s stellaris 2 0as i said i used to be a fan of this game but that was before 2 0 screw hyperlanes screw my ships taking years to get across my empire by which time the pirates have raided five of my outposts and left screw chokepoints in space
