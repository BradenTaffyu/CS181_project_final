2020 perhaps my favorite game of all time but my god the company behind it is awful broken patches leaving major features broken for months at a time little to no communication on them until i m sorry if they fix it with the last dlc weapon strength modifiers simply stopped working two weeks to publish a beta fix that was modded within a few days two months for that beta fix to go live before that game crashing when a new race lost a settlement every campaign model t posing the pre order race was unplayable for six months so on and so forth with a long list of grudges bugs plaguing every content release bug fix patches being delayed to coincide with the next dlc launch they seem to be getting better about this remains to be seen if they ll hold to it in the past their less profitable games have been left in disrepair see atilla and thrones warhammer 1 was also dropped as soon as this game was released likely to be repeated for game 3 having to pay for blood which they try to cover up by claiming it s about ratings a blatant lie disproved time and time again denuvo shoddy ai that s likely recycled from five games ago ai routinely ignores any limitations the player has special caps currency diplomacy public order knowledge of your armies cities etc none of them apply to the ai boiling strategy down to well total war full eradication to the last settlement is the only way to stop an ai faction no way to economically cripple strategically weaken beyond agent actions or force them to submit the complete experience now costs just under 300 absurd everything from the first game at least should have it s price cut in half they re now planning to release a single lord that requires 150 worth of content to play as games 1 2 wood elf dlc and an upcoming game 2 dlc and labelling the lord as free and just today price hike in dlc again with no communication credit where it s due the art team consistently does a great job clearly on shoestring budgets at times the company has previously gloated about their animators having to work for free for the game to have matchup combat animations but the game is visually great a shame the engine coders managed to botch the visuals from game 1 when importing them i ll leave the other positives to the other reviews really the game s as great as they make it sound if you pay 300 and catch the game during a good patch i just can t recommend putting down a 60 downpayment on an incomplete mess no matter how much i personally love it wait a few years and pick up the full trilogy for 66 off or at least several months to get a finished version of game 2 get yourself a complete comparatively bug free package for much cheaper unless you re a sucker like i am god i hate to love this game
