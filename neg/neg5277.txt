2023 tl dr at the bottom while i was enjoying the game quite a bit everything was ruined as soon as i realized how the ai completely ignores the resource mechanic no i m not talking about buffs and other ai cheats we re used to in ca games but not being affected by the mechanic at all ca please explain how the ai has resources to trade when they haven t built a single resource producing building this means i can t actually affect my enemies by say taking their bronze settlements thereby affecting their upkeep on their good units completely removes strategy from the campaign map it s a shame it took me so long to notice but it s true these games keep getting simpler and less strategic and to add insult to injury they add one sided mechanics made to simulate depth where there isn t any wait for ca to correct their mistakes or a big sale before buying edit added a continuation with a few examples below further none of the added mechanics relating to diplomacy or courts change gameplay in any meaningful way it s the same as always 20 vs 20 stack battles to get anything done here are some ways in which this occurs this list does include some of the standard ai cheats that have been dialed up to 11 want to sabotage your enemy by tanking their public s happiness not really possible against ai they can have the most miserable population on the planet but they re rarely if ever going to rebel that s just for players lol want to get two factions to stop fighting or maybe bribe them into settling as third party kings have done for millennia not possible want to encircle your enemy s cities so that their economy collapses lol the ai is just going to conjure resources out of thin air not a small amount either they ll get as much as they possibly need to keep their armies going honestly three kingdoms is way better the ai cheats absolutely but they still fundamentally use the same damned mechanics as the players bonuses are one thing but ignoring mechanics reeks of a board of directors that refuses to put a single penny into campaign map ai tl dr while we re all used to ai cheats typically in the form of buffs in tw games this time around the ai isn t even playing the same game as the players i mean that literally the ai and players play under different mechanics if you want a deep strategy game look somewhere else if you want to do nothing but fight 20 troop stacks in a game that tricks you with fake depth and a strategic layer with no strategy still avoid this game lol
