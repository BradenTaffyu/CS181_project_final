2023 i m getting around 20 fps on medium settings on a 100k population save game that you can download in the discussions page motion blur depth of field volumetric quality settings fog quality settings and v sync disabled dynamic resolution quality set on automatic if i set everything on high i only get around 10 fps i have a i7 12700k cpu rtx 3080 64gb ram a 3440x1440p resolution monitor and the game s installed on a ssd it s very disappointing that the game lacks proper optimization and is very frustrating to play with such low fps as much as i would like to support collosal i bought the ultimate edition i don t think i can when they release a game in this kind of state i ll just wait for a year or so and hopefully by then they would have fixed the game and i ll buy it again for now i ll just refund on steam and play it on xbox pc game pass because i feel 2 is what this game is worth at the moment
