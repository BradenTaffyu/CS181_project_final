2015 early access review the game became way too realistic 1 hit from a crawler can apparently make you have a sprained leg 1 hit can stun you and make you infected how to stop the infection find antibiotics wich are more rare than a succesful high school relationship or die the game has became a life simulator at this point add a p and h t meter and you are done i know a survival game is supposed to be realistic but they just took realism to the most bull h t level you would think
