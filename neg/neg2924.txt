2018 wish there was a meh rating because while this is a pretty solid space grand strategy game since the cherryh patch it s had a chunk of the fulfillment taken out of it and all the dlc since looks like a money grab for what is in reality very little underwhelming content injection compared to previous dlc s shame really as a result i wouldn t recommend it to a friend but would happily recommend it to an idiot or someone who had more money than sense
