2015 this game is pretty much proof that bethesda can t make any game better than mediocre and should leave fallout games to the guys that made new vegas as they were able to make a far more superior game within a period of a year the story is better than fallout 3 s that isn t much of a challenge as fallout 3 s story was bland boring and pretty all the endings are pretty much the same so joining the various factions is almost pointless and most of the quests aren t that great either on the specs of the game it says you need some pretty high specs in order to play it this is false i m able to max it out with an r9 285 i think bethesda just put those there just to give out the illusion that the graphis are better than they actually are it just looks like a reskin of skyrim without having imrpoved on it that much they ve utterly dumbed down the dialogue in this game they just crippled it they tried to copy bioware s but they ended up half assing that as mass effect s dialogue wheel still offered more things to say as opposed to just 4 different lines on a much lighter note the animations are alright the new designs are pretty nice and they ve vastly improved on the gun mechanics and the voice acting definitely is good sadly steam doesn t offer a side ways thumb otherwise i d give it that so i just have to stick with the negative thumb for now on i m definitely looking forward to obsidian s spin on this i m sure it ll be better than this
