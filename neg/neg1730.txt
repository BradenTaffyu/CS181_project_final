2022 i love the sims and have many good memories of playing it before i had my own steam account i constantly used my dad s pc to play the game however i can see how nostalgia blinded me to liking the sims 4 over time it lacks innovation or creativity details are choppy and you will play for an hour or so until you quit first of all the need for more innovation and creativity is apparent it quickly shows in how they force you to pay for simple aspects of life such as weather animals and even weddings now at least lol even when allowed to make dlc add depth to aspects it shows it is a complete cash grab from every bug and error they refuse to fix to the simple concepts they add to the game and charge 40 it shows the sims 4 is draining money when i first saw they added seasons as an expansion pack instead of a game update oh my word i lost my mind they charge you 40 for seasons and weather then call it a day don t even get me started on the crappy details can we address how ugly the sims look base game they give you jack to work with and then pride themselves in it there must be more poc friendly makeup and hairstyles basic aspects of life has ea ever heard of 4c hair ooh it s the scary ghost of putting effort into hair clothing makeup and skin details it s not like they like the money to add detail to these things i could write an entirely separate essay on how infuriated the hands and feet make me but i won t i love custom content creators because they are the gods and goddesses carrying this game if i had the money to give them to make sims 4 but better i would the gameplay is so dull after a while making you laugh and then cry a little you click get to know flirt marry and then you mass produce a family they go to work eat for 50 hours refuse to listen to you and then die because they didn t there is nothing to explore inside the world except for the park because i don t think people want to use the gym people want to see places they go to daily and explore those environments things like going to the grocery store driving their cars gas stations random small businesses workplaces and schools some of these can be refuted with b but buy the dlc the dlc that gives you three jobs and the ability to own a small business how about the dlc that makes all the jobs playable and the ability to own visit and sell your small business what should dlc be exploring obscure and exciting topics that aren t real or add depth to issues how about the new wedding dlc for example you have to meet your parents what if there were objections to the wedding or a runaway bride what if the dlc worked and didn t take 40 hours or longer to use dlc should be focusing on adding to already in depth topics i need clarification on why you must pay to use critical aspects of life the only dlc i understand is the magical ones because that is not real ea knows we will buy the garbage expansion packs so they make them if there were a lack of profit from the sims 4 more effort could be put into it i m not sure that would happen considering they could quickly drop the franchise and abort the ship dropping the franchise would anger many people and spark further outrage with the game in conclusion this is a definite ea moment i still play with my custom content and lack of a real life the only aspects that make it enjoyable just play imvu or something
