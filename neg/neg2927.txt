2018 i really enjoyed pre 2 0 and played stellaris a ton back then i d have given it a huge thumbs up they made a serious amount of changes in 2 0 many improvements especially around ship design fleet limits and the addition of the new space stations were really nice also how defensive armies work unity tree improvements and i could go on lots of qol improvements however the removal of the ftl types and the new pacing of the game have made the game no longer fun for me it is too slow fleets move around and across gravity wells way too slow and i miss the variety of ways to hop around the galaxy with wormhole vs warp etc there was strategy s to defending or attacking with warp vs wormhole that don t exist now the replaced system for using space stations to defend and turtle is interesting and i understand their reasons but i wonder if you could have done similar with radius based snares to prevent warp wormhole empires from jumping enemy space i don t think it s a bad game now and certainly the new changes are improvements to some people but stellaris is no longer fun for me in it s current state and has become less rts and more grand strategy i think they could have made many of the improvements to fleets design size limits defensive structure and armies as well as balance to the unity trees and the like without the new space claiming system and being restricted to hyperlanes that was the game i was hoping for and the natural progression to the original game i bought i m tempted to say this could be considered a new game in the same engine maybe that s a step too far but it doesn t feel like the game i originally bought and enjoyed which to me is a negative
