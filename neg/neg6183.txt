5 months after the release i thought for sure id get a game that wasnt full of bugs shoulda known better bunch of feats that dont work like the should a few class abilities not working properly some of the special feats your unique companions get dont seem to be working correctly and the load times between areas shows how poorly optimised it is yet again owlcat release a game at least a year before its ready to go to the public stop using us as your alpha and beta testers you always end up with a good game eventually but you also always release a buggy mess if they fixed the bugs and load times theres a good game here somewhere its just frustrating when numbers dont add up or feats work incorrectly or abilities dont work as they should or are poorly explained
