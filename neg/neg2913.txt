2017 standard disclaimer play clock inaccurate offline time not countedgood writing in a bog standard 4x with some relatively minor additional features core game changes without warning as devs change their minds avoid the short version back in the day stellaris looked to be the final word in space empire builders unfortunately everything that made it special has been dumped or edited into uselessness making it essentially a run of the mill space 4x you can t depend on that constantly tries to pick your pocket it has some redeeming qualities that are heavily overshadowed by shortcomings and bad decisions there s a strong bright side make no mistake stellaris is a beautiful game with some absolutely outstanding writing there are dozens upon dozens of events for you to stumble into and explore and they re almost universally written with care and some pretty interesting plot lines conversations are as good as they can be for a script the tech tree is large and well designed and the branching knock on effects of certain techs is refreshing planets have variety and their own quirks making settlement interesting and engaging albeit mind numbingly slow the soundtrack is incredible exploration is fun textured engaging and draws you ever onward just as it should finally and best of all you design your ships and defenses to fit your style within the hierarchy of this beats that the game leans heavily on still the ability to customize gives you the chance to try things and react to new situations and techs but serious dark sides oh where to begin the biggest problem is that the game will change in fundamental ways with zero warning and no input from you if the devs decide the entire method for diplomacy is going to change core gameplay components are going to be deleted or the balance and structure of the game are going to change guess what they re going to change your saves will end up invalidated sometimes meaning empires you spend countless hours on are now junk unless you roll back your game it s like bringing a shiny new convertible home and overnight and without your consent it turns into a pickup truck serviceable sure but not what you bought were this an early access title that d be normal but this is not an early access the game i have now is not the game i paid my money for and if this were the game on sale back then i doubt i would ve bought it where this game used to be 3d chess in space it s now an absolutely standard 2d 4x game with a fancy tech tree good writing and an overly complicated design the devs release dlcs regularly editing the core game to accommodate them if need be and many are largely cosmetic and overpriced the few that add worthwhile elements are ridiculously overpriced the game is needlessly complex complexity is good but having to navigate a web of this builds that this takes that which as the person running the empire should be beneath you much of your time will be spent micromanaging making headway in stellaris quickly becomes tedious as you re constantly interrupted by pop ups asking your opinion reminders and the same bloody announcement you ve seen a thousand times but can t disable it s difficult to have an overarching design when your train of thought is derailed every 40 seconds by some nitwit asking a question that doesn t need asking bottom line stellaris could be a good game should be a great game if the devs stopped messing with it it might be as it is it s a study in frustration needless editing and pursuit of profit there are cheaper better games that won t turn into something you didn t want to play in the middle of the night and push a new dlc in your face every other month
