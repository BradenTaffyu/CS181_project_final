2021 i have played this game since its beta and after nearly a decade i can say this it is a bloated corpse of its former glory between massive content droughts over the last five years we have gotten constant and consistent cash shop updates what began as a well written and well thought out story driven mmo has now become a simple cash grab while i do still play it is solely because it is star wars and i rp which in itself is becoming an increasingly erp driven community with zero care for lore and consumed by posters to give context as to the content portion however in five years we have gotten two operations raids in others games such as wow one of which took them years to release one boss at a time as well as being given constant broken promises and vague statements pvp is admittedly decent in the game but unbalanced as the same few classes and specifications have held the top spots in these five years longer for juggernaut guardian if you are new to the game i would say it is worth playing the base story line and then setting the game aside afterwards forever the vanilla content that of rise of the hutt cartel and shadows of revan were all rather good despite a lackluster ending to shadows of revan which felt more like pandering knights of the fallen empire and knights of the eternal throne shift focus entirely away from class and place it on the outlander which is whatever class you re playing and delves into a story that makes no sense for half the classes in the game as well as is full of rather poor plot holes plot armor and railing onslaught the expansion to follow was a very short lived machine for hype and little more promising a return to the war between the republic and empire as many wanted what we got was an hour and a half of content as such and the next major update brought us back to the drama of the same now contrived and poorly thought out villain from day one which they stated the content was not supposedly what is to follow is now a focus on mandalorian content clearly in attempt to live off of the hype of the hit show overall the game continues a steady decline into mundane mediocrity and simple cash grabs to siphon from the pockets of whales bioware s highest grossing game of all time is perfectly what ea would likely wish it to remain until they ultimately decide to kill it this game vanilla to now is like watching your heroes die a titan fall and everything you enjoyed sullied and ruined few things have broken my heart more than bioware with swtor it is a pathetic and dried husk of a once great thing that once held potential for so much more
