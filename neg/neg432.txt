2021 they said we would be given private servers i stupidly thought that meant that eventually we would get the ability for dedicated personal private servers you know like every other game that has a private server option in the compsci and gaming world this has usually meant some control over the physical layer of our software we basically waited years for this from bathesda that s not what was released with fallout worlds that s not what fallout worlds is instead of being able to run our owned game on our own personal dedicated server my gf and i have to pay for what should be called something else like maybe a custom payed for personal session a custom payed for personal session is very different from what the gaming community has almost always considered what a private server usually has meant for an entire generation i m probably never buying another bathesda game it s such an unethical lie to treat us like idiots to exploit us for more money plus the implications of completely redefining private servers in the game community is frankly insulting and i hope that most people gamers would agree i should have never trusted bathesda i feel dumb for buying this game i m pretty sure it s never going to happen again what a serious insult to our intelligence 100 a year no and never again
