2020 the recent updates haven t been all that great they ve completely missed over the important parts people were complaining about i e overpowered cavalry broken bugged alliances and the stupid loading screen voice that you can t turn off to name a few which is such a waste for a beautiful game with massive potential to be the best total war title pros huge map lots of three kingdoms lore unique playstyles some and lots of new additions heroes like cmon fresh beautiful graphics cons annoying loading screen voice that gets incredibly old after the first 2 playthroughs that you don t have any option to mute lots of units are shared monotonous as well as non historic generals recent updates have made battles in legendary difficulty too easy i was defending a siege in which i was outnumbered 1500 to 300 and yet all the enemy ai did was around until time ran out some other concepts in the game such as spies family naval combat just don t seem fleshed out whatsoever and don t actually live up to their useful potential as the game would suggest i would easily switch this from a negative to a positive review if they just fixed the very core aspects of the game and added an option to disable the loading screen voice please
