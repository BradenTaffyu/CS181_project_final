2023 despite the thumbs down there this is honestly a good game i like this game it s also not the game i bought this is a primarily single player game that has had multiple significant changes to its core mechanics over its eight year lifespan there s also a lot of dlc to fully buy this game at regular price is over 300 and unlike some games with dlc if you don t buy the dlc the new major mechanic added by a particular dlc is in the game you just can t interact with it so if you re not buying everything the game isn t worth playing and this game isn t actually worth 300 and honestly that sucks i liked stellaris 1 0 i liked stellaris 2 0 i guess i m okay with stellaris 3 0 but the fact is i want these games to be different and i want to play them separately and i don t want to pay a hundred per game for these i get that paradox games are niche but i really don t get why stellaris in particular needs to be overhauled like a competitive e sports game when it s a single player grand strategy
