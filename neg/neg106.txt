2017 early access review npcs will most likely never come out i dont care about animation systems or stuff that doesnt affect gameplay i want to not feel alone and bored while playing the game multiplayer is just servers picked clean with way too hard difficulty for my taste and you never see any players until one blasts you in the face with a shotgun and you decide to wait for npcs because they are more reasonable than real humans
