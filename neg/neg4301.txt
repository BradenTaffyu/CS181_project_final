2017 i am very happy to have written this review because it helped me figure out what was very wrong with this game tl dr this is recommanded for new civ players who have not experienced the series yet and will probably have a ton of fun discovering the complex mechanics of a 4x game though i d say civ 4 and 5 are probably a ton of fun as well for veterans this is a glorious no not because of ai diplomacy which have been rightly criticized rather because of stupid mechanics one word tedious what works city building and planning districts 3 the added culture tree government cards could be refined but the idea isn t too bad builders chargeswhat doesn t work ai diplomacy and agendas omg wtf it s awful religion 100 not worth the investment stupid mechanics where is the fun why fun cannot be had for me at least my analysis is this the game has very tedious to optimize mechanics alongside a general lack of challenge this awesome combo makes you feel like you re working without the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment that comes from overcoming difficult odds two examples below 1 eurekas and inspirationsupon realizing specific actions eg building three archers you get a massive reduction in a specific tech cost 50 or 40 of the tech this is available for every science and culture tech in the game the way the feature was introduced by firaxis it seemed that it would allow for civs to go faster upon certain tech routes for example sea related techs for the vikings thus making every game different depending on what happens in your game where you start who you encounter i would call it an organic evolution of your civ depending on the context you re in sounds good sounds like a ton of replayability now let s look at this from the optimizer perspective that is players who cannot play a game without trying to exploit every mechanic in the best way possible that would be me of course we are going to try to get every eureka and inspiration it s a 50 reduction in tech cost for duck s sake even the best buildings don t double science yields but getting these eurekas inspirations is tedious each one has a very specific trigger so you go along the tech tree researching 50 of every tech but no more because you don t wait to forfeit your 50 reduction you just switch techs everytime you reach 50 this is not fun this is the opposite of fun i m certain this is not the way firaxis intended this mechanic to be used in 2 district build costthere are hidden formulas within the game why hide this information from me as an example district build cost goes up the more tech you research if you got 50 tech the district cost will be much higher than when you had researched 13 techs in and of itself it doesn t sound too good already does it but there s a twist if you place your district on the map by launching production it locks the cost so the optimizer will place every district as early as possible then immediately switch production to more sensible things like military units just in order to avoid the cost increasing with tech stupid stupid stupid mechanic it also makes founding new cities completely not worth it past a certain amount of turn because local production will never be able to afford building the increased cost districts what they could do going forwardi know it s easy to talk trash on a game that i ve spent 80 hours on and end up not recommending so here are my two cents on how to make the game better 1 get rid of the eurekas and inspirations or make the requirements harder to attain so that you aren t tempted to go after all the bonus2 improve military ai so as to make the ai an actual danger3 improve diplomacy so that the ai understands it is playing a game that they want to win with this mindset allying the player can be very beneficial if it helps overcoming a stronger opponent or eating part of their empire currently every civ will hate your gut for conquering that tiny roman 2 pop city after trajan declared war on you from that moment on don t ever hope to ally anyone because you re a badass warmonger in the eyes of the whole world let that sink in for a minute 4 get rid of the agendas open or hidden it s stupid the ai shouldn t hate you or love you depending on set in stone conditions related to a historical facts rather they should assess the situation they are in and how allying or warring you makes them come closer to their own victory5 rebalance the whole game religion tourism can safely be ignored 100 of the time military maybe science are the only viable options civs are also wildly unbalanced 6 religious combat isn t right missionaries have always been tedious to manage why make it a unit rather let us manage religion through a dedicated screen that would allow us to specify what city we want to target no more going around the map that s tedious 7 have a sensible formula for district cost8 don t hide formulas from the playerthank you for your time your hateful comments will be disbanded i don t care about your freedom of speech i do care about my feelings fair criticism is always welcome i love being proven wrong i absolutely mean it no sarcasm
