2017 i don t usually write reviews but i was so so disappointed with civ vi and 8 months on nothing has changed that feeling i d say that as of now if anyone is thinking of buying the game just get civ v for a fraction of the price and wait for some actually interesting dlc to be released for civ vi or maybe a really big sale full price is a joke right now i played 380 hours of civ v and i loved it i pre ordered civ vi as soon as it was announced whoops while a couple and no more than just a couple of features were exciting and fun such as the city districts the majority of the game felt so so similar to civ v my impressions were that it was essentially a nice mod for civ v no where near worth 60 i m hoping some dlc will invigorate the game and change it up but 8 months later and they ve only released 25 of civilization scenario packs which is also insulting as these civilizations add nothing new to the game on top of only feeling like a modded civ v they didn t fix any of the major issues of civ v mainly the crappy ai if anything they ve made it worse by adding more reasons for the ai to randomly hate you i ve found that once a rival civilization hates you which can start very early and for very little reason it s just going to be all out war for the rest of the game with a few turns of peace scattered throughout there s no respite not that you necessarily need it as the ai is also stupid and incapable of conducting a proper war or assault and then you get warmonger penalties and so everyone else hates you as well it takes the whole element of diplomacy out of the game there are just so many cons to civ vi and only a couple of pros the changes from civ v are mostly aesthetic which should never cost 60 i m really hoping there ll be some real dlc coming soon to breathe some life back into the game i ll never pre order a firaxis game again
