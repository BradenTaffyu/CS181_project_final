2021 new hack just bricks your save sending you to ng and locking you in the starting area totally trash level network security and lack of support plus unavoidable multiplayer unacceptable the new hack makes the game unplayable online since some sociopath can just destroy your save instantly a friend of mine and i have been looking forward to co op on this for months after doing ds1 and ds2 the day before we were going to start the hack went public and now cheaters are bricking save files left and right bandai namco fromsoft were apparently warned about this exploit years ago and didn t care and i d take odds that it s not going to be fixed now the base game is pretty good played it on the ps4 but the absolutely trash level indifference about years of cheats and hacking from bandai namco fromsoft culminating in this latest horrible hack is unacceptable if i hadn t bought this so long ago i d just get a refund
