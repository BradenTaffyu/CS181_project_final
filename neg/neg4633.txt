2016 civ vi isn t necessarily a bad game and i think once a few patches or expansions come out it will be fine but there are several issues right now that make this a negative review i m also only addressing negatives here there are many positive aspects to the game as well and i suggest reading a positive review after this one game pace everything feels like it takes forever soon after beginning a new game the game attempts balance by ramping up production costs of districts without informing the player this results in never having that powerhouse city for military or builder units unless you completely ignore districts builders the removal of the workers in exchange for builders was a poor choice they are annoying and even with policies that buff them a little still annoying i will be looking for a mod that changes them back to workers religion i haven t played much with religion but what little i have doesn t work well pressure doesn t seem to do much forcing use of missionaries and apostles also known as more micro management poor ai the ai works and doesn t at the same time early game the ai tend to be very aggressive unless they have a trait the steers them away from aggression and sometimes they still are i have had egypt declare war on me when they were 2 eras behind me and inferior in military numbers it s rare that i get through the ancient classical eras without having to defend myself from multiple aggressors for no reason a side note that was nice i have been declared war on by civs which later became my closest allies after an era or two warmongering the warmongering system in civ 6 could almost be called worse than the system in civ 5 while you do lose your warmonger penalty much faster than you did in 5 you also gain it much faster i declared a single formal war in the renaissance era against a civ who settled far too close to me and far away from their home i was immediately denounced by gandhi no shocker there he should as i went against his primary agenda quickly followed by every other civ i knew save one they all called me a warmonger and i never managed to get my relationship with them back up despite centuries of peace and diplomacy technology while the production side of the game seems to drag by the tech seems to go by too fast yes i was focusing on it but that isn t the point the point is that it seems as though the tech tree needs to be fleshed out with more techs it seems that the player can go from swordsmen to muskets unrealistically fast making it feel as though it isn t much of an accomplishment the early fun eras pass too quickly due to lack of techs though this may just be my opinion ui there are also some ui issues such as missing notifications because they are relegated to a small corner of the screen with small neutral color icons bombardment options for the cities are in desperate need of a button size increase more than once i have been unable to bombard an enemy due to the fact a trader was in the city and their icon covered the button for bombardment spies spies are barely worth using if on counter intelligence they are now built ok not a problem really but then must be assigned to not only a city but a district as well requiring multiple spies to adequately defend a city if it is the target of heavy enemy espionage guarding your great works enemy spy reduced your entire industry district to rubble requiring a repair which while short is pointless unless a spy guards the district as it will soon be destroyed again all of this might be forgivable if you didn t have to reassign spies every few turns turning into a micro management nightmare micro management many of the afore mentioned issues boil down to micro management some players enjoy that and i do too to an extent i just don t want it forced on me in so many different ways give us the option for example workers in civ v you could micro manage them if you wanted but if not you could automate them all in all civ 6 has a lot of potential and with a few patches and expansions hopefully not too expensive could become a really fun game for now really think about it before buying and maybe wait to see where it goes
