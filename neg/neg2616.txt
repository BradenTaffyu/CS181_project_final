2017 thehunter call of the dlc it s literally filled to the brim with micro transactions i bought the game as it was seen as a final product then weeks after offical release you spew out dlc which cost maybe not much individually but adds up to the price of another game sure the vanilla game is enjoyable and its very beautiful and that s about it it becomes so linear to one point where you re forced to either buy the dlc in order to enjoy the game or stop playing because the micro transactions are locking you out of the fun pros rich visuals and environmentcons dlc buggy and unstable multiplayer
