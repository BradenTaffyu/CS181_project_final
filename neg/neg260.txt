after finally reaching lvl 100 after 100 hours of playing on and off i can finally make my verdict this game has potential and i want it to succeed but holy f ck this game needs desperate help the menus hud skill system armour system customizability gameplay loop and co operative feeling are a severe massive downgrade from it s 2 predecessors the fixed rng and utter lack of way outta left field thing happening bogs down the replayability so much the armour system is atrocious enough to where you are required to speedrun a heist while your armour dwindles this has been mildly band aid fixed with the addition of adaptive armour allowing you to fully regen but only 1 plate out of 2 if the other breaks you won t get it back until you use an armour plate but that s just it ovk sbz has been band aid fixing issues that require a full rework the menus and ui are so basic it hurts you cannot see your teammates equipment ammo amount etc matchmaking is practically non existent as there s no server browser allowing you to potentially see oh these guys are doing stealth gotta bring my stealth build oh a loud only heist gotta bring my big guns oh deathwish difficulty gotta bring my a game not to mention the dwindeling playerbase only being kept alive by the console playerbase gets worse and worse as nobody can connect to anyone appropriatly even if they do they might not want to do a tactic you do the skill lines are mindboggelingly boring compared to payday 2 in payday 2 i could go hard into a medicbag build while being heavily armoured with an lmg so i never ran out of ammo and a trusty explosive weapon to deal with shields all the while topping myself up with kingpin if required in this game the skilllines are a hodgepot of slightly doing certain things better all the while needing to activate the most miniscule buffs known as edge grit and rush these things are just not fun to mess around with all the time i can t deviate from a certain playstyle like pd2 where i can either go hard into medicbags and armour or drills and c4 in pd3 it s oh grab this so you can constantly keep edge and grit and not die lmao it s gotten even worse where now with the addition of adrenaline overheal the game has become laughably easy but surprisingly for like a few heists you can feel that power fantasy come back to you which is what i see the payday franchise as a whole as a power fantasy arcadey robbery shooter i understand it did not start like this back during pdth but the overall outlook on this franchise has changed i unironically wanna go back to the days of the true ending of pd2 the faces all of my friends pulled being shown what was in this silly little robbery horde shooter was always a blast1 tiny thing however i can give this game is the massive upgrade it has to it s stealth potential over pd2 but even then that s mostly due to it s mechanics such as being able to interact with things in casing mode luring guards via breaking throwing knifes or radio lures we all like to say this game needed more time in the oven or it has a good foundation but needs flavour and i gotta agree i don t know whether it was publishers management or just lead developer issues with the development of this game but please please this game needs a resurgence sometimes q2 3 2024 because it is going to die with a whimperi hope in about a year after they ve added the features they re striving to add as part of their operation medic bag i can come back to this game dedicating as much time as i have in pd2 and hopefully writing a much more optimistic review
