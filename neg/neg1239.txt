2015 i really really wanted to fall in love with this game i was all aboard the hype train from the annoucement the fallout series is one of my favorites which is why after spending 70 hours at the time of this review all i can say is i m dissapointed now keep in mind some of my complaints can be easily added in with mods i m sure some of them are being or already made this doesn t make up for the fact of a lacking rpg system as well as a massivly dissapointing similar endings i ll start with the cons cons compared to the previous fallouts the plot is lacking and more narrowed leaving you stuck with four choices from four factions these four choices all lead up to the same end and whatever faction you side with will bascially just give you very similar side quests despite the craftable weapons from fallout 3 returning you actually can t craft them at all you have to find them this will probably be a future mod weapons and armor don t deteriorate i m sure this will also be a future mod when in conversations your stuck to four choices to reply with most npc s you will have conversations with are linear straightforward less interactive and you most likely won t be able to chat with them again ie asking them questions trying to find out rumors etc for a launch the game is riddle with quite alot of bugs and crashes but i m sure most of them will be fixed with the next patch the side quests or at least most of the ones i ve come across are extremely similar to eachother ie go kill raiders at this camp for us now go kill mutants at this camp with few unique side quests however the side quests follow the old oblivion questing system the higher level you are the more unique side quests appear compared to the previous fallout new vegas it appears they tried to adopt a similar faction system to vegas but there are very little factions you can side with brotherhood of steel the railroad minutemen and the institute all the endings are very very similar and hugely dissapointing with the only biggest difference coming from if you sided with the insitute quests to get to the final missions for these factions are different however settlements are tedious to micro manage making you spend over an hour improving them when you have more than one and it s a hassle to find junk aka building materials to go collect and hold onto since most add carrying weight notes and holotapes you collect over time don t have their own tab for themselves they are thrown in miscellaneous with magazines bobbleheads bobby pins and keys this makes this very aggervating when you have collected a lot of items in miscellanesous over time when you need to find a specific note i m sure this will be a future mod the loyalty system for companions in this game is somewhat lacking when it comes to rpg when you maxed out on a companion on friendship romance they will have nothing else to talk about with you for rpg fans this will be annoying for rpg fans this game is has less rpg elements than the previous titles and more focus to combat the companion command system isnt as good as fallout new vegas s command wheel some of my friends have complained about disorientation or delays when in first person i cannot tell for myself some enemies appear to have a unlimited supply of grenades which becomes more of an annoyance rather than a challenge no skill tree system and reworked perk tree system is a bit dissapointing compared to fallout 3 and fallout new vegas legendary enemies can mutate fully healing and wasting your precious ammo there are a lot of companions in this game and if you collect most of them they start becoming hard to track when you switch companions out i m hopeful for a companion tracker mod pros the massive improvement to gunplay much better than previous titles the diversity in enemies armor weapons and power armor customization settlements until you get to many has some pretty interesting plot twists even though the plot isn t that great lots of companions to unlock compared to the previous games lots and lots of guns as well as melee weapons despite the lacking plot the main questline missions are usually diverse until the ending missions and are pretty fun graphics are much better compared to the previous titles the game appears more challenging compared to the last fallouts even adding legendary enemies to fight and drop a legendary weapon vats is much more balanced and improved power armor is improved and adds a different mechanic when in combat compared to having none overall the game is very addicting and fun however there are simply to many flaws for me to recommend this game if you want a more rpg experience and a cheaper price then totally get fallout 3 or fallout new vegas if you don t own it i cannot recommend the full price for this game wait for a sale or buy the game when it s cheaper otherwise i recommend waiting for future patches future dlc and future mods which will improve the game and possibly change my thumbs down to a thumbs up tl dr game is very fun but is also a dissapointment compared to its predecessors wait for the game to be cheaper if you think you can muster i ll give it a 6 10
