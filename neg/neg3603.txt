2018 early access review i m going to be negative about this one the game has great potential and the concept is really interesting the sandbox in combination with a zombie apocalypse and a 7 day threat cycle works very well that being said the development of the game as well as the communication to the players is really lacking you d expect that given the amount of money the game has generated the fun pimps could have up scaled their development team more and more rapidly given the time span of 5 years since this game is released some other in my opinion bad practices of the company include releasing a really rough and unfinished version for the consoles and not making sure this version is even updated yes they outsourced this to a third party but they are still responsible for their product and shouldn t have made the decision to release for consoles in the first place not enough focus on making the game stable the game has glaring bugs for years issues with mini bikes or backpacks with all your stuff in them disappearing as prime examples the random world generation is very rough the game is poorly optimised to name some examples yet instead of focusing on these issues tfp keep re implementing entire systems the ui how inventory works the weapons vehicles etc people generally respond to this with but this game is in alpha polishing will be done later i disagree with this the longer you keep bugs alive the harder it ll become to fix new bugs that start to arise don t build on a poor foundation or things will start to collapse no focused modular updates instead of focusing on one or a few major aspect of the game in each update tfp attempts to rework many distinct systems all in huge updates in the next update i count a total of 12 major systems that are being overhauled this greatly increases the time between updates makes testing harder and doesn t expose the individual systems to player feedback before work on the next system starts poor and inconsistent communication with the community madmole the main developer that does most communication with the community has the tendency to sometimes disappear for months moreover when he does appear he does have the tendency to sometimes flame people that disagree with him with the support of his ever faithful backers he sometimes but rather inconsistently uploads rushed gameplay videos on which it doesn t really appear that he knows really well how the game works these in my opinion bad practices have made me lose faith in the fun pimps making true the potential of the game while i like the game in its current stage at some moments i cannot recommend a game that is this rough and has so little promise of getting improved anytime soon i do really hope that there will be a day on which i can change my review to a positive one
