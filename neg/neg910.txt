2017 paid mods the game that was the short version the long version is that fallout 4 is on release a bare bones game it s actually the skeleton of a game waiting to be filled by the community and yes the community has filled that skeleton building upon it transforming it into a great game there are thousands of mods i personally play with 130 others play with over 200 using this great library of free mods you can turn fallout 4 from the empty shell it is into one of the best games on the market so what do the creators of this game do well dear ol bethesda decides to implement paid mods 5 per mod even so you can enjoy their game not that they are good mods weapon and armor skins mostly not mods that actually fix or improve upon the game in any other way but that in itself is actually fine let them have paid mods separately so folks can nicely ignore and let their creation club just wither away which has been happening so what does dear ol bethesda do well here s the kicker they keep releasing updates that don t do anything to the game itself just modifications to the paid mods creation club market and these updates break f4ske the real thorn is that 99 of the mods out there use f4ske which is fan made as an essential tool in their mods so without f4ske you have no free mods forcing unnecessary updates from modders who either are not active anymore or have little time to spare to make it short bethesda is intentionally releasing hack updates to break free mods so you are forced to buy paid mods so instead of paying your 60 for the game and it s dlcs you also need to pay 8 for the creation club and then pay 5 per mod to make the game playable so yeah bethesda wants me to pay 130 mods after finding their paid equivalent 5 assuming they would all be this cheap a minimum of what 650 to just play their freaking game in a actually working and fun manner fallout 4 has been turned by greedy executives into paid mods the game as a conclusion if you don t mind being constantly reminded by the game to buy paid mods and you enjoy paying for what used to be free content then yeah go buy the game if you do not want to be treated like a cow to be milked for your hard earned money then do not purchase fallout 4 there are plenty of other games out there that respect you as a consumer than go play elex or witcher 3 games that respect you for buying them which reminds me of something else something a lot of people have been asking for lately bethesda please i beg you please let obsidian make fallout games from now on they actually make good games
