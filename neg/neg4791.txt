2018 this game is really fun at first but there aren t very many orders so once you finish them you re stuck doing the same thing over and over again it gets repetitive quickly and you don t have a great selection when it comes to paint furniture etc it seems that the devs don t care much about what people are saying because every update is just optimization rather than adding more stuff to do creating more disappointment update even a year after this review this game is trash not only have they still added nothing to the base game other than a few sinks but the save system no longer works i redid the same house three times making sure it autosaves and manually saving it just to come back to it in it s original state after trying to restore my save file using the user backups the title screen somehow became playable and my timer is broken and it no longer loads my progress i had six houses left until i was done with the game and lost it all after two minutes of trying to restore my save files the game is repetitive buggy and continues to disappoint it s obvious the devs don t care about the quality of the game also shown in their overpriced broken garden dlc and now that the save system is broken i give up on this game don t buy it unless you want to be severely disappointed and support devs who either don t know what they re doing or don t care
