2013 sadly creative assembly has done it they managed to outdo the mess that was the launch of empire total war this game is flawed in so many ways that it would almost be funny if it were not so frustrating and sad even after seven quite large patches this game has gone from a total mess to a slightly smaller mess that is the good news i guess the a i is if i am honest is not up to par with that of the original rome total war and that was released in 2004 there is still a massive issue with overall performance specifically when it comes to frame rate drops on even extremely high end machines the game itself feels as though it was made to appeal to a wider audience by this i mean it has been dumbed down extremely the ui for example is very barren when it comes to information the research screen is poor in choice and the government screen is close to pointless it just seems that the two steps forward shogun 2 gave this franchise are gone and instead ca have not only taken three steps back but have stumbled from those three steps down a massive canyon into a river floated miles away and washed up in the middle of nowhere the final thought from me is to just wait on this one wait not only for a price drop but i would say at least a year or so till ca has managed to make this into a complete and working game this was highly disappointing
