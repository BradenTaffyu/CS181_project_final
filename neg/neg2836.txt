2019 i have hundreds of hours in stellaris it always had its flaws but it was always so much fun the latest update dlc destroyed that now the game is a tornado of micromanagement cryptic interfaces further created criminally stupid ai destroyed playstyles and endless waiting until enough time passes that the game engine bogs down so much and turns take so long that you just start over stellaris needs major attention and in its current state i cannot recommend it at any price
