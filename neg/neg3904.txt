since 2019 5 years now this game was supported and updated by a dev team called evil empire founded by an original dev of dead cells for some insane reason motion twin has been scrubbing their name from the rightful credit that they deserve and cancelling further support for this game that was planned to go into at least 2025 with big updates they even blurred evil empire s name from the credits in the upcoming animated show they are now also using dead cell s name to push their new game as the creator s of dead cells when not even half of the original team and none of evil empire is working on their new game this is exceptionally shameful corporate like behavior truly unacceptable do not support these devs
