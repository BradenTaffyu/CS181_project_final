2021 alright so here s the scoop i m a huge fan of the sims and like most of the other reviewers i ve seen the evolution of sims games sims 3 was absolutely phenomenal i loved it when sims 4 was announced i hopped on the hype train ready to have a great experience but i didn t what a lot of people don t know is that the sims 4 launched missing several key features from previous installments including the removal of the toddler life state and the removal of family trees traits have been pruned into the oblivion so with the base game you only get about 15 to choose from as opposed to the 30 40 from the base game of 3 some of the missing features were eventually patched in after ea received a lot of backlash for it but the game still feels empty pros a lot less lag than sims 3 my worlds don t take 15 minutes to load graphics are more vibrant than they were in previous titles build mode has been greatly improved and allows for a much better experiencing when creating homes and buildings sims now have moods that affect their actions and how they interact with others i e angry sims stomp around and scared sims have the option to take a nervous poop cons one of the best and most interesting things about the sims 3 was that the map was much more open world zoom out of your house and see whose visiting the local parks the community pool entering and exiting buildings you could control your sims even if they re all the way across town the sims 4 does not let you do this neighborhoods are sectioned off so each one has a loading screen when travelling between them if you go to visit a gym in another neighborhood you have to take control of either that sim alone at the gym or the rest of the family back home you can switch between whose active but you can t control both at the same time a lot of furniture and items that were available in the base game of sims 3 are now locked behind dlcs several years later i noticed bugs where i command my sim to do something and they just stand there staring at nothing this sometimes requires a restart if it goes on for too long you can no longer control your pets this is one of my least favorite changes between 3 and 4 in sims 3 you had the ability to control your pets there s a lot less life states to play as in this game 3 had pixies witches werewolves vampires and genies which all had their own unique wishes lifestyles and gameplay elements you can no longer create custom patterns or choose colors from a color wheel when in create a sim or when placing furniture you are bound to whatever choices of colors there are by default this absolutely murdered creativity the sims 4 although i enjoy playing it and creating sims and homes is a shell of it s former self do yourselves a favor only buy this game when it s on sale especially the dlc there s over 1000 worth of dlc now with some of the dlc costing as much as the game itself if not more ea should be ashamed of their business models in nearly every game they ve released in the past 10 years disgraceful
