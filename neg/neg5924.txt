2019 pretty bad optimization for a game this simple take a full 3d game like left for dead 2 or portal 2 and such those games run better than this simple 2d background 3d model game also there are pretty much no graphics settings other than resolution in the game itself pretty upset with the quality of this game especially since this is pretty much just a port of the mobile version i can t play the mobile version because i use android version 4 4 4 which is not supported so i don t know how much worse that version of the game is i liked bloons td5 and some of the the ideas that this game has but switching to 3d models was very unnecessary also having voice acting for some monkeys was an awful choice and the voice acting is kinda cringey
