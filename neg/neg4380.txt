2022 a good game at a base level but it seems with every update more technical issues are added when they should be subtracted and with almost every playthrough i have now accompanied by a crash or an infinite loading screen forcing me to shut down my pc entirely most of my enjoyment i have with this game has been removed and that is why i cannot recommend it
