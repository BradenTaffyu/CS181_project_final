2022 early access review 9 years of ea limbo some updates introduced good stuff like the item level rework better zombie behaviour etc some introduced bad boring stuff like the skill rework the individual skills are fine but being forced to put valuable skill points into basic strength agility int skills to unlock other skills instead of increasing those by doing stuff from said skill tree like in the old system is just terrible but good god the optimalization boot up a custom map 8gb around your base drops down to 4 2gb walk into a larger city imma take 13 gb of your ram for sh s n giggles i will probably change the review if stuff improves but right now just no
