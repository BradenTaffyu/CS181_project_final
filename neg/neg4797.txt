2018 not worth it at the moment at the price they are asking and i will briefly explain why first the performance the game really doesnt run very well at all even on a high end machine it can be very choppy i tried lowering the graphical settings but to be honest it seems to make no difference whatsoever which is odd considering the graphics are hardly cutting edge in fact i would rate the visuals as well below average second the bugs oh the bugs the game is completely full of bugs which i could forgive if this was an early access title but it isnt electrical sockets you cannot remove so they get in the way of placing objects walls you can demolish but upon a restart they will suddenly reappear only they seem to be a hologram as you can walk through them potential buyers claiming they only want a single bedroom not two even though there is only one bedroom in the property broken doors that you get rid of but then cant place a new door in the same place making it look odd not being able to place curtain rails or they will place but hover magically 12 inches from the actual wall and scores of people for who the game wont load up at all these are just a few examples of the list of irritating issues in this game lack of content there may seem like a reasonable amount of items when you start playing but you will quickly realise that you will only ever use a handful of the same things for example there is a list of various premade kitchen layouts almost all of which are terrible i have only used 1 of the many pre mades so your only other choice is to build your own fitted kitchen from the various cabinet types corner unit cabinet with sink drawer unit etc but there is only 1 design yep every kitchen you ever build will look absolutely identlcal to every other one you have built the only choice is the colour you have around 5 or 6 colours all of which are quite terrible so you will use either creme or white who wants lime green or luminous orange kitchen cahbinets then there is one oven and 2 gas hobs to choose from so yes every kitchen you ever design is always exactly the same the other thing is almost nothing matches design yourself a living room and nothing matches anything else or the things that look similar dont have the same colours available for each item its like a pick and mix house that jack built from charity shop second hand dealers there is only 1 carpet that comes in 3 colours a beige a blue and a hideous green there are around 5 colours of wooden flooring and around 3 or 4 types of wallpaper im not kidding when i say every single house you buy ends up looking pretty much like every other house you buy you cant even paint window frames or doors so you have 1 door design to choose from that come in a staggering 3 colours you also cant demolish outer walls or replace or move windows why you cant do anything whatsoever outside of the house again why why cant we cut the grass or paint the fences or anything this is supposed to be house flipping 15 is just too much to ask it is at best a 9 99 game probably leaning more towards 6 99 as a reasonable price for what you get only get it on sale
