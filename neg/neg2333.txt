2017 as you can see i have spent some time on this simulator while i enjoyed the first few months the sim quickly became repetitive i found myself counting the minutes until the next dlc so far it seems that a new state is added every 10 months so that gives you 10 months to drive around a state that you will have seen all in one month leaving 9 months of the same by itself that may not be such an issue but combine that with the same two truck dealers you have had since day one and the joy starts to disappear according to steam about 800 000 people own this sim however this sim only averages about 3700 players a day the daily number spikes a little with each patch or dlc these numbers reinforce my opinion related to the pace of development it seems that most users lose interests in this sim well before dlc releases but we keep coming back with high hopes only to be greeted with the same cycle play for a few weeks wait for the next dlc if you enjoy experiencing a variety of trucks and challenging drives through the mountains of oregon or utah this game is not for you i you enjoy driving through the desert states of the southwest with the same truck for two years than this is the game for you i had high hopes for this sim but it appears that the devs are going in a different direction than i had hoped to be fair there are trucks in the workshop but they just don t compare to what is officially offered i have no complaints about the gameplay sound or visuals scs had done a great job with that it is just missing that thing that keeps you coming back that thing that keeps you interested and challenged variety
