2016 for tldr people full review below score 4 10verdict fallout 4 is a major decline to the series while it had it s moments they were so far and few between i felt like i was playing another game that wasn t good either if you love fallout 1 to nv you will most likely want to avoid this game bethesda does not seemed to have cared about this game in the slightest and it shows a lot as you get passed the first 5 10 hours of gameplay if you have never played a fallout game before i urge you to get fallout 3 and or new vegas with the dlc and save a load of money and time and have a better rpg experience in the process full review observations main and side quests i honestly can t even remember most of the quests let alone what they were about unlike fallout 3 and new vegas i could tell you all about quests in detail for days and hell even fallout 2 i could probably recall how to do the quests if i thought about it enough the rpg elements are pretty much all gone in this game and have been replaced by a animated poster with a load of perks that are completely useless for certain playstyles and require no forethought on choice for the most part because there is no level cap and you can eventually get every perk i often skipped most of them besides a few crafting ones i was forced to get because of the amount of weapon choice in this game and ones that gave me more damage boosts the leveling system it s even worse it feels like am playing a free to play mmo with the way a lot of the side quests are just repeating themselves shut the up preston you stupid with no real differences to them besides being in different areas and a feeling that at any moment i was gonna be offered xp boosts for cash to start popping up on my screen oh and all your specials can be maxed out what the the speech system is a complete and utter joke the basic function of the speech system in the game feels like it was ripped directly from mass effect except your character has a massive mental deficiency and even with using a mod that replaces the wheel does little to help the options of a stop light system of give me more cash checks and oh come on tell me more yet you ll only reveal either useless extra info or a vague hint at something else checks and you ll most likely be failing the easiest checks 50 of the time unless you have charisma at 7 or higher or you have a rabbits foot up jammed up your ass also the classic fallout humor is beyond devoid from this game the settlement and crafting system is just a big no i didn t even try to put in mods to change this because besides crafting mods for my weapons so they aren t limp condoms in combat i had literally no interest in it after the 5 or 6 hours of exploring the crafting system i did the brillant crafting system of new vegas is gone it has been replaced with optional resource farming you can literally build a farm for some resources or just scavanging everything like you are the star from american pickers shops are useless for the most part i never had a need for them in the time i played this game and maybe had a total of 4 purchases early game on my first playthrough because you can easily get all the stuff you need in the wasteland because its just thrown at you like vomit from a overweight kid who got sick in a chucky cheese ball pit after eating to much but if you re horny for crafting and settlement building and are impatient as you can buy most resources from the shops spread about the world dlc good god i am glad i didn t spend 70 on that season pass all that has been released or going to be so far is for settlement building and the like while far harbor from what i hear is okay but is quite short and is mostly fetch quests and the automatron dlc is literally 2 4 hours and doesnt take you anywhere new modding besides a few mods to fix bugs and crashing and the speech system i had no drive to want to mod this game in the slightest compared to fallout 2 3 and especially new vegas to which i modded the hell out of them other comments why the are there so many cats in this game albino deathclaws highly unlikely in general especially out in boston what the is this honestly just ruin the lore even more brotherhood are still cuddly teddy bears and trust you way to easily thou some people love them this way story seems like it was written by the developers kids honestly it s dreadful and no cares could be given to it karma system is gone completely you cannot be a completely evil character you can try but you never feel as evil as you could in fallout 2 and new vegas in this you are kinda just a semi sarcastic the skill mags weren t half bad interesting twist on the formual one of the few good things about the game most of the fallout lore is gone from the games of old and what is there feels like it was put in reluctantly gunplay is decent and has been improved a lot over the previous games thou the melee combat feels completely untouched dogmeat isn t a complete halfwit and his tricks are cute good character customization voice actors for both your male and female characters are npc voice acting is hit and miss only memorable ones for me is stephen russell nick valentine and codsworth and brendan hunt travis miles bethesda admits to not really giving a about the dlc for this game tons of bad why the and oh for the love of moments conclusion thank you bethesda for taking a game series i grew up with and adored and giving me what turned out to be unwanted and nasty reach a round whenever i see this title on my game list i feel sadness and regret it also makes me hope someday obsidian or some other studio is allowed to make another fallout and bring it back from the infested hole the series is currently festering in you bethesda war may never change but this fallout sure has
