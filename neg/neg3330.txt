2017 it s good but it s just not quite good enough the economics side of the game is really well modeled all your equipment and weapons take on a new importance in terms of industrial production requiring some careful thinking and foresight so as to avoid mid game issues striking balances between military and civilian factories according to your foreseeable needs makes for an interesting meta game aspect early military build ups may take preference for military factories for instance but can you afford to let go of those civilian factories for much needed resources the player will definitely ask themselves questions like these throughout the game diplomacy is thankfully more fleshed out this time round with a new option to create factions and non agression pacts actually becoming usable in single player a smart reasoning system has been implemented making npcs react to the player country in certain ways it s as entirely viable for example to create a faction via threatening force against your neighbours as it is to do so with a charm offensive by improving relations trade has been simplified in an interesting way swapping civilian factories for a set number of resources so no more painful micro managing of trade deals to get 100k of all resources combat is also pretty well done with battles taking a little longer now compared to hoi3 and a raised emphasis on success at the operational level which can be accomplished a number of ways thanks to doctrinal foci commanders intending to build a strong infantry based army heavily supported by artillery may wish to adopt superior firepower doctrines while others focusing on a more mobile tank led military would prefer doctrinal training for mobile operations the use of tactics form a major realistic part of battles now with better skilled commanders more likely to use better tactics in order to win battles at this stage you might be thinking why am i not giving this a thumbs up well there are a few reasons ai issues is a big one the ai is rather weak in terms of its intelligence it remains tied by feet and hands to the battleplan system which is a really ineffective way for it to fight on many occasions as it will perform rapid strategic re deployments to areas which are not necessarily the most urgent take italy for instance poor poor italy whose navy gets crushed almost every time in the mediterranean whose soldiers consistently fail to defend the most important italian vp locations allowing the british to stroll right into rome in 1940 this happens a lot and brings me to my next point naval invasions naval invasions are implemented terribly you need a minimum of 50 air and or naval superiority in the seas along which you intend to send your invasion fleet this is too easy requiring a few destroyer squadrons or fighter wings at best both of which the ai has a tendency to spam if you can reach that minimum you can invade anybody with the bare minimum of effort the solution to fix it of course is simple require air and or naval supremacy meaning 100 control over those seas historically when the western allies invaded normandy in 1944 the luftwaffe could muster only approximately 170 fighters to duel with more than 12 000 of their allied counterparts and the kriegsmarine remained locked up in north german ports sending only a few s booten to harrass the invasion fleet this situation is the very definition of supremacy and there s absoutely no reason why this shouldn t apply in game world tension is something of a very irritating sandbox y annoyance it s a measure of how tense international politics are and various kinds of action will increase or decrease it declarations of war annexations and post war treaties in the realm of non democratic nations tend to increase it while natural decay guarantees of independence and declarations of war from democratic nations tend to decrease it the developers seem to have this idea in their heads of providing an additional challenge for the authoritarian and democratic players in that keeping wt low is ideal for the former while raising it is ideal for the latter this is obviously very silly since wt as an element in itself is not bound to ideology democratic actions should ordinarily have just as much impact on wt as non democratic ones it s also heavily advantageous for democratic nations by providing them with the guarantee option at 25 wt they are able to throw out ahistorical guarantees willy nilly to anyone who is being justified against by a non democratic nation the problem is 25 wt gets reach very quickly within the first two in game years providing little to no room for non democratic nations to do ahistorical things quite in spite of the fact that the guarantee options are ahistorical themselves in reality of course nobody but poland got anything like a guarantee of independence prior to 1940 and yet try justifying against portugal as nationalist spain in 1937 and the anglo french will have none of it again the solutions are very simple massively increase pp cost for ahistorical guarantees decrease wt effects for non democratic actions or remove ahistorical guarantees entirely my final reason for the thumbs down is a simple oft re hashed yet critically important one the continuation of pdx s dlc release business model i just can t abide by this i understand perfectly well that game companies need to remain competitive in the current environment but what we are going to end up paying is about 120 90 e100 for the finished product this is unacceptable especially when the dlcs don t really improve the gameplay experience in a significant way unique focus trees improve puppet dynamics this is mod creatable stuff which should absolutely be in the base game anyway worse yet there s a dirty little piece of reasoning behind all this pdx are intent on continuing to release dlc and patches for previous long ago released games in their line up they won t be named because you know exactly what i m talking about but it s a very poor business practice and shows a lack of commitment to current and future games tl dr don t buy this for the time being go have a look at other titles put money and effort into them and wait until a panzer pusher final edition has been released then grab it on sale this review is updated as of
