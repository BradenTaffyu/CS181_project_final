2018 my review of this game is based now after v2 0 as once i installed that i could not tolerate the game before v2 0 the game was awesome and yes i reverted back to it and have played it off and on since then my main issue is they just up and changed everything on us all some people like it some people don t personally i feel options would have been a better way to implement some of the design changes instead of forcing us into this one ftl speed and snail paced exploration the battle fatigue system was fixed to be horrible as for anything after v2 0 i can t comment every time i check the old ftl choices are not back if this were early access a huge overhaul like that i could understand the game wasn t released so design choices change that s one of the risks of backing early access titles however this was fully released with dlcs under its belt then they just overhaul everything on us and tell us to get over it to some it is better to some it is worse i enjoyed playing with my friends for a few hours taking over the galaxy making my own mod s to create my streaming channel s persona and plot to life it was fun now being stuck with the worst possible ftl choice imo and forcing weird mechanics onto us bothers me i cannot recommend this game war was entirely made controlled my some weird galaxy rules that nullifies many of the basic fundamentals of some of the playstyles with no way to bypass it claiming stuff as some sort of devouring swarm empire eating people or assimilating them and such is now impossible in such controlled war mechanics by the secret universe police that apparently tell you that your hive mind doesn t wanna do that anymore for 10 years who is enforcing this just no this was a great game to me until they killed it for me in v2 0
