2022 death penalty is a scam on normal difficulty while claiming it will take 2 3 of your inventory in reality it takes 80 90 and degrades all your tools to red why don t you stop pretending death won t cost you that much and just remove all inventory why do i need that 1 fish and 2 stones if it won t make me even simplest tool shark and all other animals suck in combat because it s unity game and not a single developer till date were able to make decent combat in their unity game controls are clunky ui is bad and visuals are stock unity crap you ll in even unity game islands and vegetation looks just as ugly as in stranded deep same assets often you will die because developers have no skills to program collision for objects i know what s inside the enemies because they jump on my toon and they go through like ghosts dealing damage while my toon has to make few steps back to hit them every enemy has one attack pattern hit run u turn jump and it s so boring to shove 10 metal arrows into shark s open mouth you can t hurt it from sides with bow for some odd reason it swims in circles and often can jump on you out of nowhere as developers never bothered to make light in deep sea and you won t see any shark or anything else if you re fighting in the open area at night such a waste of time waiting for every critter to circle and run back to you rats have weird hitboxes so you can t hit them properly and it s hard to loot their shaken body because the hitbox is few pixels wide difficulty options are bad you can either play it without any danger from animals and shark play easy where you won t be scammed out of your inventory on death or play normal sadistic version where you can barely survive first hours and then you fortify your raft and shark no longer bothers you i believe this fortifying thing tries to hide issues with game balance developers failed to provide meaningful survival all difficulty goes from clunky controls bad unity issues jumping on a raft and missing it shark loves that one just like it was in stranded deep inability to hit enemy with melee weapon while it hits you repeatedly because unity combat toon has health for 3 hits and shark hits every 3 seconds if you re in water peaceful mode isn t that peaceful as you still will have to fight enemies in story mode and you need to finish story mode to unlock items for your raft speaking of story mode it sucked they give you some random notes all voiced with some khajiit accent notes itself do not make any sense i tried to follow the story but it s shallow boring and i believe it shouldn t be there it gates useful items and raft progression for no reason another reason why i believe the story is a failure is forced platforming jumping with unity controls and physics is bad and wasting hours on jumping is even worse they have few levels where you miss the jump and have to redo whole section platformer all out of sudden no thanks some kids when asked to clean their room would sweep all garbage under their bed out of sight out of mind this game does the same for world objects ocean is perfectly still and there s no current to take your raft anywhere you stopped all garbage stopped in the water garbage generates only near your raft jump into water and swim to see empty water without a single object in it same with islands you visit only one side of an island gets resources spawned sea bed is empty and the only thing you have is a shark who will follow you like a pet that s lame i understand performance issues but this game works like crap looks like crap and still performs in 30 60 fps range unity engine can t cope with that why everyone tries to create big worlds in it linux performance has 20 fps out of 60 locked in steam play played on windows to have at least some fluid gameplay i m disappointed there s no difficulty setting for a casual player where you at least keep your tools on death and can access all content raft upgrades without playing piss poor story mode i m surprised so many people praised this game despite its obvious flaws if you really want to play it go for creative and forget combat building raft is fun everything else isn t
