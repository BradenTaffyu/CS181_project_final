2022 a huge step backwardsfirst of all i understand why divinity original sin 2 is as highly regarded as it is it has all the trappings of an old school rpg masterpiece an isometric view tactical gameplay turn based combat an original and somewhat interesting setting and a variety of seemingly emergent gameplay mechanics such as fiery surfaces and spell chain reactions that all make it look like a modern update to the classic rpg formula the beauty however is skin deep almost none of the mechanics hold up under scrutiny the open world is illusory and level gated to hell and back try stepping off the beaten path and venturing into an area just one level above your party and you will find that every single monster will wipe the floor with you requiring the use of extreme cheese tactics in order to beat them with the opposite being true of areas one or two levels below you which you will clear as easy as taking a leak every piece of loot even legendary and epic items is nothing but easily replaced junk remember the days of baldur s gate 2 where a magical sword picked up in the first dungeon could carry you through half the game if combined with the right character build that never happens here that sharpened mithril sword of 10 fiery devastation that you found at the end of the dungeon of doom will be made obsolete by the procedurally generated trash sold by the vendor the next town over no piece of loot lasts beyond its designated level meaning you will be switching all of your gear on every character every half hour in a game that already has a ludicrously bad inventory system not even the diablo series can match the utterly mindless loot wheel gameplay of dos2 the tactical combat that worked so well in the first game has been nearly ruined by two devastating features the first of these is the armor system which more or less renders obsolete many of the fun status effects of the first game do you want to set enemies on fire stun them by adding electricity to that convenient puddle of water put them to sleep paralyze them or make them cower in terror too bad because none of that works until you ve drained either the magical or physical armor barrier of a given enemy which with the amount of hp bloat this game has can easily take three or four turns meaning status effects the whole selling point of dos1 is now an afterthought and then there s the dumb as bricks initiative system in every other turn based game initiative works in such a way that the character with the highest initiative score goes first then the one with the second highest goes second and so forth this means you can design your party around a high initiative score potentially nuking your enemies before they can strike dos2 functions on a round robin turn system meaning that even if all of your guys have a higher initiative than all of their enemies they still only get to go 1st 3rd 5th and 7th respectively it turns initiative into a complete dump stat with no reason for existing and prevents you from accomplishing a lot of the fun chain reactions that you could pull off in dos1 levelling up is boring as hell because your stats hardly matter most of them amount to negligible percentile increases of a given attribute such as strength increasing your damage by 5 constitution increasing your health by the same value and so forth there is virtually nothing else to it meaning that dos2 has the dubious honor of being one of the few rpgs in existence wherein levelling up is boring there is a strange lack of reactivity in the game take the starting area for instance a prison wherein you and a bunch of other individuals deemed dangerous are held captive by a group of heavily armed magisters once you finally kill the magisters every prisoner will just stand around still complaining about being held captive i m not saying this is the biggest deal but c mon larian you could have had something happen also if you slaughter half a village no one will care the rest of the village will still sell you stuff and generally treat you as if nothing happened the story is nothing special despite being more serious than in original sin 1 why is it that more serious equals better in so many peoples eyes it doesn t really hold a candle to say baldur s gate 2 planescape or other more modern rpgs such as dragon age origins it s only considered good because the bar for larian was set so low that anything is an improvement the same thing goes for the characters fane the red prince and whatever else their names are receive an undue amount of praise and while they are decent can anyone honestly say they hold a candle to say morte from planescape wrex from mass effect or irenicus from baldur s gate the writing being good this time around is nothing but a case of low expectations generating a sense of being positively surprised even in lesser areas the game disappoints the music is weak and forgettable compared to its predecessor the first dos1 had a wonderful blend of left field often distinctly un fantasylike compositions that felt genuinely original and weird in the best possible way i remember sometimes going back to certain areas for no other reason than to listen to specific tracks dos2 has pleasant but sorely unremarkable run of the mill orchestral compositions as you ve heard them in billions of other similar titles the inventory system is still a complete mess i don t think i exaggerate when i say i must have spent roughly 10 percent of my playing time merely sorting my inventory this was also a huge problem in dos1 and i find it incredible it did not get fixed only buy this at a heavily reduced price or if you are deeply in love with the first one and absolutely must have something similar but expect a product that is weaker in every conceivable way
