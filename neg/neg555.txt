2023 project moon had fired their story illustrator for being a feminist so what the artist had done for being a feminist she just retweeted a tweet blaming unauthorized recording a k a molka and calling for stronger punishment on such crimes and it happened when she was a teenager way before working for the company the company says that they always asked for their employees to be careful with their sns not to become a social issue with their opinions so the artist had deleted her old sns account as working for the company but the korean incels dug out for the deleted tweet and insanely demanded pm to fire the artist for being a radical feminist it s absurd to be fired because of your old retweet now even deleted and what s wrong to be a feminist what s wrong to blame a crime and hope for stronger punishment on criminals it might sound crazy that pm took those incels side and actually dismissed the artist after a few hours all it took was a single phone call at 11 p m actually isn t it illegal to dismiss an employee with just a phone call and their opinion in social issues indeed in korea the whole country is losing its sh t with misogyny oh what s more pm had posted the announcement on their official twitter account about this sudden dismissal in korean right after the incident but never posted global announcement in other languages just updated the summer event like nothing happened it s a total deception towards users overseas they have right to know about this incident but pm just decided to hide it i feel really disappointed with the company s decision really loved this company s games and characters but it s time to let go
