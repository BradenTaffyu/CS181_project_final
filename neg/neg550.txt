2023 the game tries to appeal to both the pc and mobile market by combining parts from both genres but ultimately ends up failing at both as a result i m sure fans of their previous games will still play it and rave about it in the reviews but if the company s goal was to grow their fanbase by attracting new players into their game then they did an extremely poor job because this game does not appeal to your average pc gamer or your average mobile gacha gamers this is not a good singleplayer game because 1 it has a stamina system meaning you cannot play at your own pace you need to wait roughly 90 minutes just to have enough stamina to do 1 battle you get 1 stamina every 6 minutes a battle costs 12 20 stamina 2 the progression system is locked behind a paywall in order to upgrade your characters you need to gacha and hope you re lucky enough to get the right upgrade for the character you want skill upgrades passives skills and new skill setups can only be obtained from the gacha system the only thing you can actually grind for free is character exp 3 lacks content outside of combat the entire game is just three chapters of dialogue and non stop battles there s no exploration no management no choices no collectibles etc 4 ui is not intuitive to a normal pc gamer it s obvious it was designed with mobile in mind for example you need to press and hold to see your stats this is also not a good gacha mobile game because 1 mobile optimization is extremely poor tons of people online complaining about how badly it runs on their phones2 lack of auto features no x2 speed in combat no auto repeat no dungeon sweeps limited auto combat functionaility 3 no secondary progression systems usually gacha games have equipment with stats or runes with stats that drop from normal dungeons as a secondary way to progress and customize their characters outside of just gacha 4 not enough things to grind for not enough waifus barely any units to collect very small gacha pool no loot from combat 5 lack of freebies no free currency to grind no free daily summons no pity system no login rewards 5 dungeons take way too long 30 minutes just to do 1 dungeon is too much time commitment for a mobile gamer to do in 1 sitting
