2022 i ve put a bunch of hours trying to do the challenge modes however because of the bugs in their game that they re still not fixing i can t complete the game modes i had trouble finishing the chaos theory mode s due to the same issues 1 dino s will randomly stop eating even with available food 2 feeders will stop automatically releasing food3 dino s will randomly walk out of their enclosures4 medical and ranger cars will randomly get stuck in buildings and be destroyed mainly when you have them check on the aquatic animals or flyers when returning to their cars the cars get stuck inside the buildings 5 dino s will have all their needs met but will not give you credit for the missions the only way to report these bugs is on their website however i can t log in via steam can t log in via epic games launcher and can t log in using their own account so there s no way to report the bugs they won t fix these issues so i wouldn t waste your money on the game because some modes you can t even finish because these issues are in the game
