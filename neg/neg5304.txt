it could be fun if everyone wasn t playing the same three meta decks it also doesn t help that it s extremely hard to progress early on since unlocks are slow cards are locked behind packs you get packs with coins or actual money you only get coins from your single daily mission or winning matches hard to do when you don t have a ton of cards unlocked and everyone else playing seems to have dumped a truckload of money into it then when you finally do win a game your opponent gets butthurt and walks away from their computer and leave you waiting for the timer to run out i like mtg but this is awful no creativity no fun opponents even more pay to win than actual magic at least with the actual game you get some variety with the decks you face since everyone cant find or afford all the extremely busted anti fun cards you don t play the exact same deck every single game also your opponent can t just storm off like a child when things don t go their way no idea why i keep installing this game thinking i might enjoy it this time
