2019 gosh i would like to give this game a good review i love ships and the gameplay is actually really fun in fact if you are interested in naval warfare and don t mind the more arcade esque mechanics you should give it a try but damn did this game become a pointless grindfest i ll breakdown my major dislikes lootboxes you do get a few by playing but they pretty much contain rather worthless random rewards and you can buy them with real money power creep wargaming introduces new ships regulary currently the majority of them are obtainable by grinding xp unfortunately they also introduce the one or other premium ship which completely power creeps normal ships of its tier some of these can be obtained with ingame resources but grindfest grinding resources like coal or steel is no fun at all the better premium ships cost around 200k coal you can get maybe 2k per day if you finish the daily missions so on average 200 days to get one premium ship of course you want more than just one and as it already happened in the past wargaming tends to remove these ships from the resource store entirely so you better be quick or pull out your wallet holiday events wargaming can be generous by gifting you a premium ship i already got quite a few already and yes all of them are low tier ships higher tiers are earned via missions i d be totally down for that but these missions are ridiculous usually there re 4 for christmas 2019 there re 7 directives sets of missions of which you have to finish 6 to progress doing some of them will reward your efforts with a premium ship but some of these missions require you to earn 20 million silver or 150k xp unless you play this game almost religiously there s no way you can do that puerto rico a new battle cruiser you build in your harbor and the build process is fully animated that s awesome until you see that you must grind your way through 7 directives of missions which require you to earn ludicrous amounds of xp different types of damage done specific hits on enemies and you you have to earn that in ships of specific nations also wtf so to fully construct this ship i have to play this game for 10 hours straight every day in the week now remember that this is part of the christmas specials yeah right oh i forgot you can also spend money to speed up the construction silly me pricing so when i started playing this game there were only a few premium ships the only other things wargaming offered for money was a premium account and lootboxes apart from the gambling boxes i don t mind spending money on a f2p game if it is well made and actually f2p world of warships is still free to play there s no need for you to spend money but assume there s a certain ship you want maybe because of its history let s name the ship prinz eugen at the time of writing this you can find this ship for 37 euros in the premium store that s a lot of money for one virtual combat unit for this i could buy a new game that would occupy me for a lot longer just check for yourself and you will see what i mean by saying wargaming s pricing is stupid now to be fair some ships like the georgia and friesland can be earned with ingame resources unfortunately one of the points above applies so prepare for a grindfest so in a nutshell can i recommend this game to new players no don t follow the rabbit hole hopefully wargaming changes their priorities but as it currently is i do not see them doing that anytime soon
