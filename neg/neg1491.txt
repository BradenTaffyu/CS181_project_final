2021 early access review the long awaited mount blade bannerlord the life sucking open world rpg where skills matter and your feelings of frustration don t is here should we be excited though well as the germans would say jein ja because the game improved several aspects the ui looks much better they introduced a much needed siege system in which you actually need to build siege engines to storm a castle and it is magnificent there are more commands to control your troops and they added a smithing system which was severely lacking in the warband version they also introduced caravans which is a cool addition nein because teh game is still very raw it is terribly optimized on lowest settings at fhd gtx2060 the battles stutter a lot you have to pass a will roll of diff 25 to endure playing large sieges as a powerpoint presentation the smithing system is simply broken the best two handed swords you craft using rare materials will be 20k worth a javelin can go as high as 180k that breaks the economy too once you can craft javelins you achieved infinite money the leveling system seems broken beyond repair and i hope the devs redo it from scratch there are 6 attributes each with 3 skills attached the only purpose of the attributes is to determine how far fast you can level its skills you can only level skills by using them but as they get closer to the cap you get a multiplier penalty e g you get only 1 2 then 1 4 until you get no exp at all to mitigate that the devs added a focus points which increases the cap multiplier for a single skill only max 5 focus per skill you get 1 focus point per level 1 attribute point per 4 levels the progression is non linear i e the higher the level of the character skill the more exp points it needs to progress but you get less exp points due to the multiplier penalty to eventually get max attributes you d need to reach lvl 200 ish it is much more intuitive than it sounds the key problem is that to level up you need to progress skills but to progress skills you need to level up the non linear behaviour is terribly balanced even after cheating to get all attributes to 10 max speed cap to all skills after 40h my character is barely lvl 35 remember non linear so it gets much worse later if you try to focus in one attribute group of skills you ll level up even slower yes in bannerlord specializing is bad once you create a kingdom your lords force you to declare war on every kingdom with less troops lords with traits such as honour and honesty pass their time pillaging villages you can also send your companions to form parties to protect your own settlements but instead they will join the murdering as well but in your name there is no toggle you can t say no bad boy sit you can control some policies of your kingdom but there is no chill daddy policy and everybody is bloodthirsty the whole time i ran out of space but i could still rant about marriage charming persuasion the way the npcs creeply smile at you as if they d had mushrooms the lack of armor crafting customized troops trees and of a potato at the end of this post mount blade is one of my favourite games of all times and bannerlord surely sounds promising however it is better to stay away until the devs finish fixing some of the problems above as it is now it is a bad game no achievements played on linux via proton thanks steam i will update this review once the game leaves early access
