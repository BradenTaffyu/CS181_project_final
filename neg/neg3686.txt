2019 early access review yea i gotta say after putting many hours into this game that a17 is not the direction this game should have taken after playing a lot of a16 it just feels like there are zero rewards for doing anything the level up system of a16 where you earned a bit of xp every time you worked at a task was i believe what kept most of us grinding away at the game now it just feels like you get nothing in return sure there are perks which are unique in their own way but they don t account for the progress and achievement of earning rank ups over time and don t even get me started about the limited inventory space in a game where you were already limited pretty severely until minibikes all in all i d say if you were to play on a16 4 and run mods you d probably enjoy the game however i unfortunately cannot endorse a17 i highly doubt they ll revert any changes since it was a pretty big change in general another early access game down the drains it seems
