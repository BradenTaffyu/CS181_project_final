2023 i couldn t even finish it i just got bored the story was tiresomely predictable and i just feel like i got some alternate universe hogwarts when i wanted the hogwarts i ve known for ages not to mention other aspects that i m sure other reviews will go over praying that some dlc and tlc can help save this game it really really is beautiful and still salvageable
