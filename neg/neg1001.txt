2015 after completing the main storyline of the game at around 20 hours level 25 it hit me there is absolutely nothing to do in this game and stupid repititve quests to clear out raiders from the same place over and over does not mean there is always something to do sure there is a new quest here and there but this game has got to be one of the biggest let downs of my life fallout 3 has and always will be my favourite game and ever since i completed it i was waiting for the next fallout by bethesda it was not worth the wait if you got 100 spare feel free to spend it on this game but don t believe the hype behind this game because it is all just losers jumping on the fallout bandwagon on a positive note some of the new features of the game could have been really cool and immersive if they weren t programmed to work for a xbox controller instead of a keyboard and mouse building 4 10
