2020 early access review i love bannerlord but can not recommend it in its current state when i bought the game on its release i really enjoyed playing it and was excited to see what the devs would do with the game i have now revisited the game though and am fairly disappointed with the progress of its development i am happy that the developers have fine tuned many of the game mechanics and fixed many of its numerous bugs but feel that this is really the only thing that they have completed the devs have still not implemented many vital features such as perks effects currently most perks don t work out of the 12 perk trees that exist 5 of them contain perks whose effects don t work and another 3 have less than 20 of their perks working other missing features include some mechanics regarding sieges kingdom management and crafting there has also been very little in the way of any new armors or weapons which would not be a problem if modding tools were released however mod support has yet to be released and its modding community has subsequently died my overall opinion is that the game has been released for 5 months and in that time has made little significant progress in the way of attracting its player base back i would recommend that anybody who is on the fence about purchasing the game wait until mod support drops edit if anybody wants to see what perks are and aren t working check this the devs officially announced that the first batch of modding tools is planned for release by the end of august youtube video development update 2 modding tools and more views 90 603 in this development update we take a look at some recent and upcoming changes to the game as well as the first batch of modding tools that we hope to share soon 2nd edit its september 10th almost a month later and they have not released modding tools yet like i said progress with the game s development is disappointing
