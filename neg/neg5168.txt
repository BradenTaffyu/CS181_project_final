2016 this game is amazing in my opinion it s the best total war game at this point you may ask why da thumb down tho well ive been playing 42 hours in my dwarf campaign and as much i was enjoying the game i got to turn 217 im basicaly done i was missing only one objective but then as i end my turn empire plays no problem bretonia plays no problem skaeling plays no problem varg plays and as soon as they start to move an army the game crashes i have reloaded and tried many times my save and it just doesnt work the biggest concern about that is that i am not the only one having this issue i visited the forums and a lot of people had that problem and not only with the dwarfs the problem doesnt occur only past turn 200 as well some people had that problem as soon as turn 45 so at this point all i can say is this game is great in all aspect but considering the fact that i basically lost 42 hours of campaign i just cant stand it and the fact that this bug can happen at any time on any campaign note until they make a patch to correct that problem my review will stay as a thumb down
