2021 the complete opposite experience from the first game in the first game i absolutely did not care about the story setting or characters i couldn t name a single companion didn t like how overly magically whimsical the setting was and rarely knew or cared what was happening in the plot but i loved the gameplay had a good time playing it now i am invested in the setting and its lore i love the characters and want to see where their journey is taken them i m invested i also hate the gameplay it is terrible i have had no good times and have dropped this game the addition of the armour mechanic is half the problem you either commit to all magic or all physical damage otherwise you re wasting time spreading your attacks out and all those nifty status effects from your attacks might as well no exist the other problem is the balance you have to cheese so many fights after having already dieing to it a few times it s like playing dnd with a dm who hates you and wants every encounter to be a total party wipeout ambush and then pat themselves on the back for their being difficult then says that you can just try again and again until you get it that is not fun if you beat an encounter using your understanding of your and your enemy s abilities with well made strategies a victory is supposed to feel like an accomplishment instead when you re going down the road in this game you re apparently supposed have have the foresight to have your archer wait over here your healer back up over there your rogue go invisible for what seams like no reason and your tank rush ahead to trigger the ambush you ve already died to a few times because if your characters are ever within spitting distance of each other when an encounter decides to start you can expect no less than every enemy conjoining into a minute long artillery strike of aoe attacks that leave you stripped of all armour and half of your squad then when you cheese the save scumming and ai and you finally win you feel nothing no accomplishment no victory just frustration no amount of git gud fixes this issue it s trial and error combat at its worst tl dr armour sucks the dm in this game hates me and the feeling became mutual edit game was only enjoyably playable after installing mods it was worth it and a great time after that but should not have been necessary
