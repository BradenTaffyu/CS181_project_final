2020 ok i have played medieval 2 in the past then shogun 2 rome 2 and had a try on other non fantasy total war games shogun 2 is the obvious comparison to three kingdoms both eastern and shogun 2 was the last good non fantasy total war game in my opinion rome 2 wasnt than great and you know it i played cao cao s faction highlighting the units is the biggest pain in the ass the fight choreography of the units are somehow worse the shogun 2 the graphics on my 4k monitor are somehow inferior to shogun 2 this game think increasing saturation better graphics but when you compare the water graphics to rome 2 or shogun 2 the textures especially rock textures on high setting look okish for a 2019 total war game it seems i had a larger expectation set on this aspect the generals getting along or not system is stupid the units in the game get boring in the second half of the game the camera in this game feels restrictive compared to shogun 2 rice fields is my person most memorable map in shogun 2 can you name a memorable map in three kingdoms i cant since they all look the same i personally hated the siege system in post shogun 2 games and consider them to be place units in front of the gates and put it on fast forward get in the forest and you have 70 ambush chance get in the open fields and you have 100 ambush chance the cavalry feels slow multiplayer is dead i enjoyed rome 2 s politic system especially with rome s faction but there is none of that in this game no internal politics just generals not getting along missing naval battles they should replace the skills tree unlocking every set amount of turns to skills unlocking once you capture a settlement it makes much more sense on that note the settlements lack variety edit 29 05 2020 generals can hire better units as they level up is also annoyingi felt more frustrated playing this game than entertained for the majority of this game while there i have only mentioned negatives kind of like in life you remember the rules you ve broken or wrong things comes first as opposed to all the rules you followed and positive things this game in my opinion is just average yes in the age of if its not 9 10 then its i give this game 5 5 10 average bad nothing truly stands out but nothing truly is game breaking just many small negatives adding up this game is for die hard tw fans and not for first entry into the series go play shogun 2 for that
