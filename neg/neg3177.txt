2021 i really enjoyed this game until you hit a wall where you need to pay money to advance any further which is about 15 20 hours the point where i decided to uninstall was when my tier 5 battleship had half it s hp melted by 2 torpedo strikes from the same carrier in the first couple minutes of battle with no counterplay while being taunted at the same time i don t understand how people can pay hundreds of dollars to acquire top tier ships in an arcade game that doesn t even try to simulate real naval battle mechanics there is no skill to overcome the challenge of playing with free ships because of dumb hidden variables the ship you re aiming at can cause your shells to go wildly off target even if you re aimed perfectly and arbitrary consumable skills with no historical basis my battleship could launch a depth charge aircraft strike useless if there are no submarines in the game install this game if you want 20 hours of fun followed by crushing disappointment and toxicity the epitome of a pay to win game
