age of empires iv a single player s perspectiveas an avid fan of the age of empires series particularly for its rich single player experiences i had high hopes for age of empires iv aoe iv however while the game excels in many areas it disappoints when it comes to offering enough single player content to truly satisfy those who prefer to game solo however after you ve played through the available campaigns the game starts to show its limitations the most glaring issue is the lack of content for those who don t play multiplayer or ranked matches aoe iv doesn t include campaigns for some of history s most fascinating civilizations such as the chinese japanese or byzantine empires this omission is surprising and disappointing especially for players who enjoy exploring different historical eras and cultures since it s release in 2021 we had only one new campaign
