2018 the most hated total war title with a slog of a grand campaign overpriced dlc most factions being dlc started ca s dlc whoring and the games melee combat looks and animates pretty bad still poorly optimized for most computers even after numerous overhauls politics is still boring and somehow less fun than napoleons and empires barebones version navies are completely pointless and a waste of money when armies can do the same and somehow be better in naval battles most factions with the exception of rome have barebones unit spread and selection and are boring the total war games now limit your genral count for reasons has a lamer genral progression tree than shogun and less character for said generals than all other previous total war titles gone are the days of cool retinues and character traits which are all limited by the way endgame is a pointless snowballing slog no religion for some reason but replaced with culture although both shouldve been in game and it s also pretty boring also brain dead ai on all levels of difficulty what more can i say that this is still a broken game going for 60 bucks with over a 120 dollars in dlc while theirs a superior version called atilla which fixes a lot of rome 2 problems provides an actual challenge looks better animates better has food actualy matter cooler features and is only 45 bucks with only 75 dollars worth of dlc whoring too bad that game is also poorly optimized and has been abandoned by ca did i mention you can play woman for certain factionsnote i don t realy care about the inclusion of woman into the game hell for some parts it makes sense such as egypt with cleopatra who weirdly missing in the agustas campaign but it does break the imersion althrough more generic as hell boring genrals with tits boobs doesn t change this turd anyways
