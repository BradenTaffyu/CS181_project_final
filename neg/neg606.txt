2017 really disappointed with the game it does a lot of things well but falls flat on its face in two categories encounter design and writing as someone who has played run and occasionally written rpgs d os 2 feels amateurish when it comes to both those things the encounter feels extremely samey with nearly all enemies functioning the same almost every enemy s kit follows a checklist of aoe status effect teleport and heal their ai consists of picking a target then dogpiling that target regardless of positioning or self preservation enemies will walk through fire burn themselves down to 1hp and be set to die next turn just to get in one more hit on target prime heck they ll stand around without attacking or just spend all their ap moving if they can t attack said target they ignore oppotunity attacks and taunt effects so the only way to prevent this is to kill or stun them doesn t help that most fights take place in the same sort of unfriendly terrain enemies get high ground player gets hazards enemies get to magically appear from nowhere in flanking positions player gets deployed in a clump regardless of formation settings enemy damage scales extremely quickly but since they don t actually have gear the player doesn t benefit from this pickpocket an archer npc before a fight and you find three gold and an empty bottle during the fight he will merrily pop multiple consumables like explosive arrows or healing potions he didn t have these before the fight and if you kill him before he would have a chance to use them he wouldn t drop them either same for gear the enemy archer will have better armor than your tank and do more damage with his bow but someone on death all his equipment vanishes into the ether or occasionally you ll get a pair of common quality gloves two levels behind which he clearly wasn t wearing since they would never get his armor that high the story of the game is stock for the divinity series which to be fair has always embraced the pc as special snowflake story trope the character dialogue is iffy but the plot frequently feels forced or out of touch with the situation kill a named npc said npc returns in the next scene if you let me burn someone to a charred corpse on screen then animate a disgusting blob zombie with his corpse that character should probably not pop up again overall the game frequently feels like it was set up by a new or just plain bad gm these are my favorite npcs you can t kill them i put them in fights but they magically survive or escape no you can t loot or use their equipment because i don t want you to look as cool as them haha look how dumb you are being ambushed by invisible enemies i made magically appear even though you were standing where they were a minute ago most of the game s challenge comes from this rather than any real feel of difficulty few additional weird design choices initiative is i go you go meaning boosting initiative is meaningless since you will always take turns with the enemy status effects are blocked by armor magic armor meaning these have to be stripped before you can apply effects this seems fair until you realize enemies have more armor and do more damage than you meaning they can frequently fire off these abilities and land them on the first hit while you have to spend a turn or two chewing down armor the armor mechanic also means you are best off focusing on one type of damage preferably physical due to fewer resists so in a game with six different kinds of spellcasting one of the better teams is four 2h warriors bashing everything to death while spamming fly or teleport many enemies have flat out immunities to certain effects for no clear reason a clear reason is something like a fire elemental being resistant to burning there is no way to predict this so you can go into a fight only to find the damage types and status effects your party is built for are worthless for a given encounter graphics are nice gameplay has a lot of potential but the encounter design lets it down i m in the 2nd act and i m sick of the fights you get access to a wonderful variety of abilities but you re best off running a party of all physical attackers and the odd utility spell i want to like it i think a really good game could be made out of the foundation d os2 is built on but so far larian hasn t done it on the bright side it is way better than dragon commander was
