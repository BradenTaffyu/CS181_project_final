2020 i m the only person i know who actually liked this game and was trying to get my friends to play it the latest update has made this game a chore and impossible to play as a casual that update has ruined the experience by nerfing damage increasing enemy health and forcing players to use specific builds in order to survive i now can t explore and play the game how i want and i can t even attempt to work towards a specific build because all my materials are gone weapons and armour are broken and my ammo is dried up the update was supposed to make it easier for low level players and nerf higher leveled ones but it has done the opposite
