2017 great game but the dlc has really gone too far now mandate of heaven was completely broken at launch for 20 euros then ended up on a humble store sale for 50 off within 2 weeks after it was fixed just to add insult to injury for paying full price to play a beta dlc now a content pack for 10 euros little more than some skins and a few events seems rather close to what res publica is and afaik that was about half this price even at launch meanwhile development continues to assume you have literally all of them while some don t really matter others contain very much must have features i do realise they are frequently on sale but wouldn t it at least be time to an eu4 dlc pack for those that only recently bought the base game apparently paradox code is like fine wine it only seems to increase in price over time
