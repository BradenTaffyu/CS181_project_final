2020 i want to like this game i enjoyed the wastelanders dcl story dialogue through to its completion and overall it feels like a step in the right direction but frankly playing this game is a f ing chore i m constantly juggling inventory and managing the weight in my stash fallout 4 was a game about collecting everything fallout 76 punishes you for doing that and i thought maybe i could forgive the game it s supposed to be a survival game after all and balancing inventory is often a key part of the genre but if you subscribe to fallout first you get the privilege of unlimited junk storage seriously it s a pay to win mechanic a cash grab resolution to one of the most frustrating aspects of the game and clearly bethesda knows that remember fallout first is a 100 year subscription this is something you d expect in a free to play game not a aaa bethesda experience it s easy to understand why so many people hate this game there are other reasons to dislike the game terrible ai outright boring shooting mechanics miserable inventory menus shameless in game store bugs bugs bugs but my second big gripe is optimisation i play on a 1080 ti desktop 8700k i7 my drivers are all up to date i ve fiddled and fiddled with the settings like a mad man but the framerate is jumpy beyond reason it doesn t matter if i set everything to the lowest settings the game will go from 120 fps to 70 to 50 back to 100 to 45 ect all within a minute or two of playing like i said i genuinely want to like this game between xbox pc i ve got about 1000 hours played in fallout 4 which still isn t a perfect fallout game but at least properly functioned at what it set out to do fallout 76 stumbles at every step i cannot comfortably enjoy this game and i can t recommend it i truly hope in time fallout 76 gets better but it s been two years since launch i m beginning to think this game exists for the sole reason of an in game store but wastelanders has some enjoyable moments i was surprised at the depth to dialogue trees and their outcomes and i applaud that i just wish the rest of the game had the same tlc
