2020 the game is solid a dream came true for many warhammer fans despite throngs of bugs some late unforgivable issue with the interface which might be solved in the next patch or might be not ca is not really famous for fixing bugs even less than balancing stats and several aspects which could be easily improved the real deal breaker is how the game is sold it s a years old game still full price then there re hordes of dlcs still full price and the biggest part of the game the mortal empires map is unlocked only by buying an entirely different game several years old still full price and then a lot of remaining stuff belongs to this different game s dlcs still full price this is not sparta this is madness
