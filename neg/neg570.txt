2020 i have tried to love this game twice everything is there from great voice acting wonderful and colorful graphics and a good storyline that is beyond most if not all competing titles unfortunately the creators of this game also preferred a combat system wherein nearly every fight is fully tailored to your party level to be challenging and woe you if you did not take the path the creators intended on a certain map and your level matters enormously in this game the difference between level 10 and 11 can mean life or death in your next encounter as not only your stats but also your available items scale with it and are very dependent on level a handmade shiv at a slightly higher level will outperform a carefully crafted dagger of a lower dagger by far this is very immersion breaking and not in line with my preference of carefully outfitting a team with sought after items why buy an expensive weapon from a store if next level everything will be outdated there are also a number of frustration inducing events that can likely only be won using party micromanagement that is beyond me or incredible cheesing of certain strategies that are likely not intended as such combine this with an ai that mostly seems to know that a knocked out character will require hard won resurrection scrolls and has a knack to perform a final kamikaze blow to have you reload in the final rounds of combat and frustration is complete a great game for many but not for me ultimately and maybe also not for you i hope the creators will use a different combat system in their next game as everything else is very polished and detailed overall when more than a few gaming sessions are ended with a feeling of frustration i can whole heartedly say i cannot recommend the game to everyone despite its many great points
