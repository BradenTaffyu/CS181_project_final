2017 empire was a step in the right direction conducted in a terrible fashion napoleon attempted to pick up the pieces but napoleon was too small a scope to do it alone shogun was alright but ultimately did not grab most fans enough to define the series then came rome 2 dear god rome 2 you were the chosen one every total war fan highly anticipated your arrival you were the most hyped total war in history all fans old and new awaited your release and then it released and instantly people experienced probably the worst total war game launch in history this game is no doubt the primarily killer of the old total war fanbase this game is what truly signaled that the dark age of the total war franchise had begun from the broken mechanics to the even more broken gameplay almost everything about rome 2 is worse then its predecessors the ai has always been a very glaring problem in the franchise but here in this game the ai seems to be at its absolute worst of any total war even the graphics are a downgrade from the lush and rich graphics that shogun 2 and napoelon were capable of how do you manage to make a game that is worse then its predecessors in almost every way is beyond me but rome 2 did it there are a few things rome 2 did actually do better then previous total wars however like for instance i think the campaign is slightly better done but i think that can be attributed to the fact that the campaign maps cover far more interesting areas then what previous games leading up to rome 2 did all and all i d recommend if you did not buy this game at launch and thus become stuck with it in your library like so many did dont buy this game you d probably be better off with attilla i think its even cheaper them rome 2
