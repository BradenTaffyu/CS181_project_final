2017 i want so badly to love this game and am hoping desparately that paradox will continue to revise and reforge it into what it has the tremendous potential to be as of now the game s pace and mechanics both slow the rate of progress for the player to such a degree that i legitimately feel bad about myself for the time invested in any long play session and to play through a full game would take sooo many long play sessions i have the utmost faith in paradox and personally believe that they are one of the preeminent developers in modern strategy gaming so i am ok with shelfing this title in anticipation of a more rewarding revisitation someday but at present time i am sad to say that i regret making this purchase
