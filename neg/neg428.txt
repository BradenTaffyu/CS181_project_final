2023 don t be fooled by the amount of hours i have it manages to hook you up enough so you even consider getting 1 month of fo1st which unluckily i did so you re into the sunk cost fallacy in order to pursuit better gear that you don t really need afterall because there s no endgame so i m going to list the good and the bad stuff good the map is interesting with lots of places to visit and it s fun to explore to an extent the ost has some good songs that fits the scenario really well the gameplay in general feels good but has lots of problems ill go into detail in the bad section the community is mostly nice and helpful most of the time there s basebuilding system which it s far from perfect but it is an interesting aspect of the game to go and see other s bases you can mod the game to an extent which helps a lot with performance ui qol and other stuff if you have limited time to play daily maybe it fits you since you can get most stuff playing only 1 2h a day since there s little to grind unless you have extreme patience you get almost the same playing 2 hours a day than a guy playing 10 a day ill get into detail later bad while the map has interesting places most offers nothing and has no quest related to them because questing wasn t even a thing back in the day there were no npcs at all so they were introduced later in the game most quest and npcs are uninspired fetching quest that feels like a tutorial so you go visit places otherwise you have no reason to visit except for the sake of exploring i can remember maybe 2 or 3 quest that were cool to do and lorewise interesting another 2 or 3 even the mainquest is dumb as considering all the context of fallout games the brotherhood of steel is a joke the settlers are a joke and the raiders are another joke the enclave has the depth of a coin too and since there s no real reputation system you can befriend everyone and they seem cool with each other tho they constantly mention how much they hate each other so you can t really feel you re fighting their battles you re just there fetching stuff while the drama plays itself the gameplay while it feels like mostly fo4 it has a lot of bugs specially in vats and many annoying limitations like not beeing able to target limbs with melee making melee extremely annoying and underpowered except if you go full with a chainsaw or autoaxe because they re not properly introduced and do stupid damage that even without perks is better than your well invested 2h super sledge build because that s how retarded every weapon style is now with the balance also you have literally 2 builds power armor or not power armor because even going low health or full health has the same gameplay but does more damage or you re more tanky that s basically the difference there s no endgame except for endlessly launching nukes that gets old really fast in fact you can even get rid of the main questline until level 50 because the game plays around events they give you everything you need from xp to loot to gear which are repetitive after a few days and most of them sucks bananas to do and even the ones that are fun can be annoying aswell because you don t get other s kills xp you have to tag the monster to get xp and loot so if there s one guy launching mini nukes forget about getting anything it s a up system no matter how you look at it every single aspect has cooldown and or is daily plus is ridden with rng you only have 500 scrip to sell a day that you expend 50 on legendary modules so 10 legen mod a day and you use 1 of them for crafting armors and 4 for rerolling legendaries well since rng gonna rng because of course you can expend the savings of 4 days of grinding marvellous events like feed the people on getting one roll or piece of armor and guess what not having it so just like that your day is basically finished unless you want to commit seppukku by doing endless expeditions of course also caps vendors are capped gold bullion going to get some f springs is aswell getting pa pieces from random pa around the map everything has cooldown or is capped you have so limited inventory that you are basically constantly tempted to get fo1st because it has an ammo and a junk unlimited chests so that s the catch up here since everything is daily and you have limited space you now have a solution paying it clearly the gui system specially at vendors and the inventory ui is atrocious made for consoles entirely so expect big f up situations of missclicks missbuying or selling and whatnot aside of depeloving fast arthrosis on your left hand because of the constant navigation of wasdcz between menus in 2023 then one day you go online expend another 20 legendary modules on one piece of armor it doesn t roll what you need and you finally ask yourself why i m i still wasting my time here don t do it don t be like me and avoid this wait your turn simulator edit since izaren took the time to answer this review i m going to reply that thanks but no thanks this is no feedback this is just a review of fundamental issues of a game that its only function is to cash fans of the fallout franchise it has no soul it has no clear future it was defective since day 1 and giving more and more feedback is not going to solve the core issues because you as a company never had faith in this product you just saw an opportunity and the many limitations that the game has is a proof of it you want to retain players artificially not because the game the content worth it and you re still living off it so a guy with 300 hours saying how it is i understand is bad marketing again thank you for the answer but i can recognize pr when i see it even the whales that keep this product going are confused about the direction of the game they are just playing because of fomo not because they really enjoy it that much anymore and you know pretty damn well you need no feedback but what do i know i m just another guy i guess
