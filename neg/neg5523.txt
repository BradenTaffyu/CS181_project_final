2018 to all who don t know ca apparently decided to enhance the female representation and after a fan backlash they decided to attack their fans there is really no other way of putting it knowing that i would have to go and die in a war and every female could easily choose not to in the country i live in i do not like this change i think hope this is reasonable and i am only putting this here for honesty since it is not the reason i am leaving this urgent recommendation not to buy this game right now i would even go so far to not buy any game of them ever again here are 2 statements that really shocked me from a perspective of a fan for years who has played multiple titles of this company people saying they won t buy the game because there are too many women in it is fine with us if that s their reason we d rather they didn t anyway i cannot unbuy your game as far as i know and talking to costumers in this fashion after your major screw up is simply wrong i liked your game because it was more historically accurate than most other titles and as far as i remember there were already females in this game i really wonder why you would decide to go down this path right now shortly after the disaster ea is facing with their preorders i can honestly not understand the logic strategy here is it really the most stupid reason you just having so much of a need to put your own worldview into this game it would be the less bad thing still a reason for me to boycott you but less bad the second statement is the more severe one in my opinion if having female units upsets you that much you can either mod them out or just not play i mean i could mod them out yes but with this statement you are asking your customers to remove the changes you patched into a game they loved in order to enjoy your product again and i can not come up with another company that asks for similar things that s a really terrible way of dealing with your customers the people who are giving you their money to get content they can enjoy they do not want to have to work 50 hours or to undo your work again and still have to pay 55 euros for that at first i thought that this price was a joke because i do not remember having to pay this much some years ago but i think the latter part of this statement is more directed at me just not play i mean yes ok if you insist after all in short term you do not have anything to lose in a costumer of some years ago who stops playing your title now at some point i stopped playing rome1 like all other of your titles but for computer games i often returned and enjoyed them again sometimes just for a few hours one of the games i recently excavated again was one of your titles warhammer total war with all these products i could return and they did not change in a way that would have led me to not buy them in the first place with this latter part of the statement you really show how little you care and i am deeply disappointed but as i said a long term fan costumer who would not pay the 55 euros for a game since he already owns it compared to people who were not interested in the game or even in the genre and will now probably buy it because they see think the developers have the same worldview probably is not as important right now and finally this is why i want to warn you dear reader if they treat their old costumers like this they will treat you at some point like this just ask yourself if you like representation and diversity and all of that what makes you believe that they will stand by you in a few years or maybe shorter if they see it more profitable to change the product at some point to fit a worldview you do not like because it will make them more money they will probably do it then you would be the one who already payed the 55 euros and if you stopped playing they could simply not care just imagine in 2 or 3 patches from now the game might have no diversity at all anymore and the company then basically telling you to stfu and stop playing
