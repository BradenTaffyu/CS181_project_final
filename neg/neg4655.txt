2019 so sad to see the civilization series lose its way so badly with each instalment the games added or refined something up to civ v bnw which is imo the gold standard in these type of games here however we take a massive step backwards where to begin well let s start from the er start i never imagined graphics could be dumbed down but here they have managed it after you get over the horrible mobile game style visuals and start playing you are greeted with clunky and boring early game exploration with a pathetically small map size even if you choose the largest oh and it won t matter anyway because all other civs will be crammed right next to you within about 4 tiles slight exaggeration but only slight the next thing you notice is the excellent and flexible social policy system of v is gone replaced by a completely linear system that will ensure your progression through the game is identical each time with little dashes of agenda pushing thrown in free of charge the ai here is utterly laughable from brazil denouncing you and threatening war every turn hating you until the end of the game because you got a great person they wanted to others offering and accepting ridiculous trade deals hating or loving you for reasons far beyond your limited control granted all civ games have had issues with ai but this is the pinnacle of bad ai right here the district system is an interesting concept and as you get used to the way it works it can provide a small measure of the flexibility and freedom that has been lost unfortunately nowhere near enough to make up for the losses the next casualty you will notice as you play on is the world congress again a system that lent rich gameplay options and flexibility is ditched and replaced with nothing remember the turmoil that could result from you pushing through a selfish resolution or the diplomatic kudos you gained from hosting a worlds fair the drama from picking a ideology that opposed the majority of nations well you can forget all that here and ideologies got chucked out with the social policy system the less said about the extremely dubious woke as hell dlc the better want your world congress back well you can pay for the privilege and enjoy as a bonus another slice of agenda pushing in summary this is civilization minus all the depth charm and fun that were the hallmarks of the series civ extra lite caffeine free it is hard to believe this game was produced by the people that gave us the last 5 and the x com games if vii does not seriously turn things around this series is dead
