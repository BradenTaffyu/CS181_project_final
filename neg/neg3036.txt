2015 tl dr the following review is inaccurate because it is now a year old and although the game has goen through huge improvements on the points criticised and other things i still do not recommend this hotlap simulator update a year after it seems like the netcode and ai have been updated and make the game become playable with other cars on the track they added 4wd support and a few free cars next to the dlcs to show off this new feature of the physics engine dlc 3 has been released with some lamborghinis nice to see them deliver that promise one of the lambos in the game however is community content that has been promoted to be part of the official game if i remeber correctly all in all if you are searching for some fun driving cars around track with great realism and don t care for ai or online multiplayer you might want to try the game beware though it is a simulator so it is best played using a steering wheel preferably a 900degree so you can use the full lock of the cars with the announcements of the dream pack 1 dlc i felt like i needed to warn potential buyers of this game so here it goes after having pre purchased this game and having early access being able to play the beta it was a pretty good experience the physics are okay most of the time and feel incredibly good with lower power rear wheel drive vehicles eg bmw m3 e30 bmw m3 e92 bmw z4 e89 bmw 1 series m coupe ktm xbow lotus evora sr lotus elise sc the front wheel drive cars do not feel that great to me but as i am not a fan of these i will pass the subject now for the gameplay aspect menus are reasonably well designed and constructed the options menus is very big with a lot of options very nice to see just a little side note menus are a seperate process from the game engine so you can let your pc cool down a bit between two races which is a nice segue to bring you to the graphics engine part of the game graphics well oh boy the optimisation the obvious lack of thereof the graphics look good but it s nothing extremely spectacular and yet i struggle to max out the settings and get a decent framerate my system 2 way sli of gtx 680s an i7 4770k 4ghz and 16gb of ram the in game ui is very minimal and is not very well optimised for the multiplayer aspect of racing in my honest opinion but kunos has the answer modding yes like the rest of the game you can mod and the ui is coded in pyhton so you can either make your own or download one from someone else i will not comment on multiplayer as my experience was sub par to all the other simulations i ve played but it was about 8 9 months ago so it might have changed the ai is horrible absolutely not aware of you the race on rails they are not braking when you are and thus bump into you and thow you off track the difficulty of the ai is also something strange you well i at least can t keep up with the race leader if you don t overtake the ai in the first 3 to 4 corners well the cars in front of you are going to vanish into the distance and you ll never catch up interrestingly if you turn the scenario the other way around if you are the race leader even if you don t drive that well and don t set lap records they ll never catch up assuming you don t crash of course so finally assetto corsa becomes a solo player hotlap simulator with not a lot of content 37 cars of which probably half are just variants of the same car10 tracks where 3 of them have a second shorter varianta drag strip for quarter and full milea dedicated drifting playground track but this not a lot of content part will change in the same horrible fashion that game developpement has seen fit to go towards yes you guessed it they have at least 1 dlc planned regarding the controls also very important to note if you do not have a steering wheel well do not try the keyboard and the controllers are a nightmare to use and to make it worse you have to have a 900 degres steering wheel because the game supports it but also likes to map the 900 degres of rotation to a 270 degre steering wheel making the force feedback way too powerful and the steering way too sensitive and imprecise also apparently 45eur or your regional equivalent is not enough they want to add content but also fill their pockets because yes game devs also want to live they do not work for free they are planning to release a dlc in the coming weeks months but thanks to its naming scheme we know that it is far from the only dlc that is planned what the f is wrong with game devs nowadays why dlc whay not wait to release the game for full price when the game is ready and finished when there is content that make the game worth buying at this point i don t know what i should do with it other than poke it with a really really long stick to see when new content is going to be added and see how much the dlc will cost as i generally do with any game that does include dlc in its roadmap look at blizzard people please they have a roadmap that says 1 dev2 bugfix3 release4 make sure everything is stable5 dev dlc 6 bugfix dlc 7 release dlc 8 repeat steps 4 to 7 in blizzard terms dlc means expansion that is downloadable your game does not tell you all the time this content is part of a dlc to unlock it buy the dlc no instead it doesn t show anything of it in game it does show however a nice thing on the battle net launcher saying that there is an upgrade available for this game a blizzard expansion is typically more expansive than a dlc and for a good reason it add a butt ton of content and updates and patches and additional balancing and new awesome pixar like quality animations for cutscenes please everyone stop buying dlc and here isa little bonus yay more text it s the comment i left on the assetto corsa facebook page regarding the announcement of the dream pack 1 dlc not long ago they made something very fun and appropriate they released a video teaser of the contract deal they signed with lamborghini in which they show 4 different cars that are not part of the game and obviously advertises the game as having these cars in it when obviously no one has seen them in game they re part of the upcomming dlc not the lambos these are clearly coming later the modding aspect is great allowing and encouraging modding is great but making an engine adding 10 15 cars plus a racing variant of some of these cars and another engine another racing class essantially the same model but with 300 hp instead of 350 and weighing 1100kg instead of 1250kg doesn t make it that different 10 tracks and asking the community for their money and hard work to make the game worth a damn by making mods and asking to please not upload poor quality mods because it s an elite game we want to have good content the please do not port is a genuine thing on the modding part of the assetto corsa forum feel free to go and check it ot yourself i am not happy about the money i spent on the game it was too much for the content provided i would prefer for them to remove their branding for the game because frankly your racing simulator well it bloody hell isn t mine thanks for making it this far
