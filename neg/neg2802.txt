i bought the game and a few expansions over the years usually when on sale i refuse to support this grubby money grabbing tactic of releasing half finishing underwhelming dlc alongside updates that change the base game usually in favour of the dlc you need to buy i will torrent the full version next time i wish to play and with all the negative choices paradox have made with all of their games over the last couple years i won t ever be buying 1 of their products again
