2022 the problems with master duel are the same problems plaguing yugioh for years other reviews are not exaggerating when they say opponents will take 10 minutes to complete their turns and then otk you with a field full of overpowered monsters that is the state of the metagame it s been that way for a decade now and it s not fun it s not a matter of skill or being good it s a matter of not being fun i don t want to spend 10 minutes watching my opponent make their moves and yeah i can watch a youtube video while they do but can i really say i m enjoying the game either master duel or the yugioh card game and of course it s the myriad meta strategies you know and hate chains and chains of summons usually links but sometimes xyz especially if zoodiacs are involved ash blossom to interrupt and halt critical combos utopia otks exodia otks cards that shut down almost all forms of counterplay or punish the opponent for removing them had an opponent the other day that comboed heroic champion rhongomyniad with barian hope to gain rhongomyniad s effect to entirely lock down my ability to do almost anything without any cost or drawback and there was nothing in my opening hand to stop it so i lost in two turns sound like fun i remember how in yugioh arc v zarc played a deck centered on shutting down his opponents by negating or nullifying their plays and summoning ridiculously overpowered monsters that were nearly impossible to get rid of and the protagonists called him out as a coward who wouldn t let opponents fight back because he was afraid of losing it s sadly ironic that a lot of metadecks in yugioh these days play exactly as zarc did and just like zarc they will overwhelm you and beat you in one or two turns without effort on the occasion i get matched with an opponent with a deck of power level equivalent to mine and skill level as well and we have a good back and forth duel where turns take a few minutes but not 10 minutes and i need to stay on my toes to keep up with them but don t feel overwhelmed sometimes i win sometimes i lose but either way i usually have fun i like duels like that but they re rare there s a way to tag yourself as a casual duelist in your profile but there s only one matchmaking queue no way to seek out other casual players for games it s dumb that you get no rewards if you surrender i ve lost i know it my opponent knows it why must i wait 5 minutes for them to finish flexing on how good their deck is before they attack and finish me off you get rewards if you lose so why not if you surrender when you ve clearly lost i also regret that there s no in game chat i definitely know there s potential for abuse but being able to talk to opponents even if it was restricted to after a game would be nice there s times i m genuinely impressed by opponents creativity or i just want to wish them good game and compliment their playing but nope i also wish there would be a chance to challenge an opponent to a rematch or to look for a best of three opponent instead of single rounds i liked the idea of the xyz event but it was flawed in practice since a lot of players ran decks that don t rely on xyz including pendulum monarchs and any other number of main deck archetypes i know it s not feasible to enforce players to play xyz archetypes but it still hurt the idea that that was what the events was supposed to be about i also like the solo mode brief backstories of card lore and opportunities to play ai opponent and try out new strategies and decks i think an ai versus mode would be a good idea give an ai opponent a specific kind of deck you want to face and play against it would also allow you to practice against meta archetypes for ranked play the yugioh card game itself has the same problems as always decks that are too fast and take several minutes to do a single turn and a duel will only last three turns or so before one player is overwhelmed master duel will live or die depending on how it allows players to play the game iwthout having to the same otk metadecks over and over and there is potential for that to happen different matchmaking queues for players seeking different kinds of duels more events to encourage usage of more diverse deck types allow for more socialization between players as is for now you re entering queues hoping you get matched against an opponent that will be fun and sometimes you do sometimes you don t it s down to the luck of the draw
