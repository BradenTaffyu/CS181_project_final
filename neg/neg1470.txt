2022 early access review a husk of a game really sad making this review after my uninstall because i figured out that by turning off fog of war from exploiting lord armies that number into the thousands of troops just up and spawn right next to you when you re sieging this is really not what i expected from 1 a simulation game and 2 the m b series i also call it a husk because there s really not much fun to be had in it most of the game from about 15 hours in becomes a loop of recruiting troops gathering an army and sieging what is essentially the same exact castle or town over and over and over it s really not even worth it to build up your own kingdom in this game which was a quintessential part of warband time could be spent much better in other games
