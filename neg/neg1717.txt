2023 this is a good game but it s also owned by ea pirate it please edit no actually that s not a good enough explanation this is available on steam as a free game but we all know that s it s minimum 14 maximum 800 for the actual full game so you d think that everything would be handled by steam as you are paying for the product on steam and steam is advertising the game but no then it makes you install origin which slows your pc and is generally a piece of nothing but bloatware then origin says haha actually we re outdated lmao lol lmao why are we outdated because ea decided to change launchers which is stupid update your old launchers to the ea app and forces you to download the ea app which them metaphorically and also literally proceeds to bend you your pc your wife your 3 kids and your dog over a desk and them until they die and then charges your next of kin for the game again pirate the game and send zipbombs to ea tech support or real ones if you can provide proof of these in a google doc i ll send you titty photos
