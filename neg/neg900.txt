just started an ultramodded playthrough thanks to their timely 17 bug fixes it is now not feasible or possible most of the modding community has moved on already all of those mods from pre 2020 are now defunct forever they have forever crippled the entirety of their mod infrastructure in ways that will not be obvious for years to come thanks to this little update uninstalling and never supporting bethesda again thanks
