2017 video review youtube video res reviews hearts of iron 4 views 785 resoula s hearts of iron 4 review two things 1 sorry about my voice this was recorded when i had a cold around the same time as my eso review actually which brings me to point 2 2 hearts of iron 4 is a grand strategy game by paradox interactive it s the long awaited sequel to hearts of iron 3 which was easily one of the most in depth grand strategy games ever made when it comes to raw military simulation with the organization of your fronts front lines second lines and rear logistics so let s talk about gameplay the bread and butter of any grand strategy game where does hearts of iron 4 improve in production easily hearts of iron 4 features a very in depth production system for your tools of war you can dedicate factories to producing your tools which gain efficiency over time as the workers get used to creating that type of equipment you can manually customize the strengths and weaknesses of the blueprints of your tanks which is a very interesting new feature so you can either roll with default things off the historical research tree or modify them to your liking lend lease has been improved and now you can send aid to your allies directly instead of loaning them your industry power in terms of war economics this is one of the best paradox games to date unfortunately resources in this game are static map based control points which grant you access to production this means there are no resource stockpiles which is a very strange and regressive feature that sort of upsets how amazing war economy in this game is the way actual war works is very strangely different from previous hearts of iron titles no longer can you organize your lines of war in with the in depth micromanagement that made this game series what it was no longer can you really fortify a line with secondary lines to reinforce and third lines to pull back your injured divisions now you just stack divisions on top of each other endlessly in front lines that fight in battles limited only by the size of the battlefield itself the good news is that with these changes and the addition of the macro management system of drawing your front lines and your intended targets the game is more accessible than ever in that what took plenty of strategic effort in the past is now accomplishable with two clicks of your mouse unfortunately all the strategic depth to combat is also gone there is no skill left in it other than the having the knowledge of how to create effective divisions and how to disperse them among your front lines air and naval combat have overall been improved for the better unlike the ground combat i d say they both work by assigning your fleets and wings to zones and giving them a specific type of goal to accomplish while in that zone the only annoying thing there is that ship fleets have no cohesion whatsoever the fastest ships engage first always and get slaughtered there is no fleet strategy you just need to hope you have the right amount and types of ships to win historical tech trees are gone those lovely things we had all around the board in hearts of iron 3 only a very few specific major powers in this edition of hearts of iron have those historical events no longer play the biggest role as those nations now have focus trees as well which allow them to research events of their choosing so germany can now choose to have an event that creates a new faction between them and the soviets and certain countries can intentionally stray into an ahistorical path the focus trees i feel are actual excellent additions to the series but only the ones that are specific the generic tree shared by most nations is boring dull and unnecessary graphics have been vastly improved performance definitely better than hearts of iron 3 when it comes to a huge lack of memory leaks this time around unfortunately the game is filled with bugs that mostly plague modders and as a result leave many total conversions left incomplete internet connection to host seems only vaguely linked to internet speed there s a huge slowdown you can feel somewhere in between how paradox connects its players and in matches with a lot of players you ll find you have to play at turtle pace speeds because one can t keep up the biggest problem once you get past the complete downgrade of this game compared to its predecessor is that the base game is so bare bones and empty you ll be wondering where the rest of the game ran off to it was released incomplete and paid dlcs have barely added anything worth justifying the price of the original game let alone the price they want you to pay for the dlcs hearts of iron 4 gets a 6 10 from me though i had a lot of fun with it and it s definitely an alright game but it s so bare bones it doesn t deserve to hit any of my good ratings this was a half assed casualization of a once in depth and strategic game if you are someone that is afraid of how complex grand strategy games are fear not this is so simple a five year old could play it but if you re someone who wants substance to their grand strategy instead of accessibility look elsewhere
