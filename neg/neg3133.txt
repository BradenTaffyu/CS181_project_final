2018 if you ever fantasized about naval warfare then this is a must have for you the gameplay is better than i first expected the graphics sound are great there s plenty of depth to the game especially with 200 ships balance is actually fine i ve played aa games that were much worse in this aspect overall i think is game is really decent however i would not recommend it if you re no fan of naval combat even if you are a fan this game might not be for you there s several problems with the game this is a pure and simple multiplayer naval brawl in matches lasting 20min there s hardly anything else in those pvp battles you might also get placed with ships 2 tiers higher than you this is not fun the limited map pool actually becomes very boring after a while the biggest problem is the progression system without spending any money on the game it will take you more than 100 hours to max out 1 tech tree out of 20 and get 1 highest tier ship this is a ludicrous investment of time so therefore it is wise to actually spend some money to make the grind bearable even if your goal isnt to get a t10 ship however the payment for this is 10 a month which is too expensive for a game this size especially since you also need to spend a few euros on other things the pricing in this game is too expensive in general it just isn t worth it given the limited nature of this game if you have no problem spending money i would definitely recommend this if you love naval combat you should at least give it a shot but don t be fooled by thinking you can play this for free indefinitely
