2022 this game has been very disappointing for me i bought everything on sale and i still feel like i paid too much it lacks the necessary game play elements that made the other games lively meaningful events depth to sims focus on all generations rather than just young adults memories ect i ll keep playing it but only with the help of mods the packs are just as disappointing discover universities doesn t work with rotational game play the vampires and making magic expansions had some pretty great innovations to the magic systems but the neighborhood was too small get to work was fun but the store part of the expansion can t run unless you re actually there and at the store dine out is buggy and it takes hours for sims to eat their food but at least it kinda works cottage living is actually great and it has just as much content as the trailers showed if not more wedding stories on the other hand does not plumbella s recent videos showed that it wouldn t even start the wedding sometimes and even if the wedding goes off without a problem there s no opportunity for drama you can t leave people at the altar you can express doubts about getting married but it s a positive interaction and there s no aspirations it feels very flat especially when compared to the trailer if you are going to buy the game get it on sale even then it s a toss up whether you ll be getting everything you paid for or if you ll be disappointed you ll be paying for buggy content that might get fixed in a few months but hey at least the aesthetics look great i actually like the cartoony design of the sims 4 but i don t like how the depth of the game became more shallow
