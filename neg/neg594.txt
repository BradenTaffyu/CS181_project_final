2020 i feel pretty conflicted about this game some parts are great and other parts are not i think of this game as a car with a great chassis a terrible engine and an okay body kit given that i have to give d os2 either a thumbs up or a thumbs down i m going to go with thumbs down chassis excellent the game s foundation is excellent the way that the game environments are built out of bits of terrain that you can manipulate is great it allows for quests that are heavily based on direct interaction with the objects in the environment and not just selecting options in a dialogue box menu i particularly love the liquids and the gas clouds which interact with the characters in the environment and with each other to produce neat effects the way the game s maps are set up is also fantastic with secret doors hidden underneath movable furniture and the sprawling networks that they hide are great fun to explore engine bad the rpg systems in this game are mystifying pretty much every choice they made for the game s rpg systems is confounding why does the game have discrete ap while the characters all move in continuous space why do movement and non movement abilities share the same action pool why does the game feel that it s necessary to have separate inventories for all the characters when you can teleport items from one character s inventory to another instantly and at infinite distance even during combat why are there weight limits in the inventories that are small enough to be occasionally annoying but not so small that it actually makes me think about what i need to carry and what i don t what does it mean that ifan has a strength of 13 at level 1 and 35 at level 18 how smart is a character with 40 intelligence all of the statistical systems feel like cruft from some diablo clone rather than something more suitable for an old school pc or tabletop rpg and usually at odds with the rest of the game s open world exploration and experimentation heavy design an example most of the game s builds i hate that term are an in for a penny in for a pound affair the retribution ability for example is only effective if you invest heavily in it from an early point in the game which means that you need to decide early on if your character is going to use retribution you have a similar situation with the four weapon skills ranged two handed melee one handed melee and dual wielding you ll never be in a situation where you ll be able to apply two of these skills simultaneously so it s completely mystifying why this is four abilities instead of just one that you have to pick one of them if you pick one at all and not take the others has the downside of costing you weapon choice flexibility and no upside at all that i can see and of course spreading points around these four abilities is patently suboptimal pretty much everything in the game like this with trade offs that aren t there or which don t make sense plenty of people have already weighed in on the weaknesses of the split between armor and magic armor system and the effects that it has on the game but really the bigger problem with this game s statistics is the game s overly aggressive level and equipment scaling system the difference in dpr and hp between two creatures separated by just one level is enormous while it s not the case that level differentials make winning fights impossible it does obfuscate how your tactical choices impact fights there are fights that i lost because i had inappropriate tactics and there are fights that i lost because i was underleveled and it was never clear at the time which of those two was causing me to lose the fight likewise i m sure that there are fights that i used bad tactics on and should have lost but was still able to win just on the strength of the numbers attached to my equipment and character sheet the reliance on aggressive scaling makes the tactical combat system feel loosey goosey and unrewarding really where i turned against the combat is in act 4 in act 3 my characters felt like they were living out their archetypical fantasy hero playstyles my warrior would wade up front and tie up opponents at close range my thief would dash around the battlefield stabbing people in the back and my archer would seek high ground and bombard opponents from long range these maneuvers were in line with the fantasy vision of these characters and the game was pretty fun as long as it worked out this way these tactics completely stopped working in act 4 every single fight in act 4 required me to use the cheesiest most un fun tactics i could think of enemies could kill my characters in a single round so i had to figure out how to deal damage to them without putting myself in a situation where they could attack me this usually involved luring them away from the spots where the fights were supposed to take place positioning enemies in pits that they couldn t escape from abusing line of sight rules lots of teleport spells and slowly plinking away at enemies with my archer at max range where they couldn t shoot back at me it was incredibly tedious and unfun even the fights where my tactics were clever where i dragged a barrel of instant death gas across multiple maps to where an enemy was going to spawn it wasn t fun for me because i wasn t really engaging with the tactical subsystem or the characters fantasy vision i hit the point in the game where i was either getting eaten by sharks or plinking away at sharks in a barrel were my builds i hate builds levels or equipment not up to snuff for those fights are you supposed to play the game in this cheesy way if you want to progress i have no idea but i don t feel great about either answer body kit fine the graphics story voice acting whatever are fine it s a game about elves if you ve played one of these games before you probably already know the story remember baldur s gate it s pretty much the same story as baldur s gate looking back i just think that the whole game is kinda weirdly grim everything about it is kinda dark every institution in the game weirdly and pointlessly sinister the game presents a vision of a world without any silver linings or bright spots and even the goofiness mostly underscores how cruel a universe this is as an aside a lot of this game s fans also strangely mean when you do google searches looking for help for certain parts of the game you ll get forum posts where posters get aggro against the people asking for help with its pervasive gloom the game only manages to strike two tones glib amorality and gallows humor this is a game where you can talk to dogs but they all need xanax
