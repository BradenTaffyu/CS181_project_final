2021 i was so excited for this i stayed excited until i got to the end and it all crumbled apart the simple visuals are nice and the long shots that set the scene really fill out the world but you can t skip it i ve tried to replay this game to see different dialogue and found myself frustrated with the minute long of waiting as the same visuals i ve always seen appear the story hinges on you getting emotionally attached to chloe max s childhood best friend and i never did i only hated her more and more as time went on like how she got angry at me for taking a few minutes to answer a phone call from kate as if those couple minutes made all the difference in her day she wasn t a good friend and the entire relationship was one sided the game forces you to care about chloe and you constantly have to fix her mistakes when it came to the end it was an easy choice but there was another issue the game is choices matter but in the end either way you choose all of your choices are undone and mean nothing it doesn t matter who i save because i either kill them all anyway or go back so i never had to save them in the first place in the end i felt frustrated and lacked any investment in the story
