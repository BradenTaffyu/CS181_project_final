2017 lol thought this was a good game until i saw this new update dlc package basically what everyone else has said the game is good it had some minor bugs and issues at the start but obviously they would be kneaded out in the next few patches instead of a patch we get dlc that should have been in the base game tents 4 us dollars for a tent my faith in the gaming industry is slowsly dwindling it s not an art anymore its just a cash cowpro salt f4 exits directly to windows
