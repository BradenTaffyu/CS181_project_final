2019 early access review after 6 years of being in early access and the number of bugs in the code the only thing i can say is that if the producers wasted the money they made off of over a million sales on this pile of garbage it s never going to get better don t bother getting it now because after about 20 hours of gameplay you will realise that every hour you play is almost exactly the same this game is almost exactly the same as minecraft with a lot of mods installed except that it will randomly crash every few hours have crippling ram leakage and if you re thinking on playing on a server with the intent of pvp the amount of teleporting players when everyone has less than 60 ping will make you question if the game engine was even meant to support weapons throwing weapons are a joke and i ve seen better water physics in kerbal space program if you exit a vehicle while you jumped off of a ramp the vehicle will float in mid air and immediately stop i dont believe that it s the developers fault that they didn t get the funding that they needed to make it work but whoever ran the project must have blown their entire production budget on blackjack and hookers i do have to add that despite all of the bugs i do enjoy playing this game in a multiplayer server without global pvp and on a private server where you can share builds at the moment it s a game that has great potential but is doomed to be that game which had great potential but never actually made anything out of it
