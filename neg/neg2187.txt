2023 wt has a negative game development direction typical of most microtransaction based free to play games honestly i just believe that gaijin s monetization strategy was flawed from its outset as a free to play game as marketing it as one draws in the most players yet creates major issues down the road honestly this could have just been a pay to play game like many other games or certain parts of the game like higher ranks could have just simply been hard paywalled so that sl nerfs and dragging out the game isn t necessary for the company to continue making profit i don t mind that gaijin feels the need to monetize its game given that at this point in development war thunder is a generally relatively polished game considering it has had years of development however the decisions made by greedy execs for short term profit are really killing the game as it is suffering from end of life syndrome now that it has been almost a decade since wt s release
