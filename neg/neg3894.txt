45 fricking dollars 45 this game was like 20 something lord just get a key from like cdkeys or something jesus christ on a chainsaw wtf is that price hike the game is not even worth that much it s buggy at best still has a lotof problems and most importantly runs like a crap most the time and to be fair there isn t really much to do in the game besides runs quests that get boring after the 15th clear zombie mission you are paying 45 daboons for a 5below version of project zomboid and i mean no disrespect to the devs but as a game developer myself with a game released 45 bucks is way too much for a game such as this tl dr why the flying hell is it 45 bucks it was 20 now its 45
