2018 this review is from my first and so far only playthrough with version 2 0 4 i got the game via a humble bundle last year but never got around to playing it until just a few weeks ago thus this review avoids all of the negativity of the major changes with version 2 of the game when i first started this game i was very impressed with it there were a lot of options and the game was just different enough that it took a little to learn exploration and system surveying was nice along with all of the different anomolies that would show up i formed close relations with one of my cpu neighbors and even formed a federation with them i also started to see the vastly more powerful fallen empires sleeping behemoths that i found facinating however the further i got into the game the less impressed i become anomolies that facinated me early in the game become repetitious my federation allies becoming war mongering idiots that were friendly with me but kept dragging me into one war after another with other neighbors i was bored with the game and ready for it to be done with a galaxy wide crisis hit that helped liven things up but the flaws of the ai became more pronouced fallen empires were steamrolled by the crisis because their ai had no ability to adapt their ships or tactics to counter the threat other ai friendlies including my federation members went in with vastly inferior fleets and ships and would get ripped to shreds even the shared federation fleet would get gutted and downgraded as soon as my current presidency ended making it worthless again fortunately the bad ai also allowed me to defeat the crisis since the enemies ai was almost nearly as bad by leaving its fleets scattered all over the place doing nothing instead of trying to concentrate its forces but prevail i eventually did and i was looking forward to a nice long bit of peace to rebuild my economy after so many military expenditures and maybe get all of the other factions to ally with my federation so i could win this game but no all of the goodwill that i had garnered with the other empires disappeared as soon as the galactic crisis ended claims that i had long ago recinded on their systems were still permanetly affected their attitude towards me a long standing issue from what i ve read and my federation allies immediately declared war on effectively the rest of the galaxy well ain t that great there s really no other way to earn victory at this point other than to conquer the rest of the galaxy i m more than powerful enough to take on everybody else but it ll be a very tedius task unfortunately there s only three victory conditions to the game maybe there s more in the dlc i only have the base game conquer everybody colonize 40 of the planets in the galaxy or have your federation colonice 60 of the planets in the galaxy last i played i had a long treck to accomplish any of those goals maybe if my federation allies weren t so comitted to war i may have been possible due to a bad gameplay mechanic but definitely not now on top of this all there s a number of quality of life improvements some that have been have been requested for a long time for instance filters or search functions to find where discovered strategic resources are in the galaxy or where terraformable barren planets are something that can become important later in the game extra tool tips to explain why i can t terraform a certain planet into a gaia world but others i can combat coulse use some love as well at the very least some extra fleet options so my fleets just doesn t charge head first at the enmy i have ships with weapon ranges over 120 why do they feel that they have to close to 80 units the furstest you can set them to overall would i recommend this game in its current state i d probably have to say no at least not for full price if you can get it on a sale then maybe go ahead although i was disappointed with the end game content and the numerous bugs and quality of life issues i can t say i didn t get my money s worth for spending only 12ish dollars on the game anyway i m sorry but that just happens to be how i feel about it what do you think
