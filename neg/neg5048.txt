2020 it s a great total war game but i m not recommending due to the fact that they still want you to drop 135 on the full game when it is now more than 2 5 years old unless theyre having one of their weak discounts i received the base game for free recently as they are giving away free codes with any purchase from the games workshop webstore also 75 for all dlcs content that is already ingame just locked behind a pay wall so you can only play a small handful of factions unless you pay more than you did for the base game disgusting business model
