2018 i recently returned to this game after purchasing it at release back in 2013 and having been massively disappointed back then tw rome 1 is one of my favourite games of all time while this game is much improved from release i still don t think it is as good as the original the original game made you feel like you were the ruler of a nation you cared about your generals and troops they were slow to obtain and train and settlement management while not perfect was enjoyable in this game the units just feel like very easily replaceable sprites it does not evoke any emotion i have to commend ca for sticking with this title the fairly recent addition of a family tree etc helps but it just misses the point generals die fairly quickly are too easily replaced so that you just don t really care about them to top this wives and daughters can now be generals and faction leaders in a large number of factions i don t mind this in exceptional cases as it did occur in the time period but in this game it is now so frequent that it is a total emersion killer for me
