2021 early access review only thing that is fully finished in this game is the combat system then again combat is exactly the same as in the previous installments that means that ranged is the best option again archers especially on horses just destroy everything infantry and cavalry are unfeasible cavalry especially grind is fun at first as it always is in m b games but once you get to mid late game everything feels like a placeholder early game content quickly becomes a chore ai in big battles is retarded enemy is always on the defensive always tries to form that stupid suicide circle both allies and enemies sometimes at the same time in the same battle so large skirmishes become unfun unless everyone just charges which is an extremely rare occurrence cuz ai can t be tactical it just dances around and does the freaking circle thing and yeah ai knows that archers are the best too so tries to win all battles with just ranged like i mentioned charges happen once in a blue moon campaign map ai don t even get me started if you become a vassal merc your faction will declare war on someone to keep you entertained i guess and will move its stupid armies to siege some backwater castle don t ever join those armies since they re slow and unpurposeful they constantly forget where they were going and change their targets they eat the food you have stored guess lords can t do their grocery shopping on their own if you finally reach a castle and seize it another faction that has borders with yours will declare war on your dudes within a couple of days and your faction won t be able to hold their own on two fronts this stupid f kery will continue until at least one castle is taken back by someone then everyone will declare peace for a month or so and the cycle will continue as for sieges these were never good in m b so i guess nothing of value was lost nothing was gained either new siege mechanics don t seem to work well it s just a giant moshpit in front of the ladder all over again whether you are fighting for someone or have your own kingdom defeating and capturing enemy lords individually in order to weaken their faction is pointless they will always escape captivity and come back after 2 3 days with a full party of leveled up troops to fight you again you can chop their f king heads off and kill them for good but this will ruin your relationship with everyone making diplomacy even more useless than it is oh it will also mess with your recruitment since apparently killing your enemies makes you dishonorable and the majority of notables are the opposite of that they won t like you anymore peace treaties do not work you pay them around 75k 100k for peace at all times and they declare war on you again after a couple of days talk about dishonorable those pricks they just don t care diplomacy is non existent the way to play that game right now is to get 200 horse archers and just kill everyone siege a castle no need to take it even wait till they come running isolate parties one by one crush them in battle capture lords chop their heads rinse and repeat until there is no one left to oppose you while you are drowning the countryside in blood might as well capture all the settlements that you can but what s the point of ruling over this cardboard calradia i d rather leave it to the looters tl dr most mechanics are promising but currently work poorly and are rather shallow after a while you just see how lame everything really is mods break after almost every update and yeah graphics look good and seem optimized sometimes there are visual glitches tho after so much time in development and all those updates i don t know man i guess i expected more
