2020 this may sound conflicting but this is a great game it just has way too many bugs for me to recommend it i have lost all the trophies and my lodges on multiple occasions now have encountered uncounted animal behavioural bugs crashes sound bugs ballistics bugs had my character progress wiped more than once and my level up points have been bugged for a while as well it just doesn t seem like paid dlc should be this plentiful for a game that suffers greatly when it comes to core mechanics especially for how long some of these bugs have been around i m not saying i didn t enjoy the extra content and even now i want more of everything animals maps guns vehicles and more its just that it feels like another slap in the face that every patch brings more problems maybe not to everyone but for a fair few of us every game has bugs and from what i know its a small team who are trying but i can t help but feel they should be fixing the problems first rather than releasing more paid content it has been very frustrating losing all my progress over and over i enjoy this game and i want it to succeed but i cannot recommend it yet if you are interested in this game id say wait for now but if you cant wait my advice is prepare to be patient you will have fun but don t be surprised when the game crashes bugs out or if you are unlucky enough delete your progress
