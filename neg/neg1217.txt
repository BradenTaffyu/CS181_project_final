2017 fallout 4 is a game that is both an improvement and a step back from the games that came before it compared to earlier games combat is faster paced and has a magnificent flow enemies take cover and move dynamically you even get a seperate key for throwing grenades and mines graphics wise fallout 4 is also a step up from fallout 3 and new vegas while they were wonderful in their own right let s not dance around the fact everyone in those games had faces that looked like they were sculpted out of flesh colored pudding here characters are nice to look at from prune headed ghouls to french accented androids it makes everything easier on the eyes and makes the customization options offered for your that much more satisfying through the character customization at the start and the settlement building system you can really feel like you re actively changing the game world opposed to just wandering around in it however at the end of the day that s all it is a feeling while fallout 4 might look and feel good it s significantly shallower than it s predecessors there s no level cap no skills and no real character focus picking your starting special points has lost all meaning because with enough grinding you can max out everything gone are the dialogue trees from previous games with their multiple options based on perks skills karma and previous decisions the fact your character is voice has reduced all dialogue to a paltry four options that are usually yes slightly sarcastic yes no and occasionally some form of a question worst of all is that your actions have very little meaning and impact you re given less options than any other fallout game in the franchise there s no karma there s no good or bad as long as you don t mess with any of the factions or do something stupid in a major city there s virtually no repercussions for your actions even if you have a companion who doesn t like certain actions you can have them sit on a bench while you rip people s faces off out of sight the endings if you can even call them that really reflect the nature of fallout 4 in previous games the endings touched upon the factions locations and characters you had an impact on it was crude and basically a glorified slide show but it still felt rewarding because the game recognized what you did in fallout 4 there s basically two endings that s right all the settlements you did or did not built all the decisions you made all the companions you met ultimately mean nothing they don t even get a mention at the end all that beauty all that build up for absolutely nothing of substance that sums up fallout 4 and it didn t have to be this way fallout 4 has a fantastic setting and plays around with some really interesting ideas it has one of my favorite companions to date but she and everything else in the game feel agonizingly wasted here with the shallow mechanics and hollow presentation that s why i ultimately can t recommend fallout 4 for those interested in a meaningful and engaging rpg however if you want a nice looking game that s modder friendly and lets you make beautiful characters then i suggest picking up fallout 4 if it goes on sale build fantastic estates tweak the bodies and clothes of characters with bodyslide and make your own fun you ll probably have some actual fun that way
