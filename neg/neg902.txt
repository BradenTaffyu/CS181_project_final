2021 fallout 3 and new vegas made me fall in love with this universe and rpgs in general after not playing this game on launch or for years after i was excited to finally get my fallout fix what an absolute let down its a dumbed down boring slog didnt even finish the main quest as it was so bad side quests are just as boring and the world just feels dead and lacking in any character honestly just gutted
