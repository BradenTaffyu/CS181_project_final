i could go on about issues like the lack of content or the always online requirement coupled with unstable servers or the lack of urgency with operation medic bag updates but those have all been discussed to death even if all of those things weren t a problem the core gameplay would still be flawed due to one mechanic that the game designers refuse to tweak the armor system unlike the previous two games in the franchise where armor acted as a regenerating damage buffer armor in payday 3 now acts as a second health bar as expected this had disastrous consequences for the gameplay flow taking damage in a game with hitscan enemies ones that hit you instantly as opposed to firing projectiles is inevitable you can play smart to try and minimize damage but the enemies only need line of sight and an accuracy dice roll that is often in their favor it makes maintaining your health armor feel out of your control and up to the mercy of the game it s a lesson that games from literal decades ago learned and addressed with their subsequent entries ditching map placed health pickups in favor of regenerating health or shields but the game designers of payday 3 ignored this in a misguided attempt to be different the designers know this system is flawed they ve added armor repair kits and adaptive armor as half hearted measures to make the system more palatable but these are bandaid fixes that don t address the problem it s frustrating that they still want to stick with this system 8 months later even as it continues to face criticism from a dwindling playerbase i can only assume they either lack the resources to overhaul it or are too stubborn to commit to changing it i genuinely think the core gameplay could be great with a few tweaks but so far starbreeze seems content with letting it fall apart
