2019 early access review this game had massive potential there was and still isn t anything quite like it on the market unfortunately it s blatantly clear that the fun pimps have absolutely no clue as to what made their game legendary amongst every other zombie survival base building game out there alpha 17 completely changed how this game is played to the millions of older players it looked like 7 days but the game mechanics are nowhere near the original the gameplay is now just a tedious grindfest all new perk and leveling systems have been revamped to allow for a much more static progression system than before alpha 17 s new lighting and retexture looks great and all but the gameplay does not feel similar to the game i feel in love with 3 years ago i m all in for changes and reworks to game mechanics but to completely change the game into something that feels completely foreign should have not been an option on the table especially when the game mechanics worked completely fine before then there are the bugs where do i begin as if falling through the world isn t enough several game breaking bugs that have existed since the beginning of this game still has not been fixed to this day i have not had a single gamesave that have not been riddled or terrorized with absurd bugs the fun pimps took a whole year to deliver a new major update with no hotfixes or patches in between and instead using some of the time to patch some holes in their spaghetti code they release a new update with no community inputs in mind furthermore as if this game s optimization isn t horrendous enough as is alpha 17 hit a new low in everyone s framerates rocking a 7820x overclocked at 4 9 ghz on all 8 cores with a 1070ti and 32 gigs of 3200mhz cl15 ddr4 i d hit 60 fps if i m lucky even in remote areas alpha 16 and prior wasn t much better but at least outside of cities framerates could match my monitor s refresh rate of 144hz even if the frametimes were absolute garbage keep in mind that i m not even running on max settings as cranking all the settings to max would net me below 60 easily all the time i can say without a doubt that amongst all of the games i ve played 7 days by far takes the crown for the absolute worst optimized title i ve laid my hands on all in all what has 7 days to die become games are supposed to improve over time or that is what i thought before experiencing alpha 17 for myself the fun pimps have no intention of keeping this game s legacy alive the company does not take in community feedback and input and goes beyond the call of duty to silence and ban users from their forum who criticizes the dumpster fire that the game is right now after all they ve made tons of money already and it s obvious that they have no interest in developing this game with their hearts i would still recommend playing older revisions of this game alpha 16 and below to experience what game brought my buddies and i hundreds of hours of fun only if you obtain this game for free
