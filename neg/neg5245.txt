2017 i bought this for 15 dollars on humble bundle and i still feel ripped off but it isn t a game without merit let s get into it the good it is a lot of fun for what it is some serious thought was given to the campaign map different factions are able to use it differently making for some unique play units move across it at a good pace too it was well thought out the game looks gorgeous for the most part faction units are well detailed the campaign map is pretty generals that feel fairly unique and sometimes alter your playstyle not 10 a pop unique though sometimes the battlefields look really good from a distance but the pop in on textures are still pretty goofy when you zoom in the bad it seems as if any real depth to individual unit orders has been eliminated or squirreled away as special abilities for dlc generals no spear wall formations wedge formations square up for cavalry strikes fire arrows or any other special tactics you could use to give you an edge battles in tw wh basically boil down to tossing a horde at a horde and having another horde flank that horde and using your generals special spells to give you said edge see the dlc peaking up again optimization sucks you ll be waiting minutes for larger battles to load guns firing and arrows going through the air look bad goofy like a bunch of snowballs or something huge leaps and bounds backwards from previous total war games smoke effects from guns and similar attacks are also not really present which is something i always admired about empire and shogun s flintlock units the ugly more paid dlc than a free to play over 70 of base content is locked to dlc you don t get a single full faction by buying the base game interested in playing pvp you ll have to buy dlc so you can play as the whole of your faction and have the necessary edge with your tactics only four incomplete factions available with the base game this is a warhammer game and there is no blood in the base game do you want blood well that s gonna be paid dlc too so prepare to pay a 4 premium if you want blood unlike shogun ii which was still a bloody rip off to pay for blood this game will have 0 blood in the base game interested in trying out the more specialized campaigns for any of the races and not just the grand campaign well they re there and they look interesting but that ll be another 20 per campaign the dlc you could still buy for the game takes up over half of the options on the main menu these guys know what they re about it s already clear sega is relying on the modding community to make the game all that it could should be in summary get it on humble for 12 or wait for a really good sale at the time of writing this review the base game is 30 off but none of the dlc is discounted again these guys know what they re about taking as much of your money as they can
