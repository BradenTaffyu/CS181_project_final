2022 scs software actively censors their playerbase to prevent any vocal dissent regarding the canceled hor dlc they locked all dlc threads on their forum and disabled comments on all blog posts tweets and youtube videos concerning the dlc comments are also being disabled in certain steam discussions and on negative reviews it s a very ironic practice considering that they like to throw around the term bestcommunityever to describe the people that they re now silencing who have supported their company by buying their products for years on end i obviously don t support the atrocities that have occurred since the full scale invasion of ukraine in february but many people have forgotten that this particular war has been ongoing since the 2014 crimean invasion scs chose to conveniently ignore this when they released a dlc that included russian cities in 2018 i could go on about war operations or territorial controversies involving other dlc countries that scs didn t consider as enough to justify canceling their dlc turkey spain etc but i won t for the sake of time cancelling the dlc does nothing except alienate a large portion of your playerbase if you are concerned about negative press why not just donate the dlc proceeds to humanitarian efforts since you already intend on not profiting off of it instead of utilizing your digital and financial resources to potentially help a situation you are choosing to let it all go to waste with your indecision the dlc cancelation is not really the main thing that bothers me but it is part of a growing trend of scs neglecting ets2 in favor of developing new assets and dlc for ats if you look at the scs blog posts and dlc release schedules it s clear that ats is disproportionately receiving more attention while huge parts of the map in ets2 are bordering on a decade old with no updates the only reason why i even considered writing a negative review is because of the active censorship efforts by scs as for the game itself it s okay i guess it does the job well enough for when you want to just relax and listen to podcasts you need to download mods to unlock the full immersion potential if you plan on playing for a long time i can t really fault it since there are no other over the road truck simulators that i can really compare it to aside from other scs titles with the same game engine the keyboard controls are fine and logitech g27 support works as intended
