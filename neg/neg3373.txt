2016 it will suffice to say that hoi4 has been my worse paradox experience so far and i loved hoi3 ck2 eu3 4 and stellaris this game needs serious fixing which sadly will only come with maybe 2 years of dlcs and patches by then it will be costing 100 usd ai is completely brain dead the front system is a mess and it is actually harder to micromanage your troops compared to hoi3 which is as must since leaving matters to the ai is a bigger source of frustration than actually managing stuff yourself the fact that this was released at this state really show how paradox really cares about their costumers if there s another side of the story they probably ended up with this broken game due to really bad design decisions and lacking implementation and even after delaying it couldn t salvage the whole think so decided to let it loose and hope people wouldn t complain too much
