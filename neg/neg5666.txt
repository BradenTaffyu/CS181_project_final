2018 game is full of bugs although its playable and is a decent game the worst issue this game has is the dev saying to mod the game or dont play i dont care about the addition of female generals but for a dev to say that to a fan base i will not purchase another total war game just because of that comment you have lost a big customer cause i own shogun 2 rome 2 and empire to anyone looking to buy this game jsut know that the devs dont care about the community and just want to do whatever
