2022 version 1 was great so was expecting a lot better from this game and here s why i m not impressed to effectively manage your park you have to spend the entire time zoomed out as far as possible to be able to see everything so you can t see the dinosaurs which sucks there is absolutely no utility to being zoomed in apart from to go oooh wow look at that dinosaur while everything falls apart because you re too zoomed in to see whats going on clicking on anything will automatically cause the game to zoom in so you re constantly zooming in and out trying to select things to action for example zooming in on the response station when you select a ranger team and then having to zoom out and try to find where on the map you wanted to send the rangers but for everything you do its irritating and slows you down for some idiotic reason the park visitor amenities are split into shopping food and drink it s completely unrealistic that a venue would sell either food or drink and not both hello ever heard of a cafe or a restaurant it s just a bit crap and its a sodding pain in the ass to configure each building over and over again to cover all the amenities you need three of the same building every 500 yards its just rubbish it looks rubbish it s boring to do and its not in any way realistic it s just lazy game building you can assign rangers to enclosures using the look out points but they dont check it often enough for that to be helpful dinos constantly need you to manually welfare check them weather damage is a pain in the ass you can spend hours building an awesome park and then a hurricane appears for 10 seconds and blows everything up you immediately go bankrupt and the rangers cant fix anything because you have no money and they down have enough activity slots not to mention you have to manually tell them to fix things and a hurricane will blow up 20 items per second whereas the rangers only have a to do list of 5 items there is so much waiting around for stuff research expeditions building blahblah to happen it gets boring quickly the guest type mechanic is an unrealistic waste of time imo apparently dinosaurs can magically catch bacterial or viral diseases from not having the right kind of plant in their enclosure i urge the developers to go read about how science actually works i cba to list any more what a drag jpe2 is an example of when sequels regress instead of progress whoever was making the decisions on this one was completely clueless
