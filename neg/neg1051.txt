2017 morrowind was the game that changed my view on video games and i still love that game following in footsteps i played oblivion and i loved that one as well then i discovered fallout 3 and it made me fall in love with it s universe and atmosphere and fallout new vegas solidified itself as one of the greatest games that i have ever played and it remains one of my all time favorites i also enjoyed skyrim alot and i loved it so without a doubt i bought fallout 4 with no hesitation and from the moment i started a new game i felt something was off with it it s not a fallout game to me i did not care for the main story and i did alot of pointless quests just to keep my mind off progressing main storyline lack of freedom and removal of roleplay elements outright insulted the franchise and fans the wonky building mechanics annoyed me and the barrage of pointless and dumb minutemen quests put the final nail in the coffin and to this day i still have not finished fallout 4 mainstory and i haven t touched any of the dlcs even tho i purchased season pass along with the game i haven t even gone back to explore rest of the world i very much like to go play previous bethesda titles again even tho i ve finished each of them multiple times over and over a video game can have many flaws and still be good and enjoyable but when it lacks soul it falls bellow everything and it s truly sad to see this happening to fallout franchise a franchise that undoubtedly had one of the most colorful souls i m absolutely worried of what s going to happen to the next fallout elder scrolls games bethesda isn t the same company they are following in the same footstep of other major companies that just produce hype inducing cash grabbing generic garbage these companies no longer see video games as art they see it as a market they ve lost their passions in search of numbers if you wish to understand the difference of fallout 4 and previous titles and understand why it lacks soul i suggest watching this review youtube video views 0 i tried to like this game for 175 hours it just isn t happening it s not fallout
