2018 i didn t write this original review by lenin information about new eula since take two interactive bought kerbal space program the eula has been drastically changed the new eula will restrict figuring out how the game works and changing it because of this mods are technically banned although the eula does not mention mods people under 13 years of age are not allowed to play the game to comply with us law this was not included in squad s eula as squad is a mexican company it is no longer allowed to make mods for multiplayer there goes darkmultiplayer gone damn you take two gameplay videos now require a credit to take two to be displayed during the first 5 seconds of the video any user created content can now be copied distributed or shared in any other way by take two without crediting to or asking you first expanision packs squad was already planning to add an expanion pack for kerbal space program which would be released around the same time as this one it just happened that the expansion was released after take two interactive bought the game squad had to give us an expansion pack as they needed money they were losing money the working conditions weren t good at all which in term lead to strikes which forces squad to sell their game to take two interactive my problem with the pack is that i wouldn t want to pay 14 99 for an expansion after buying the base game for 39 99 what makes me particularly angry is that we prpbably won t be allowed to make a mod for individual parachutes for the kerbals as that feature is included in the expansion on top of that take two s new eula most likely forbids it too conclusion let s revolt against take two boycott the game don t play it don t buy it play older versions of the game download a pirated copy of the game break the eula and most importantly don t buy the expansion pack download a pirated version of it don t support take two in any way you may do the things listed above but what will make the biggest difference and potentially could make take two listen is to write negative recensions about the game if enough people do it people might not buy the game when they see all the negative recensions it is very important though that your recension is informative about why you wrote a negative recension we are not criticising the game itself we are criticising take two interactive new players need to know why we are being negative about the game they need to know about the changing of owners and most importantly how take two ruined the soul of our lovely creative game join the revolution
