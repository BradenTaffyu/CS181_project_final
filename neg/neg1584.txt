2021 early access review stuck in development hell for years releases into early access extremely barebones even now aspects of the game are still lacking ai is completely busted both in and out of combat someone thought it would be a good idea to set your move speed to 2 after being released from captivity simply just lacks the charm of the first game very hard hurdle to beat full aaa pricetag to just put it simply mods may be the only saving grace
