2021 i had an absolutely awful experience with this game its plagued by constant crashing and several quest breaking bugs just because i exited a building from the way i came in and not the way the game intended me to exit i irreversibly ruined 2 major questlines only to realise my mistake 50 hours or so later this is absolute garbage compared to fallout new vegas also it is not an rpg as the element of choice is non existent in this game
