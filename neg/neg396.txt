2020 update new steam has told me i ve now played an additional 76 hours noice but here s all i got for you the game hasn t really changed same problems as before but it seems they think they deserve the labor of love steam award yo how about you prove it s something you love and quit focusing on mtx and season passes thanks update part 3 one wasteland has still any semblance of having a fun time it s all meta this or meta that wanna just enjoy a fallout game don t buy this one update again came back with the bos left because of one wasteland still ruining enjoyment for my character update one wasteland is a horrible idea and it has ruined any sense of enjoyment for later levels the game now requires you to have a damn near perfect build through every level of the game or you ll be out of ammo and have everything broken literally all the time who the hell thought this would be a good idea alright let s do this point by point 1 the stash limit is horrible you ll end up spending most of your time re arranging and attempting to store everything you want you ll notice most of your space gets eaten up by the junk that you collect in order to mod build or make other things but wait you can just buy the monthly subscription to get an unlimited junk storage that should have been free with the game 2 the games new instances for story are nice if they don t glitch either a mission wont start an npc wont talk or an npc will already be dead and you will be blamed for it great thanks 3 high level late game enemies at higher levels are just bullet sponges and a waste of time they also hit so hard it ll drain your healing aid constantly it s real fun to sit in a corner against 5 enemies constantly slamming into you wasting your ammo and healing aid until you win well whatever i ll just carry more ammo right wait for it 4 carry capacity is heavily gimped for the survival aspect ammo weighs you down guns weigh you down aid weighs you down junk weighs you down etc so i hope you enjoy constantly going back to your camp to drop stuff off oh wait see 1 5 perk cards a downgrade even from the complexity of fallout 4 s downgrade on fo3 nv wanna hack better equip those cards wanna use a shotgun today instead better switch around your cards but wait do any of the cards you want overlap with the hacking or lockpicking slots well you re gonna have to pick fighting or those think you can switch card loadouts on the fly nope even the card loadout mod can t do that efficiently 6 level limit well at least if they use such a dumb system they ll let you get enough points to just load up on cards and slowly use everything you want right nope they built this game as a pvp game failing to understand that people wanted to just quest with their friends this has resulted in a really attempt at a survival pvp environment with a fallout skin 7 pay to win fallout 1st you need atoms for repair kits subscribe or buy you want a refrigerator for food items subscribe or buy unlimited junk storage for your stash so you can store more legendaries subscribe only and so much more i already bought your game why do i have to buy basic features that should have been in the base game tl dr it s not good it doesn t work they didn t build this game for you they built it for their wallets
