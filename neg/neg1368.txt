2021 early access review how long till you actually implement an ai that isn t absolutely garbage 2 giants holes in the city walls and my troops hug the gate instead of going through the holes seriously how hard can it be to sort out your ai s not only do have to deal with pointless updates that only break previous saves after all this time they can t even design an ai that goes through breaches made into the walls and don t get me started about the ai s inability to climb a ladder theres a reason why have to destroy the walls of settlements as the ai can t figure out how to climb up the ladders and just huddle together letting the defenders shoot them to death having to use mods to make basic fixes which the developers refuse to do issue there is as soon as they update the game my save gets destroyed the game is fun not gonna lie but it is also frustrating beyond all belief losing countless soldiers due to bad ai which the devs refuse to fix then got the other siege engines troops running into the side holding the ammo because they don t know how to path around to load it so artillery is useless 9 times out of 10 put plenty of hours into this purely because i have to keep starting over due to devs breaking my saves stop exploiting early access to not fix or put any effort into your game another new issue is the peace mechanics as i have now had 4 saves ruined due to the enemy kingdom only doing peace if they pay me 30 000 000 a day which ruins economy and bankrupts the kingdom and only way around this is to stay at war with them why is there no option for just a white peace so i can avoid this broken mess of a situation
