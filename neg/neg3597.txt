2020 early access review this game is a really good base where it s a mix between rpg elements and survival elements your character does get better the more you play but survival always used to be the biggest factor in this game however the recent alpha 19 has completely changed this and it is no longer a survival game with rpg elements but an rpg game with survival elements the whole loot system has been changed to increase the early game by limiting the tier of gear you can find until your character has hit x level this for me completely ruins the feeling of a survival game where you could find high end loot at anytime since now no matter what you loot you will be limited on the gear you find purely because of your level looting gun safes will only provide you with stone hatchets and taking on a massive dangerous area that is difficult fully geared while having little gear to try and get a really good item no longer exists this to me completely ruins what makes a survival game a survival game as the thought of maybe finding something really good through a 45 minute trek through a difficult building using nothing but a wood club is gone since when you do finish it and get to the gun safes that are locked you will open them pick them to find nothing but 2 stone hatchets it is such a grind that i played in a single player server with 150 loot and 150 xp gain with 2 hour irl day cycles and by day 4 the best thing i have is a blunderbuss after looting about 20 30 gunsafes and weapon boxes this to me is not engaging as now instead of actually exploring to get better weapons it is better to just kill zombies for 5 hours straight with terrible weapons to level up your character as much as possible then go looting in the safes since now you will actually find guns in a gun safe when i play a survival game i don t want my loot to be limited by what level my character is and when people point out they do not like this the devs just come back with the response of well survivors will have looted this before you got there and left their gear in terms of the world yea a survivor went through an entire city with multiple gun stores and a weapon production facilities managed to not kill any of the zombies in these areas phase through the multiple locked doors and the metal gates put in place when the area went into lockdown then unlock and relock safes behind them and also break open weapon boxes and then re put them back together like they were never touched leaving the stone hatchets behind just to waste other survivors time okay dude this doesn t even make sense from a world building perspective since why would anyone waste their time relocking and rebuilding the boxes safes chests if you like rpg games with survival elements you ll probably like this otherwise atleast while this loot system is in place i would not recommend this for anyone who actually enjoys survival games since forcing people to use clubs and arrows to kill zombies for 5 hours in a game with wonky ass hitboxes and questionable melee combat is not enjoyable atleast for me
