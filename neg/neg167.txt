2020 i have to say this is an amazing game very fun engaging and exciting with great graphics to boot however i could never recommend the pc version square enix has made zero attempts to make this playable as it hasn t even had a functional fullscreen mode since it came out you have to download third party mods to make the game work at all and even then the performance is awful even with a good graphics card and with settings low the game still runs consistently under 30 fps and has a lot of bugs i unfortunately had no other alternatives to playing this game i don t own a ps4 and so i am very disappointed with my experience i hope one day square enix ports this game to the nintendo switch but until then i will never be able to finish this game just the worst port i have ever played
