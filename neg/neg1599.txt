so much potential but they left 99 of it out of the game battles are cool and that s it dialogue sucks your companions suck running a kingdom sucks being part of a kingdom sucks quests suck starting a family sucks crafting sucks city management sucks i could go on if you can get it on sale for like 30 then i think it s worth it as the early game is great fun with hard battles and when you do your first siege it s super exciting from there though there s nothing
