2022 early access review to begin with i really like this game if they were to keep it in early access i would definitely give a positive review but i look at the release date and then look at the state of the game and i think really a full release including console if you get into this game with the mindset that it is in ea and will remain in that state regardless of a full release then you will greatly enjoy it but don t believe for a second that this game will be completely fleshed out and perfect come october every single time i play something s break it is most often the ai in fact i would say in nearly every battle the ai does some stupid crap that it should shouldn t be doing especially during sieges the balancing for settlement and castle production is all out of whack some perks on the skill tree do not work or are not implemented well enemy parties will escape imprisonment and spawn with an army of 60 troops in unfriendly territory immediately raiding any village in sight and keeping the enemy warring nation constantly at full fighting capacity since those armies don t have to spend the time recruiting troops and building up their fighting force there is very little to do when your nation is not at war you can grind non combat xp do bland repetitive quests or chase weak bandit parties for measly troop and player xp the ai can get very confused during sieges the ai still has no idea what to do with ladders siege towers don t get me wrong it was much worse in the past and is at least passable but the amount of times i ve seen a group of soldiers just staring at the empty ladders is infuriating using a catapult while attacking a castle can get infuriating the ai reloads it for you but the pathfinding is so bad that the soldier will try to walk through another soldier and will get stuck until you jiggle the catapult back and forth enough for the reloading soldier to slide around the hit box of the other soldier for the defenders of a siege often times clumps of soldiers will attempt to pass each other on the battlements this results in huge traffic jams during a siege that will result in the ai soldiers getting stuck for much of the battle resulting in the enemy easily scaling the walls with no opposition and then killing everybody from behind because the defending ai is trying to get to some point and will do nothing else until it gets there not even turn around and defend themselves there are no back railings on the battlements so sometimes the ai soldiers will jostle you off the wall resulting in you dying from fall damage and forcing you to reload a save or fast forward through an entire battle sorry but this review kind of turned into a rant for me all in all buy this game if it looks fun but don t expect a polished or finished project for a long time even if it is fully released
