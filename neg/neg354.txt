2022 awful we expected a dlc wanted a favorite location to explore sandbox npcs story and going back to fallout roots this is a really bad daily ops it s a daily ops that you have to meaninglessly grind for just to get to the pitt its worse than disappointing i m angry i bought 76 when it was announced and have been a fan since fallout 1 this is fallout turned into a roguelite rinse lather repeat collect meaningless rewards this is so far away from the idea of fallout 1 2 3 fnv 4 it might as well be a different ip buy fallout 4 but boycott 76
