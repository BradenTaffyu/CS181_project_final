2017 played this for several years had some fun in game bias exists but that is to be expected how they treat their community contributors however is unforgivable uninstalled and closed canceled my account with them in doing so i left behind all the planes and tanks i d earned whether they were bought with lions eagles or earned in events any time i think of starting a new account i just look back to when they practically ordered their forum members to put copyright strikes against any contributor who reports and proves that hacking is going on in their games speaking as a player who has been pilot sniped from 7km away and through a mountain i find what they ve done to be reprehensible lying afterwards and saying they didn t mean it like that is just plain hilarious do i recommend this game no i really can t bring my self to do that if only because of how they treat people who support them
