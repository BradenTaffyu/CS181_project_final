i have played this game since it dropped and have even more hours than it shows on steamthere s no reason for generative ai in games and this on top of the insane amount of dlcs and the price tags on them are simply not okayi would have supported through the latter and i would have eventually gotten them all but never again will i touch this game now that it has ai in a job replacing capacity
