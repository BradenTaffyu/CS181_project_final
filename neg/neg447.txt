2023 i can not believe how broken this game still is in 2023 i don t even know where to start from stupid timed quests to randomly spawning in monsters no matter what i do with weapons to make them stronger every monster is just a bullet sponge monsters spawn in the dozens on top of each other feet from you when you turn your back i will be walking in the middle of no where and literally slip on rocks and injure myself in the game i have to make sure my controller isn t plugged in at launch or else i have to hard close the game from my second monitor through task manager because it freezes at log in need to repair your armor and weapons have fun scrounging junk for the next two hours while the rest of your stuff breaks on that journey feel like you ve gotten a hang of the game too bad your stache box is full and you should get a subscription of 12 99 to shove as much crap in there as you want i used to be one of the biggest bethesda fanboys around and the fall from grace they ve had has made me so angry that i can t imagine buying another game from bethesda ever again todd howard you deserve all of the thrashing you get
