2023 this game is very fun and easy to sink hours into but as of right now i would not recommend it the game currently has large unresolved bugs with creating new games and loading saves where it will just get stuck on loading please wait forever this happens on multiple computers of mine and tons of people in the forums discussion are experiencing the same issue using the legacy game version used to work but in the latest update has stopped working
