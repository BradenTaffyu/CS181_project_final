early access review gotta write a long nerdy negative review because the funpimps are dumb af game is fun enough but devs are really wishy washy and keep postponing content features in exchange for overhauling existing systems in the game over and over and over again or removing existing content for no reason at all these massive changes have always been loathed by the community because a it means the actual new content is delayed again and b the things that are being changed were 100 functional before and are seemingly being changed just to change them for example bandits just got delayed again with the announcement of 1 0 bandits at one point were actually supposed to be included in this current alpha release that is before the full release of the game instead in this most recent version we got another overhaul to the experience system devs thought it was a good idea to totally revamp the existing xp system again for something truly avant garde aka they call it learn by looting so now instead of just earning xp by killing things the games been turned into a collectathon and the player needs to randomly collect 100 s and 100 s of magazines in order to level up the skills they want the game used to have a learn by doing system kinda like skyrim that actually made sense and worked just fine i guess that system wasn t convoluted enough the price is going up with 1 0 also without anything to really justify it besides updated player models and new armor again updated player models and the armor rework were supposed to be in the game years ago according to their own words on their own streams the kickstarter from way back when and the multiple iterations of road maps that they themselves posted throughout the years they re also advertising the burnt forest biome as new even though it is a returning feature it was cut at some point because reasons meanwhile we re still using their placeholder ui from 2013 all in all devs seem really unorganized and unfocused in what they want this game to be that s evident just by the fact the game has been in alpha for 10 years now just the out of nowhere full release announcement coupled with a baseless price hike and telling console players to go pound sand and buy the game again is just a move on all parts
