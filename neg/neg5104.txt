2017 great game but after tw2 came out as 59 99 for races that should be dlc la carte rather than buying them all i felt taken advantage by a corporation again i d pay 9 99 for de then 9 99 for the he and 19 99 for tomb kings but after that i have no interest in skaven or lizardmen but 60 for each game well my low self esteem can only take so much abuse so if i had known this release policy in advance i d would have waited for it to go 29 99 for tw1 and then wait for tw2 to go to 29 99 and then pay the 60 for the actual whole game which is acceptable to my self worth as a person so yeah buy this game its great but wait for it and tw wh2 to go on sale for 29 99 lord knows tw3 which will probaly be tomb kings orgre kingdoms southern vamps and cathay will be 59 99 too along with lots of dlc that only works for that as well its crap like this that wants me to work really hard to become a billionaire so i can lobby congress to rewrite laws around the issue of right of resale and dlc which by all means that process is quite a pain to do because it would require years of intensive hard work or dubious business dealings but its starting to seem like the most logical thing to do at this point rather than write reviews asking if we could just buy games and dlc content at reasonable prices
