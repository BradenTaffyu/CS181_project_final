almost triple the price increase overnight without significant feature updates during early access release nah man it was fine for what it was worth before the release which was 6 during sale i was really hyped up by the potential influx of players during release day and the revival of online multiplayer maybe even some pvp support revamp to compete with the likes of dayz or rust but considering the price hike this seems more like a last ditch money grubbing pr stunt before the devs abandon it tldr stay away from this until we see some more significant updates in the future from the devs not worth your money currently
