2016 it s so big there s so much stuff so many plots but is this the coolest most boring game ever they put so much effort into the combat and the loot which is fun but i constantly find myself wandering around with nothing to do but grind the quests including the main one are so boring and dull that i can t bring myself to play them again fun until you get bored and then you realize how much time is wasted on a game edit since i ve triggered everyone i might as well elaborate a bit the game itself meaning the combat the loot the settlements gives a lot to do but the stories and quests are so dull that i don t want to do anything else but screw around which i m bored of a lot of my recorded time is being overnight afk basically if you want a story driven game or are a fan of the other fallout games this game isn t worth the pricetag if you want an open world survival shooter then this game will be fun
