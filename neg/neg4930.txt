2019 obligatory mod ban negative review review you got my money but you won t get my endorsement even without the dev drama though this title is on the fence on the plus side the campaign is good ish with more diplomatic and economic options compared to previous total war titles the campaign is still a far cry from more fleshed out strategy games like europa universalis or sid meier s civilization but ca is making some definite steps in the right direction on the negative side the battles are as of now very lackluster and boring which is especially problematic given the fact that battles are one of the core features of any total war game there s also very little in the way of campaign variety so once you ve experienced one faction there s not a lot of incentive to replay it this will probably change in time as more factions and startdates are added but given ca s policy of releasing tiny overpriced dlc combined with their current anti fan attitude towards the modding community well if you re thinking of purchasing this game in 2019 hold off on it for now wait for more content more sales and maybe a few sackings until then you re better off with cheaper more fully featured titles in the series like warhammer shogun 2 or even the classics which now include all dlc for free
