2019 first review i ve written saved it special for this one as others have stated the ai and difficulty rules are just game breakingly terrible the ai is basically written to be a game a catch up the harder the difficulty the longer it takes you to catch up and match the ais progress lets also discuss barbarians if you focus on building your cities up and don t have enough units outs to constantly patrol your borders a barbarian encampment will pop up and machine gun out units at your cities oh but if you take the time to build units then you fall behind in city development and to echo other comments the ai does some really stupid things like sure ignore my settler out in the open to go attack me full life swordsman
