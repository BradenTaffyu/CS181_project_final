2015 concerned for the future of bethesda titles in the grand age of computer technology i am starting to get worried about the future of not just bethesda titles but gaming in general with the exception of indie gaming it seems that mainstream titles are over simplifying features and streamlining what made them original in the first place fallout 4 is a perfect example of cutting back on features so it can appeal to a wider audience instead of taking the mantle of it s origins and extending them further let s run a quick check list skills points removed replaced by perks any survival mechanics introduced in new vegas scrapped dialog has been cut back removal of karma system seriously hardly any repercussions just a few off the top of my head anyway so am i saying fallout 4 is a bad game hell no i enjoy certain aspects of it despite a lot of things upsetting me honestly skyrim to me felt like where the whole feature stripping started when you compare it to oblivion and when compared to fallout 3 fallout 4 feels the same considering we have now entered the next generation of hardware i was expecting more from every aspect of the game not just the features that have been lost in time fallout 4 had the chance to be revolutionary not just in a gameplay perspective but the very foundation of it s systems aswell so in summary do i recommend fallout 4 in time yes i will modders will take bethesda s work and turn it into something more but for now i would have to say that i am left a little disappointed
