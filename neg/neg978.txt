2016 the gameplay itself is pretty fun for a while and it s amazing being able to explore the commonwealth and build settlements and all i loved a lot of the sidequests but without getting into spoiler territory the story writing felt pretty limited in scope compared to other games if you re thinking about buying it and have the extra money to spend go for it if you want a fallout with more customization with your main story and a bigger focus on your companions i d suggest new vegas personally
