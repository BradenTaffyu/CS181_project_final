2015 the game itself is solid although heavily simplified since earlier total war titles this results in battles being usually being over in 5 minutes or less and the campaign basically won after 20 or 30 turns when your empire has become so big that you can fight on multiple fronts without danger of losing what really makes it impossible to recommend this game is the relentless moneygrabbing strategy sega pursues with it s dlc choices many of which simply unlock factions that are already in the game or add a few mostly uninteresting units at a time the real killer is the blood and gore dlc which adds an option to the game that should be available to anyone who has shelled out for an expensive full price game from the start the next step will be restricting the higher resolutions or holding other graphical options hostage until the idiots customers pay extra for them i can only recommend this game in some kind of big heavily discounted bundle and even then i think there are better ways to spend your time and money
