2022 the gameplay is alright i would recommend it on those grounds not as good as prior entries less about strategy and more about doomstacks where i despise this entry is on the scale of money grabbing 3 games running off the same engine recycled not to mention the incessant content packs for all warhammer content it is just shy of 200 just like creative assembly i cannot be bothered therefore i m copy pasting this review
