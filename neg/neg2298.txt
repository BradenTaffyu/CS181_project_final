2021 while the base game is relatively chill and fun for a little while it s now eight 8 years old and scs is nickel and diming it to death with countless dlc and territories on which to perform the same driving the run your own trucking business sim part of ets2 is simplistic and barebones you never see any of your other trucks driving the roads no matter how much you watch for them you assign drivers you hire to trucks you buy outfit and then tell them where they are based the jobs they pick up are phantom ones from a separate pool you don t have access to and beyond telling them what cab they drive and where to start from there s little to no control or interaction with them and as a result they feel as artificial as they are once you ve spent a few dozen hours picking up trailers and driving from point a to b ad infinitum you start looking for something else to enrich the game which is where the dlc are supposed to come in unfortunately all they add is 1 more driving locations and 2 more cab trailer parts and decoration to change the look and sometimes the performance of your cab the base gameplay never really changes at all no matter how much money you shovel at the game the large loads addon can give you some slightly different logistical hurdles in terms of jobs loads but they are fairly rare and never as lucrative as the long range time limited jobs you can get on the market scs has had 8 years to add more diverse gameplay systems to ets2 we know they ve had tons of suggestions on their forums but only modders generally pick up on it and try to implement them scs is happy to milk this title to death without really improving the gameplay or working on a worthy successor that does have enhanced gameplay would i recommend the game after 500 hours only if you get just the base game and on steep discount when it is on sale don t buy any of the dlc except the heavy cargo pack or a country add on if you simply must have that country i e you live there etc they just aren t worth it for some changed scenery to the developers the day you realize the gameplay business sim implementations in ets2 are far too simplistic for today s gamer and start work on a new and improved version i e ets3 is the day i start taking an active interest in ets again it s stagnated stale and passe 8 years later
