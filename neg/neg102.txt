2022 early access review this is an updated review after i desperately tried to make the game fun by stapling 50 mods onto it and carefully tweaked every sandbox setting i was not successful there is a ton of simulation put into the game and clearly a lot of work done on the high level aspects of the game like horde movement and overall progression of society breaking down after a massive pandemic however the core gameplay loop itself is severely lacking and the game is created more as a this was your story simulator then it is a game you are designed and intended to die in some manner and the game tells you this outright there s not really anything to work towards past surviving your initial week getting a car and boarding up a hideout somewhere my positive thoughts clearly a lot of attention to detail and moddability put into the game over the years simulation is done very well high number of zombies simulated society progressively breaks down during the first month looting can be fun to turn up things you can use and there s a large amount of area to explore loot sandbox custom game can very helpfully turn off a lot of features you may not like about the preset difficulties like the commonality of certain resources zombie frequency strength speed respawning character xp gain and the lethality of being infected among other things as with any game of this developmental scale a massive modding community addresses issues the core developers can t won t addressmy negative thoughts the complex systems in the game will require a wiki trip to figure out what they do and what they can do for you and how to even interact with them as they are very often context dependent and you wouldn t ever figure out how to do it on your own skills like electrician metalworking foraging trapping etc are very trial and error unless you look up a wiki to tell you what you can do things like sheet ropes to escape second story windows need a hammer and nails for some reason and obscure tools are required for a large number of useful actions which you don t know about unless you are carrying the tool the crafting menu is terrible blueprints are hidden away in different tabs and hidden entirely if you don t know about the recipe meaning it is extremely difficult to tell if half of your known recipes are even attainable or require an intermediate item or if that junk you picked up is actually useful the menu is also flooded with crafting recipes such as crafting an opened umbrella from a closed umbrella or removing ammunition from a box things that were tacked on as crafting because it was convenient and the system was already there the fact i have to craft the shotgun shells out of a box into 24 shells before i can use them is baffling this is a dying is fun game but the default level of skill accrual and general progression is tremendously and abhorrently slow meaning dying can be an intensely frustrating loss of progress due to permadeath nature this can be mitigated by multiplying skill gain in sandbox settings however default lethality of zombies due to infection is also a ridiculous risk to take at any time there is no way to jump back to a save if the game screws up or you accidentally left it unpaused for some reason you die that s it zombie infection is an instant game over and happens based on diceroll getting scratched or lacerated by a zombie is a 7 and 25 chance of contracting the infection and getting bit is a 100 chance the infection is uncurable and has a 100 fatality rate you will die by default the infection kills you in 2 3 days and provides no indication that you re infected you have to read a wiki and eliminate all other possibilities of sickness to determine if you ve contracted the infection this is clearly a story element of your character succumbing to infection and thankfully this entire system can be turned off in sandbox settings as it makes almost any zombie combat an insane risk encumberance and carrying is never clearly illustrated and you will again want a wiki trip to understand it bags show they may have a encumberance reduction 60 on them but they never clearly say this means things placed in here weigh 60 of their usual amount on your character being well fed also provides a carrying bonus so you want to eat a lot but this then makes you fat which makes you less strong which perpetuates the process certain small containers like a first aid kit are flatly worse to carry for their intended purpose then carrying the items in it individually since containers only reduce weight when worn or in your hand stealth mechanics are largely rng and largely not worth exploiting unless you specifically build a character around them a stealth jaw stab move is shown to you in the tutorial but this is both rarely useful except against isolated targets like in the tutorial and also not easy to do unless you have maxed out stats like they give you in the tutorial zombies will notice you and attract more zombies over and over zombie combat has many subtle cues going on but can be boiled down to backing up and whacking the horde over and over the game will not tell you the first level of being drowsy or the first level of being exhausted is an instant 50 damage reduction until you go to the wiki and figure it out yourself moodle tooltips are unhelpful and not very descriptive as to actual effects using and generally carrying firearms is a liability unless you intend to use them as a noise maker to divert the horde or are in a remote area zombies respawn in unseen areas after 72 hours so you will very frequently be beset upon on all sides as soon as you fire any firearm lock on based targeting is finnicky and frequently targets the wrong zombie or hits targets in the background despite very high hit probability on your highlighted target guns are weaker than most melee weapons require ammo and magazines and attract hundereds of additional targets to your location combine this with characters being panicked or having a low aiming skill for even worse hit probability stray bullets will not hit other targets either and you may as well just forget ever keeping a gun on you bolt action rifles are both generally incapable of killing single targets easily at range and keeping up any volume of fire meaning they will always make a situation worse for a simulation game shotguns have a insane cone of fire around 45 degrees in front of you melee combat seems to be the only reliable and meta way to deal with zombies and for larger groups it is agonizingly paced and boring you just back up in one direction and swing when they get close enough repeat just make sure you don t get grabbed from behind or exhausted and you ll kill everything given enough time large hordes can easily be fired and forgotten with molotovs which trivializes the threat and really just becomes a game of herding the cats into the fire a vehicle with a siren virtually clears an entire area within 12 hours for you driving is abysmal traveling above 50 mph is suicide because you cannot see far enough in front of you to see a proc gen car wreck before you slam into it cars won t snap to the road at any amount as sort of expected there is really no long term goal except to survive as long as possible but for the most part your fun is self made exploration and looting and stashing stuff this is fine but there seems to be a distinct lack of interesting things to do that do not boil down to whacking zombies driving around looting stuff or fortifying sitting in your base doing nothing or accidentally losing hours or days of progress to an errant bite or accident if you truly do want to enjoy this game you will need to comb through every sandbox setting and install a double digit number of mods to address the base game s shortcomings
