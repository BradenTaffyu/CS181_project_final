2016 game looks very good and the graphics are great charge extra for blood the game is missing quite a few tactical things that the previous total war games did well spearmen and swordsmen seems to be used almost the same way for example very often it ends up with a massive clash in the middle around heroes i wish mages could have more effect on the game especially the really high level ones seem to be really ineffectual still releasing the game with 4 playable races and expecting us to pay extra for the other 10ish ones is like selling a table without attaching the legs 15 for the beastmen disgusting
