2023 i have been playing the civilization franchise since 2009 and it was the game series i truly fell in love with however the fact the developers made a sub par base game and then added on 10 dlcs that were also overpriced soured my enthusiasm the fact they unashamed still use spyware to harvest the obscene amounts of information of their own fans to sell to advertisers and or the government see the game s eula i thought they my have reversed course since march 2019 but nope the software is still there today nov 2023 this is a total betrayal of the fans and i will never buy a civ game again
