2023 this game is not free to play with almost 300 hours in the game its almost impossible to get past rank 4 on any type of vehicles on any nation because they cost so many silver lions you re paying around 30k to 40k for a plane at rank 2 and as soon as you go to rank 3 you come to a grinding halt with progress because p lanes double in price after each one you buy this means you need to buy premium accounts and vehicles to get anywhere near modern times not to mention the repair costs if you don t do good in a game your instantly punished with a 1000 silver lion repair cost which is just another way for gaijin to hopefully suck money out of you after every plane bought i am very close to silver lion debt and i m sick of it i just want this game to be actually free to play not free to experience
