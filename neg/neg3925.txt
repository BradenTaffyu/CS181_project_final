2023 i m very on the fence about this game once you get into it it s really fun it lends itself to fast paced gameplay zooming around tearing through enemies which is incredibly satisfying improving feels rewarding and earning your first few boss cells rewards for completing a run which send you back the start to do it again with increased difficulty is really satisfying the ost is also exceptional and the artstyle though a somewhat mixed bag really shines in a lot of the backgrounds for the different environments the problems which to be honest are inherent to the game from the beginning really start to show themselves once you hit 3 4bc as the game just becomes such a complete slog there is definitely an element of mechanical skill to dead cells you need to be able to react to enemies obviously but a large part of getting good at the game is purely knowledge there are an absurd number of enemies each with their own attack patterns and telegraphs becoming familiar with all of these is the biggest component of gitting gud each biome has its own pool of enemies some enemies show up in multiple places others are exclusive to certain biomes so learning a biome essentially constitutes learning how to read the enemies within it and re learning that pool each time new ones are added with new bcs because the game never changes fundamentally between the boss cell levels you re running the same biomes every time you re therefore faced with a choice you can just stick to the one route and minimise the amount of setbacks you ll face learning totally new enemies in addition to the bc difficulty increases which really is optimal for reasons i ll get to or you can mix it up for the sake of variety but substantially increase the time you spend playing as you get used to dealing with new mobs in the case of the latter the variety is largely cancelled out by the frustration of losing what progress you d made since your existing mechanical skill only carries you so far against completely new enemies so you do the former and this is what makes sense as there is quite literally a best route in the game sewers prison sewers graveyard cavern straight up just gives you more scrolls and you want scrolls because the multiplicative scaling is really the best way by far to counter 5bc either you nuke everything or you get nuked and when one scroll is worth potentially hundreds of percentage more damage of course you re going to take it all of this to say grinding 5bc essentially just constitutes staring at toxic sewers for hours on end especially if you re doing lots of runs to try achievements or multiple routes bosses it ceases to be fun entirely some other miscellaneous issues the scroll system is poor as soon as you start scaling you re locked into a colour and two thirds of weapons become actively detrimental pickups weapons suffer the same issue as enemies there are so many that you can either devote hundreds of hours to learning them or turn on custom mode and engage with a handful you re comfortable with the visual clutter is the worst i ve ever seen the accessibility update options mitigate this somewhat but it s still not great pixel vomit everywhere the game insists on having platforming sections despite the platforming being godawful the jump feels sluggish and you snap to ledges to mantle them from miles away removing pretty much any and all room for tight skilful platforming it s actually frustrating when you try to make a precise jump past something only to snap to it from halfway across the screen because the game is more interested in catering to people who have never played a platformer before a lot of the difficulty comes from cheap enemies that wallhack you from off screen and just very high volumes of very high damage mobs that just get spammed more and more as the bcs go up rather than any tests of mechanical skill or game knowledge which is part of what contributes to the sloggy feeling the writing is painful the game tries to have its cake and eat it too with le spooky mysterious vague lore a la hollow knight but also le epic rick and morty taking nothing seriously jokes and banter none of which is funny one of the more poignant story beats though that is a generous description is undercut by the cringest line and le epic troll middle finger moment i ve ever seen it s like the marvel so that just happened on crack the super secret ultra final twist boss is wildly underwhelming one of the blandest easiest final boss fights i ve ever encountered the rest of the bosses are also nothing to write home about the game s combat shines better in biomes at least before the grind wears you down the devs milk this game to an obnoxious degree middling half hearted updates and dlcs years after launch balance patches for a single player game just move on lmao all it serves to do is add bloat which is bad for the player because all these new weapons just take up space in your loot pool over the weapons you actually want to see unless you re willing to sink potentially a thousand hours in learning every single weapon but the combination of how insane an undertaking that d be and the existence of custom mode makes me assume that isn t how the game is intended to be played also on the devs they literally launched the game without an ending and while the dlc that added it was free the rest slotting into the main game despite being paywalled feels a little slimy overall dead cells is a game that seems to discourage you from engaging with it it s designed in such a way that optimising for the smallest amount of content makes the game most bearable and given how obnoxious it becomes anyway maybe that s for the best if you re content just playing this to 3bc you ll probably have a blast but as a full experience i can t recommend it especially for a comparatively high price tag especially accounting for the dlc as indie games go 5 10 the core gameplay carrying the first few difficulty tiers isn t enough of a silver lining to outweigh the unpleasant grind dead cells becomes
