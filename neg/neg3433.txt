2023 massive performance issues aside the game feels more like a knock off imitation of cities skylines made by some sketchy back alley developer than it does an actual sequel from the original developer and publisher i neither hate the game nor regret taking vacation from work to play it at launch but it s definitely another example of a game being released for an arbitrary deadline before it was ready i m reasonably certain that in time many of the performance issues will be addressed well enough for a multitude of people who are complaining about performance right now to be able to play the game decently well what worries me though is the way colossal order redesigned certain mechanics of the game versus the prequel i appreciate certain levels of complexity and detail when building my cities and the developers definitely tried to add layers of both to a great many aspects of cities skylines ii obviously taking inspiration from various mods from the first game for several features but for systems that were i presume built from the ground up with those inspirations in mind they didn t seem to do a very good job at integrating either those inspirations or their own new ideas into the mechanics so what we re left with is in my opinion a lot of game mechanics that function too complexly for too simple of end results and as these seemingly half baked systems are core elements of the game and or its engine i m honestly not sure how willing or able the developers will be to modify tweak or outright change them to make them play better perhaps with time i will become more accustomed to the altered mechanics of c s ii and learn to appreciate them regardless of whether they get changed from their current forms or not i know it isn t exactly fair to compare a brand new game on its launch day to a game that has something like a decade of constant development under its belt but is it wrong to expect a certain level of refinement from the very people who undertook that development hopefully this game will eventually grow into the shoes it s trying to fill and we can leave all these launch issues behind us and look forward to many years of watching this game grow into something that surpasses its predecessor but for right now it feels more like a step backward than it does a step forward this and the aforementioned performance issues is why i cannot recommend anyone buying this game right now wait a few patches and pick it up when the reviews start to turn positive it s probably better if you wait and buy it after it gets fixed rather than buy it now and let its disappointing current state taint your impressions and possibly keep you from coming back to it later
