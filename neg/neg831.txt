2016 first of all i d like to say that this game is not fallout the game limits your decision making and forces you to take on the role of a good guy the fps aspets are well done don t get me wrong who doesn t love watching raiders heads explode but it lacks a lot in an rpg element dialogue is limited and in most cases your choices are yes no sarcastic and more information unlike previous games when the character takes on a role of his her own based on how people were treated and how you may help or harm them it feels as if bethesda spent more time on preston garvey and his settlements rather than adding more of a wasteland atmosphere with over 200 hours of my life spent on this game i only wish i could have them back it was a waste of my money and time the game is not at it s best and it s easy to see what their main focuses were as i end this i d like to say i m a huge fan and have played every fallout from 1 4 i just don t think this game is anything like fallout and i hope that bethesda can change that in the future maybe in 2077 we ll have a fallout of our own who knows
