2023 i am not judging mod inclusion but the worth of the base game positives for bannerlord still great combat with weight behind horses and weapons but with better graphics greater scale battles captain squads relative easy to use tactical hotkeys and siege weapons are all very nice additions to the game cities and towns got lots of love with maps units reputation etc some of the warband jank is cleaned up ie animals go to inventory no more herding cattle new systems like smithing skill perks reputation and realm laws are in the game new factions that still feel differentnegatives for bannerlord taleworlds don t know what game they re making they built a cool combat system and sell it as a single player sandbox rpg but put sooo much development into multiplayer that was essentially dead after 3 months because its up against chivalry 2 mordhau for honour allied ai commanded battles can become a frustrating slaughterhouse if you join as a captain i ve seen too many battles where my allies single file plug walk into a wall of enemies companions and settlements feel less special i like bunduk ymira borcha and the rest of the crew from warband i remember the epic three way battles over dhirim that disrupted trade for an eternity i can t remember the name of any companions or settlement sieges in bannerlord realms seem to death war to a stalemate most of the time in warband realms didn t always form one huge army to hit one target there would be multiple skirmishes and smaller sieges this would allow the player to have an immersive impact with smaller defensive battles solo or with one friendly lord raiding and economic aid feel like this might be an ai problem on the overworld but it does lead to the next problem grindy its very difficult to try and do anything in bannerlord because the ai seems to want to preserve the status quo this leads to every gain you take being immediately the target of a unified enemy while your own realm will not lift a finger while not impossible to do it slows the game down to guard duty and made it not fun for me may as well have put in preston garvey late game is pretty much broken or non existent standard play is to make money get some guys together pledge fealty or create a realm get some land expand the realm diplomacy political intrigue and economics all feel non existent which really defeats the rpg element the way people treat you as a random mercenary verse a king is pretty much the same despite the reputation system conclusion everything feels rehashed shallow or soulless except for the combat there are some good new ideas and frameworks like reputation dynasties different types of local leaders skill feats realm laws but they are feel like placeholder systems i think most of my frustration comes from what it could have been if you don t mind the graphics warband and with fire sword are the better value games
