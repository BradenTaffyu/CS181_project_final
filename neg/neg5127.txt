2018 once upon a time a very long time ago i was walking through debenhams and saw some kids playing with models they all looked like they were having so much fun rolling their dices and saying they d lost so many troops then removed some of the models upon closer inspection of them they appeared to be models of small elves and some grotesque people i was informed by one of the people there that they were orks and high elves and that they were having a battle between the two different armies i went home thinking i want to be a part of that years went by spending an obscene amount of money on my fantasy warhammer warhammer 40k armies after which i gave up on them as i couldn t afford the money and time to invest in my hobby during that time there had a been a few good warhammer computer games shadow of the horned rat and dark omen but nothing that really took me back to golden age but i heard that ca were making a warhammer game i was so happy i d loved the original shogun total war games due to their blend of turn based and real time strategy if they could do it for my beloved warhammer all my dreams would come true seeing the slow trickle of screenshots then videos got me more and more excited then it hit me the whispers of dlc more and more dlc i thought to myself it will be expensive but still cheaper than my early years so i still invested in the game hoping it was good knowing that the developer would hopefully do a good job i ve spent many happy hours on the game but it seems that other people have also now be watching how much fun i ve been having like some sort of voyeur a piece of spyware was put onto my copy of total war warhammer allowing my data to be forwarded onto advertisers i never consented to this and there has never been any opt out option to it if the game had been free but the condition was they would collect information on me like so many websites apps that are free business model is i may have been ok with it but the fact i ve already paid so much money then to steal and it is stealing as i never consented to this my information surely this would breach some part of the gdpr legislation that was brought in in any event i won t be playing this game anymore until its been confirmed that this spyware has been removed shame on you guys at ca ruining my already gaming pleasure for your greed
