as a long time player of 7 days to die it s with a heavy heart that i write this review i have spent countless hours in this game enjoying its unique blend of survival crafting and zombie killing however over the years the direction the game has taken has been increasingly disappointing one of the most frustrating changes has been the introduction of mechanics that feel unnecessarily punishing and poorly thought out for instance the fact that containers are now destroyed when you drink water from them is utterly nonsensical it s a minor detail but it disrupts the immersion and adds a layer of frustration that feels more like a bug than a feature then there s the new read to learn skilling system what used to be a flexible and organic progression has turned into a grindy and arbitrary process instead of naturally improving skills through practice and exploration you re now forced to search for specific books to level up this change strips away the player s sense of control and satisfaction over their character s growth and feels like a step backward on the other hand the game has introduced some mechanics that rather than adding to the challenge simplify the experience in ways that detract from its core survival theme for example the ability to spawn directly at your backpack after death removes much of the tension and consequences of dying what used to be a tense journey back to retrieve your items is now a trivial task reducing the overall challenge and thrill these changes along with others have fundamentally altered the game i once loved it no longer feels like the gritty survival focused experience it used to be instead it s a mishmash of frustrating mechanics and unnecessary simplifications given the current state of the game i can no longer recommend it especially not at its increased price 7 days to die was once a must play for survival fans but now it s hard to justify the investment of both time and money it s disappointing to see a game with so much potential take such a wrong turn
