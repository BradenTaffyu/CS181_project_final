2016 pretty good total war picking a fantasy world was a good idea because their other games were just loosely historic it is fun for awhile many many many issues from the old total war titles still remain diplomacy has not changed at all every other turn goes like this allies ask for help i declare war next turn enemy asked for peace offers 1500 i make peace make free money next turn allies ask for help again repeat repeat every 5 turns or so i decided not to make peace just to speed up my turns enemy generals charge straight into battle except in this total war generals are more powerful so it is less of an instant win enemies still still come on make armies that are stacks of mostly catapults it is bad enough fighting stacks of orcs made up of 50 archers what is the fun in that this total war must use the same method for determining army composition they didnt even try on the battle map the enemy ai only has two modes 1 advance toward player hope archer units can piss off player and draw forces away 2 flank at any cost thats it that is how every battle is played if you guard your flanks well the ai will stop moving and think it is the same as other total war games found what i think might be a bug if you select a hero agent thane for example as dwarves then hit the arrow at the top of the screen to cycle through all of your characters it jumps to the lords generals and never goes back to the heros agents it will just cycle between your generals edit i think when cycling through characters it only skips the ones that are in an army still kinda buggy though units are not balanced well i will have to mod them chariots have tons of hit points and just sit there as multiple units attack orc cheap o archers have the missile damage as dwarves who are masters of technology crossbows rifles cannons here are a couple of pros dwarf and goblin underground movement is just plain awesome it is an improvement that is just perfect it makes sense it plays well adds a whole new dimension i also like being able to collect items for generals and heros works well almost rpg like
