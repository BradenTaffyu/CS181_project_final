2023 they did it again there is one of the greatest rts of all time sitting on relic s shelf it is called coh 1 and all they really had to do was to build on what they got there instead they built a total war hybrid and added many of the same mistakes they made with coh2 the result is still a decent game but unfortunately not one that could measure up to its origin add to that the game is hardly much to look at in 2023 and the interface is not what one would call polished ether so its not like there is no fun to be had here but if you were hoping there might finally be a worthy successor to coh 1 you will be massively disappointed it feels more like an overhauled coh2
