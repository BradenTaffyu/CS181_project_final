2019 i ve uninstalled this game two times and i ve got tons of storage so i usually don t do that the first time was because the game automatically installed with the game redshell a spyware program that steals your information for ad targeting the second because their new eula which again you agree to by having the game installed gives them permission to access every bit of personal information your pc can give them both times just happened to be at the same time their big very expensive expansion dlc comes out it s clearly no coincidence that they put this garbage in at the same time the most users have the game installed it s a disgusting and predatory business practice and it makes me feel just disappointed the greed in video game developers today is just sickening if you really want to buy this game go buy civ 5 it s a great game some say much better than this one and the best part is they aren t updating it anymore it s safe from its own developers edit it turns out that all the significant patches only go towards the dlc rather than the main game remember that really cool mechanic in civ 5 the world congress really fun and interesting right remember how people were complaining that it wasn t in this newer version well it s in now as long as you have the dlc please buy the dlc please they held an old beloved game mechanic back and sold it as part of a dlc super overpriced by the way don t forget i d like to close off by saying 2k games is an awful publisher everything they touch is littered and tainted with egregious monetization and i discourage anyone and everyone from buying anything with their brand on it from now until they stop taking advantage of their customers thank you for reading
