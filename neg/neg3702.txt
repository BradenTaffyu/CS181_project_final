this is the same game i last played back in 2021 but with some updated lighting post processing some new player models that look like they re from a different game entirely and the same tired disjointed progression that has me missing all of the old quality of life mods i used to run to make the game more tolerable this is a 1 0 release i m having a lot of trouble seeing what s new and what s not just the same content i remember seeing from the last 5 10 years but with a slightly new coat of paint smells of we give up slap 1 0 on it ship it and move onto the next project i m thankful i already got my fun out of it because it s a real shame if this is what the end of a 10 year early access cycle looks like
