2018 so recently i ve decided to finish my imperator augustus campaign which i ve started early this spring late winter as octavians rome i had armies fighting barbarians close to denmark western germany and guess what out of 4 barbarian stacks 3 were led by women it wasn t like this before i had a break so my jaw dropped when i saw this nonsense it appears that ca altered my saved game and turned barbarian kings into queens now i see why people are mad and downvote this game ca broke immresion for me as well and come to think of it i bought every single total war game since rome 2 and i even bought all dlcs as well i was die hard fanboy of ca and they pay me back like this do not force your political agenda on me or i will vote with my wallet either cut all feminist nonsense out or you will lose your loyal customer i am done with you ca for now
