2020 after playing enough to see as much of the game as possible i can say this is one of the most disappointing fallout games there are it s bloated with mediocre features that make the game look like it has an identity crisis and while the writing itself is alright it s ruined by the game s horrible 4 option only dialogue system which is vague and fails to reflect what my character is actually going to say rpg elements are dumbed down as the only things that make builds different from each other is how they perform in combat and nothing else remember when the perks and skills you invested in could affect even dialogue well that doesn t happen here i m not joking when i say that most of the time your option are saying yes no sarcastic douche and still agreeing and exiting the conversation the game s only saving grace is the modding and while that s not a bad thing by itself it s the modders that do the heavy lifting for the game and if you want to get it for that reason i don t blame you as i did the same play tarkov or far cry instead at least those games know what they are and what they want to be and they do it well oh and you can always check older fallout games even 3 ps to the developer who decided to make most guns left handed go to hell do your research on how guns work edit back to the topic of modding a lot of you must be aware of the fallout 3 and nv remake mods coming to fo4 and as i previously mentioned if you wanna get this game for that reason go ahead those two games are classics that deserve a remake and if you see this review go up in play time it ll be because of said mods because i can assure you i m getting them and if you want to avoid giving bethesda your money directly get the game through a reseller edit 2 i m a huge fan of the new vegas mod dust and i discorvered its fo4 version frost honestly i d recommend that over the base game it removes the main story bye bye shaun never cared for you anyway and turns the game into a true open world sandbox hardcore survival game i m having lots of fun with it tldr frost mod base game
