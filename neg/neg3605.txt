2018 early access review lazy devs yearly updates mods ban and censor anyone who even slightly criticises the game before i start my review this is the only place i can voice my concerns we bought the game we have the right to critisize the game if you insult the game on the forums they claim you are trolling i do not recommend this game at all it s pretty fun but the game is so poorly optimized the devs are the laziest salty devs you will ever meet mods ban and delete post of anyone who questions them or even asks something nicely the updates come about once a year and constant failure to meet deadlines most of their fan base is filled with circle jerkers who believe any excuse the devs make they flame anyone who questions the devs transparancy is ethical but according to the fanbase fans don t deserve to know what goes on with the game funding again this game is fun for the first couple hours but it becomes repetitive constant bugs and terrible frame rate frame rate is important when the hordes start growing bigger using vehicles makes you wonder if the devs have ever rode bikes because they don t know how they work imagine making around 75 million with 3 million copies sold only to put an update once a year devs who don t prioritize their games should be called out for what they are lazy devs it s better to support devs like subnautica who actually put in tons of effort to release their game with any luck 7 days to die will be released in 10 years
