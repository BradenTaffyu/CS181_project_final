2019 first things first about the game itself game was not bad at all one of the better total wars ai wasn t horrendous the gameplay wasn t too bad quite a nice variety of units in the base game its really fun to play with your favorite 3k characters localization was made professionally they speak an older traditional chinese properly in fact i switched the audio to chinese as it sounds better would it be a thumbs up no due to corporate greedthe story behind the scores of negative reviews can be summarized as creative assembly made quite a bit of money through steam especially on chinese players as a matter of fact 3k was targeted towards the chinese market since its a no brainer chinese culture good for chinese players hence why fantasy genres are good for a whole population in this case it is naturally advantageous to place it in chinese markets after making bank af profits from china creative assembly sold off the title to netease which is essentially regulatory body for video games in china they say they are a reseller but they censor both the game and mods ex china pm xi shows up as so it ends up with your characters being named chu the chinese players got the play the same uncensored retail version as us now they have to go through a censored version if ca wasn t that greedy they would keep the title s rights to themselves and keep distributing it but hey ca grace can promise how many times she wants that things won t change for the chinese players but they already have gotten censored and they don t have the right to use the game mods as the west this is infuriating you are segregating the west from the east again you still took the chinese video gamers money at full price on release didn t you i m pretty sure if you disclosed that in the long run you would leave distribution to a chinese retailer you wouldn t get a lot of sales on release eh on top of this you can add 8 princes suck you remove all notable characters and dump us in a side story chapter where we can t care recognize anyone with a bunch of generics in a sandbox and charge us 15 cad shamful dispray
