2021 super super fun game i absolutely loved it loved i say that in past tense because the game is spyware they collect your geolocation your zip code payment info first and last name the type of hardware you have and the different computers you ve been on they take the info from multiple computers and compare the data for more accurate info what type of game does that i will not allow this to be on my computer anymore and the developers should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for ruining a spectacular game they harvest every little bit of data out of your computer as you play hopefully only selling to advertisers for big bucks as they fill their greedy pockets off of our private information that they blatantly have no regard for in the eula they rub our noses in it by saying something along the lines of if you don t like us taking in your data this way don t play the game i m tired of being another cog in these machines i encourage everyone to avoid this game like its airborne ebola update if you just can not resist this game like obviously i couldn t then use a vpn that you can completely trust it s the first step of the marathon to making sure you re protected from games like these
