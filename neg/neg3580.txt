2023 early access review this game is just survival evolved but with a re skin so just read that review if your pc can actually run it if it cant then there is 0 point in getting this now or the future as they haven t implemented the other maps some of which was promised on launch which didn t happen makes you really ask damn could ve gotten evolved for like 10 honestly a disappointment graphical changes sometimes the color and lighting looks cool at specific moments and if you have a godlike pc then it might be worth as supposedly they are going to add all the maps with some new creatures with the pvp servers changes then it could be a fresh experience but the servers are also with high ping across the board performance is a joke unless they are legit trying to make another crysis benchmark for us if you try to play at a playable framerate 60fps the graphics are just similar to evolved except maybe more vibrant colorsyes they added qol changes that is pretty big for this game as the original was already riddled with their clunky menus but that seems to be the biggest change in my opinion they also advertised better pathing which may be working like 15 better as only 1 4 of your dinos get lost while following you through a forest yaaay for the mf that says its good it really aint i know its pretty much advertised as such where its just a graphical change and it semi delivered you cant deny wildcard is hitting the with this as there was little to no advertisment outside of the core ark fans and discord no better servers no new maps need a 4090 to even run medium settings with good frames making private servers exclusive to 1 company before people would compete to make better servers and a diff experience than vanilla like can someone tell me the value of this game other than it being a cash grabpvpand for the pvper s its also more dino than tek based so thats cool for pvp servers are still trash havent played on evolved servers b4 but when i asked around the ping and dinos jumping from place to place seems to be common the dinos jumping around isn t terrible until you get stuck in a pack within a literal instant and cant fight back there you go your level 200 tame that took 1 2 hours getting to that point to only have the server on you not to mention the constant server crashed and rollbacks the game punishes you more than the people and we aint talking about the dinosmy pc for power reference amd ryzen 7 5800x 8 core processor 3 80 ghzamd radeon rx 6700 xt graphics card nvidia 3070 equivalent they spent resources and delayed ark 2 for this bs bruh
