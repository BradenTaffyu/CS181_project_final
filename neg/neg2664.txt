2020 as much as i love this game overall most of the fun interesting features are locked behind the dlc wall in fact i would even dare to say there were more things available in the base game before the dlcs than there is after i remember being able to get things like nihlistic aquisition the flesh is weak and a few other things that have since seemed to be folded into dlcs and effectively removed from the base game i can t tell you how many times i ran into something that seemed to be just missing from years prior and then going on youtube and finding that it s in the game but just now folded into some dlc pack that while it did expand it effectively locked it behind a paywall the game feels crippled to me with so many of the unity options and research techs just gone and it seems some of the old stories missing much of the depth and variety of the game just isn t there in the base game granted if you have a hundred or so dollars laying around and really do enjoy this kind of game it may be worth dropping the money on this as there are few if any 4x games of this caliber out there it truly does draw you into a deep narrative as the story of your race goes on through the ages i just wish they hadn t basically removed so many of the parts they expanded on from the base game and tucked it behind a paywalls
