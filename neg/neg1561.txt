2020 early access review played for 3 hours and i would say it is a very simillar to regular mount and blade i would tell you guys to buy the game but i would still advice u all to wait since it crashes some times and the game still needs to be polished but overall its a good game also in my opinion some hud and player interactions menus can also use some work also at the moment i don t see the worth of a 40 euro game i would say its good and better than previous mount and blade i would have also liked more varity of quests instead to quests repeating plus this is a problem i might have found out but it would be a good thing to get information of travelling nobles from other nobles like in previous mount and blade or you could buy that information from some place of the same faction it could help i hope when the game fully releases it would be worth the money but as for now it is good if u love large and better battles not judging this game very critically since its in early access and will give it time to improve
