2018 post patch ruined all the races made after a massive overhaul of the interface and such really has put a massive damper on the game when i have to completetly redo 16 races due to the radical changes new features are nice but added a massive unessisary required depth to the game fun at first but when managing 50 systems and dealing with pirates and shipping goods and alloys to manage happiness update made games last several hours longer managing silly new interfaces and managing jobs and such gotta say game went from fun and enjoyable to tedious and a paused fueled mess
