2017 i dont often give bad reviews at all but for this game i feel i have too as most of the new stuff they added atvs and tents so far is paid dlc the game is expensive enough without having to buy these dlcs and as i rudely told by a mod on the forums as i apparently wanting free stuff as i had no money is quite disgusting and i have money i just refuse to pay full price for a game then keep having to buy these silly things that personally should have been added for free paying for an expensive game
