2023 product received for free i love company of heroes series and this third instalment is currently a big disappointment compared to the previous titles the dev has been advertising themselves for their coh dev program which emphasizes on listening to the player s feedback and it did not deliver well about 3 months before release relic sent us a tech test supposedly the final playtest before launch for players to have a feel of the game and oh boy did we spot so many problems that i thought it should have belonged to an alpha beta and not of a launching game the main menu ui is very subpar with no theme or font compared to the previous games it also has reverted artwork with every soldiers there holding their weapons left handed this issue also exist on the very game s box art in steam you can see the british soldier holding his gun with bolt on the left while it is not a problem with gameplay it shows lack of care to their own product unique color option is confusing you can be a red player on blue territory while the enemy is blue with red territory edit the issue has been addressed sounds is probably the worst aspect of the game units yell over one another even overwhelming the announcer at time giving us no time to breathe and absorb the information on the battlefield in game description is very bad edit many units still has their unit name too long and the letters has to scroll itself like a billboard periodically to show the rest of the name overall i dearly want the game to be a success given my immense love for the previous titles but at this current state i cannot recommend it at all my rating is 4 10 for now saving grace is a decent number of faction at the start an ok attempt in blending the commander and doctrine system of coh1 and 2 not very laggy can still crash occasionally relic has done quite a bit to fix the core part of the game the bad sound mix and anti climatic in game effect still can t win me over really but i have to acknowledge their effort their coming patch seems to lack the content amount needed for an expansion but we will see if they have plan to add more to it right after or just leave it at that communication about changes has been improved though i wish they have a more well planned road map for the year and communicate more about why they make certain decision
