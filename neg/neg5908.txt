2018 this game is really mixed there are good and bad things but for every good thing it feels like they did something bad as a result i ve been playing this game for about three months on mobile already first off the tech tree here in the form of knowledge is vastly superior to btd5 s buildings and coin system it s a lot less restrictive since you don t have to complete maps to unlock them you can get them as you level up allowing you to tailor them according to your own play style the problem is that there aren t enough options many tech tree options do little to expand on what your monkeys can do or only buff up one branch of it i found myself investing almost entirely into the military one and then the magic one because they actually had more utility than the rest upgrades also have to be unlocked with experience you get from using said monkeys the experience rates are pathetic and seem to stop even if you keep going after clearing the rounds this really discourages any attempts to push as far as you can there are tons of new upgrades each monkey now has three branches instead of two and five upgrades for each branch instead of four however you can only use two branches for a single monkey and you can only have one of each tier 5 upgrade on a single map this results in a lot more options and a lot of new builds the problem is that these options are rarely ever practical they often cost at least 3x more in some cases 10x than the previous upgrade with many of the lowest costing 25k and the top ones crossing 120k you would clear impoppable maps before you even had a chance to buy these due to their absurd cost there s also paragons now which can cost 900k in the case of the monkey wizard s on top of all the costs necessary to max out all 3 of the branches graphics and map design are a definite improvement with terrain being a factor now due to the 3d nature of maps line of sight can be blocked making it more difficult to utilize snipers the mages can get around terrain effects with an upgrade and aerial types like airplanes and helicopters can by pass this limitation as well giving new depth the problem of course is that it just becomes another restriction like water and your first time through some maps can be entirely luck based because when you use your money to clear the terrain you re not exactly sure what you re going to be getting and that s not good the biggest problem i have found with the game is half cash mode which is pretty much there to offset the double money purchase for 10 on mobile and the chimps mode which disables all forms of skill trees continues double money and money generating upgrades the issue with these is that they are just poorly balanced and feels like a poorly made restriction challenge that was not properly thought through so they just say turn off everything even the ability to sell monkeys this is especially problematic since you re likely using the skill tree that makes many modifications to your game so it s like playing with a different set of rules i wish the hard mode was actually more than just turning everything off the other problem is that after clearing a map for the first time the rewards instantly drop to 1 10th of what it was this eliminates replay value from most maps and makes your monkey money that you earn worthless for anything other than continues it s too bad you need like 10 clears to just get 1 continue the only real source of money is from the daily challenges and that is not good editing to add the last problem and biggest i have to add is with co op if you get matched with a cheater congratulations your account is flagged for cheating as well because they can t actual identify who the cheater is say good bye to all your progress unless you want to play solo and be banned from contested territories clan races i suggest staying away from co op entirely for this reason alone because all it takes is one match made cheater to ruin your entire account this is on top of all the connectivity issues that comes with co op game speed can vary and if you get disconnected you aren t always able to rejoin the game and while we re on this topic keep in mind that the game does monitor what you have running on your computer at all times like certain other anti cheats this is not disclosed on the store page
