2021 for context i m a huge fan of the fallout franchise with hundreds of hours in 3 4 and almost as much in new vegas i played 76 to completion of the wastelanders main quest level 50 and as much as i wanted to like it i just can t recommend it play 4 instead the good where 76 really nuka shines is providing more of the same that made 4 such a success a huge overworld map chock full of ugly beautiful post apocalyptic landscapes which you can freely explore without loading screens bizarre and formidable cryptozoological monstrosities legendary weapons for the finding base building with more parts than you could ever hope for and this time other people can actually see your constructions and since the wastelanders update quirky npc s who breathe life and story into this space giving you purpose and direction on top of all of that familiar bethesda retro futuristic sci fi rpg goodness the online aspect of 76 offers the ability to team up with other survivors to take on foes that would have been waaay to much to solo the way you level up your character special has been overhauled too instead of allocating skill points and perks every time you level up your skill points now equate to capacity for each skill and you pick from a pool of perks up to that capacity best of all you can change them at will this eases the concept of playing as a particular build and gives you a lot of flex in how you apply those traits the online aspect itself isn t inherently problematic either i love that i can spend hours building a cool base and i do but now other players can actually see the result and player owned vending machines actually make that a pretty common occurence all the junk you collect well mostly specific junk that you don t need can be sold to other players for caps the bad first of all holy currencies batman it s a page right out of the micro transaction mobile app playbook there s still caps for most things you ll need like in game vendors though now mundane actions like fast travel will cost you caps too but now there s also atoms which can be bought with real money for mostly but not only aesthetic items then there s gold bullion for late game equips and plans you can trade in another form of currency treasury notes for gold bullion but only up to a certain daily max this is why you play videogames right math then there s legendary scrips you get those for grinding up your unwanted legendary equips there s also ammopoints because why would you dare think you could just sell your unused ammo to an in game vendor when there could be another inane currency that only exists to push you toward ponying up your real money to avoid the inconvenience of not having enough of the ammo you actually need in a shooter game and that s not even all but i m already sick of listing them looking past the currency there s the glitches technical difficulties can and will happen and bethesda has a special track history in this regard but this is not that instead of humorous physics freakouts or one out of a hundred quests that just can t be finished you get frequent server disconnects you get unresponsive inputs when you finish crafting you have to log out and back in again almost every time you craft something you get half of the spoken dialogue not showing up in the subtitles this one s nitpicky for most but not for the hard of hearing the glitches in this one aren t fun or funny it s a big game in a big franchise and i m leaving out a lot both good and bad but everything i really liked about 76 was there in 4 and very little that i disliked about 76 was there in 4 i guess the biggest difference is just the finite nature of a single player game once you ve done everything in 4 you re done 76 kinda keeps growing but mostly in superficial ways meant to push you toward buying atoms subscription plans maybe skip it and hope fo5 is everything we hoped 76 would have been
