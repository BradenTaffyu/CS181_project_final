2020 i can t fairly recommend this even with how often i enjoy playing it as of the past couple of weeks there has been way too many glitches friends and i continually have our game crash usually from one of us shooting a gunit s been embarrassing because i just convinced my fiance and one of my friends to join my hunting group of now 6 people talking about how great and realistic it is and i keep having to explain it wasn t this bad a week ago i ll change my review when the game is improvededit most of the complaints have been dealt with since i last played but now the whole game itself is unplayable for me running is more like i m running underwater incredibly slow my bow is completely useless because it takes ten seconds to get my bow out another five seconds to aim another fifteen seconds to reload and another five seconds to aim while an entire herd is running by me reload is so slow i m still seeing the reloading animation happening for five seconds after the reloading sound is over stop making dlcs and fix your game
