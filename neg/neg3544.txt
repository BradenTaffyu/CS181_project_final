early access review first of all i absolutely adore ark i ve got close to 1 5k hours in evolved and i cannot help but hold onto hope for these games the game play is unique and super addictive the concept of having this gorgeous survival game where you can tame pretty much any creature you see amazing asa could easily be my favorite survival game could unfortunately though ascended feels like a massive slap to the face for any ark fan not only is this close to a triple a title price for whats essentially an non optimized graphics update asa is also hiding a lot of cash grabs yes you get all the map dlcs in the base game but most of the cool new features that are being advertised they are only available through the bob s tall tales dlc not only is that upsetting in itself especially for those who have bought evolved and all it s dlcs already there is also the matter of unofficial servers if you re someone like me who wants to play with friends and not worry about random players in your game you have the option of renting a server with evolved you actually got to choose who you rent from which left you with good and affordable options when it comes to ascended we only get nitrado because of some alleged exclusive contract nitrado is expensive and has some of the worst service i have seen with server hosts but hey at least snail games makes some cash off that as well huh of course this is not enough though ascended also introduced better mod support especially for console players sounds good at first until you realize that the majority of good mods the likes you may have used in evolved are now becoming premium mods that you have to purchase which would not bother me as much if the money actually went to the people who you know created the mods but wildcard snail games are taking a huge cut from sold mods yay we love not paying devs and artists a fair share in the year of 2024 anyways it feels more like you are buying an incomplete game and each compartment to make it a full game and a fun experience is sold separately this is ofc a very subjective opinion because people have different priorities and preferences in this game but for me this isn t worth it for people that enjoy playing on private maps with friends and or people who like playing with mods
