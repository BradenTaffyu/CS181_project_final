2021 early access review the game severely lacks any form of multiplayer improvements features or changes over warband it is a genuine downgrade to what we had previously which was plenty of mods custom servers more game modes far superior competitive combat and community delegation the servers being now completely and utterly dead compared to release reflects this fact the oceania community is a prime example of where every player went back to warband for anything multiplayer related the singleplayer though clearly mechanically and conceptually an improvement over warband many features are still missing incompleted or poorly implemented at this current stage there is nothing here that hasn t already been achieved in warband with modifications where s the criminal gameplay at i won t go into depth about many core issues that exist many reviewers have already done this but i will say that the combat forgets what made warband perfect and unique in fact most of the game in it s current state implies they forgot that warband was ever made and released the battles are visually impressive it s great to have massive engagements yet mechanically and fundamentally it still remains a downgrade warband focused on the player it allowed you to always be the star of the field bannerlord throws that away your hero is akin or sometimes worse off than many ai on the field and that never changes trying to charge into combat often results in you being immediately one hit by a ranged archer or swarmed and stunned locked to death is this realistic sure but is it fun no it s simply not the fun for me was being able to actually be the hero on the field saving my retinue single handedly by being decent at the combat mechanics i will never understand the decision to take away the skill ceiling and competitiveness behind the combat that existed in warband i have had this stance since release the potential is massive for this game but the future it once could ve had i believe has long been diminished by the poor decision making from the taleworlds higher up developers and managers the game honestly is just okay pretty meh alot of the time with some good moments sprinkled in fact is it could ve been and should ve been so much better
