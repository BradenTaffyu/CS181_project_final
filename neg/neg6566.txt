2016 dark souls iii is one of those few games that i love dearly but can t recommend to everyone because of a number of different issues that bring the experience down fans of the series can possibly interpret my review as an overall positive experience but new folks will need to consider the game more carefully hopefully some of my gripes have already been addressed by developers let s begin with the performance dark souls 3 continues the tradition of having areas that drop frames it was a mostly stable 60fps experience for me but dropping frames didn t do me any favors when i was carefully timing my movements the frame drops weren t restricted to one area either i had this problem over the entire course of the game some areas in the later portion of the game were really horrid what also made me really sour was whenever i lost connection to their servers i d be booted back to the title screen instead of just going into offline mode i ve seen this happen during a boss fight i also had a few crashes but they were rare enough to not be a serious problem finally i joined a significant number of other players worlds as a friendly phantom only to not be able to enter the boss s fog door for reference i am using a gtx 970 and an i7 4790k with 8 gbs of ram and windows 7 the combat in the game is very familiar if you ve played the previous games but the weapon variety and weapon skills help spice things up wielding a weapon with both hands lets you use its weapon skill which can be anything from a special parry firing three arrows rapidly summoning lightning having a new strong attack combo a quickstep or even giving yourself a temporary attack buff having more tools to handle a situation is a plus in my book and this game s implementation of it gives melee players an incentive to put the shield away weapon skills being available on every single weapon made combat feel much more entertaining especially when the boss weapons have some of the boss techniques on them i didn t engage much with spellcasting since i heard it required a lot of specialization pyromancy is still very accessible for characters powerful and looks great the magic buffs in general are also well worth the effort to acquire for melee characters however the combat has significant flaws poise doesn t do what you would expect poise didn t keep me from being staggered by attacks and no matter how much poise i stacked even the weakest hollows could stagger me without much effort because of how poise works in this game heavy armor doesn t feel like it s protecting you as much since stun locks can still happen i believe some spells and definitely some weapon skills can increase your poise to prevent stagger to allow uninterrupted attacks for example the black knight sword has a skill called perseverance which says raise sword to temporarily boost poise damage reduced while activated when this skill is used you can avoid any staggering effects and attack without restraint notice how it says it s raising poise yet any poise gained from any wearable equipment cannot avoid being staggered they should have renamed the stat because of how confusing and misleading it is to have two different kinds of poise with very different effects from what i read regular poise has to do with vulnerability frames not i frames with rolling i suppose that s what they want from players more rolling the second major problem with combat is how the walls interact with players and enemies you ll soon discover that as you try to attack through a solid object you ll recoil from the impact this recoil can occur when fighting near pillars or walls and makes sense when it happens you don t have kitty pryde s phasing abilities on the other hand enemy attacks will ignore walls and strike you for full damage i ve only seen enemy phantoms and two very large enemies recoil from trying to attack through walls or objects one of those large enemies threw a chain axe through about 14 feet of wall and managed to hit me there were far too many instances where enemies could attack through extremely thick walls or obstacles and still hurt you i wanted tough but fair not this nonsense i ve even seen some enemies shoot projectiles through walls i don t understand why enemies are allowed to ignore solid matter to such a degree i don t remember if the other games had this enemy behavior but it s really obvious in this installment at least the boss combat is pretty good the boss fights in dsiii are very well paced and are much more memorable than dsii there are less bosses which appears to have resulted in higher quality fights with unique and interesting movesets the overly humanoid setup of dsii didn t make a comeback for this title i enjoyed most of the fights and found myself pleasantly surprised at what the bosses brought to the table sometimes the fights can change in a way that i ll not spoil here i liked how they were designed both mechanically and visually speaking of visuals dark souls iii is the best looking one in the series it s a gorgeous game with gorgeous views the environments also tie together pretty well you can t exactly travel to all the places by foot but if you can see it you can probably go there i greatly enjoyed how you can constantly see places that you ve been to in the background which gives a good sense of progress and where you are in the world seeing what s up ahead and thinking oh man do i get to go there too is another thing that dsiii does very well here s an example of what i mean from very very early in the game youtube video i got dead again views 121 870 episode i had an accident season 3 episode nm 56b i d also like to point out that there s no impossible elevator la dark souls ii multiplayer is fairly pleasant but from software s approach to handling cheaters doesn t seem like the best approach mostly because of how the innocent are soft banned along with the guilty be sure to never ever accept an item from a stranger but unfortunately sometimes that may not even be enough in addition to that issue some of the covenants have difficulty finding hosts the game s matchmaking seems too restrictive which doesn t make sense since it s capable of scaling players down to the host s level if you go and reach a high level with a character be prepared to have a really difficult time reaching certain covenant ranks the password matchmaking is quite good and allows friends to easily play with other friends just make sure you both spell the password exactly the same i spent a large portion of my time engaging in jolly cooperation i also did deliberate pvp which was also a good deal of fun the multiplayer functions mostly and it s fun but it carries the risk of contracting a digital std no one wants to be soft banned unjustly yeesh whew here are some other things that affected my time with dsiii i ve seen my friendly phantoms die to an invader after i finished watching a boss intro cutscene the patch notes for this game are vague to the point of being almost useless the camera will sometimes work against you if you re too close to a wall and the game has plenty of nods to the previous titles that sometimes turn into full body spasms i really enjoyed dark souls 3 but hoo boy did i also grow frustrated with the game i uninstalled and reinstalled it several times before finally keeping it uninstalled i just grew tired of the problems it has but i do acknowledge that there s still a great game in there to be experienced it s just a darn shame that they went with the decisions they did that prevent the game from reaching its full potential i was almost done with ng too if you can look past its issues prepare to buy
