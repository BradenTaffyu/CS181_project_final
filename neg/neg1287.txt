2015 early access review i like caves of qud quite a lot and it deserves the positive ratings it has gotten however it is not quite ready for a consumer audience and is quirky enough that it would turn a lot of people off i m writing this negative review so that you can understand its shortcomings before buying it caves of qud is actively in development with all that entails by development i do not mean polish there are almost daily updates which sometimes break old savegames mob combat ai is still getting major improvements items are still being added large balance changes are made regularly the main quest is not finished some major locations the kind you can see from the world map are not finished and some of the few named unique npcs have no dialogue this is a true early access game not a beta if you are passionate about roguelikes and or science fiction to the extent that you d like to help develop the game by finding bugs through hilarious death you might want in on this beyond its incomplete status this game is a roguelike by genre convention it lacks a great many of the conveniences most gamers are accustomed to input is keyboard only the default keybinds for laptop are both horrible and incomprehensible permadeath is on by default and the disable permadeath option is somewhat cryptically hidden many enemies can and will destroy you even in starter zones and a fair fight is a myth you will not always get warnings when steering your character towards certain death you will have absurd runs of bad luck that are not your fault and you will die of them makes excellent use of its tile art system but it s not what most modern gamers will expect if you are not comfortable reading books at least a chapter at a time you will probably not be comfortable playing if you cannot occasionally relinquish control and adapt to chance circumstances you will find this game infuriating if you cannot sometimes let go of a good thing this game might break your heart when your character dies this game overall has a high barrier to entry if you overcome it though the world beyond is rich and lovely as a hundred other reviews will attest caves of qud is a lovely roguelike with beautiful tile art a piece of far future fiction that sci fi fans will immensely enjoy
