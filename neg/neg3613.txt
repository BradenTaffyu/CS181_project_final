2023 early access review i will elaborate further but to give a quick summary alpha 21 has changed how the game works to rely almost if not entirely on random chance and loot as well as grinding missions from the trader to buy required equipment for survival all while the developers have locked the responses to their updates on steam and from what i have seen have come across as rude and disrespectful brushing off concerns and complaints as vocal minority edit when i played a21 i had loot abundance set to 150 blood moon zombies lowered to 6 per person which is 2 less than normal bloodmoon block damage decreased by 50 when we were meant to get 1 book we got 2 instead even under these conditions we still had the experience detailed below do you expect the game will be easier with harder settings and if this can happen with easier settings it points to the game relying too much on random chance yes i can play a previous version but how long until the devs change their mind about that they changed their mind twice about the main stat system of the game why not what version people can play yes i can mod the game but why should i have to in order to play the game i paid for because i did not pay for a game where i am punished just for specializing and trying to use teamwork and after 10 years of development i should feel pretty confident in what im getting even if the game hides behind the early access title entire games that are more complex and made by fewer people have gone from concept to finished product since this game came out 1 the waterin previous iterations of the game one would find jars either empty or full of murky or clear water which need only be boiled to clean it for drinking where you would then get the jar back and eventually build up a stockpile of jars that one only needed to refill and boil this made water a complete non issue while the food and enemies were supposed to be the real issues how would you think the devs would fix this issue 1 make jars much harder to find 2 make jars take up more inventory space and be breakable 3 make the purifying process more difficult or time consuming 4 remove jars entirely and force players to get drip fed from a dew collector which takes half an hour to make one jar if you guessed 4 you win the golden turd why remove jars entirely they claim its because water should be an issue in the apocalypse you shouldnt have 500 jars of it as if its some matter of realism while ignoring the unrealistic idea that there would be no containers for water left or that survivors would just not use them or get rid of them also if we are using dew collectors then how are we collecting the water of yeah it puts it in a jar so i guess our character just spikes the very useful and valuable glass container on the ground after a good refreshing swig every time you still find random jars of water but they are all murky and need to be boiled once boiled and drank from you do not get the jar back it just vanishes for the first week of in game time my friend and i were both thirsting and starving to death and constantly debuffed because of it we were surrounded by pools lakes and rivers and i once decided to drink from one i immediately got sick and started loosing what remaining food and water i had 2 the skillspreviously there was a generic skill system in place where you would level up put your skill points into the categories that would improve your ability to do certain actions such as mining skinning or looting or unlock certain items for crafting such as a forge and workbench where most of your tools will be made they changed this to instead put your points into the skills and it will increase your chances of getting a book that will inch you closer to your goal of unlocking what you need for survival this has the effect of feeling as though you have little to no control over how your gameplay will go because your not in control of what skills you choose to improve and when you need to improve them in version a20 i could have the ability to make a forge on day one and only have to find the materials to do so this would make me less suitable for combat and make me decide on locations to scavenge in based on the chances of getting the supplies needed you know like in a zombie movie when they say things like we need medicine bad we might have to try the hospital in version a21 it took me until day 4 to unlock the ability to make a forge and day 6 to make a workbench leaving me with an hour of real time to prepare any real defenses im not talking blade traps i mean iron tools to dig stone and clay for cobblestone blocks which got shredded on the bloodmoon me and a friend were unable to survive the first bloodmoon entirely because of random chance i feel as though this makes surviving feel less about personal choices and skill sets and more about rng it wouldnt be so bad if certain things were unlocked by skills but the fact that almost everything is unlocked this way is absurd this also has the effect of reducing teamwork for example i usually handle the base building resource harvesting and ammo crafting while letting others handle the scavenging hunting but with this update the chances of finding skill books is determined by the person who opens the container of loot first meaning in order to get my skills leveled up and workbenches unlocked i am required to do the same thing as everyone else and aid in raiding homes and buildings which means even less time to prepare the defenses for the bloodmoon 3 the devs so far i have noticed the comments on all of the announcements have been disabled forcing most if not all of the discussion or complaints to be funneled to their forum i distrust this because its a place where the devs have control over if something is seen or not besides this i have seen the devs being rude or disrespectful towards some who are voicing their displeasure with the update and brushing off valid complaints as being a vocal minority which comes across as them thinking they can do no wrong and if you dont like it get out and if your going to bring up well people in the past then shut up i dont care what happened in the past i care about what they are doing right here and now and it dont sit right with me maybe im wrong maybe im not im saying what i see with my own eyes and what it makes me think 4 the truththere are community made mods that improve every aspect of this game from skills to zombies farms to vehicles they do it better and with better balance than the devs can imagine there is something special that could be here but it will only be built by the community because the devs keep messing around with rehauling huge chunks of the game that nobody has a real issue with instead of adding more to whats there the problem with this is if i have to change a bunch of server settings tweak game files install mods and additional content just to solve the issue the devs keep implementing then the game is bad which is a shame because it comes so close to being really great
