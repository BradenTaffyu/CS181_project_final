2022 i do not recommend this game if you re new to yu gi oh pvp is a nightmare filled with jerks that have unfun overoptimized decks early yu gi oh was fun where both players had an equal chance of winning nowadays you d be lucky if you ever get to do anything on your turn i ve been playing the card game in real life from the start and i ve stuck with it all the way i believe things started to really go down hill after pendulum monsters were added tl dr casual and new players beware casual dueling is dead here
