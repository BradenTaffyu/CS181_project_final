2023 i have played this game since april 2020 and love it i have put in 769 hours of game play since day one but read on to see why i am perplexed about this game warning you will spend a lot of money to play this game i thought each dlc would be worth it but it s not really look outside the box it s all a marketing gimic the base game is cheap yes 19 99usd includes california navada and arizona they charge an average of 11 99usd per state and more for bigger states like texas 17 99 since playing from april 2020 from west to east i ve purchased every other state up to texas and many other dlc s i have spent almost 150 00usd thus far and they re only less than 1 2 way through the united states i purchased wasahington 11 99 oregon 11 99 utah 11 99 new mexico 11 99 idaho 11 99 colorado 11 99 wyoming 11 99 montana 11 99 and texas 17 99 addon dlc s about 12 00usd and i have not purchased oklahoma charging 11 99 not doing it that just came out they still have the other half of the united states to build of about 36 more states if they charge 11 99 for 36 more states it will cost 432usd more plus taxes plus what ever more dlc s like paint jobs and add ons come out i have spent enough on this game they copy past too many things like your garages gas stations truckstops dealers stores companies and so on each state is the same other than different roads and sizes they even put a hiring cap that i did not know about i ingame purchased about 20 new trucks when texas came out i cannot put drivers in them because of that hiring cap i would love to be able to haul a load from the west coast all the way to the east coast some day but im not giving them any more money i have given more than i should have i fell for their marketing scheme too and take a look at their statistics on how many people play this game they make so much money and will continue to do so with 36 more states to go so with all this said until they make some major changes and start charging way less per state i am not giving anymore money for this game if things change for the better but they will not i will change this to a positive and recommend it
