2020 hands down some of the worst pathfinding in any rts must ve taken some real effort to make it this bad on the other hand the game hasn t crashed yet and the mp works too unlike indicated in some other reviews however as expected the community is a total online gameplay is dominated by smurfs and teamstacking expect your teammates to ragequit 10 minutes into the game thus leaving you to play a 1v3 against people who played nothing but aoe2 for the last 20 years all team lobbies are stacked no exception this means the enemy team is always sitting on discord together and has 3000 years of experience while your team is made up of people who speak no english and just bought aoe2 as their first rts five minutes ago i guess sp is alright since you get all the expansions even though the campaigns are fairly boring if you woke up this morning and decided your life isn t enough yet go ahead and buy it and play some mp otherwise go play something else
