2020 unfortunately the developer is just spamming out paid dlcs after dlcs rather than fully flesshing out the base game and making all aspects playable instead problematic areas are kept problematic over the years untill particular aspect is upgraded with paid dlc which in turn simply adds complexity extra chores but often not really solving the porblems just creating new stuff that ai is often unable to comprehend overcrowding of divisions over the course of game ais just spamming unlimited quantities of armies which simply bogs down the game and warfare over time airwar bombers teleport to the destination had really big hopes after nanomanagement of hoi3 that hoi4 will be les nano management and improved version of hoi3 but unfortunately nope
