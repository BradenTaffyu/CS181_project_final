2017 i did not ask for bloatware and absolutely nobody asked for micro transactions after getting the game when it came out plus the season pass this is what you do i ve been playing bethesda games for what half a decade you need to seriously consider how many customers and fans you ve been alienating with this crap what were you thinking now it s downloading unusable content to my ssd that doesn t have much room in the first place you need to stop you need to listen to customers not just numbers and we shouldn t have to bankrupt you or riot online to be taken seriously we re fans we shouldn t have to explode at the company we love for them to listen to us we shouldn t have to start boycotting you for you to take note in the mean time you complain that fans are overreacting and being harsh but anything else gets completely ignored no conversation possible so what do you want from us well of course and no crticism no matter how you screw up you should be ashamed of yourselves whoever came up with this is bad for your company they do not have your best interest in mind they do not give a crap about you and how you look to the people that put food in your mouths they ll get paid anyway they personally will not bleed reputation like you have been for the last year but no it s piracy and toxic online communities right no as a company it s your collective narcissism and your cynicism in dealing with your customers and fans but if it s your fault you may have to take responsibility and we can t have that right it s the customer the fan the community they didn t make these decisions they didn t code this crap they didn t push for this when it obviously wasn t wanted but it s them they re crazy for pointing out flaws they re nasty for not wanting to be scammed they re toxic for saying no with baaaad wooooords you should ignore them en masse because they didn t always say it the way you like such a toxic environment to work in it s so hard so stiffling to innovation and progress so demanding oh dear you i guess the world has changed haha you should plug your ears and distance yourselves even more it s the only way customers and fans need to be told what they want so we can spend less on producing these things impressionable moneybags trainable but so loud we need strategies to work around this we need to waste some more money on a consultant we need to make them want it we need more profit for less work but still keep our image there is a way there is a formula that works the whales are waiting the shareholders are salivating kaching or you could give the customer a good product and not insult them with your obvious easy money schemes make tons of money be hyped and adored as one of the few who get it if all we get from you is underwhelming products the second coming of microtransactions and insults how exactly did you expect to be treated throwing shade at the modding community that s been keeping your game popular and relevant and often fixing it while trying to exploit them at the same time you disgust me this is absolutely absurd uninstalling fallout 4 watching skyrim both versions like a hawk if this isn t fixed if you do not properly fix this i will never touch a future product of yours ever again
