2022 this game used to be really good and fun however as of patch 3 3 the game systems were completly broken to the point that there is no point to play the game you will start trying to develop your empire and suddenly realise that you are getting major penalties from having a large empire what is a large empire you ask according to paradox 3 planets is a large empire empire in a game where you can have up to 1000 systems each with a possibillity for 1 or more planets what is even worse is that there is no way to play with only a few plannets because you need to colonise several worlds just to be financially viable you can t even build tall because to build tall you need more more resources which you will have no way of getting other than colonising more places so you have massive penalties for building wide completely disregarding that being able to conquer everything should be a viable winning method you can t build tall because to build tall you need to build wide in order to support it no matter what you just get massive penalties and go nowhere last but not least this is nothing new it just got worse with 3 3 and i suspect 3 4 won t change but they marketed 3 3 as being significantly faster than 3 2 this is patently false the early game moves a lot faster but once you are 75 years in you are already as slow as being 200 years in on 3 2 and 200 in 3 3 the game slows down to a crawl making it impossible to play your timer won t go more than 1 day per second and it chegs for several seconds on the first or second day of each month sometimes the time completely stops for over a minute none of this ever happened with 3 2 in short 3 3 is an unbalanced mess that becomes impossible to play due to poor optimisation and if i am to believe what i ve been told this is because the game only uses a single core of your cpu which is unthinkable that in 2022 a game developer still refuses to introduce multi core support
