2022 i used to really enjoy this game the core loop of destroyers cruisers and battleships was very fun and each ship type had an important role to play unfortunately the game developers have repeatedly chosen to maximize short term profits over the health of the game this game is very much pay to win nowadays with all the best ships in their tier being the most expensive sometimes to an absurd degree worse when they made the changes to aircraft carriers and submarines they made some poor design choices that make the classes not very fun to play instead they are made to be as easy and low risk as possible i think this makes it so not many people want to play those classes but this looks pretty bad for the developers given the resources they put into developing those classes so to make those classes more fun they have significantly turned up the impact of those classes to the point that they seriously overturn the balance of the game where the base game revolved around information and risk reward the other classes especially aircraft carriers completely break that dynamic they carry essentially zero risk while completely ignoring the concept of positioning in the game i think matches without carriers can still be pretty fun but when carriers are involved it incentivizes a style of play that is extremely boring for pretty much everyone involved i could see myself coming back to the game if they significantly reworked the carrier class in a way that didn t upset the game loop between the original classes and brough higher risk higher reward gameplay to the class but as it stands this game is boring and pay to win
