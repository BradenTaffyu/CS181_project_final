2021 early access review a good thing to kill a couple of weeks worth of evenings feels very great in the beginning you get overwhelmed by the features and possibilities and some dozens of hours pass before you start to notice something is amiss the game in its current state does not succeed at being classic roguelike dungeoncrawler and does not have much to offer as a sandbox too non sophisticated combat system along with obviously overpowered exploitable items abilities fail to actually provide the challenge during the main quest there are not too many interesting places to visit besides the main quest locations so the sandbox part is mostly endlessly grinding autogenerated ruins for random and usually not really sweet autogenerated rewards the challenges that are not the direct combat are usually avoidable without too much additional preparations the challenges that are the direct combat are usually solved by levelling up gearing up which is usually autogenerated ruins grinding the last but not the least the game community moderators specifically is hyperparanoid it s the first community ever where i was forced unable to ask game questions no not those questions both on official game discord and on reddit
