2021 get out of my emergency roomdeveloped by two point studios and published by sega two point hospital is a hospital management simulation and strategy game released in 2018 build and design your dream hospital cure its quirky patients and even weirder illnesses in a simultaneous juggle for staff morale queue optimization and hospital reputation disclaimer two point hospital is the spiritual successor to theme hospital developed by now defunct bullfrog productions and published by electronic arts in 1995 category rating detailed breakdown design graphics good great reimagination same ridiculous diseases and their treatment great detail to cute funny animations solid graphic design lacking complexity many animations too long winded sound music average iconic speaker announcements acceptable sound design some sounds out of place soundtrack lacking urgency tempo very mediocre compared to the original gameplay controls poor fun for the first three hospitals gameplay loop way too slow too easy to cheese objectives gameplay elements run against common sense of the player tedious and laborious for no reason appeal innovation bad a nice trip down memory lane with caveats no challenge to the player gets frustrating with time many levels too similar no interesting changes to the old formula content value average 50h basegame game doesn t respect your time dlc which only add three more hospitals each additional content lacks innovation not worth the full pricepersonal score bad scoring range poor worst bad average good superb best personal thoughts i really wanted to like two point hospital the premise sounds so great a reimagination of the more than two decades old theme hospital a game i remember playing with delight this can only be good right wrong playing the first three levels felt so close to the original and i was positively impressed the soundtrack was a bit more downtempo compared to the original and for some odd reason the game felt way slower than i remembered suddenly things start to feel off and by the fourth level it started to annoy me i started to realize that this game doesn t respect your time i wanted to know why and i found the reason gameplay and new animations fight against the player in more ways than just by difficulty i started losing income even though i felt that i did everything right until one day i realized that giving patients benches vending machines and things to reduce their boredom with holds up the entire queue i started to struggle with queues all the time and even 5 6 gp offices couldn t reduce the buildup i had to initiate mass exodus from my hospitals every year because they would die like flies why because they hold up the queues i don t understand why add a mechanic into a game that bites you in the behind like this why give the patients options to annoy the player more than they should this runs against anything i ve experienced before and for the animations bloaty head in the original is cured within 10 seconds the recurvery treatment for cubism needs a whooping 50 seconds for one patient what the hell went wrong here remember emergencies good luck treating all patients in time because unlike in the original people can t walk through each other anymore this all culminates in a painfully slow gameplay loop that takes up too much of your time and is not worth the effort avoid this game unless you really want to feel that tiny bit of nostalgia
