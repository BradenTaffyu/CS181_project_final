2020 i ve played this game for over 150 hours both original and de i can say that the first 20 hours or so are very fun the first act is cool you can help people and you are so weak that everything seems t be useful any object can be use to help you then comes act 2 massive map that feels more like a checklist of fight and quest to do spirit vision has so many uses but it s an ability you have to cast and only last a few seconds yes mod helps most objects are starting to become useless and get less and less use now for act 3 which is super quick i did everything in an day no real quest or interaction just fights after fights and it s in act 3 that you hit a point where your character becomes so powerful that all challenge disappears even at the hardest difficulty also any item other than weapon healing potions scrolls and arrow are now useless for the rest of the game so you can sell everything act 4 is the worse fights are easy and quests you picked up back in act 2 have horrible conclusion not a single npc are relatable or interesting and puzzles instead of being fun and challenging are just very easy but long and tedious plus the good end the cannon ending at the end is the same results as if you has not played the game you get drained from your source and become a silent monk dallis and the magisters were the good guys or at least the less bad guys so basically all game you are just causing more people to die i wish i could recommend the game i wish i could but honestly after act 2 i just kept playing to be able to say i finished it because it s unfortunately not a good game there s some good ideas some amazing ones but the game just feels unfinished quests seems rushed late game feels rushed tons of bugs looking at you initiative order and just generally feels the game should had been either smaller or get more time to add more relevant stuff and less useless stuff
