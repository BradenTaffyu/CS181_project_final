2019 what can i say about stellaris well it s not the same game i bought not anymore when i first heard about stellaris i was excited i bought the game and i really enjoyed it and quickly stellaris became one of my favorite games the game was fun with all the customizable things like different ftl ways the variety of different alien species to create your own customizable race the events that happened while exploring the galaxy and how i loved the wormhole generating stations but this is all gone paradox made a point of destroying a great game to put things so stupid in the game just to say it s different and they ve removed so much good stuff from the game today that for me it s unplayable all the misery began when they removed the warprive and the wormhole stations forcing us to use hyperlanes and then came the new leguin patch and ruined the stellaris completely they removed the sector system that was perfect and put a horrible system trash that does not fit with the current planetary system they ve changed the planetary system to something much worse it s so stupid that it sounds like a joke it makes us wonder who has these absurd ideas to think this would please the players the artificial intelligence of the game has been destroyed not even the machine can deal with the new system extreme lag in late game hundreds of bugs still ancient that paradox does not think about fixing so soon do you want an advice do not buy stellaris paradox more than proved that did not care about the consumer or at least wanted to turn the game into something to please their old fanbase not to attract new players i bought all the dlcs in the pre sale i gave money to paradox without thinking twice and frankly i m sorry i feel like i ve thrown money away for a game that turned out to be something and turned into something i did not want if i knew it would be like this from the beginning i would never have bought stellaris
