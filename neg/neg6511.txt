2016 updated june 9 2017 to follow up to some of the remarks and update on review with last dlc and patch about half a year ago it seems like support for this game has come to the end with dark souls remastered out i can recommend playing that one instead of this since it got in my opinion much more solid mechanics in terms of design even though in terms of functioning they may be not ideal notorious lagstabs that are not as unfair as people would think there is long explanation but it s for remasterd review dark souls 3 is certainly still a decent single player co op experience but sadly in terms of gameplay it s an inferior game to past 2 and now remastered pvp experience is still better in other entries perhaps if one day from decides to remaster ds3 and add back some of the cut content as well as revert poise to how it used to work in past games when that happens it will be indeed a superb experience on par with past 2 games untill then it s a subpar just more dark souls kinda game as for build diversity weapons being worse or better is good for an rpg but some weapons being drastically better to the point of making whole weapon classes redundant obsoleteis not healthy balance as for meta builds sure you can play with almost any build through game but as soon as you hit pvp you will have certainly much worse experience than you could running objectively better build but even then you wouldn t really want to run a build with heavy armor since it doesn t provide you much but requires lots of investment from being generally and pretty universally useful in past titles poise which is found on heavier armor types transformed into highly situational and niche stat that demands to be played around instead of supplimenting the way you choose to play in past titles having more poise was a really appealing option and there was meaningful choise you could sacrifice some damage for poise and it would pay off since it s universally useful for about any kind of build maybe except full on glass cannons builds that are built around never ever getting hit in ds3 poise only works on particular moves during those moves and generally is restricted to massive heavy part of weapons spectrum to make use of it you would have to build your playstyle around forcing hyper armor trades with your opponent and any decently smart player simply won t trade with heavy armored ugs opponent because it s obvious who will come out on top should they attempt trading blows it s just really poor design this review was last updated on july 6 2016 this game could be one of the best dark souls games really it could but there are some things that are done way worse than they were even in the least loved by dks community dks2 i ve tried to do my best at condencing this review and updating it weapon movesets after dks2 you would expect to see cool diverse and unique weapon movesets wrong welcome to next gen dks game where all weapon classes have 2 movesets at best for all the weapons boss soul weapons nope same boring and sometimes even bad movesets same goes for weapon ar values most weapons can be just infused for quality and use that way that leads to another problem complete lack of build and weapon diversity one could argue that there are different builds yes there are mage builds for example could just as well cound fashion souls build too or cosplays majority of players pick quality build and for a good reason it is the most effective and universal one ofc there are caster builds or dex str builds but they are much more rare and compared to quality simply suboptimal weapon arts while some are okish some are just disgustingly bad scythe weapon art in particular about same windup as fully charged heavy attack but way less damage and requires fp landing headshot adds a little more damage but it still does way less than charged heavy having same windup and readability greatswords have same weapon art as straight swords mostly so ye same weapon art for 2 weapon types i would any day pick dks2 parry on greatsword l2 over the awful weapon art weapons balance a lot of weapons are just plain better than others same goes for some weapon classes ofc it is souls game so you can play with any weapon and win but why play with sword a over sword b if latter is only different from the other in stat scaling and has completely identical moveset poise there was a lot of drama about it but i will keep it short as of right now poise is extremely situational and one could say that wearing heavy armor is heavily punished in this game by making player sacrifice stat point into completely useless otherwise vitality that requires ridiculous investment compared to previous games fact that some npc enemyes have properly working poise only serves as more salt on injury poise in dks2 was working almost perfect after all the tuning done and now we have this a big step back from previous game in itemization in past games you could get all weapons or armor you could see in game with extremely few exceptions in dks3 there are quite a number of unobtainable armors and weapons you will never get some of them were just cut and are still present in game data absolutely same ng and on one of few things dks2 did right was ng it added not just dull more hp more damage difficulty but also new enemy placement and harder boss fight mechanics here it s just x rings that you can loot covenants feel really shallow and oversimplified there are 2 covenants that autoinvade to kill players and if you forget about phantom color and currency name they are essentially exactly same 2 blue covenants that are almost exactly the same except a gimmick difference which doesn t really make much difference oh and blue eye orbs gone so prepare to enjoy sitting for hours waiting to get summoned red and purple covenants are pretty much the same as well if they invade with minor difference of purples having a bit more options on how to complete invasion regional matchmaking absolutely useless on pc game has 2 regions japan and not japan so pretty much all this matchmaking does is filtering out japaneese players which is actually yet to be confirmed if you happen to have it on other than that australian players will get matched with european players or na players just as likely as players that are actually are in the same region patchnotes quality average patchnotes for dks3 look like this we did some tweaking to axes changed swords a bit and did some other stuff we do also some adjustments were made to rapiers go ahead and guess what we actually did overall i m really disappointed in how dks3 turned out to be sure it is great single player ish experience for 1 time but it betrays what dark souls was in so many ways by completely discoraging invasions because in majority of invasions you will be facing 2 or 3 or even 4 man ganks and should you die you will also leave your souls on the spot you got killed as invader there are no arenas no interesting tech in pvp really boring weapons and bland armor and rather weak underlying game mechanics my advice if you want dark souls pvp play dark souls 2 sotfs if you want to experience another chapter of dark souls sure this game sure does deliver at least on that but once you re done with it you re done with game it is so unlike previous games in longevity but it is what it is my rating for this game as dark souls fan is as another chapter of world story lore 8 10as a souls series game with multiplayer 2 10i would recommend waiting for from to finally decide what they want to do with game and fix at least some of these issues and buy it once it will come with all dlc and some goty version untill then dark souls 2 is better souls game
