2021 constant server issues no way of communication beyond emotes and in game comms if you re even comfortable with that constantly crashing kicking you from the game and several bugs that let s be honest will probably never actually be fixed unless you have a lot of time and patience look for a different game edit now that my one year subscription ran out i ve uninstalled it it still crashes and kicks you from the server on a regular basis they did make the sub much more worth getting about a month before mine ran out still too much hassle to keep playing it
