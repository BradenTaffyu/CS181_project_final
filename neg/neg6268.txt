2023 early access review starting out with the positive probably the best gameplay of competitive digital card games much stronger then hearthstone lor etc very good new player experience legitimately it feels like 60 of cards can be played as well there are far fewer useless cards then say lor or hearthstone however i cannot recommend this game for a few reasons 1 unsatisfying bordering on predatory monetization as you get later in your collection cards are separated into pools and getting into pool 3 feels like a significant slog compared to the first two pools f2p you are expected to get 1 2 new pool 3 cards in a week and if all you have received that week is d tier cards it can feel pretty bad when you lose to someone who has a stronger collection anecdotally it feels like i am constantly playing people with complete combos with my janky slapped together deck with holes in it paying small amounts of money does not really help either 5 10 dollars really only progresses you through a few caches this issue is magnified later once you complete pool 3 you are expected to get new cards at a rate of 1 2 a month to be fair i am still working through pool 3 so i am hearing this secondhand they have bundles to progress you faster but they cost between 50 100 dollars they are moving some cards down to lower pools but it remains to be seen how much this affects the experience edit as of 3 31 both of these have been somewhat addressed they are releasing smaller monetization bundles and moving cards down in pool additionally they have increased the amount of tokens that you get but at the cost of only being able to get a single pool 3 card from the shop per month kudos for attempting to fix these issues at least 2 technical issues with their programming there are multiple tales on the subreddit of people being double charged for items and then not being able to get refunds personally i had a card that would be considered one of the strongest meta cards pinned in their token shop for over a week but apparently these cards can become unpinned if you press esc anywhere in the pc client when i tried contacting support to see if they could repin the card in my shop i did not want compensation just to have the card added back they told me i was basically sol and would have to hope i opened that card or that it miraculously showed up again update as of 3 31 while the stability of the client is somewhat approved the support for this game remains ridiculously bad if you have any sort of issue you may as well pray to obscure chthonic deities as they are still more likely to provide you aid then marvel snap support
