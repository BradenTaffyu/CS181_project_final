2018 early access review dudes bought this game on desura around 2011 game showed promise and i decided to support the devs just as i did with several other games since then as the years passed i ve noticed a logical pattern all of the early access games i ve supported have continuously evolved as time passed regardless of the hardships they ve endured even those that are still in early access status to this day all except project zomboid aside from 1 major update around 2012 2013 the game has remained pretty much the same a few pointless updates that no one asked for as proven countless times they would rather integrate flying ponies than npc s kudos to their pr manager for fooling people into thinking that the game has progressed in any way thankfully the modding community is more than making up for it and have been keeping this game alive for the past 5 years unless you don t mind waiting for the 2030 1 0 release avoid this game like the plague 2019 edit something i found funny no man s sky a game which was essentially a very complex tech demo when it was released in 2016 had a 3 year development period development started 2 years after pz worked on by around 4 developers at a time and was extremely badly received in 2016 due to its lack of content by most users some may have appreciated the level of maths required to procedurally generate every in game object nms had 3 major updates since release fully making up for its shortcomings and is now a fully fledged game a far more complex game finished in 5 years 2013 2018 8 years into pz development and we re currently worse off than the original tech demo from 2011 which actually had a limited story line and npcs well done indie stone well done 2022 almost 2023 edit still ea need i say more steam should add an additional award to their xmas nye holiday nominations congrats on pretending you didn t abandon your game award 2030 1 0 release is optimistic af
