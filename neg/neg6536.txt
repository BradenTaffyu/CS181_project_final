2016 this game is a very fun game and i loved every second of it however from soft has ruined the game for me 1 softbaning according to the anti cheat software shoving its head up its ass i and many many other players have been softbanned for no reason co op does not really exist for me any more and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well i m basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error on top of all that i deleted my main character because i thought it would fix the error message so there goes 30 hours of my time from i hope you re happy 2 glitches this game is riddled with glitches some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds it was not a framerate issue it just happened for me my game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well sometimes i would try to roll but it would not happen i did the most logical thing and tried to roll again and i just ended up rolling twice it was not a framerate issue 3 online play i m not going to lie my internet connection is not the best but i get a decient ammount of bandwith that i have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode most of if not all the games that i invaded orwas summoned into had lagasaurous rex teir lag players would slide across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds enemies and bosses would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them it was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on from s servers the worst part was the invaders and the bosses invaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing when bosses became like this i could not be damaged i don t know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me i don t know however the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game conclusion don t buy this game until it has been fixxed otherwise you may be banned for no reason thus limiting the game become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position
