2021 in short aoe2 with a new skin and mechanics but less control features background i normally enjoy skirmisher mode and base my opinion on that aspect of the game a few issues automated features removed patrol attack defend neutral stance etc no auto explore no more cards load outs no treaty timer settings no treasure only 8 civs yawn graphics plus many smaller inconveniences that should not exist in a modern game ex create a game add a new civ team must change from england everytime i know it seems petty but all things considered this speaks to the level of detail and care put into making the game rant this is the first game in over 50 purchases that i asked for a refund it s not horrible but it follows the ea sports madden release playbook new skin ui remove standard features only to possibly add them in later disguised as dlc or a patch i genuinely feel the studio developers intend to leave it to the mod community to finish the game for them
