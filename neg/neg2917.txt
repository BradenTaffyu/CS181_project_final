2018 despite hundreds of hours in this game i cannot recommend it i have purchased the dlc and supported it but can no longer do so due to the massive changes made by paradox changes that should have to a conscientous and thoughtful developer merited a version two as opposed to butchering a game that people have already purchased and spent a great deal of time with paradox decided that it would heed the people who whined and complained about the methods some used to fight on public servers despite those tactics being tried and true and used in actual warfare they altered the ftl mechanism to create choke points the varied methods for different civs at startup was a welcome complexity in order to force a certain play style colonial influence as it were was gutted and a new system implemented that slowed and dramatically altered an already slow and ponderous game this comes on the heels of other changes that made it more difficult for managers like myself to expand and control the growth and development of our planets the choice for those of us who already had the game well there wasn t really a good one either comply and accept the mandate from paradox as forced by their draconian alterations or receive no new content and updates and roll back to the pre patch i use that term loosely it was more like a bloody complete alteration and lose out on anything in the future they very kindly provided the rollback information in what i took as a don t let the door hit your a on the way out this bait and switch tactic is inexcusable as the changes are so widespread and alter the game so much that paradox should have in good conscience started work on stellaris 2 with this architecture in mind it is difficult to have invested so much time and money in this game only to be told to sod off and i am stuck with a relic or abide by paradox s authoritarian efforts the united nations of earth does not accept these controlling overtones and is relegated to version 1 9 1 where there are more flexible and interesting play styles rather than the one size fits all mindset that paradox saw fit to impose needless to say this is the last paradox title i will purchase as i don t take kindly to having my resources being treated with such cavalier disregard
