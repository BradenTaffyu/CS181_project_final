2021 i love this game it s easily my favorite total war game i ve always loved the romance of the three kingdoms and the characters are beloved to me from things like dynasty warriors and red cliff but with a heavy heart this has to get a thumbs down from me the northern tribes aren t going to happen anymore the upper parts of the map are going to remain as they are and the problems with the late game are going to see no tweaking i m not one of those people that is mega angry about this but it s just not complete and we all know with the creation of its own studio that three kingdoms is going the way of warhammer so just sit back and be patient if you want to enjoy the three kingdoms setting and characters i m sure a three kingdoms 2 will be out in a year or two that will just make those who bought the first game pay 60 again for a complete game or something close to it so if you don t buy this now you won t have to also buy that later unless they lock some of the characters and factions and tie them to the purchase of three kingdoms 1 oh damn
