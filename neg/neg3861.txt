2023 early access review honestly i uninstalled as soon as i played alpha 21 this game used to be good but the devs ruined it by shoving these stupid ideas down our throats what the is up with removing the water jars hur dur water should be an issue in the apocalypse you shouldn t have so many jars of it this game is about a zombie apocalypse not a heat apocalypse if you want that realistic survival vibe to the game then this is going the opposite direction in a zombie apocalypse it wouldn t be hard to find plenty of dirty water sources like rivers and lakes that could easily be collected in a water jar and boiled by a camp fire the dew collector is a good add on don t get me wrong especially in desert environments but to completely remove the glass jar method because its unrealistic is stupid edit i guess i was a little to harsh with the review its still going to be negative but the water jar issue can be fixied by just simply installing a mod from nexus so its still playable for me thanks to mods
