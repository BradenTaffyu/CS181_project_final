2016 i m going to be honest here i bought this for tactical military simulation back when it was new it was great so many servers and people that were actually pretty fun to play with heck there were so many tactical milsim servers but as time moved on game got ravaged with life roleplay servers and then got invaded by zombie and the currenty stage well real life roleplay or zombie dayz clone mods hard to find tactical servers anymore the core game itself is dead only 2 7 servers exist if you wish to enjoy true arma experience other than that feel free to purchase this zombie raided title
