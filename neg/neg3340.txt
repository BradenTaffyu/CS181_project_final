2022 the game is good and i had fun with it but paradox is a piece of company selling basic gameplay features as dlcs the game as it is together with all the dlcs might just worth around a full price game not triple a instead paradox sells a bare bone base game with close to 0 features which is just enough so you might want to buy the extra functions for extremely heavy euros but by itself its far from enough to serve as a good video game experience my first sentence only applies to the game which i pirated in which i have all the intended functions of the game without having to spend 200 on something with a worth of around 30 i do not endorse pirating but i paid for the base game a lot already and i got barely anything for my money this is unacceptable pirate the game because its fun but do not pay for it as it is on steam because its just a flagship of corporate greed oh yeah the new subscription can suck my ding dong
