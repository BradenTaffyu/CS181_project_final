2022 divinity original sin 2divinity original sin 2 is a game that was made with love and passion but it isn t a masterpiece like everyone says it is due to some major shortcomings in the game design side of it the good the combat and rpg mechanics work extremely well it was a bug free experience the only technical problem with the game is the extremely long loading screen very well done voice acting beautiful colorful graphics the finest of all crpgs an awe inspiring soundtrack even though some music may get a bit monotonous on some maps due to uneven playtime around the maps visually diverse maps and different biomesthe badthe biggest sin of divinity original sin 2 in divinity original sin 2 you can create your adventure make history and select your path the game tells you to do whatever you desire and emphasizes freedom character creation dialogue roleplay etc at least that s what the advertisement says in reality this is a gigantic lie in fact you must play exactly as the developers intended you to play if you want to succeed you must follow the path designated by the developers at every step that means finishing as many quests as you can so your level is high enough for you to be able to win fights on your terms so the optional quests are in fact mandatory you don t like some quests too bad since you cannot grind because the mobs don t respawn but that s not the whole story about quests the maps are wide open giving you the illusion of freedom but when you discover a map for the first time you ll realize that most of it are gated by high level mobs that are going to kill you outright if you engage in combat against them thus restricting the exploration the game strangely emphasizes if you try to do quest b before quest a you will die because of how much a one or two level difference with your opponent means that s not to mention the fact that some quests are gated behind a perk stat item requirement due to these game design choices the game is a constant session of seeking xp around the map by using guides and other resources you can learn where to go in order if you don t want to waste time checking each enemy encounter level one by one this could have been prevented by leading the player little by little where to proceed or a better way to do this is to design the game for it to have level scaling considering the way armor works it is much more rewarding to set up all your characters to deal the same type of damage physical or magical in order to finish fights less frustratingly for example in my playthrough i chose a ranger physical damage a fighter physical damage a rogue physical damage and a wizard magic damage but because of this non sense armor system my wizard was so weak and i had to transform it into a supporting character because he couldn t do any damage to the enemies this way he couldn t do much either because now he had to get all the support abilities from different skills like geomancer hydrosophist summoning necromancer etc i got the skills but as xp is very limited throughout the game i was not able to upgrade them all to a decent level this armor can be defensively viable 50 50 depending upon the enemies attack style physical or magical very frustrating rng for sure a key feature of the game are the items placed in the world that the player can use during encounters since 90 of the fights start with you being ambushed you can t plan your attacks in advance you also need to save spam because you don t know when you will get ambushed another highly praised part of divinity original sin 2 is that there are so many abilities to use however because the game is so stingy with xp there is no way you can use most of them in one playthrough if you unlock all of them you won t be able to complete the game because you will be underpowered that way i don t think many people will replay this extremely long game again and again just to use more abilities in combat the imbalance of the skills is also a thing some are too powerful like most summoning skills and some are comparatively weak i have also considered the ap costs of the skills in this comparison i think most people can agree that the most important part of any rpg is the story and the way this story is presented to the player the story here is very clich predictable and boring to be honest our companions all have much of the same backstory and their purposes are very similar not to mention their personalities are very edgy and boring because our companions do not talk to each other mostly they do not form any bonds between them do not expect enjoyable companions like in persona or final fantasy games there are also no well written side characters or npcs in the huge world of divinity as with the plot presentation it is unnecessarily complex tiringly long and full of unnecessary dialogue to lengthen the playtime as a player i wish persuasion was not just a stat thing it would be great if the player had to convince npcs by what the sentence options say i love it when games just let you explore freely and reward you accordingly hollow knight is a great example of this but when it comes to dos2 as the game is overly cryptic sometimes you have to pause the game and look up what to do in order to advance through the quests you will probably miss a huge chunk of the content without searching the wikis why did this game have to be so cryptic eventually the player ends up spending hours on a puzzle or breaks immersion and looks it up on the guides either way it hurts the overall experience the game is almost 90 100 hours long this is for the main storyline but since the side missions are mandatory you could consider it for the whole game because every fight had to have some gimmick and this gimmick always showed itself at the end of the fight the player almost always had to reload the fight this is also very immersion breaking and annoying spoiler the final boss was a huge disappointment it was neither a well designed boss nor did it have that final boss feeling it was as if 10 guys had gathered and they were in a battle royale they fought themselves and later the survivors of their battle attacked me kraken s extreme power is also ridiculous why did this game have to have so many barrels and crates as i checked all those crates and found nothing in most of them i think the developers also intended to lengthen the game s play time with this i expect at least some reactivity in this game for example if you slaughter half a village people will still sell you stuff and treat you as if nothing had happened quest items should have been marked if you accidentally sell a quest item you will be screwed divinity original sin 2 isn t a terrible game for sure i can say that at some points i enjoyed it but as i played more and more i noticed many shortcomings that ruined the experience bronze medalthank you for reading follow my curator page
