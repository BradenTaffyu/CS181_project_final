2023 the game is simply not finished hopefully all of the issues will eventually be fixed but in it s current state playing beyond act 3 will simply be a terrible experience for you the writing in act 1 and 2 is very good and faithful the 40k universe the gameplay can be complicated at times but that s to be expected for a crpg i overall had a great experience playing the first half of the game however after act 3 everything goes downhill in terms of quality i had to use mods to trigger fix every companion questline in act 4 except for one act 4 barely adds any new side content having done everything available before progressing to act 3 act 4 felt very empty and rushed gameplay wise there seems to be something clearly broken with the balancing the arch militant archetype simply scales way too fast in combat paired with two support oriented officers and i could clear every single combat encounter starting in act 3 before the ennemy had the chance to play a turn in hard difficulty at that point i was simply in it for the writing and just wanted to get it over with honestly but even the writing felt way less interesting in act 4 and 5 i would suggest people wait a few months until the game is at least partly fixed before buying or that you go into it as if it were an early access title
