2020 wargaming is a piece of crap company nothing more nothing less greedy scumbags the game is essentially unsupported riddled with bugs the balancing team consists of about 2 ppl all they are interested in is pumping money out of you let s just hope tencent will buy them and fire everyone these people should be blacklisted from working ever again in gaming related companies special mentions to the community people of wg those are the most innocent receiving constant toxicity from us because they are the medium between player base and company but ofc wargaming str8 up ignores them tl dr are you interested in paying 60eu for a ship i m talking about an average decent ship for the endgame nothing extravagant that thing costs 60eu the free part of it is not free you could literally nolife day and night wouldn t make a difference to give you a comparison of frustration i didn t rage in league of legends almost ever it was what it was i can t remember a session in world of warships that i haven t lost my mind one way or another it s just too toxic for the soul game is hilariously broken and unbalanced client is buggy and unresponsive to say the least and servers crashing and burning in eu at least are quite common i would really love to continue playing this game concept is awesome and it caters to older gamers but under the current publisher wargaming it s just unplayable if you catch yourself having fun in the game it automatically means some1 else is getting cancer because of you that s the level of company we are talking about and as every other gaming company they have turned towards milking the whales and stripping any aspect of skill from the game you might as well get yourself a 1 euro dice and start rolling it same thing with wows your actions don t matter you can do your damnest but rng giveth and rng taketh away in their latest christmas event you were getting a ship for free and you had to pay at least 80 euros to buy some boosters grind for about 10 days at least 8h a day if you are a good player to get the ship about 10 20 ppl worldwide managed to truly farm it for free by playing 2 weeks non stop we are talking about 16h per day playing and streaming or something along those lines just avoid it unless the publisher changes it is amazing that a copycat company hasn t popped in and cloned the game a 10 member dev team can make a game several times better than wows in a month or 2 tops this is not a hyperbole the game is a piece of crap in every single aspect it s a low bar to clear i don t know what else to say to convince you of how bad it is i ve played a fair chunk those 200h i have are only on steam i m probably way past 500 by now but today is the day of uninstallation edit matchmaking is a huge joke but they don t have the balls of introducing a skillbased matchmaker because it will reveal the monstrosities in all their glory 5 ships would be used by the good players that s it all the rest are just underperforming pieces of trash every lobby would consist of the same 5 ships but no they really like their matchmaker as it is so animals that pay can perform well in their broken ships and superman players being able to perform even in rust buckets satisfying their ego and mastery of the game how the matchmaker works imagine a player that has played about 10h of the game and paid to buy a high tier ship being in the same team as you with 10 000 battles or the enemy team having 2 3 cr33d members and you having braindead people with 28 winrate in carriers want more you think those horrifying stories are just stories extreme examples thats the average match composition in a weekend
