2016 i am truly conflicted i have put a tonne of time into this game i can see the team did a great job of making an awesome well balanced game i have been playing total war since rome but there buisness practices are downright disgusting greed wouldnt be a word its a shame this game is awesome it really is but all the tacked on dlc i cant recomend it i genuinly wouldve bought 3 of my friends copies of this game devs clearly not looking at the witcher boys on how to make dlc and how to treat your long abiding customers as well there greed is now legendary and there name now associated with money grubbing but its a great game as a long time fan of the series i have to say i dont recommend it the flc dlc attitude is disgusting and makes this shiny gem look tacky and fake
