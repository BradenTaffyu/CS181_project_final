2016 this game s combat feels like a massive step up in terms of fluidity and overall action and it looks actually pretty decent for a bethesda game however i feel like i can t recommend this game to fans of previous fallouts or the rpg genre in general bethesda severely ripped out a ton of role playing elements including inputting severely dumbed down and sometimes unclear dialogue options a voiced protagonist no coherent skill tree or system and the overlying quest of trying to find your dumbass son you don t know or care about infinite quests consist of a person telling you hey you really aren t making a difference in the quality of the wasteland but i m going to keep telling you you are now go clear out this place for the 5th time thanks honestly there s too much wrong with the game for me to list here i m sure you ll see what i m talking about if you decide to buy it
