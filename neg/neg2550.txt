2017 this one hurts i was really looking forward to it but it lets you down hard it has the potential to be a really good game but unfortunately it s way too far from finished for every reason to play there is at least for the moment two not to i don t even know where to start but here goes the bugs this game is so broken disappearing animals disappearing tracks the photo missions are a bloody mess the patch didn t work sometimes your scope sights work at other times it just looks like you re looking through a tube on top of your rifle over and above that i ve experienced three complete system crashes just not good enough the walking oh my good gods the walking if you re looking for a game that s more of a hiking simulator than anything else you ve come to the right place everything is so bloody far away and while you can fast travel between base camps you still have to discover them walking 4km to a mission is not fun even if you can shoot a few things along the way this is especially fun when you ve walked more than 3km and your game crashes giving me an achievement that i ve run an ultra marathon doesn t help either this isn t called the marathon runner progression making me work my ass off for something that s worsefirst of all skill points and perks their effects are nominal you don t actually feel like you ve progressed at all the ability to judge an animal s weight doesn t work because the developers never really got around to sorting out the whole kg pound conversion thing just yet then of course you have to choose whether you want to range your sights or judge the windage of your shot the windage often differs significantly from the general wind direction because you know deer farts and stuff secondly the progression of firearms this i worked my way up to the 338 they don t say whether it s a 338 lapua or winchester regardless both of these cartridges are renowned for their accuracy not in this game though 0 accuracy 0 nought you work your way up to the best and most expensive rifle in the game and it can t shoot straight lack of contenttwo maps each with their own animals but it gets old quickly the missions are all the same the amount of weapons are ridiculously small and the balancing i presume between damage and accuracy just means that one is slightly less crappy than the other having said all of this it does have a few good points the hunting is fun and it ll keep you entertained for a few hours the game is beautiful the terrain is awesome and the animal models are pretty good it seems that the developers are pretty keen to improve it but i m extremely disappointed that it was released in this state this game is not finished and letting people buy it so that they can help you pick out the bugs is total bs even though it is an often too common thing these days again this has the potential to be a really great game but for the moment i d steer clear
