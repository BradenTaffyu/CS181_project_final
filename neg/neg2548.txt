2021 it is a great game no question there but do i recommend it no why let s make it an easy task go to the forum bug reports technical issues and take a look at all these countless complaints about fps drops and sound issues since the latest update 30gb and then notice that there is not a single post statement by ew regarding that matter but hey buy the new dlc that screwed it all up
