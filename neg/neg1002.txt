2019 i get it bathesda gets alot of praise they can put together compelling content the problem is that content is contained in a bug ridden trash can all of thier games are the same when you have to wait upwards of 3 minutes for a game to load then the moment you touch a key it ctd s there is a problem i could write you guys a huge article about the issues i ve dealt with playing bathesda games over the years but you guys know you ve played them i am very torn about this game it can be incredibly fun great combat moments or amazing set pieces that tell stories there is also annoying crap like trying to leave a building and waiting 5 minutes the story in this particular game is just gabage there are a few good charatcers mind you but the majority are annoying the voice acting is both great and terrible depending on who your talking to the crafting is well not really crafting mediocre at best building bases can be fun but build height and population limits remove the possibility of really expanding your settlements i hate all the factions minutemen are too needy ralroad is just stupid bos are institue are just lost in thier own little world you as a player do not end up giving two for any of them there are no real consequences no real kharma just do what you want conclusion do not buy since we lack anything better by all means play it you can have a decent time but buy it cheap we cannot keep rewarding these companies for churning out half baked products it s time to start actually paying attention to your customers and not your investors if i worked at bethesda i would be ashamed of this product
