2017 early access review first of all i want to say that i have loved every minute that i have been able to play this game like games such as rimworld developers have placed the majority of their focus on creating in depth simulation through realistic items crafting vision sound etc this means that graphically pz is not on the standard of many mainstream games if you re looking for an in depth true to life simulation though this game gets pretty dang close one of the best features to this game is that the developers are consistent in communicating and pushing out updates in the time that i ve owned pz the game has changed and grown so much but hasn t lost the core pieces that made it what it was in the early days so why can t i recommend this game in truth it has to do with the fact that i cannot currently play the game due to bugs in the design starting in 2014 a build was released that made the game so that on my system there were no menu options at startup yes there are some google search fixes for this but none have worked so far in the next build they game back and i enjoyed pz again until a patch dropped and i lost menu buttons again since that time the chances of me being able to actually play has been a toss up as to what version is currently running every build and every patch is a maybe that i can actually continue playing the game i paid for or wait to see if they fix it in a later build unfortunately because of this i cannot recommend that someone buy this game until it is consistently available to play if that happens i will gladly keep playing and might even buy copies for my friends to enjoy on multiplayer but if you re thinking of buying this game my advice is to wait until the bugs and issues have been ironed out and it is functional as intended i mean really indie stone just the ability to alt tab out of the game and shut it down in this case would be nice as it is every time i test out whether it s been fixed i m forced to manually shut down my computer and restart quality of life here lol
