2018 the truth is this game is fun the campeign is massive and the different races keep everything fresh and different also there is online co op and versus campeign which is great with a friend the online multiplayer is well balanced and there is a decent enough variety of maps and builds with each faction to keep it interesting the issue is ca s disgusting pricing for this game making individual factions 13 99 needing to own the original to be able to play the previous factions lord packs which add new units to existing factions for 5 99 is just a bloody joke overall the gameplay is great and if you have a spair 100 and love the total war formula and the warhammer universe then its a must buy if like most humans you dont wait for sales to get this or only purchase the factions you know you want to play but even then its over priced
