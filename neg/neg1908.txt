2021 having played the game more recently i decided to update the review with a small follow up original review is available below basically what i mentioned below is indeed true often times you ll be frustrated enough to remotely consider getting a premium vehicle which you should not admitteldy i myself spent money on premium vehicles but i did it because the vehicles i chose were fun funny ones though i still am ashamed of spending this much time and money on this game the mechanics even though can be fun most of the time contain bs and you can clearly notice them not long after you start playing and often times you re gonna be asking yourself what or sometimes laughing at the violence but that s it there is some fun to be had but it s 98 frustration i can safely say that i indeed hate this game and i am never installing it for at least a solid 2 3 years again don t waste your time on this edit 20 5 2023 yeah glad i quit thisoriginal having not touched this game for 2 years i remember exactly why that isas others may have descibed it it may seem appealing at first but in reality it s a rage inducing experience that may lead you to spend real money to get stuffat only 160 hours total playtime i started seeing this frustration and instead of giving in into the whole premium stuff i just decided it was complete garbage and stopped playingto describe what is likely going to happen as you play you will quickly unlock new stuff but as you move further down the tree said stuff is going to get increasingly harder to get and harder to playthe times you ll have good times are extremely rare and most of the games will be awful due to some bush that is no joke or someone who saw you first and you didn t see them or they were hiding in a bush i cannot speak about the plane or ships department as i am more interested in tanks than planes and ships but i ve heard it s also quite frustrating there tooessentially the game wants to put you into a trap that will lead into an endless loop of pay to win through buying a premium account or a premium vehicle which won t change anything to begin withthe only good things i see about this game are the realistic models and the penetration mechanics of the tank guns even the smallest ones however the game is clearly rigged to make it into a grindfest of pain and rage so it s best to just avoid it and any other gaijin game reallydon t waste your time on this game and quit it now before it s late
