2016 early access review i ve owned this game for close to three years now i ve kept up with mondoid updates with baited breath i m always disappointed things that could easily be added post release and are in no way shape or form a priority for the fans are the only thing they seem to work on meanwhile something that has been begged for and promised since the very beginning is still nowhere in sight i still love the base game but at this point i d recommend staying clear until the devs actually decide to do some real work on it rather than adding calories to potatoe chips
