2015 this is an excellent game it has the potential to expand your knowledge of or even develop an interest in the subject of history it is a series unparalleled in the genre of grand strategy and in the earlier versions of the game i would have recommended it to anyonehowever i can only in good conscience recommend this game to people who have enough money to buy all of the dlc or at the very least has a good friend who they can play multiplayer with who buys all the dlc the game is not able to stand on its own merits without this the way the dlc model in this game works is that they expand content change systems and do other rehauls of systems and charge money for it that makes sense they rehaul a system so they ought to get paid right well sure unless they take content away from the player that they originally to repackage it and sell it off to consumers as was the case in most of the new features in common sense it s a disgrace i ve had bugs occur in previous patches which were caused by not owning the dlcs and even if you do not own the dlc the ai i e every single other nation in the game does which means the ai develops an unfair advantage over you in many cases also in the case of one of their dlcs an ebook they were literally selling thomas paine s common sense which by the way is in the public domain and hence free for anyone to download online it s hard not to characterise paradox as money hungry with actions such as these and unfortunately as i mentioned earlier this series is unparralleled i want so much to love this game and i often do but it leaves a really poor taste in my mouth when they do such things as these and they have no incentive to stop doing the things they are doing because suckers like myself still buy the damned dlc and they have no competition in this field
