2018 honestly i can t reccomend this sure it looks nice and plays pretty good but it s just lacking it s a bit empty soulless there s just no life in it the roleplating is limited the exploration is uninteresting and the shooting while decent doesnt stand up to other shooters but that s never why one plays a fallout game one plays to expore a world full of quirks and personality with interesting visuals and a unique sense of humor and i just can t find any of that personality here the story is bland the characters are flat and lifeless more so than usual in fallout and the one interseting visual motief they have can be missed entirely depending on which boring story path the player pursues i found no real reason to play fallout 4 no matter where i looked especially while new vegas is also os steam
