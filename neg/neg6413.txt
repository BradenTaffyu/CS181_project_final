2021 sup gang i am playing since the 4th of november and yes i barely got 16 5 hours but i will let you know why and why i am struggling to keep up the motivation with this game the majority of us probably play these games with a friend or two and with the convoy system that fh5 provides it makes it really neat to enter races in a co op form with said friends however if you wanna do a head to head race your convoy partners turn invisible and even if it is not a head to head race they will also sometimes turn invisible after approx 1 hour of gameplay your gpu will stop focusing the fh5 exe and you will drive around with heavy stutters at the point where i pulled up both steam and the ingame fps counter and well the gpu is barely being put load on and i literally have only 30 40 fps at that point all my convoy partners have this exact issue aswell after every full hour of gametime bypass for this is to just restart the game thanks 100 version nearly on every single online pvp race the game will either crash freeze or completely bug out to the point where all cars turn invisible me and my convoy partners all freeze at the same spot when doing these sort of races especially when the scoreboard pops up after every race and yeah the really only content we could do is this goliath race which is a looong ass run but hey atleast we only crashed there once if you want to do campaign with your convoy you can forget that because the convoy leader will get the progress and the rest not you will realize that you have to do everything all over again to gain the progress exp and cr is given tho but not the campaign progress i paid 100 and i am beyond disappointed it was not worth it and i look forward to the devs fixing the huge amount of bugs issues that they listed themself in their release notes and known issues section the list contains more words than what i had on my exam essay in 10th grade so good luck to the devs fixing all that all these issues are mostly happening when being in a convoy we do not seem to experience this playing alone but is this game really fun alone think about it base game worth for those who play this singleplayer with current issues deluxe edition nah premium edition well bought it myself but nah
