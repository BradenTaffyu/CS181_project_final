2016 disclaimer if you intend on playing this game offline i recommend it completely apart from the performance issues and occasional crashes now onto the meat of this review do you enjoy invading and having a fair chance against 3 people do you enjoy partaking in balanced skill based pvp combat do you enjoy being able to invade gankers and solo hosts an equal amount buy dark souls ii scholar of the first sin you ll find none of the above in dark souls iii it s sad to say but it s true the game prioritizes hosts with phantoms when you invade but not just hosts with phantoms mind you the more phantoms they have the more likely they are to get invaded i have done well over 300 invasions across a few different characters both in early and late game areas i have invaded a grand total of two people that didn t have phantoms with them now this wouldn t be so much of a problem if fromsoft didn t up so many other parts of the online you see to be invaded you need to use an ember this gives you roughly 30 extra health meaning anyone invading you will be at a disadvantage in max health too however phantoms also only get half the health restoring items that the host does both white gold phantoms and reds purples so not only do red phantoms have to deal with hosts with 30 more health but they have to deal with hosts with double their estus and white gold phantoms with equal numbers of estus uses to themself absolutely ridiculous but that s not even the worst of it the game uses a basic two hit system like dark souls ii players have no poise meaning a dagger will stagger a person in full smough s just as effectively as it would stagger someone wearing nothing combine this two hit system with the fact that there s no working poise for players and you get gankers stunlocking invaders to death with no chance to roll out of it i believe that dark souls ii got the pvp absolutely perfect you invaded solo hosts as much as you invaded gankers the host could heal when you invaded them but you and white gold phantoms couldn t apart from miracles that took ages to cast the advantage that gankers had over invaders was numbers and even that was a massive advantage if the co op players weren t braindead idiots to conclude this i guess i ll sum up my thoughts on the game dark souls iii is a fantastic game and entry into the franchise with deep lore and fun challenging combat however the online has been hindered severely due to fromsoft casualizing it you re free to say that they balanced it even though gankers and co op players already had an advantage in dark souls ii however you d be completely and totally wrong fromsoft wants to get more people into the game and they care more about the 3 friends who buy the game to ezmode the game in co op together than they care about the souls veteran who buys the game for fair and enjoyable pvp they make more money that way i hate to say it but this game s community has grown far more immature and childish with this release if fromsoft realizes how badly they ve screwed over invaders and balances invasions i will change this review to positive and don t even get me started on the estoc and dark sword edit after one year the estoc and dark sword have been nerfed into being worthless the pvp still sucks edit2 after two years there s some nice dlc added pvp is still garbage
