i was a day 1 player of this game enjoyed it for nearly 8 years solid and then the last 5 off and on but the devs had consistently made bad decisions when it came to the endgame catering to the mega guilds which made conquest a grind for smaller guilds the stories for the 8 classes are good feeling more like a single player rpg than an mmo however ea bioware has had mistake after mistake and now that it s been handed off to broadsword games a mmo life support company i have had enough of it myself i cannot in good faith recommend this game in current year to anyone unless you re a star wars fan and you want to grind for over 200 hours to get through all the class stories from 1 50 and past that you only need to do it on one character because there is no difference between the classes this game was one of my all time favorites but after 13 years i have finally called it quits there are other great games to spend your time and money on
