2023 look at the consistency of the other negative reviews one of the best card games ruined by an awful company ill put it this way if i legally had the option to lock away wotc leadership in a cell and let them rot i would without an ounce of guilt zero exaggeration the only glimmers of satisfaction are the feelings of self assurance when you put together a well thought out deck this game punishes you for doing well the shuffler is rigged beyond a reasonable doubt at this point and that doesnt make the game challenging its outright dirty this company is along the same lines of filthy as gaijin and the trash fire of a game that is war thunder the way this game is designed should be criminal and honestly id pay to watch the devs rot in cells
