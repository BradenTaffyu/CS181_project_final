2023 the title of the game says it all owlcat is very good at being a rogue trader they release games that you fall in love with but when you get about 40hrs in you start to release they you have been suckered their first game pathfinder was epic until you got to the 3rd chapter after that you realize that you are now a beta tester the same thing happened with pathfinder 2 i thought it was just tough luck but this game again demonstrates their incompetence im getting close to 100hrs and im struggling to finish the story they excel at story telling however just like the pathfinder games everything went to crap after the 3rd chapter for our convenience they have a little icon of a bug on the corner of the screen so we can be their beta testers basically if you buy this game right now you are paying them to be a beta tester just like their other games i m sure this game will be great in a year i really want to love this game i spent about 30hrs reading all the lore that s in the game i m invested and i m still struggling to get to the end i just wish i did not have to hack the game to get there i love the warhammer 40k setting and i don t think there is any game out there that can make you feel like you are a part of it as this one does it saddens me to have to give this a bad review emperor save me
