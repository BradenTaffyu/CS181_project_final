2016 typically i m a massive fan of total war games in general and warhammer as well as that the game itself is quite fun however what you get the base game is the choice of 4 races essentially with ca now charging 14 for the latest dlc installment of beastmen if you weren t lucky enough to preorder the game you re already paying an additional 25 for chaos and beastmen two of the core races of the games setting god knows how much it will cost for any additional races to be added later let alone additional campaigns maps would definitely avoid or wait a few years until you can get it for pennies from somewhere else
