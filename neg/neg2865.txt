2018 okay so a lot of time has passed a lot of things cnahged and a lot of dlcs came out rendering the previous reviws not very helpful if you re wondering it was very anti 2 0 because and this is a hill i will die on hyperlanes as opposed to three different travel modes feel restrictive but in spite of all changes and in spite of me coming back to this game periodically to play it and racking up gameplay hours i am not changing the thumbs down why well 1 dlc bloat is a problem no don t give me this but there are free updates and just play multiplayer with host who has everything you know what i talking about it s uncomfortable to buy piecemeal dlcs for more mechanics and some existing mechanics work differently depending on whether you own a dlc or not because of all this stellaris which used to be a new player friendly game is not so anymore 2 ai is hopeless thankfully starnet startech mods exist and custodian team is making improvements to it but it s just not there and probably won t ever be there at this point the gameplay designed with mulptiplayer in mind or at least focus on player experience as opposed to designing the ruleset that ai can follow fairly well since ai makes bizarre choices a lot of times made worse by dlcs and mods but netcode does not really support that mp focus 3 performance game probably needs to update the system requirements because mid to late game slowdowns is very common knowledge at this point and a serious reason to consider playstyles that erases most of entire species from the galaxy i wish i was joking and it s even worse on older pcs 4 relationship between mods and dlcs a lot of dlcs are eerily similar to mods in their ideas which are implemented differently but there are also some mods that have impeccable quality and amount of content which sadly are not updated as often as players would like due to constant stream of patches and dlcs latter pages of steam workshop are an actual graveyard also i am firmly convinced that unlike with other pdx games modding community is the primary reason stellatis is sill alive and kicking and is probably the biggest reason to play 5 ground combat this is probably the one element that really needed changing from 1 0 but was untouched all this time aside from removing army attachment system which well thank god for that but army designer similar to ship one would be very welcome space combat has a lot of mechanical and visual spectacle to it even if you don t control the fleets but ground combat doesn t have basically any redeeming quality you send the guys to the planet watch the circles go red and disappear maybe position ships above for orbital bombing and click retreat if it doesn t go well that s it no tactics no weather no terrain no planet map with regions no supply management no battle events not even damn combat triangle of troop types mods did try to tackle this but i don t think any design decision got much popularity and because of this it feels like pdx doesn t want to bother either because it s harder than poach good ideas from the community i guess
