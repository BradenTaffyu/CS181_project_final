2020 early access review i loved warband and i built up a fair few hours on it from warband s campaign to its massive multiplayer to the fields of napoleonic war i had an absolute blast bannerlord does not live up to it heavily in part due to poor optimisation constant crashes and simply a lack of features it s early access yes and so it is an early access after eight years that is less akin to a beta or a slightly early release but rather more akin to an alpha many features simply are not in the game at present such as kingdoms 200 player battles on mp from warband 100 dubious design decisions like a smithing minigame that feels like a mobile game it adds no real skill or depth to the game but is more like a boring button masher that you have to break up every 15 seconds with a 10 second break as you let a day pass to burn some more wood for charcoal so after a week you can finally make a sword that you could ve simply purchased perhaps with a massive investment of both time and sanity you can finally reach a level where you can forge a mighty blade for yourself and call it the long schlong stabbing bong but unfortunately your sanity will suffer for it a better question might be why can t i commission this from a blacksmith rather than be a blacksmith well that s all well and good we can ignore that mechanic right sure let s go back to the classic early game renown gear and money earner tournaments always two on at all times always so close to each other you ll be in back to back tournaments fighting for gold and glory you ll probably win of course except there s another problem remember how in warband armour was standardised and weapons randomised from an item pool now it s just weapons you bring your own armour in this means in the early game you might draw the short straw and have to plink away at a sergeant for 2 damage a strike and hope to high heaven the ai goofs and drops its shield enough times to let you win once you get through the teething stage and buy a ton of armour though you ll be safe and sound to continue farming tournaments of course you don t get xp anymore at least not in the same way so you won t really ever level up from doing this let s take the bandit life and raid a village stupid peasants lol oh it s 25 archers and 25 militia with shields and spears couple that with shields being much harder to break than warband and bows having what feels like borderline pinpoint accuracy now and you ll last for about 10 seconds even with your shield up before your legs fill with arrows and you drop well it could ve gone worse you re now riding away from the small army in the village you choose to sneak in to the nearby hostile town provoked by you raiding the nearby village understandable as you go to sneak in you distinctly notice that you have 30 chance of sneaking in you fail oh no that s alright you can just fight your way ou you can t you can t fight your way out instant surrender straight into your cell you filthy pleb okay let s play it honourable and escort a caravan that went into a town then didn t come out which then got attacked whilst not even spawned and i failed the quest okay bannerlord at present feels like it only has one desire that desire is to screw you in every way it can and where it doesn t screw you it tries to bore you when it doesn t try and do either it crashes on you
