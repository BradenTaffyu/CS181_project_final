2019 tw whii at it its core is fun beautiful and fun to play i would love everything about this game if it werent a complete cash grab this game on its own feels incomplete and unless you want to spend 200 you ll never get everything you want out of it there is only one campaign mode a mode that i really hate and only a few factions unlocked everything else is hidden behind a dlc or worse a completely separate game and then more dlc it doesn t make any sense i feel like i got my 60 bucks out of this game maybe with 90 hours but i would really love to play more but i refuse to give creative assembly more money for content that s already in the game i refuse to give them money for a key to simply unlock the door to more content especially simple and old content my 02
