2023 may be edited if these changes come soon online only caused game to be unplayable at launch online only forces solo players like me to matchmake for empty servers taking up even more space away from people who actually play randoms or with friends performance issues typical and bad modern boxy ui think of it like modern garbage ii ui and ux no crime net no safehouse lack of quality of life features which i am going to list stat bars instead of stat numbers no marking lobbies as loud stealth any no tracking challenges said challenges are not categorized into sections making the challenges tab cluttered and also messy with no real category filter challenges are also not organized by order i e car 4 challenges before castigo challenges or challenge type before another challenge type you can t unready clear balance issues such as standard lining armor lightest armor being completely redundant to heavy ballistic lining heaviest armor due to x4 less armor with negligible speed difference the sa a144 whatever it s called i dont remember and the scar can also one shot headshot many enemies this can be improved even further with skills but of course the balance issue is that full auto rifles like the car 4 or the northwest something cannot one shot headshot shotguns have that capability too albeit they reload too slow and also shoot too slow the mosconi is also a double barrel so much smaller mag capacity as well skill lines require unlocking the higher tier skills not to mention some of these skills are garbage too i would ve been fine if it was just research the main skill and then it unlocks all of what s in that skill line but those executive bastards need that player retention to go up or they bail on starbreeze the medic skill line is useless and so are medic bags this game leans more into armor than your health dallas is now suffering from chronic depression because of this that s all for now
