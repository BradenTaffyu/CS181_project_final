2023 in its current state i cannot recommend payday 3 for the following reasons1 they removed concealment rating and melee weapons all together2 the skill tree isn t nearly as complex and some perks feel kinda useless3 no chat in lobby4 unable to stay with a group you might click with after a heist you are forced to main menu5 mandatory online was a huge mistake with mediocre when working servers even playing solo takes forever to load6 only 8 missions to start and a relatively small amount of guns and customization i love the series and i m sure some of these will be resolved in the future but for right now just wait for a steam sale if you wanna check it out
