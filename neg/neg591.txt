to steal a quote from henry miller divinity original sin 2 is like a wh re from a distance she seems ravishing you can t wait until you have her in your arms and five minutes later you feel empty disgusted with yourself you feel tricked at the start it seems like the game ought to be a huge improvement over its predecessor there are more options for character creation there is a greater focus on your party members the combat promises a wide variety of approaches to encounters limited only by your imagination but after a while you ll start to realize that the freedom the game offers is an illusion perhaps the biggest bone of contention is the armour system instead of reducing damage or making your enemies harder to hit it instead acts an additional set of hitpoints divided into magic armour and physical armour this armour must be depleted before you can start doing damage to an enemy or start applying status effects against your enemy and since the armour is divided into two categories the game strongly encourages the player to go with all physical or all magical parties on my first play through i foolishly went with one spellcasting character in my party which meant that were basically doing bugger all to the enemy while the rest of the team were the ones doing damage surfaces make a return from the first game and while they aren t a bad idea in practice they become so obstrusive as the game goes on that at times it feels you re spending more time putting out fires than fighting the enemy and this game even introduces cursed surfaces that are even harder to get rid of the game s encounter design is awful packed to the gunwales with gotcha encounters that start out with the player suddenly being thrown into combat where the enemy will invariably go first regardless of how many points you put into wits and then proceed to insta gib one of your party members so you reload and try a different strategy many of which are completely absurd for example in one encounter my party faced off against a witch who opened combat by instantly nuking my party the solution have one character engage her in dialogue and have another teleport her over to another powerful npc who can deal with her handily when you break an encounter like this you ll probably feel clever the first time you do it like you ve outsmarted the developers but then you realize that those developers deliberately designed the game like this and suddenly it feels cheap and then there s the writing oh dear i m convinced that whoever wrote divinity original sin 2 was either a sociopath or someone whose entire socialization occured on an unmoderated internet forum the first original sin was quite silly and at times it felt like it was trying to summon the spirit of terry pratchett the humour didn t always work and the jokes didn t always land but i found it to be a welcome change from the obscenely po faced and self serious pillars of eternity but with original sin 2 the writer seems to have caught the disease that a lot of writers succumb to which is the feeling that they aren t being taken seriously so they decided to fill the story with the same tired grimdark cliches that have been plaguing fantasy settings for over a decade now fantasy racism religious fanaticism oppressed mages at the same time however they also retained some of the absurd humour of the first original sin resulting a game that s just tonally confused one moment you ll be treated to the horrific sight of people being magically lobotomized and the next you re speaking with a talking squirrel reading on an undead cat just what the hell am i supposed to feel when presented when presented with this sort of thing well one thing s for certain which is that the writing in original sin 2 makes me feel bored irritated and bewildered nearly every npc is some variation of vile loathsome irritating contemptible or monstrous every faction is corrupt and debased talking to people more often than not results in a barrage of insults condescension and mockery for no other than reason than you dared to engage them in conversation i could count maybe two or three individuals who weren t irredeemable knobheads and those that weren t usually had nothing to offer except some sob story did you think that talking to animals might provide some much needed levity well you d be wrong because they re all sob stories too and your party members well with the possible exception of the dwarf and the bard they re also a bunch jerks and edgelords by the end of game i wanted to side with the bad guys just so i could finally destroy this miserable hateful world i know i m harping on the game s joyless tone a lot and that s because it s so inescapable you can t play original sin 2 without it burrowing into your brain like some kind of malignant tumour really i fail to see the appeal in playing a game that feels like being confronted by a bully in a high school locker room or working at a customer service job in a world populated exclusively by the worst sort of karens it s a tabletop game run by a dm with nothing but utter hatred and scorn for the players what s fun about that nothing that s what
