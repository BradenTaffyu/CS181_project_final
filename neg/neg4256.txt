2017 early access review the game is basically a micro managing colony builder that is quite fun for a while learning what you need to keep a colony alive and how you go about making it takes a few playthroughs to figure out which is a lot of fun and sustains a drive to keep trying and building up a new colony my problem was after solving my problems for oxygen and food with minimal stress and sustainable energy i lost motivation to keep going sure you are always on the search for water and sand to make the water usable which are both finite recources in the world but since these things are not in immediate necessity when you already have a large supply i just don t feel like i need to do it it s a good game but it needs more problems to deal with for me to keep playing i also think i may have a biased opinion on the game since i got it very early on when it was less than 25 dollars i don t remember what the price before was but i think 25 bucks is too expenisve for its current state tldr wait for more updates before buying
