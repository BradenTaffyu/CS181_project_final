2021 the thumbs down stays but i would like to give an update on the player file wondersgta gaming actually did all the runs as provien by video record howver the completion times are still too much of a challenge so i ve uploaded my own now feel free to beat these values or just keep them i ve deleted the 100 player file as i don t like the completion times since a trainer was used it s impossible to beat them and they either don t look legit as of having completed every jurassic challenge in around 1 hour therefore i thought i rather play through it myself but honestly that s more of a chore even worse than the first one than fun if there ever will be a jwe 3 i am really not sure if i would buy it playing a game just for the sake of completion but not for the fun isn t really the thing and even though i really dislike park simulators i gave the first one a thumbs up as i had a lot of fun with it this one could have easily been just a dlc for the first one while not totally a copy paste of the original the new aspects could have been added as a dlc for jwe 1 i ll definitely not gonna buy the next one the chores got a bit weirder and they added even more timing stuff to increase the playtime in the first one if you planted a fence it was there now you need to wait until one fence piece is constructed so you merely lay down blueprints and have to play the waiting game similar as in the first one there were either waiting games to be played but i had far more fun with that system than with many of the new science unit aspects in this game it just feels like stretching playtime artificially last but not least the sandbox still requires you to play through the game luckily there is already one dedicated player that provides a 100 player file youtube video original 100 complete save file for jwe2 marine species pack install guide and download link views 178 765 now updated to also cover the all dlc up to thefeathered species dlc click show more on description to get to the jurassic world evolution 2 100 save file link for xbox game pass i personally gave up with 4 5 stars on the first chaos mode level as i wasn t able to reach 5 stars within 5 hrs of playtime i ve finished the campaign well the tutorial myself which was a piece of cake but i somewhat struggle too much with the changes compared to the system of the first one so i didn t even bother continuing especially as i can now enjoy sandbox with everything unlocked thanks to that save dsimilar as the first one it only invites to play for the unlocks to have a free sandbox but as i started to dislike all these chores since the first one and especially as here they feel worse i just paid for a sandbox game with the prize of a full aaa title which is partially good as i don t like park simulators anyways and in the sandbox you can turn off many of the annoyances furtonately still the options feel a bit barebones compared to the first one again technically it either has flaws while being perfectly able to play the regular campaign in 4k with max details starting the first chaos theory mode made the game unstable with crashes every 10 to 15 minutes reducing the resolution and turning off all overlays helped dlss did not help with this issue and furthermore is very poorly implemented as of awful ghosting issue overall waste of money
