2017 this game is only good if you never played any of the previous civs or such games before then you won t notice that this is a badly made attempt to follow the previous games but has less content than like civ3 at launch which is laughable not to mention stuff like the devs added stuff like save game settings in a patch almost a year after the core game was launched shows clearly that this game is made by people who don t really play it at all and are sadly out of touch with what the game needs or if it is nice to play i was a loyal fan been so since the dawn of civilization series and it really saddens me to see that while civ 6 would have been a decent game with just graphics update from previous games the developers failed even that and made it a lot worse game my advice go buy civ 4 or alpha centauri if you want to play a good game in this genre do not give money over a product that is costly and still un finished after countless months and patches
