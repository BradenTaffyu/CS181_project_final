2019 dont buy it even during a sale single player is unplayable for more than 10 hours beacouse the ai has the iq of a wonkey table and if you want to play multyplayer your freinds wont play with you beacouse you dont have all the dlc the dlc btw costs more than the base game and when you put all of the dlc together plus the base game its just a wee bit over 100 pound id suggest you just buy a different game since you can buy about 5 good games that you could sink all your time in for the price of this one edit they updated the game so now its semi unplayable in multi player the world generation is so bad that you have to restart the game several times too get a world all your civ s can actually play on
