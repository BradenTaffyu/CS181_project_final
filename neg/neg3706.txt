so much potential squandered this game has the rare distinction of being very good during its early days and gradually being stripped of all of its best parts until it became one of the most empty dull and barren survival games in the market i can only imagine the fun pimps recent dev meetings the decisions to streamline the game and make it dull and generic so it would reach wider audiences the endless amateurish and pointless backs and forths bouts of indecision and walkbacks regarding mechanics and balance and the talks about how to artificially extend progression without creating barely any new content whatsoever completely ignoring player concerns or responding with derision rudeness and sarcasm deciding the best ways to deceive the community regarding their many broken promises laughing about how they believe the playerbase is stupid and easy to fool and worse of all when the marketing and finances guys sat with the devs telling them to use all dirty consumer practices in the corporate playbook to squeeze a few more pennies in the short term the upcoming bloodmoon rebranding alpha 22 to 1 0 only to justify a colossal price hike the utter disrespect towards console gamers that are being forced to buy the game twice and now at a much higher price paid ouftit dlcs i d give this game a stellar 9 10 in alpha 16 now it barely reaches 3 10 such a waste
