2016 i m bound to get a metric tonne of dislikes for this but i ll live with it please note that i m only giving it a negative review because of my history with the arma franchise starting with armed assault moving through arma 2 and all its expansions and playing using ace mod on each and the fact that i had certain expectations when i inevitably pre ordered this game now please note i have no issue with the setting near future is fine provided it is done correctly and in that regard i believe arma 3 really shines i have yet to play a game set in the near future that is as believable as arma 3 because the majority of the weapons and vehicles already exist and a lot of them are outdated my issue with arma 3 is the fact that there is a shocking lack of content with the base game there is a massive step downwards in terms of realistic fidelity and the performance of the game is abysmal even with someone with a computer that is massively overpowered for the game now the argument could be made that no where else could i turn for a game that seamlessly integrates combined land sea and air warfare on a massive scale and i would believe that argument if arma ii and it s expansions didn t exist that s the problem this has all been done before and to a much better standard why do soldiers only flinch when shot and continue to fight back as if nothing happened in arma 2 if i shot the leg arm of an ai his movement would be impaired or his aim would be impaired in arma 3 nothing is simulated whatsoever instead enemies take multiple hits to be downed even with extended armour turned off i don t understand why bohemia decided to create 3 factions that are more or less mirror images of one another the reused assets between mounted mg s grenade launchers missile launchers alike is puzzling and frankly lazy i don t understand why they removed core features such as dragging carrying wounded allies to be healed properly by a dedicated medic as opposed to the magical heal all faks we have in game and i don t understand why they re still using the same tired engine as they used 20 years ago for a game that is on a much greater scale in both terrain amount of buildings and graphical fidelity don t get me wrong arma iii is a stroke of technical genius managing to take the virtual reality engine and make it look this good is mind blowing but what s the point in looking good if the game runs like even when installed on an ssd there is still the stutter loading when playing online and i ve found that in cities etc the framerates are completely unplayable when playing with a reasonable player count of 30 so here are what i consider to be the pros and the cons pros beautiful looking game interesting concepts behind a near future setting movement is easily better than the previous games stance system whilst part of movement is good enough to be mentioned on it s own bipods when they work are really damn cool ai is much smarter than previous installments reacting better to cover and suppression sound design is much better although guns still sound a bit off something i rectify quite quickly with sound mods inventory system is really nice and intuitive steam workshop support makes mods easier to use however due to the file size limit only really supports basic mods which i couldn t care less for campaign is a bit more cohesive this time around previous campaigns felt a bit aimless pre recorded voice linescons there are a lot of them the game caters to more casual players will explain with the following points 1 ammo pool showing how many shots are left in your gun regardless of difficulty setting is stupid2 ai can tank several rounds and fire back with perfect accuracy with nothing more than a flinch gone are the days of crippling someone s arm to reduce their accuracy or taking out their legs to stop them from moving3 vehicle crosshairs almost never line up with their hud counterparts and cannot be turned off4 weapons have poor penetration value i ve seen the argument being made that in the future armoured vests will allow you to survive longer which i can appreciate but that does not stop the fact that the kinetic force of a bullet would still wound you to the point where you are ineffective i don t mind the soldiers surviving but at least incapacitate them for sake 5 magical faks that heal you to the point where a dedicated medic is a luxury not a requirement 6 more of a server issue than the game itself everyone is running casual epoch altis life etc servers these far outnumber the traditional game servers which i think speaks for itself really it s a game targetting people who aren t here for an authentic military shooter it s here for people that want to use third person sprint everywhere and not take things seriously each faction is practically identical there is no assymetrical balance like the previous games everyone has one assault rifle one type of grenade one type of mbt one type of transport helicopter one type of attack helicopter one jet each wtf and the exact same grenade launchers missile launchers uav s ugv s and submarines the recycled content is lazy the dlc s thus far have offered very little content for their price for example baf in arma 2 added an entire new faction to play with vehicles and weapons respectively whilst i can t comment on the expansion pack operation arrowhead was practically a new game and from the pr that bohemia have released tanoa seems about the most compelling part of apex which will probably run like because the amount of trees etc i don t like altis personal preference game runs like absolute on several rigs i ve tried including a 5960x 24gb of ram 2x titan x s in sli all running from an ssd to remove any loading stutter it s just not possible to get this game running nicely hardly any weapons vehicles per faction i touched on this briefly but it was months until csat and nato got jets and they re both ground attackers only why why is there only one large transport vehicle shared between each faction why does each faction have the exact same uav s the same ugv s submarines grenades chemlights smoke grenades ghillie suits armour etc etc etc what the why does it take multiple bullets to drop a guy at 1m unless i m using 7 62 12 7 or intermediate cartidges armour seems to sponge bullets for absolutely no reason why can i not drag wounded allies or carry them this game drives me insane because i wanted to like it so desperately each iteration in a series should build upon it s predecessor and in many regards arma iii improved in many ways but took so many steps back that i can t recommend this game to anyone now ace 3 definitely makes this game a lot easier to stomach but the base game is still unfortunately there it s unfortunately the only way i could say you should play this game if you re used to arma ii i m sure i ll get a lot of arguments from people saying that mods will fix x y and z but the fact is arma ii didn t need fixing so why should arma iii
