2016 unfortunately as much as i like this game and will continue to play it i have to warn people that as of right now the game is broken in many fashion altought it may not appear to more casual eyes the ai in the game is uterly flawed picking any nation in the world and steamrolling anyone is very easy the ai is totally and i really mean totally clueless about what to do i will change this for sure if they fix this zombie ai and i really hope they do some examples if you are playing germany dont expect the ai to attack mainland europe it just cant make any sort of worthwhile naval invasion the ai of every nations feel compelled to send almost all their army in expeditionary forces across the world to fight useless war its very common to have millions of soldiers whole armies fighting for nothing in the sahara or in the himalayas and of course all the while they lack supplies and thousand die just because the ai dont care about supply while the army of everyone is sailing uselessly accross the world for nothing they never escort their transport ship again the ai loose soldier and equipment for nothing the italian have a bad habit of sending almost his whole army to north germany embark in aparently teleporting or more realistically folded boats sail through the english channel while the english kill them in drove of course then go all around africa to reach the utmost important and strategic country of ethiopia every game the ai is totally unable to use the army experience template systems this only weakens him even more as it cant field any kind of good units template also wasting precious experience points in dozens of template it wil never recruit the ai is unable to decide what to attack defend or ignore you can see germany conquering the russian and fighting well beyond moscow all while the britsh and the usa will conquer europe without any resistance or the italian fighting desperatly for every inch of the precious sahara desert while italy is being invaded they wont send any army to defend themselves its so funny in one of my games the ussr invaded romania early before i as germany invaded france then instanly after romania joined the allies the war was of course won by russia and romania became communist but it didnt ended there the war now was beetween the allies and the commintern so the war migrated to the only border beetween the two north india it was so ridiculous every allies nation sended whole army to fight litterally in the himalayas well almost xd and of course with no supply every one lost tons of soldier and before it even began the war was already won by the axis me this suicide for what romania wich didnt even existed anymore at this point so you see its kind of broken to me what is even more frustrating is that all these glaring and big problems passed the testing phase its shameful almost rome 2 shameful
