2021 the pay to win aspect is a big problem the most expensive rounds are roughly 2000 of the basic currency while the others barely break 100 it wouldn t be as much as an issue if 5 or so of those rounds cost more than you would get after a match regardless of if you win or lose this gives player that pay money for easy access to these rounds have a massive advantage over free to play players another issue is that long time or high tier player will usually have a stock pile of credits and will often go to lower tiers to pub stomp newer players it really makes the early game grind miserable
