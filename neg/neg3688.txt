2023 early access review with complete direction shifts in game mechanics every few alpha releases it s clear that the developers have no real strategy so the way the game fundamentally works today might not be how it fundamentally works tomorrow which is infuriating when they get something right and it makes the game fun quite often that gets trashed in favor of mechanics that are frustrating and make no sense the only real saving grace is that at least as of the time of this review if you don t like how the game currently works you can still play all the previous alphas if that function ever goes away i m basically done with 7 days i don t recommend this game because it s a crap shoot if they ll completely trash everything that works in favor of some stupid new system they dreamed up that will just drive more players away instead of fixing long standing issues or addressing gameplay functions players have literally been pointing out for a decade
