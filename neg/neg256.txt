2023 as of 9 30 2023 i do not recommend buying the game if available and if you want to play use game pass i will be using payday 2 as a comparison to this game and will be used has a the standard for this series most things said are my opinion if i don t write about anything in the game in this review then it isn t good or bad just neutral or okay the pros graphics are much better and the art style is nice overall gameplay including silent and loud are either improved in areas or are just as good stealth mistakes are slightly more forgiving such as if being detected while in casing mode he will simply be escorted to a public area which i don t mind casing mode in payday 2 was pretty much useless in this is was made more part of stealth the soundtrack is just as good as payday 2 even though i believe its made by a different artist if i am not wrong story is more focused on and is more clear even though a lot of people don t care with this type of game for story there is a small selection of 8 heist but they are all good i was never not having a good time playing any of them that being stealth or loud so i suppose quality over quantity for now c stacks are like a more premium currency that is bought with money in game so 1 c stack would cost 50k for example i like this system and is a nice change from the offshore money and cash in pd2 enemy voice lines are awesome in this the cops sound like they hate you the cons this list is much larger the leveling up and gaining exp system is garbage the only way to gain exp towards your infamy levels is completing tedious challenges that are very specific such challenges are beat no rest for the wicked 150 times on normal or higher difficulty before the assault has started every heist has these type of challenges that vary from 50 time to 25 times etc these are ridiculous challenges considering this is the only way to level up as well weapon leveling has been added and along with the exp for gaining levels on your infamy these require tedious challenges to level up your weapons too and take forever little content there are a selection of 17 weapons 6 weapon charms and 13 weapon stickers as well as 25 mask and 14 mask patterns i would also insert that mask customization is the exact same no improvements were made which is disappointing as seeing something like a call of duty emblem editor or weapon skin creator for masks would have been cool there are 5 outfits in the game besides the base i m not counting slight color variations on the same outfits as different ones same goes for gloves there are 5 weapon stats and customization is a copy and paste from cod there is not even any twist to it to show originality its just that i even believe some weapon attachments which you earn from leveling the gun up have the exact same affects as ones in cod and in vendors there is no clear slots to buy weapons from like assault rifles shotguns etc like from pd2 its just labelled as weapons the overkill weapons like a kill streak in cod if you kill a enough enemy s you get to call in a super weapon there are 2 a grenade launcher and a 50 cal although personally i don t mind this being in the game as it can offer more for going loud it just feels out of place in a payday game maybe its just me amour has been changed instead of a constant thing you have that just recharges after taking damage in pd3 it can run out when it does you need to pick up plates from a deployable like a medic bag i don t like this change as it is just another idea from how cods amour system works and amour no longer shows up on your character i am assuming due to more focus on customization s of your outfits there are no stats for amour just a paragraph explaining what it is and how heavy it is this confused me for a while skills i have seen a lot of complaints about how the skill tree is and how skills work although i agree that pd2 did them better this is not so bad its just odd at least half of the skills are based around 3 buffs you can get edge which increases damage by 10 grit which increases dr by 10 and rush which increases your movement speed although some skills don t rely on these it feels it can restrict some future skills pd2 skills just felt more useful and made the game more fun tasers names were changed to zappers enough said final charge mechanic in pd2 enemy ai worked in waves a wave would come for however long and then you get a little break in this that happens too but an system it seems is always running in the background to keep track to where you are at in a heist i have noticed usually when you start bagging loot is near where it starts when it does endless waves up cops come until you are either dead or escape i have found this system to be extremely annoying and unforgiving this also limits any heist to be added such as the continuous making meth one from pd2 this feature in in every heist on loud this was on pd2 but only on a handful of heist that were designed around it no improvements to enemy ai more some downgrades i have not felt or seen any improvements to how the friendly and enemy ai work from pd2 to pd3 besides some animations what really bothers me is that if you re playing solo the ai wont revive each other anymore so if an ai goes down you have to revive them enemy s feel especially beefy some feel almost like the division type bullet sponges not fun or satisfying this is for sure noticeable when most shotgun close range head shots wont be a one hit the game is very unfriendly to solo players this being with the only online system so no matter if you re alone you play on a server that can crash or have connection problems which could be a problem in stealth no friendly ai customization no safe house can t name loadouts as of now this is all i can think of and this took a while to write so i recommend not to buy this significant downgrade from payday 2
