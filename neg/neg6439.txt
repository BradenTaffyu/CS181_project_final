2023 re reviewed there is a lot to dislike about this game so here i go sharing what i ve grown into the game dislike greatly being forced into subpar cars to race in story events the ai can be stupidly aggressive but considering its ai that learned from forza s playerbase its unsurprising that they are so stupid at times ramming you into a corner because they failed to brake in time perhaps swerving into you as you pass them happens quite often despite how hard i try to avoid colliding the ai seemed intent on it thus making some races incredibly annoying forcing you to try and get out of the deathball that the ai create as soon as possible or you ll be rammed to death civilian cars spawn in front of you to impede your driving in both the street racing and freeroam options literally see them materialize on my lane to force me to change then see them disappear behind me like this was some kind of arcade racer seriously the game s own mechanics sometimes fail bad rewinds lagging manual switching sometimes even automatically going up a gear when i don t want it causing me to double shift and disrupt my shifting rhythm and making some tricks very difficult without restarting the game characters and dialogue are still cringey twitter esque and does not get better while the history is delightful to learn you will have a more satisfying time learning mexican history through other means than a driving game the fact that so many of the game s available cars are hidden behind the wheel spin means a lot of unnecessary feeling grinding to get the cars you want either that or spend an agonizing time on the horrible auction system that fails to add your bid 90 of the time the amount of microtransactions on the side also make me sick for the price this game demands need i remind people that baulder s gate 3 exists these companies don t have an excuse for this crap anymore so lets hope if horizon 6 comes out they fix their stuff or i can see horizon going the way of the dodo forza horizon 5 thank you to the friend who allowed me to enjoy what there is to which is very little compared to older games like need for speed underground 2 which had superior tuning to this modern title gt4 which had a superior feel and huge selection of cars or perhaps the older forza games that sent forza to fame if you want car customization go find mindight club 3 la if you want tuner car culture and a really solid tuning feature for your cars need for speed underground 2if you want a solid sim racer with plenty to give gran turismo 4 the only thing forza does is the free roam the games i ve mentioned give you more for what they are making horizon 5 look cheap and poorly made in comparison seriously the moment a racing title offers even a remote indication of these features im dumping forza forever to replace it because forza s devs and microsoft don t know nor care about making a good game
