2016 saw the twist in the main quest a mile away completely lost interest after the reveal rpg elements are watered down there are no non violent solutions to any problems you face and every quest seems to be go here kill things polished experience design of the world itself is great though quest design is genuinely overly hand holdy suffers from skyrim syndrome where you are the most important person in the world yet nothing you do has any meaningful consequences overall a bland and uninteresting experience edit i replayed this game and found the issue after you get to the institute the game just feels like its done it completely loses its steam as you are forced to chose a major faction to do kill quests for once you get deeper the other 3 factions start to hate you so essentially the factions aren t deep enough if you arent advancing the main quest you are doing terrible randomly generated quests
