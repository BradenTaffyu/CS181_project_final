2020 after playing for 100 hours or so i feel that i cannot recommend this game over the course of my time playing this game i went from excited and interested to annoyed to frustrated to be clear i haven t done everything there is to do in this game i haven t launched a rocket or mined the entire map but i have made it a decent way towards what is considered to be the end of the game the good there are several things that this game does well that i did enjoy the first 20 hours or so are spent figuring out the basics and trying to survive the game offers some tutorials that cover the bare minimum needed to survive and then lets you figure things out from there that sense of excitement when you figure out how to make oxygen or mine into a new biome was great and kept me coming back to the game even when my first several attempts at colonies went up in flames when i ran out of food were fun and hilarious the bad the game has no direction whatsoever the end goal of the game from my understanding is to launch a rocket but once you get past the basic tutorials on how to survive there isn t any guidance on what to do next at first that was enjoyable as i prefer to be challenged a bit but once i started hitting roadblocks that required me to watch 30 minute videos and scour the subreddit looking for help that s when i realized this game isn t enjoyable there are some good guides out there on youtube namely francis john videos but after watching several i realized i never would have figured out how to do things or what to do next for that matter if i hadn t watched a video even if you watch all of the videos and thoroughly read through guides you ll soon realize that most of them take advantage of some bug to transfer heat at an impossible rate store infinite liquid etc take a look at the community page or the subreddit if you don t believe me this game will make you go insane if you try and learn all the ins and out the game looks simple at first but then gets incredibly difficult once you run out of the basic materials and have to turn to more complicated technology i constantly found myself focusing on mining the map for resources while trying to figure out the optimal setup was for oxygen generation power generation farming ranching etc in the end i just could not manage to multitask that much another point any guide you might look up involves delving into the actual math behind the heat transfer mass transfer etc one thing that frustrated me the most was the way the dupes prioritized tasks there is a priority system built into the game which seems intuitive and useful at first but then you ll realize it is worthless the dupes will prioritize things that you set high enough but they aren t good at doing things in proximity to other tasks another annoying feature was that when it was time for them to go to bed they just drop whatever they are carrying on the ground in the end this game is worth it if you buy it on sale or enjoy games that require a large time investment in order to master if you don t enjoy anything mentioned above don t buy it too long didn t read if you want to see what it is like to be an engineer this game is for you if you want a casual game that is fun and rewarding look elsewhere
