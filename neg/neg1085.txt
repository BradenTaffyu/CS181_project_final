2017 oh great another update when games like terraria release an update after a while after release it s usually new content so what great new oh it s a creation club update well that s fine i don t have to use it so it doesn t bother me oh now my game is broken and has neon glowing puddles when it actually loads bethesda i ve been a fan since i fell in love with morrowind s highly aesthetic landscape and fantastical story but this is just getting ridiculous i understand completely that the market has changed but you re drifintg into ea s territory implementing paid features nobody wants that break the game i honestly feel i can t support you as a consumer anymore because why bother when i don t even get to play the game i paid for and if you want a good story go check out pandamic s fallout videos on youtube because they are incredible
