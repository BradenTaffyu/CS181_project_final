2016 early access review it s taken me a while to write this review because i ve been and still am split very much 50 50 on whether to recommend this title but on balance in the game s current state unfortunately i cannot recommend it certainly there are some good things here i have over 40 hours logged because the game s world and mechanics are intriguing the graphics have a certain charm they are more than adequate for a game like this and it is set in an interesting and well thought out sci fi world unfortunately i kept finding myself underwhelmed by the content and options that the game actually presented me with i should state that i have played and enjoyed dwarf fortress and i am a big fan of permadeath and roguelikes in general i have ascended in and even contributed to dungeon crawl stone soup which by the way is a free and awesome game so go download it now if you haven t played it the problem for me with rimworld is that while there is a really interested structure of a game here that structure has not been fleshed out with enough meat for something that has been in development for nearly 3 years this is quite worrying especially with the apparent pace of updates released by the developer i really do hope to eventually be able to change my review what needs to change for that to happen is that the mechanics need to feel rounded out in the core game without relying on mods certainly there are mods available that fix many of my concerns with the current gameplay but 23 is rather a lot for a title that then requires mods to turn it into something resembling a complete experience i ll conclude this review by listing some specific things that i think badly need addressing going through this list it becomes apparent just how nearly every single mechanic in the game feels majorly lacking warning some spoilers ahead though they are very minor 1 some bits of furniture can be uninstalled and moved to a different location but it seems completely arbitrary which furniture this can apply to it doesn t apply to workbenches so if you want to move one a single square to the right you have to completely deconstruct it and rebuild it wasting resources there is a mod that makes them all movable this mod simply switches some flags in the xml files no more so it would be incredibly easy for the devs to enable this like a 10 minute job and there doesn t seem to be any logical reason why they don t 2 many of the workbenches have only a single option for what you can build would be nice to have a bit more variation when the build queue for each bench technically alllows building many things of different types 3 research is too expensive and makes much too big leaps would be nice to see a proper research tree with smaller increments of unlocking different builds rather than typically unlocking an entire bench with all the things it can build weirdly there is one research option that unlocks a new type of seed to grow but all the other seeds start unlocked the research just overall seems bizarre i can right now research among not many other things carpetmaking or ship antimatter reactor the latter only takes twice as much research as the former this just seems like not the right decision to be making 4 not enough options for surgery and implants i can harvest someone s heart or kidney but not their limbs or their eyes i can implant bionic legs but i can t repair a broken spine i can t construct these bionic implants myself it seems like half the options there again there is a mod that provides a whole extra set of technologies to enable all this but it just feels the vanilla tech is unfinished 5 variation of enemies particular the mechanoids there are only two types surely mechanoids could be even more varied than humans or critters 6 gui there are all kinds of odd bugs and inconsistencies and awkwardness in the gui sure it s a massive improvement on df but it really needs some love there are also some basically usability things missing for instance being able to compare the stats of two items or two characters side by side or see a grid overview of the skills of all my colonists when setting work priorities there is a grid where you have to hover over each cell to see the value of that specific skill it s really awkward 7 combat the sometimes continual raids that the storyteller throws at you get really tedious to defend you have to micromanage every unit which is really jarring next to the normal gameplay which is the antithesis of micromanagement combat should be set up by giving colonists rallying points or patrol areas so during a raid they will all go to those locations take away direct control of the units and make the raids a bit easier to compensate this would much better fit the gameplay of a colony builder game and be a lot more fun currently the best way to defend against raids is to abuse gameplay mechanics and pathing logic to direct the enemies into killboxes which to me feels like cheating things need tweaking a lot to make these firefights enjoyable also if you have trained any pets then they will get immediately slaughtered probably by friendly fire you can t really mix melee and ranged combat at all because everyone even those with high shooting skill aims so badly they will just shoot your own melee dudes and pets instead of the enemy 8 balance the game is very hard and switching to easier difficulties doesn t seem to change much the storyteller ai basically decides when it wants you to die and there doesn t seem much that can be done about it apparently this is the point of the game i would find these stories much more interesting if my colony had a chance to develop a bit further before inevitably getting decimated by overwhelming forces it doesn t help that it s extremely slow and difficult to recruit new colonists so usually losing even one or two which is very likely to happen in any raid is a serious detriment to any progress maybe i m missing the point but i was just not finding it enjoyable 9 size of map travelling to other sectors the default map really isn t all that big so resources are strictly finite when you start the game you pick a spot on a huge world map but then you can t visit anywhere else on that map even though factions from elsewhere can visit you well i think those are all my biggest gripes i could probably think of more but this demonstrates the scale of the problem i could see past one or two of these flaws because there is a really interesting game underneath struggling to get out but with this many barriers to me enjoying it i just keep not wanting to carry on with my game i m not sure how long it will take the devs to fix all of this if they ever do but we could be waiting another 3 years
