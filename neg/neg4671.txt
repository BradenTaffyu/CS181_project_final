this game used to be the only game i played and it was fun that is until saber came and decided to sell a deluxe and ultimate edition then came the dlcs then came the prices rising then came the season pass why the hell is there a season pass this game doesn t deserve overwhelmingly positive user reviews it deserves very positive or mostly positive only buy this game if its on sale by at least 30 and by god do not buy deluxe or ultimate edition or any dlcs if you get some good mods you will be fine
