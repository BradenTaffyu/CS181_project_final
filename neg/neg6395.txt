2022 if you ve played horizon 2 3 4 and 5 like i have it gets boring really quickly there are no big fundamental changes except for the map offcourse and new types of events the cars are 80 the same as in horizon 4 and the cars you can win through festival playlist are also 80 dlc cars from horizon 4 alot of bugs in the beginning and still to this day and still not even 1 dlc release to this day the game has been out for almost 7 months pretty upsetting when you buy the ultimate version wich is 100 i think it just gets really repetitive for me can t enjoy it as much as horizon 2 and 3 those are still the best horizon s for me personally edit i have played it a few hours again with some friends to have fun recently and to get the 992 gt3
