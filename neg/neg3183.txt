pay to win entirely biased roster power creep you name it just an awful pvp balanced fun situation subs op cvs op bbs what are those it s almost like the devs forgot this was a bb simluator back in the day and is the major reason 90 of the people even try this title to captain a bigass ship with even bigger guns 1 10 do not play waste of your time frustrating angering at p2w equipment and just genuine disregard for normal f2p progression everything is p2w
