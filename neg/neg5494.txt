2019 not worth it the game is 6 years old now and neither basic features nor ai politics works for 5 cents worth mods can make the game decent but the inherent flaws tend to overwhelm even the best mods over time and ca doesn t deserve money for a game that s at best only playable thanks to the modding community owing to their refusal to actually fix their own product the prime example of broken game mechanics fleet battles fleet battles is by far the most obvious example of plain broken game mechanics your ships will generally ram enemy ships alright once then they have a tendency to either get stuck on the spot or forever row backwards when you tell them to ram again you also have to tell your ships manually to repeat the ramming if one ramming wasn t enough to sink the ship because apparently ca thinks that s funny or something what s even worse regarding fleet battles is that when two or more ships board one enemy ship and the enemy ships is sunk either by ramming or by the boarding action being successful because ca was actually so lazy that they decided that a successful boarding should end in the ship somehow sinking and the boarding parties somehow miraculously all making it back to their ships in time instead of just letting you capture it presumably because that would make too much sense the two boarding ships will be permanently stuck in the boarding phase for the rest of the match and will also be invulnerable to ramming or boarding themselves this often results in you destroying every single enemy ship but the odd two that at one point managed to board one of your ships and thanks to ca logic striking again you will then go on to lose the battle when the timer runs down and you ve been unable to destroy the two invulnerable bugged ships it makes no difference how many ships you have left at the end of the battle versus the two enemy ships you ll still lose even if you d had 1000 ships against the two remaining enemy ships when the time has run out the prime example of ai politics would presumably be the wars the ai gives no craps about limiting itself to wars that actually make sense for their nations the moment a country gets embroiled in a few too many wars hint the ai does this all the time it seems near incapable of making peace if one side hasn t been entirely defeated ai nations from across the map will start piling in and taking a chunk wildly criss crossing the med by far overstretching themselves the result is inevitably that the map looks more confusing than the borders of the holy roman empire one should also take extreme care to never ally with ai nations if you get into a war they will invariably force you to make a mad dash for any region you want to seize if you want it intact because as mentioned above the ai will send 20 unit death stacks they should by no means be able to afford all over the map and claim individual settlements for themselves wanna conquer dacia sorry that one tiny british tribe you decided to spare and keep around as a satrap raced across the map and somehow seized the capital and just generally destroyed your realistic strategic plans and enjoyment what s even worse is if you lose one of your own settlements because your ai allies will all too happily kick out the invaders and keep the settlement for themselves even if you d play as the roman empire you d be liable to losing the city of rome itself like this to a random ai ally that stationed one of its armies in italy and was ready when you for some reason briefly lost the capital there is no diplomatic option for demanding requesting or even paying for the return of the settlement so either you ll just accept that it s forever gone or go to war against your ally with all the other ai nations thinking you the aggressor for doing so this also applies to cases of undeclared invasions whereby the ai occassionally sends an army into your territories without permission ruining local food production tax collection etc but because they didn t declare war and haven t actually attacked you the ai community will think it s all entirely kosher attack the nation that invaded you and you ll be branded the aggressor this game was released 6 years ago and despite such absurd joy ruining factors ca has consistently just straight up ignored them in favour of pumping out yet more dlcs
