2023 early access review update they did go back on the server hosting issue and that is now resolved after many fights from a dedicated community of players being very angry they are updating the little issues slowly and the game is much more playable now after many many updates there are still way too many trees in many places and terrain issues galore if you have the hardware and get it on sale by all means buy the game however i had to upgrade to a 4070 gpu just to stop the constant crashes that is insane end update i have never been so disappointed in my entire life the months of getting drip fed little asset images like trees sleeping bags and stone tools should have told us something the total radio silence right up to launch should have told us something too but despite it all we as a collective community of fans believed in the company that made our favourite game ark survival evolved is pretty great in its current form after all so surely a remake with better graphics bug fixes and features would be the best thing ever so when an amazing looking trailer drops followed by a game release in less than 24 hours we all jumped on the band wagon this is what we were waiting for right it looks amazing surely it will be amazing to experience well no not even close it is visually stunning and that is about it we trusted the developers when they said it was play tested and on track for release either their play testers were not ark players or they lied spawning in you get bombarded with the beauty of it all those who can actually run the game that is as the recommended specifications on the steam page are a lie just like anything else that this studio seemingly says and don t get me wrong it looks great however after playing for a little bit you find out just what a mess this game is early access is the tag that we all cling to as reason but honestly it is worse than i expected yes we as a community did hype ourselves up excitedly awaiting the game that was being drip fed and teased for months the developers just had to sit back and reap the rewards with minimal advertising effort as we were chomping at the bit for this game and they did just that getting a little backlash from their community about not giving us anything at all to work with prior to release but shrugging it off with a promise that it would be worth it and we trusted them my top issues with the physical gameplay are the ui is clunky and feels outdated the previous version wins hands down in that regard the dinosaur models sometimes feel out of place in their new surroundings as many of them are directly placed over from the previous game with very little to no updates to their models the game world does not play well in first person and many times you need to swap over to third person just to be able to see anything at all the lush forest is way too dense to comfortably play in many spots and the terrain has multiple places that you cannot even access on foot without following what feels like a very liniar path and i am not talking high cliffs but rather it seems like you can walk there but you get pushed away traversing the map on a land dino is painful because of the overgrown forest and that is what has been bothering me most about gameplay not being able to see the entire map is horrible as you cannot plan out a route that goes beyond the section that you are allowed to see at any given time no you cannot pan the map up and see the whole thing either they were so close to having a great thing going there with location marked pings and death markers the vanilla settings feel way off just booting the game up not altering anything sees a character flying through levels without even needing to find an explorer note as xp gain is so high but you get one piece of flint from a rock or 2 pieces of meat from a creature and tweaking that is proving to be difficult to balance as the settings either don t stick or don t offer enough of a range of options i want vanilla asa to feel like vanilla ase and it doesn t the handheld torches don t seem to make much light anymore and really do not help to actually see in the dark the ambient sound is great especially in the caves and really add a lot to the immersive feel of the game but that makes the little sounds that feel out of place so much more bothersome using things mainly i absolutely hate the laughable sound of hitting a rock what happened to the old sound why does it sound like we are beating on glass give us a bit of bass or at least beat two rocks together to hear what that sounds like and come back to us you need to manually save as you go and often too as this game just loves crashing on you even when saving often i have had my character engrams reset and lost progress more than once where the save just seemingly didn t work that is not fun we don t want that and the crashing is intense even with everything on my system updated and rebooted i still get crashed out of the game regularly which adds to the frustration my pc specs are posted below why the hell can i not rebind the f11 key we already have a command for swapping window sizes it is alt enter we don t need to use f11 for that i set f10 and f11 to my gamma up and down and by chance found out that this is a thing i was already annoyed so i am adding it to my list of annoyances and let us not forget that its price has doubled in less than 24 hours with nothing to show for the increase and here is the big one the greatest deal breaker for me is that this abomination of a game has done away with privately hosted server clusters great communities were built on self hosted servers where the physical hardware was in someone s house it was promised to still have the option to do this way back when we were told how nitrado would have the monopoly on hosting servers i double checked it was in a community crunch but now after sales have rocketed up we find out this was yet another lie and we can t actually host our own servers this forces players to play official those are full and having severe crashing issues and horrible ping for players who don t live close or rent a server from nitrado not everyone lives in the usa i am not paying through my ears to host a server that gives me 300 ping so what is left single player and non dedicated play with a 180m tether yeah that is great fun tried it out and ended up rage quitting the game as it comes with its own slew of irritations i am well aware that i am a nobody to the corporate machine just a voice in the pool of reviews and gripes we all are but i fear that if studio wildcard doesn t get off their power trip high horse and take a step back to see that so many nobodies are unhappy about this game they are going to lose the battle get the private servers sorted and make a big announcement of that go with it was not added on release as we wanted to get the game in your hands first but say something beat off nitrado with a stick if you have to you need to build communities not topple them like you have if you can do that they will be entertained enough while you listen to what is making players lose interest in the game we waited for and address that and this is the important part listen to your players we love your older game we expect more from you than this you have betrayed our trust many times over on this game turn back now and save this ship or get your life jackets ready i have no faith that this will actually be wildcard s course of action and it will be a shame to see something with so much potential go down the drain my pc specs rtx 4070 12 gig gpu upgraded from 3060 12gig at first review 64gig ddr 4 memoryi5 12600k cpugen4 2tb nvme to run the game from
