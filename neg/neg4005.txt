i don t normally do negative reviews on this since this is one of my favorite games to play on steam but the foolish decision of the developers to get convinced by a copyright troll impersonating a nintendo representative to remove all nintendo related addons from the workshop have had me writing this negative review this kind of decision is enough to encourage more dmca trolls to file more fake dmcas on other addons and negatively affect your upcoming game s box and thus damaging your reputation as a once respected game company that made a once wonderful and fun game that provides endless creativity and fun until you ve wisened up and start realizing what aaron was doing to your game i would be considering to stop supporting you and your game
