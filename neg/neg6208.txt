if you are really into warhammer i guess the game is okay strictly as an rpg its sort of cluttered mess and strictly inferior to the literally dozens of other games in the genre you could spend the next decade playing i wouldn t go so far as to say that it isn t fun but that is only because i am a sucker for wh edit played another 60 hours and the game only got worse way worse honestly it started out as a 5 10 experience with mediocre gameplay especially combat propped up by strong writing the writing is still strong but as the game goes on an the combat and leveling systems get even more convoluted and pretty much ruin the redeeming qualities of the game the combat isn t hard but the devs added more pointless perks and tweakable character options than there are distinct and useful abilities or weapons i am still using the same weapon for my main character that i acquired in act 1 sixty hours ago none of the options add anything substantive to gameplay and combat is a boring slog fest where you spam the same three abilities you gained in act 1 at one point i had avoided the leveling menu for nearly thirty hours and clicking through the resulting mess went on for two hours before i stopped caring and just clicked the first option for whatever popped up since it doesn t matter anyway it took an outright new character to even add anything novel to the combat and that s a space marine going up to harder difficulties doesn t add challenge it just increases the length of the already tedious combat the whole thing is really frustrating because the gameplay is terrible and i just want the the story only to have pointless useless mechanics like the warp travel and reputation systems make even the lowest difficulties and story mode unenjoyable the combat is actually worse than inquisitor martyr where at least the devs limited themselves to a handful of pointless and outright bad ideas before half baking them here its several handfuls and its not even cooked at this point i don t want a refund i want paid he does it for free for my time as a playtester
