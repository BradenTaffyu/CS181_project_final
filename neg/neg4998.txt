2021 the game is currently very buggy and basically incomplete and as of several hours ago it is no longer being supported and ca is going to make some other total war game based on romance of the three kingdoms this game is not quite 2 years old yet frankly the only reason i hadn t given up on this game yet is that despite all of the poorly implemented mechanics in the various patches dlcs or just bad design decisions from launch there was at least a chance that it would be fixed in the future well so much for that half of the mechanics in this game are bugged poorly balanced or just don t work right sometimes even doing the opposite of what they should go on play as a bandit faction notice anything strange about how your tech tree works vs how it is supposed to work at least that particular bug arguably benefits the player also looters are known to randomly spawn in the northwest corner of the map i guess they re supposed to represent raids from the nomads on china s border but they are still listed as han citizens as far as the new imperial intrigue mechanic is concerned so you get punished for actually defeating them and the zeal mechanic the yellow turbans use in mandate of heaven was not play tested at all from what i can tell i could go on and on about the various problems and lazy solutions that totally don t work btw that were implemented but i think i ve made my point this game is half complete half baked and yet full price and as of now it will always remain half complete and half baked forever with no hope of salvation ironically the much reviled eight princes dlc is pretty much the only part of this game that is in a playable and mostly stable situation so at least the eight princes campaign is good for whatever that is worth
