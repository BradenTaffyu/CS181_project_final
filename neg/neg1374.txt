2023 taleworlds changed from a small but committed family studio beloved for their subpar graphics but deep systems into a aaa sized studio with good graphics but paper thin systems they lived long enough to see themselves become the villain this isn t to disparage the hard work of the devs on bannerlord but it s important to note that the direction of bannerlord has been awful not only did they release it in early access they have spent years developing it and still it s not up to the same level of mechanics as warband a game that s over a decade old no feasts events claimants usurpers manhunters naval combat right to rule system books trainers duels deserters or camping to name a few all features offered in previous mount blade titles the economy and diplomacy systems are a cruel joke bannerlord is more restrictive to mod compared to warband and because bannerlord developers insist on releasing extremely minor patches that break mods constantly throughout it s development cycle many modders gave up on the game further contributing to the state of negativity the community has for the game taleworlds you have a chance you can pull a no man s sky and win back your community but it s going to require serious effort from your end to pay back the ball fumbling you ve been doing for years on this game s development until i see a youtube video titled bannerlord just got a huge amazing content update or bannerlord is actually good now in 20xx i won t be revisiting the game or purchasing any future taleworlds products edit it s the second half of 2024 and this game still stinks they release micro patches that still break mods and in my opinion reality its so the game stays on top of the algorithm on steam ps store xbox epic etc so they can keep making money on sales there really is no excuse for a game like this to stagnate with a dev team of 130 they either laid everyone off or abandoned this game and are working on a new project and not telling anyone go play warband instead with mods or without vanilla warband is actually more feature complete than this game hellotoyou
