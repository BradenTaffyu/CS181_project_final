2017 arguable the best total war in the series having played them all over the years improved ai and streamlining of certain needed game mechanics makes it incredible enjoyable however their dlc is incredible agressive in how it s implimented options to buy dlc are all over the menus it makes it feel almost like a well polished mobile free 2 play game although there are only 4 playable factions in vanilla they are fantastically diverse and overall give more varity then having 12 slightly different factions i feel faction wise they give you enough at vanilla but the additional campaigns blood in a warhammer game are all chopped out for dlc along with anything else not core the additional factions are also very expensive for what they are and seeing as they are in the game as non playable factions i m not opposed to buying dlc and spending more on a game thats doing it s own thing which can only be sold to the pc market thats the price i guess for sega to keep footing the bill but i feel that with warhammer are just being far far to greedy in short wait a few years and get it all cheep in a sale
