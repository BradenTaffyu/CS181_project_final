2023 this game is amazing but i m setting a negative score until namco decides to set an acceptable price tag on this game this is a 2016 game where they re charging full price here in brazil this game is actually more expensive than elden ring and there wasn t a single instance where they put this game on sale during the entirety of 2022 check steamdb a complete joke by namco if you want this game try to find another store to buy the key i m pretty sure they re way cheaper than through steam edit july 30th 2023 they lowered the price a little bit now it s costing the same as elden ring it s still super expensive for a 7 year old game nonetheless
