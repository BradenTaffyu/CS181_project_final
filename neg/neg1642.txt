the game is infested with cheaters already the ranked gamemode is unplayable due to 99 ovr auto greener users same bugs from previous years like slow mo while subbing into mycareer games random crashing and pretty consistent crashes while leaving mycareer arena some other gameplay bugs that can be hella annoying but i would imagine those will be patched unlike the other mentioned bugs when it works it is the best 2k we have had on pc very fun and has a fairly steep skill gap so far if you play online i can t recommend buying it for full price wait and get it on sale
