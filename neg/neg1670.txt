2023 i m not saying it s bad but when 90 of the content is locked behind a paywall it seems clear that ea intentionally limits the options you have in the vanilla game in order to motivate you to buy all these dlcs that cost like 30 a piece that is malicious marketing and precisely why ea is the butt of all jokes about dlc it costs nearly 800 to buy all the content in this game that is absurd and inexcusable and frankly if you buy it than you are a part of the problem
