2018 a fun game hampered by terrible combat i ve played a ton of stellaris and while i greatly enjoy a lot of what the game is doing i often find myself abandoning runs before the end game due to the awful late game war system conquering other empires and trying to engage them in battle is frustrating and tedious holding systems is nearly impossible since it only take a few ships to capture an outpost and the ai ends up with a half dozen roving bands of small fleets that blow up everything you ve done while retreating immediately if you try to catch them to make matters worse your own defensive stations are often ineffectual at blocking off choke points i ve watched numerous times as enemy fleets bypassed my fortified system without a shot ever being fired at them there s a lot to like about stellaris and i relaly enjoy the random events and different approaches to empire you can take while the early game exploration skirmishes and race for teritory are great i can t reccomend the game in it s current form due to the late game being the opposite of fun i m hopeful that some of the major issues will be corrected in a future patch but for now i have to advise playing something else
