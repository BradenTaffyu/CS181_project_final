2022 early access review if this was the first mount and blade i would be impressed but it is not taleworlds took warband off the shelf took it apart cleaned all the parts and put them back together again yes new engine new graphics new map but they did not address any of warbands major issues sieges are still lacklustre hideout attacks are still not as tense as they ought to be being lord of a village still does not mean much beyond getting a bit of cash i could go on but i hope you see my point it is the same game i don t mean a better warband it is warband with better graphics the difference being they did not come up with any meaningful new ideas or fixed any major problems same parts only cleaned and painted i can forgive bugs and i can forgive gameplay issues but those are not the problem with bannerlord the problem is a distinct lack of creativity and that i can not forgive
