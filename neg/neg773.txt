2016 i never thought i d say this but man this game was boring sure i sunk 200 hours into it but to be honest i stopped doing the story quests 5 hours in and the side quests about 50 more in most of the time was spent building and maintaining settlements waiting for the mod tools to allow some people to create some fun gameplay mods to make the game interesting sadly this never really happened instead bethesda has decided to try their paid mods scheme again because they think everyone is a moron and won t notice creator s club seriously go yourself i will never buy another bethesda game again i ensure all my friends know about their so they also never buy another bethesda game again until these devs start losing money they re never going to stop with stupid like this nice graphics don t really excuse the laughably boring story annoyingly dumbed down game mechanics insanely lacklustre dlc and uninspired gameplay it s not even an rpg anymore just a mediocre shooter with some watered down rpg elements here and there the guns are a simplistic array of non descript bullet hoses that only differ in the appearance of their models their damage is laughable at times even with skills maxed and absolutely pathetic in dlc like far harbour there s no character creation your character is already decided for you all you get to choose is what they look like settlements are still ridiculously broken with the stats for each one becoming erratic when you get far enough away really disappointing game hopefully the next one if there is one will be in the hands of obsidian because new vegas is still a superior game
