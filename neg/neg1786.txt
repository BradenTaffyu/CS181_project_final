2023 in light of the new awful economy changes i have compiled a list of all the scummy things gaijin does which worsen the experience for all players in the name of profit only i really hope they change some of these things for the better intentionally releasing new vehicles in an overpowered state in order to make people grind as quickly as they can to abuse them before the nerfs intentionally releasing overpowered premium vehicles and not nerfing them in order to make people purchase them the price of said premiums being equal to triple a games i don t know how it s excusable for some premiums to be 70 when they already sell premium accounts for 10 a month intentionally making sl modifiers low and repair costs high so that the average player cannot break even in sl after a game this encourages them to purchase a premium account or a premium vehicle this also encourages players to leave after one death to minimize losses implementing research efficiency and tiers to make players buy more than one premium per nation in order to grind keep in mind each premium can cost up to 70 forcing players to buy a vehicle previous to the one they want to buy regardless if they ever want to use it a lot of vehicles should be in a folder but are not because gaijin wants you to spend more sl forcing players to buy x vehicles from the previous tier before they can buy vehicles in the next tier this increases the grind and forces you to buy vehicles that you might never have any intention of playing still making the sl and rp grind painfully slow even if you are using premium vehicles and a premium account especially at the top tiers mind you you are paying 10 month the price of 2 3 premiums per nation you want to grind and it s still very slow intentionally making stock vehicle performance extremely insufferable by locking away essential needs such as spare parts fpe nvd usable ammo and countermeasures this is to make players purchase these modifications with ge introducing crew qualifications which are arguably a pay to win feature aced crews provide significant advantages over basic the sl cost for expert crews and the grind for ace crews are not viable for the average player people just purchase ace crews putting players in debt over their own mistake after the january 2022 incident they could have just let those players keep their 7 days of premium as a new year s gift and take the good publicity but they doubled down this was so bad that some players were going to take legal action because they felt as if they got scammed and gaijin was forced to remove the debt because of the insane backlash selling pay to win bush cosmetics which otherwise are extremely hard to grind for are unavailable for half the year and you only get one random bush implementing an rp soft cap which punishes skillful players because otherwise they would grind too quickly and won t be compelled to spend money introducing strike drones to make the game more frustrating and to make people lose sl if you get 2 kills and then die with your drone it will be less sl earned than the repair costs of what you killed due to the modifiers a net negative overall intentionally making one nation overpowered then making a different nation overpowered in order to make players purchase premiums to grind the new overpowered nation intentionally keeping the br s compressed in order to make the game more random and frustrating to limit skillful players and make players more likely to spend ge on mods crews or premiums intentionally making minor nations have underpowered vehicles with very high repair costs and low modifiers because they are played by mostly experienced players who would otherwise grind too quickly making boosters expire for no reason other than to take advantage of fomoslashing the economy time after time but disguising it as a net positive for example making the players choose but nerfing the economy either way and putting the blame on the players introducing extremely grindy events with vehicles that never return or are sometimes op capitalizing on fomo introducing lootbox style crates bought for ge or ridiculous amounts of sl with very low chances of getting the reward you want this is effectively gambling at worst and very predatory at best they do not need to be this aggressive when it comes to monetization this game already makes so much i just hope they start caring more about their player base and less about their profits
