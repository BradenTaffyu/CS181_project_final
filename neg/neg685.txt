2015 fallout 4 heartaches by the number fallout 4 is a title that in relation to the previous games took one great step forward technically and mechanically but twenty enormous leaps backwards in terms of roleplaying writing dialogue and quests fo4 effectually forgets everything that fans of the series loved in the originals new vegas and even bethesda s own fallout 3 trading that out for an experience more akin to borderlands than any other mainline fallout release i m not outright saying that fallout 4 is a terrible game it s far from it but it s simply not the game fallout and rpg fans rightly expected fallout 4 starts with an excellently produced opening cinematic explaining the state of the world in the year 2077 and then you are quickly transitioned to a married couple living in boston massachusetts from here you choose either the husband or the wife to play as and then customize the look of your character to your liking after a bit more exposition you find yourself running with your spouse your infant in their arms to a vault as sirens blare that the nuclear apocalypse has finally come due to events unspoiled in this review you emerge 210 years later the sole survivor of vault 111 on a mission to reconnect with your missing child who is no longer in the vault when you emerge as exciting as that opening plot summary may have sounded any veteran of the fallout series would be able to quickly identify countless problems with it fallout has always been a franchise about creating your own character who finds their own motivations in a devastated world with seemingly innumerable options none of that is true in fallout 4 however because the character you play as will always be from before the apocalypse have had a spouse at some point have a child be either a military vet the husband or a lawyer the wife and will swear an oath at the onset of the game to find their child which should make all other content meaningless until you have this kills one of the most iconic aspects of the fallout series player narrative freedom it s the basis for why i ve not recommended this game as it s the first domino to fall that proves fo4 is not a fallout rpg which will be explained further switching to something more positive i think fallout 4 looks superb the textures and faces are just passable but the lighting godrays modeling animation and artistic design of the boston ruins are all visually stunning the game even performs markedly well for a bethesda title apart from some fps drops in the downtown areas there were several bugs on release but most of those issues are fixed now for once i have no major complaints about the performance of a fallout game another favorable aspect of fo4 would be the irrefutably improved combat when compared to prior entries in the series the shooting is now both precise and reactive and the ai is clever enough to have some self preservation instincts most fights are undertaken while exploring and as for the exploration i d say it s just as good as you d expect from any bethesda game the world is full of interesting places and most of the best moments in the game are bred through this pairing of combat and exploration however there is one caveat to these mechanics the issue i have with the combat exploration duo is the horseshoe design of most of fallout 4 s dungeons this is to say the type of design skyrim had that circled you back around to the main entrance at the end of each interior level this is an okay design choice within itself but considering this is fallout where the places you explore are meant to be realistic settings the horseshoe level structure gets repetitive and by consequence immersion breaking early on in the game otherwise the broader world design suffers no such gameplay errors though the last encouraging thing i have to say about fo4 is that the power armor crafting and settlement systems are all awesome power armor is finally given the depiction it deserves as it s now less of a normal armor type and more of a vehicle that the player drives the crafting utilizes nearly every miscellaneous item from the game allowing them to be broken down for components to modify weapons and armor and to build settlements the new settlement system is basic but thematically makes sense in the world of fallout as it shows people attempting to rebuild civilization and organize societies for their own well being while i don t agree that gameplay gimmicks are where fallout should target its energy these systems are well constructed and engrossing nonetheless refocusing on fallout s main tenants of design i ll very bluntly state that the player progression is atrocious the leveling system in fo4 removed skills from its makeup and now relies solely on the s p e c i a l system and perks this is a problem because the level of diversity you can apply to your character is limited to 70 perks many of which are boring stat multipliers where as you used to have over a dozen skills with values of 1 100 which made for incredible variation in player type as well as more worthwhile perks to compound this issue fo4 almost never provides different solutions to quests and dilemmas based on the character you ve built making progression pointless in roleplaying terms speaking of things in fallout 4 that are pointless the choices are too well that isn t entirely true some quests do have a final decision you can make on how to resolve a situation but in essence you can t choose to be anything but a constant quest sponge this is partially due to the aforementioned restrictive progression system but the actions you can take are so limiting both physically and in conversation that you can t kill people you don t like because half of all named characters are essential and you can almost never turn down a quest in dialogue player choice at its finest oh and as for the damned dialogue yet another dumbed down aspect of fo4 that was once essential to the series is the dialogue the crux of this issue is the limitations the system imposes by always artificially mandating 4 response options even when more or less may be fitting this makes conversations feel inhuman in an uncanny valley way which bleeds into both the personalities of the characters and the depth of the quests characters other than some companions are never given the justice they deserve because your interactions with them are so narrow and quests default to almost always being shoot and loot affairs because the dialogue is not built for intense thoughtful debates every roleplaying element has proven to be a disappointment and i ll expose why take a moment to consider this fact there is not a single writer credited for the creation of fallout 4 the lead designer emil pagliarulo is the only person whose job description even partially included writing this illustrates why there is a lack of thought put into the roleplaying dialogue choices and quests as they require a consistent team of professional writers to construct and ensure each element works in harmony that s what s at the heart of fo4 s troubles in my eyes a complete disrespect towards writing in any form which is what made fallout what it is today when it comes down to it fallout 4 is a perfectly well designed game on the basis of being just that a game what it is decidedly not however is a fallout rpg because to be one of those you have to actually adhere to what made previous fallout s so great those who have not played a fallout game before will almost certainly enjoy fo4 but as a long standing fan of the franchise and as someone whose favorite game series was fallout all fo4 gives me is heartaches by the number personal rating 6 10 entirely mediocre posted on 8 13
