2017 this is the first review i ve bothered to write about a game in my 14 years of being on steam i m taking the time because i m extremely frustrated with the incredible dive in quality and game play experience the game takes after the opening chapter i m voting this game down because while i completely love the oepning zone i ve found the rest of the game to be frustrating and tedious at the start of this game you ll feel like exploring and experimenting with everything you come across because there s so much you can do but in the second section the randomness in difficulty and scaling will force you to become tactical and calculated you will feel that exploration is punished by mobs outside your viable level range but you won t be provided with clear targets to persue what was beautiful and fun becomes tedious and boring very quickly combined with the many many dialogue and quest bugs this makes the game far less than appealling before going into details i want to add that this isn t about the difficulty if i respec my characters in certains ways take advantage of min maxing and use tried and true tactics while avoiding out of reach fights then the game is easy to continue with but everything about this world screams that i shouldn t have to do that that there should be some way to afford my skill books without needing to steal that i should be able to make a persuassion check without full min max into the required stats none of that is the case after fort joy you are severely limited in scope for experimentation by the systems of play i loved fort joy i thought about the game all the time ways to do things stuff to try and just like that almost instantly i m completely hating it tells you a lot about where the time an effort was spent the details below fort joy is great the game feels polished and balanced some fights are hard and some are easy but playing on tactician level difficulty i felt like it was a tough punishing but ultimately fun experience after fort joy the game takes a huge dive in polish while the difficulty level becomes very randomised there are fights which seem absolutely natural to the flow of the zone and which are initiated by dialogue so you don t just avoid them which are stupidly more difficult than the large boss battles you ve just played through to be clear these are little plebs you re fighting the same types of guys you fought on fort joy but suddenly they are 3 4 levels higher than you can possibly be when entering the zone this is such poor game design i m literally pointed to find these character as my main quest only to enter a fight that i have to completely cheese to get through and it has no story implication it s not a special fight it s just some normal dudes who can kill any of your characters in one turn it s not just one fight either there s level 8 fights right next to 8 lvl 11 mob fights and no discernable way for you to see the danger coming again this is bad game design you re being led down one path and being flogged for it if there were pointers or there was an indication of where you should go then i d be less frustrated but the game offers you nothing the journal is almost useless in fact it was like this in fort joy as well but the quests themselves were more clear cut and controlled giving a sense of exploration and freedom while also not throwing you far out of your depth unless you wanted that sometimes i did and got smacked for it occassionally but that was just in reaper s coast there is no such sense of restriction you just have to blunder around blindly and hope part of the problem with this is the level scaling this has been detailed elsewhere but the difference in levels can have absolutely huge implications on your ability to fight again this in itself isn t a problem but when you combine it with a lack of information and where you could go then it s painful other problems post fort joy terrible scaling of dialogue checks i can win none of them and i hear this is a common problem for a game that encourages you to try different things it also absolutely enforces min maxing of your characters to succeed which makes the required stats for roles to be successful very stupid economics right now you essentially need to use pickpocket to be able to get most of the skills you require you also require barter min max on one character and lucky on another character helps a lot without those three things you cannot expect to have decent equipment after fort joy given that skills also cost money you get punished also from the amount of fun you have not just the difficulty from lower level equipment interestingly enough even killing vendors and everyone doesn t give you that much gold you really have to gimp the economic system if you want access to skills costs also by the way scale poorly with levels polish and bugs there are a lot of bugs in dialogue quests and logs in this section there were quite a few in fort joy too but now it s just silly almost every quest has some strangeness too it and most look so easy to fix you honestly have to wonder how few people larian had qc ing a product which is this ambitious in the end i really want to love this game but i ve just gotten so bored in the new zone everytime i try something exciting i just get shut down by horrible scaling and mechanics fort joy encouraged exploration and experimentation driftwood just encourages you to cheese and tactical perfection i feel like i m playing a tactical game and not a role playing game suddenly this is disappointing
