2017 i like the game but putting the pros and cons of the game asside i do not like the creation club creation club is yet another atempt at paid mods the expense of some of these mods are laughable with how much they cost i also do not appreciate that the creation club mod content is pre downloaded onto my computer without me purchasing or adding any mod from the creation club if this continues the space taken up cy cc files will grow as the creation club does its also a bit of a low blow for those who bought the season pass when if creation club goes away i will post a more through review of the game or at elast i will remove this negative review
