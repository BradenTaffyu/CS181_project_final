2023 i played this game since 2014 sunk hundreds over hundreds of hours playing it while my friends spent their mornings pranking their siblings or honing their makeup skills as a kid i spent them playing war thunder while some of my friends spent their teen years going out to parties and doing drugs in secret i was in sweatpants playing war thunder while they spent the last few pandemic years getting into gaming with stardew valley and other chill relaxing games yeah you can guess it was it worth it was it worth spending so many hours playing and patronizing a game that treats it s userbase like this i ll let you read the other reviews for that they explain it much better than i ever could no all i m left with is the sour taste of having skills in a game that literally hates me for not putting as much money in it as i put hours while being the only one in my friends group that can t do a straight eyeliner line
