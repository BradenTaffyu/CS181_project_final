2022 early access review the full game is launching soon and yet it feels as unfinished as the first early access release game breaking issues like troops not climbing ladders during sieges and instead pooling up at the bottom to be a fun target practice for the enemy enemy troops getting stuck inside walls preventing battles from ending simplistic ai that causes blobbing clumsy controls that prevents using tactics boiling down to f1 f3 bum rush or f6 and let the ai do it remnants of unfinished systems are also laid bare for everyone to see there is one character in the main quest that has half of her lines voiced and seemingly no other not even her counterpart character other systems have been culled or severely cut back settlements no long have land plots for redevelopment build castles different types of farms mines or stables nor technology trees there is no way to adjust parameters such as tax rate militia size and work effort villages no longer have any development and castles and towns just have small incremental stat upgrades which replaces all these mechanics criminal enterprises that allowed you to evict gangs and set up your own criminal enterprise have been cut almost entirely with on the vestigial and entirely unimportant gang member npcs that just offer repeatable quests objectively some of the worst quests in the game and they re entirely unimportant there were hints to other potential mechanics like seasons which may or may not have had gameplay altering effects but are also seemingly absent or so toned down that i haven t noticed them in the 100 hours i ve put into the game sometimes listening to the community is not in the best interests of the game but the developers seem to have taken this to the other extreme and completely ignore the community beyond improving modding tools a happy accident of simply improving their own development tools they have no regard for the modding community that has kept warband alive for over a decade they have certainly not learned anything from the kinds of mods that have been produced for both warband and bannerlord the game design of mount and blade has not progressed from the first game in the series despite a wealth of examples of what could be done with the formula the developers seem afraid of even wading in the kids pool of innovation as demonstrated above cutting everything that even remotely approaches a new game mechanic in summary bannerlord is fine and likely with time the community will develop content that will ultimately make bannerlord a good value proposition as a platform but ultimately as it stands there is so much missed potential and the game can be generously called a better looking warband but warband is the greater value proposition due to the wealth of mods that are already available for it and the fact that it is considerably cheaper i don t hate the game but i am extremely disappointed that we had to wait 12 years for what amounts to a coat of paint and more bugs
