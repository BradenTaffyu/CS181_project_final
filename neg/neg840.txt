2017 words can barely describe my dissapointment this game is an rpg without rp turning it into just a merely g for game i am not allowed to be who i want to be this to me is essential to fallout for to me this is what makes fallout i want to choose i want to be bad i want to be good i want to be neutral i want to be able to kill anyone i want to be able to help anyone i want to see how the world reacts to what i do and the consequences they bring in this game i am forced to be a sort of good guy i am never able to really choose never able to go my own way and see the consequences they bring i am allowed to choose between four options basically yes no why and sarcastic it doesnt matter which option i choose because they all lead down the same route which means i am not allowed to choose what i want to do you can only customize the look of your character but you have to be the anxious goodwilled parent who is really just looking for his son in nature so picture this i am a lunatic with scars i kill anyone i can find i am a laser rifling mass murderer with cannibal as perk i am not a good guy by most standards but when i talk with npcs and make their quests you see this guy with blood red eyes my character that looks like an absolute maniac like a psycopath raider leader that kills any living thing he sees fit as a ruse for mindless mayhem and he in heart is this anxious good willed parent that is only looking for his son sniffs takes a bite of human flesh sniffs i am only looking for my son you know i am coming from this age where civilization still stood eats human flesh and i realise in all this madness i am also the only one who is a cannibal yes the only character who is still alive from when civilization still stood is the only cannibal in the main game real cannibal like human eat human not ghouls or supermutants or such i ve never stumbled upon any other cannibal in the game i thought i found some cannibals but they were a huge dissapointment believing people to be robots instead my heart was struck by such anticlimactic garbage so you are this forced to be good guy who is the only cannibal in the game its nuts then bethesda apparently releases a dlc which forces you to be a evil guy that is not what anyone wanted i don t own the dlc and i cannot say this personal experience but according to the reviews it doesnt seem well and it doesn t surprise me what it does now your character is a bipolar maniac with no self control switching between being a good parent in the main game and an absolute monster in the push of a button for no reason you re still not able to choose you are forced to be a good guy then out of nowhere a bad guy that s just nuts i want to choose not to be controlled i want to choose but i cant because this isn t an rpg its a g for game they destroyed the rp and supplemented it with fps action i thought i bought fallout not battlefield or call of duty and to top it all off paid mods this is where i draw my line this is why i make my review i am extremely dissapointed with bethesda i will never buy a game upon release again you have fallen into the ea category of amazing trailers and hype of empty promises and no amount of hype or amazing trailers will make me buy such games because i know all budget and heart went into those advertisements and not the game itself i know i will be robbed thanks for ironing my permanent scepticism towards a game company i once believed to actually be something trustworthy ea clones are not worth a single microscopic dollar of my money this is my opinion of the game this is my review this is my absolute dissapointment and i want everyone to hear my voice so that they might not be as dissapointed and feel as robbed as i this is my opinion and i believe i am not alone either
