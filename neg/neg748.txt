2020 fallout 4 could have been a great rpg there s maybe 3 interactive quests that give a player more choice than go here and kill things there s maybe one skill check in the whole game the game uses the theme of synths in an interesting way maybe twice the institute railroad and especially the minutemen feel extraordinarily bland and shallow maybe because every conversation is give me more information money sarcastic yes polite yes no why the is the institute replacing people with synths why is bethesda so obsessed with making the player the leader of every faction but then having no actual ability to make decisions why do radiant quests exist why is the settlement mechanic so pointless and unrewarding did they fire their writers after morrowind or did they quit
