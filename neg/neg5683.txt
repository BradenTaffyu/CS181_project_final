2014 i feel like a battered housewife this makes the fifth weekend i ve tried to love rome ii these weekends have interpolated twelve patch cycles eight months two console releases a government shutdown a winter olympics a plane disappearance and of course this review itself i wanted to succeed after a decade of storming ch teaux forts firing by line and charging samurai uphill against spearwalls i wanted to return to the legionary maniple but i couldn t love rome ii am i being melodramatic well okay i m being melodramatic bugs don t factor into the equation this game is just poorly designed political economic and military concerns don t relate properly the first being especially loosely coupled the lifespan of characters has dramatically decreased while the level of management characters require has doubled the campaign copies the ckii civil war system and civ v victory system without apparent understanding of what made those systems work in their games and battle movement and killing speeds have accelerated to the point where tactics and more importantly tension are virtually impossible i won t waste my time detailing the many sins of this game three move s ahead s odi et odi episode does that as does reynold sanity s why rome 2 failed series if you prefer a brasher more offensive and for those who dislike the game more cathartic approach rome 2 has spectacle and that s why many people love it if you re here for strategy this game is leagues below shogun 2
