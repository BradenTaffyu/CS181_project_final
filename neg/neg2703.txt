2019 stellaris is the most heart breaking example of one step forward two steps back that i ve ever seen in a video game stellaris is a very very fun video game but it s also a video game with a lot of issues thankfully the development team is always doing their best to fix as many issues in stellaris as they can get to with every patch that comes out unfortunately the development team in spite of their best efforts and intentions always end up introducing more new issues than old ones that they ve fixed every update i m excited to start a new game because they ve finally fixed that one nagging thing that s kept me from really being able to properly enjoy it and every update i m frustrated because now some other thing is causing me grief in spite of it all i like stellaris but i also wouldn t recommend that anyone purchase it because liking stellaris is akin to watching a puppy try to make its way across a frozen lake you love the puppy of course you do because it s a puppy and it s adorable and it s trying it s best but it just keeps falling down and sliding backwards no matter what it does and never seems like it ll manage to finally properly make its way across the whole lake editing to respond to some folks in the comments the2lied desert kingit s not so much that the game is buggy as it has serious mechanical issues for example the current state of war goals and peace deals is absolutely atrocious and they ve already tried to rework it once to make it manageable rather than being able to pick and choose which systems or planets or peace terms you want you are locked into only being able to enforce the peace terms of the type of war you re waging when you re declaring a war the game often won t tell you what you can expect out of a peace deal under that war type when you re defending in a war well you don t have any choice at all as to what kind of peace deals you ll have access to and will just have to be content with what the game wants you to be able to do not to mention the current war score system of relying solely on war exhaustion is also ridiculous for example in a recent game i engaged in an offensive war against fanatical purifiers a containment war i did this because they were pushing in on my borders and i wanted a little breathing room so the war is going well and as i check the war screen i realize that well there s little to no information on how to actually accomplish peace we re both at or near full war exhaustion but i m only allowed a white peace or a surrender am i really going to have to occupy this whole faction just to make peace well i keep going until i get a pop up saying that enforced peace will be coming in a few months because i m at 100 war exhaustion in spite of having lost no battles or having had any of my planets occupied with the war only going on for a few years but i m barely halfway to their home planet are we just going to return to status quo ante bellum just because i haven t been able to occupy every system then the enforced peace comes and i have all of the systems that i had been occupying when the enforced peace fired oh that s cool i wish the game had more clearly explained that this is what happens in a containment war against fanatical purifiers i also wish that i could enforce ideology on them instead to keep them from being genocidal maniacs but whatever except what s this due to the systems i ve taken i am now massively over my administrative capacity aww jeez see this is why i wish i could have picked and chosen what i wanted from the peace deal well whatever let s just abandon these systems and these planets and wait what i can t abandon planets but these planets i took from the fanatical purifiers are taking up dozens of points of administrative capacity and i have no quick or meaningful way of increasing my administrative capacity quickly so am i just supposed to sit here way over my administrative capacity with empire sprawl severely gimping my nation for the next however many years yep yep i am there is no functional or meaningful way to get back under administrative capacity by getting rid of the planets that you involuntarily took in a peace deal that ended a war you started just because you wanted to make some space between you and the genocidal maniacs that were knocking at your door this is just one example of many of times when the extremely unfortunate mechanical features of stellaris have ruined games for me the game isn t buggy at least not too buggy but that doesn t mean that it isn t devoid of mechanical issues
