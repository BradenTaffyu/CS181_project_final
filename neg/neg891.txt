2016 this is a mixed review i both recommended it and do not recommend it as others have stated it doesn t feel like a bethseda game at all due to being strongarmed into the heavily prewritten narrative of your character it s hard enough to roleplay with the heavy storyline but any attempt to forget about it and do your own thing is completely negated by the forced voice acting of your character the previous games didn t have voice acting for a reason bethseda games aren t mass effect i don t like mass effect for a reason the ui is completely bafflingly terrible i don t know how they went backwards from their moderate improvements in skyrim but hoping a mod will fix it i m sure the beth devs are hoping for that too other than those two major gripes i like it a lot it s a visually stunningly gorgeous game and the combat is a lot more enjoyable however the game feels largely devoid of content especially with settlements so i would not recommend this game only played as vanilla however there are systems in place code base that wasn t in previous beth games that makes the prospect of modding exciting like equippable armor on nonhuman characters dogmeat etc the whole building and farming thing to begin with despite how boring it is in vanilla if the basic codebase wasn t in there to begin with it would be nearly impossible to mod it in ourselves so a good game by itself no depressingly not a good game in theory with the modding community hell yes and as much as i m excited about mods the fact that bethseda got really lazy due to their expecations of modders filling in the blanks is a bit sad yes they contributed more codebase for us to play with but i just wish they also focused on the vanilla experiance more but perhaps i m asking too much buy for mods if you don t use mods then there isn t much replayable value sorry
