2020 unfortunately as it happened with civilization v as soon as it automatically updated my friends and i were unable to play since some had mac some have windows if this keeps happening it is not worth paying so much money for a game that cannot function between different platforms until these issues are fixes i am not recommending this game if your partner has a different computer system otherwise this has been one of my favorite games
