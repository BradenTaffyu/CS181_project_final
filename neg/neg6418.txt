2021 so let me preface this with the fact that i have owned every forza title since the original forza was released on the original xbox this will likely be my last forza title ever purchased for a major title game by a major studio to have this many release issues is just straight embarrassing the game is virtually unplayable in online mode constant disconnects and server side issues oh whats that youve racked up a 100k skill score random server interrupt that makes your car act like it hit a wall and lose all your skill points the game does funny things in solo mode too theres a free house with the vip pack you buy it access it log out and when you log back in you no longer own it but when you go back it says free with vip so you click it again and it tells you that you already own it but you can not access it sometimes when you log back in youre in a different car than you were when you logged out usually back in whatever car you started with but the worst part of it is through all the hype over new this and new that this game feel looks and plays exactly like fh4 i mean seriously races are named the same and have the same general layout many of the barn finds are the same as they were in fh4 in fact some of the cars from fh4 have less customizable options in fh5 than they did in fh4 but oooohhh here put a 10 speed transmission and paint the brake calipers apparently that quantifies as unforeseen levels of customization the next gen graphics are good assuming you have something powerful enough to display that high of detail otherwise it looks the same and in typical horizon fashion you start off with several million dollars worth of cars and have no real challenge as whether your racing online against other players or solo against drivatars of those players horizon has never been about finding the best line and winning the race through skill its about never lifting off the throttle and using the other cars as bumper guards to get to the end and win theres so much more that this game lacks in but if youve read this far youve likely read enough i will keep playing mostly because i wasted 100 on this game but until the devs either fix a ton of stuff or this game goes to 70 off dont buy it
