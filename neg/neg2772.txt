2016 i played this game quite a bit by now 50 hours current patch is 1 2 asimov accessible i had a much easier time learning this game rather than when i tried hoi eu4 without success great initial impact and early game cool research technologies albeit the choices are rng which is sometimes irritating and exploration with science vessels great soundtrack my most favourite thing about the game i listen to it almost daily mod support average aesthethics nothing special here the game looks fine for what it is but not outstandingly so unbalanced weapon types i can t find a reason to use ballistic weapons they do only a tiny extra bit of dps than lasers which provide huge armor penetration bonuses instead missiles are hard countered by defense points lack of mid endgame content aside a few events at late game there s not much going on and it quickly turns into a grind eventually most technologies get researched exploration is pretty much done and there s little to do zero tactical decisions during ship battles you can t give orders for say focus certain enemy ships or engage in particular manoeuvers ai is just retarded consistently irrational behaviour from ai throughout the whole game a few examples 1 getting randomly kicked from alliances federations for no apparent reason even when you re saving your allies asses 2 someone refused a trade deal where i was simply giving away some extra resources for nothing in return 3 sector ai is absolutely terrible even with plenty of resources 10k minerals 5k energy it fails to completely upgrade spaceports even leaving some planets with just a lvl 1 which forces the player to do it manually same goes for spaceport modules performance the game seems to mostly utilise 1 2 cores mid late game can become quite sluggish with a 4690k r9 290 16gb ssd i was often dipping in 20s 30s using max time speed ui is a mess plenty of things in the ui could be improved on top of my head upgrading individual land armies has to be done 1 by 1 and is atrocious quick upgrading spaceports adding modules from the planet list tab is not allowed also the ship designer could use some love copy pasting designs to quickly make small variants shortcuts to upgrade downgrade a piece of equipment refineries boosters 100 personal opinion but i hate the way spaceport refinery modules work they provide great bonuses to the ships built in spaceports where such modules are built provided you own the strategic resources necessary to build them the bonuses are huge like 50 armor 10 damage but existing ships built before the modules were added cannot be upgraded that means that you re often delaying construction of ships if you know you can get a refinery in the near future and also avoiding building ships in other spaceports where such modules cannot be built for lack of resources conclusion a game with a good first impression and potential but plagued with plenty of issues regarding ai ui balance
