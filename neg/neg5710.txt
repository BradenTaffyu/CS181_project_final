2018 politics aside this game utterly failed to live up to its name there s no apology that will ever suffice for the botched launch and the pre release sales there were predicated almost entirely on falsities peddled by ca unambitious garbage complete uncompelling in every regard abysmal music lifeless troops and voice production jaggedy uncanny collision mechanics streamlined campaign etc literally could go on forever the best part the way the game is coded precludes modders from ever changing the most egregious of the fundamental flaws ca are beyond disgusting reprehensible sell outs who lie and abuse their fanbase and put no love into the games they make i hope to god another company takes up the real time historical battle reigns and picks up where ca left off with shogun i couldn t recommend this game any less
