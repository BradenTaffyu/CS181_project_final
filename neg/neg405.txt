2023 originally posted by kempli unfortunately i can t and i won t in good conscience recommend this game however despite my thumbs down certain things in it can make you giddy fallout 76 is pretty much an exact copy of fallout 4 with identical bugs and flaws most of the algorithms are also the same which is undeniably the reason why the game has suffered from all sorts of issues throughout its lifetime for the most part the game is unable to follow everything that is happening for instance when multiple players are stepbrother i m stuck ing the heck out of a strong enemy the game will simply throw in the towel content is scarce since the developers are only focused on making more capital with microtransactions resource management is a kick in the groin without the fallout f ck you first subscription and the game has more bugs than underneath that cool rock you picked up as a kid if i could summarize the game in one sentence i d say fallout 76 is a precipice of lost potential if you ve enjoyed fallout in the past i can guarantee you ll enjoy fallout 76 to an extent as well bring in your friends though because getting depressed is funnier and less dangerous en masse hopefully none of the developers will ever read this and voodoo the sh t out of me i promise i ll keep playing o mighty leather jacketed todd it just works howard p s don t look at my playtime please as it doesn t reflect this review after receiving constructive and grammatically sound feedback while being told to kill myself several times in a very traditional steam community fashion i decided to make some changes to the review to better relay my message with an added tl dr at the beginning and a heartfelt letter at the end i retained the original review above here s a convenient tl dr for all the quasimodos who can t read beyond the opening paragraph most of the added content is just cosmetic fallout 1st is the subscription that proves the developers can t sell you the solution without creating the problem first and the bugs they re still there giving you that all too familiar sense of d j vu some people argue that i shouldn t criticize a game i ve dedicated over 400 hours to claiming that it s particularly unacceptable to continue playing after giving it a negative rating i hear you but i m too invested to stop for those who don t know this suboptimal phenomenon is called the sunk cost fallacy imagine paying 15 cabbages per month just for your character to be able to carry all their sh t i love the fallout universe yet i still find it difficult given my experience to genuinely endorse fallout 76 i outright refuse to recommend it because of its current state its progress over the years its history of shortcomings and its consistency to fail to meet expectations although despite my disappointment my desire to love the game remains admittedly it has taken certain steps forward it has seen progress true however this said progress which certain well mannered and articulate individuals in the comments kept referring to should ve been in place when bethesda decided to release the game moreover the game s lack of significant progress over the years raises questions especially when considering its multiple years of candidacy for the labor of love award in the steam awards ironically it begs the question of who deemed it suitable to vie for an award intended for games whose developers nurture and care for them rather than games primarily focused on milking money from the player base i never thought i d need to explain why i wrote this review to justify its existence don t force me to go all philosophical on your asses consider this review as a warning i ve become addicted to this game all thanks to the sunk cost fallacy my advice save your time and money and if you still decide to dive in remember that fallout 76 is built on broken promises predatory monetization and recycled content as for my heartfelt letter for all you care bears and happy little accidents out there once fallout 76 starts seeing a consistent stream of actual content that doesn t add to the existing grind and if todd howard sends me a kick ass leather jacket personally signed by him i m willing to consider changing the vertical direction of my pollex
