2019 amazing game but have to give it a fiercely negative review as it continuously crashes to desktop is nothing wrong with my pc all other games work fine and many many other people are having the same issue don t waste your time on this product or anything from bethesda for that matter in order to get the unofficial community bugfix you have to download it through bethesda um what and additionally must buy all 6 dlcs to use the bugfix patch basically game is a sham once you buy it you have to spend more normal bethesda scamming if you dig around the net you can find the older version of the unofficial bug fix which might fix the random ctd so many people are having right now that is not something i expect to have to do on a 30 game shame on bethesda yet again
