2023 tldr if you do not want to be left stranded in open water with no sight of land by a company that doesn t care about you and only your wallet and only cares for their self interests on how the game should be balanced do not play this game if i had to describe wargaming in the case of world of warships with one word right now that word would be greed anyone who has played free to play games knows that its part of the function of the game to promote ways of spending money as the company needs money from paying players to keep the game running fair enough under most circumstances looking at you war thunder however with wargaming and in particular world of warships as of late the line between charging enough for maintaining a game and making some profit versus attempting to squeeze every penny out of their players wallets through all sorts of different ways it has become obvious which side they stand on the side of making money at the detriment of the game and its players in the last two or so years this game has become a shadow of its former self once upon a time the game would give free collaboration ships commanders and other goodies out in troves at the time of this review the azur lane collab is in full swing the 5th time they have done it but it is the most paywall heavy edition of any previous iterations of the collab they removed the old system of obtaining the commanders from containers that gave you the new content before seeing any duplicates for about 10 usd each to now needing to open thirty two 32 to get pity or guarantee something new at 5 usd for one crate this is just one example however as about a year ago the game introduced a new battle pass system which replaced the daily missions making it so you would have to pay the equivalent of 25 usd for access to the full rewards which were available for free previously and playing daily since its introduction the battle pass has only gotten worse rewards and less bonuses with each season as time went on in its first form one could receive a premium ship for completing the paid pass along with some discounts to in game purchases like equipment or bonuses to accumulation of free grind able in game currencies now however you pay to unlock the pass only for the final rewards to be an early access tech tree ship i will get to this in a moment or the equivalent in tokens exchangeable in the in game armoury in game shop for in game currencies and without the aforementioned bonuses which were sneakily removed over the course of a few seasons however the reason why early access is an issue in my opinion is due to the game selling you an otherwise free ship content under the guise of it being not fully released yet and therefore increasing the fomo fear of missing out by not acquiring it early my final gripe with the game is less so about the monetisation that is still a big issue but in the balance choices made by the development team when making new content anyone who currently plays the game knows about them the addition of aircraft carriers and more so submarines while aircraft carriers cvs were never promised to be left out and are unfortunately still quite broken in terms of gameplay many years ago wargaming promised to never add submarines to the game as it would not fit the gameplay and would be too hard to implement they have since gone back on this statement and have added them anyway and making them completely unfair and unbalanced in the process imagine playing a game where you could not dodge an enemy s attacks and could not see said attacks until they were within spitting distance of you well that is submarines in wows many players have shown and given their opinions on them and the general consensus is that these things are hated by the community rightfully so as they break the balance of the game even worse than cvs have done the dev team bent over backwards to add subs to the current version of the game unfinished rushed unbalanced they redid many maps and did not make any new ones for years because they put all their eggs into one basket all to the detriment of the game as a result i have seen many friends and other players leaving the game like never seen before no one wants to play a game where you can t fight the enemy with 0 chance of counterplay there is many more things wrong with this game and its dev team and the company that runs it but i feel like if i make this review any longer my fingers will not only fall off but i will get second hand anger issues even just thinking about this game in the end it comes down to the player to make a choice to play or not i vote to not for the reasons listed above and for many many more the numbers say it all really i implore anyone reading this review to look at the not only the steam player numbers of the past year but that of the general servers and take note that the game is slowly bleeding player its count since the introduction of most of these changes
