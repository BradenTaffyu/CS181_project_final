2020 i honestly can t recommend this game combat the skill system has some depth to it but it s mostly irrelevant due to how strong an influence character level is if an enemy is 2 levels above you it s a tough fight if an enemy is 2 levels below you then it s trivial that leaves the rest of the game which is mostly sub par loot equipment equipment is leveled as well so it has the same flaws as enemy scaling there s several tiers of equipment quality but the base stats go up so much from level that a legendary at level 12 will have worse base stats than a common item at level 13 this means loot becomes outdated very quickly in addition loot is almost entirely randomized enemies rarely drop equipment they don t really have worn items but just scale their stats directly from level instead of dropping what they were wearing they tend to drop some gold and either a few consumable items like scrolls arrows or potions or materials generally every encounter has one or two leader enemies that drop unidentified equipment or occasionally a unique item unique items also eventually become inferior due to level scaling exploration i would rate this pretty highly if it weren t for the level system and randomized loot yes there are a lot of side quests and reward chests that you can find but the side quests are basically mandatory for exp and the reward chests contain junk half the time music the music is good quality but gets reused too much and wears thin most notably the default combat music is annoying i advise you change the origin instrument away from flute if you play this game plot the plot is a miserable grimdark slog which you have basically no control over there is almost no meaningful positive impact you can have on the world until the very end of the game since almost everything bad that happens happens before you can do anything about it get used to people dying offscreen or onscreen during a cutscene you will regularly come across horrible massacres from monsters or genocide driven slaughter 80 of npcs with any lengthy dialogue are either criminals racists murderers or will be murdered at some point you will occasionally be able to save people but they usually die later anyway the sidequests are either straightforward or involve dialogue choices with unexpected confusing frustrating results character arcs origin stories are rollercoasters with each event in the arc containing some massive revelation or emotional moment and basically nothing in between since characters have no comment on most of the quests you undertake and depending on what characters you pick their character development happens seemingly arbitrarily this tends to feel a bit forced in many cases you also have to basically consciously decide to prevent them from falling in love with you due to how easy it is to max out their attitude other the persuasion system is most notably complete trash it s not a simple check against your persuasion stat every option also involves one of your main stats what the game doesn t tell you is that those stats are compared against the npc s stats so an intelligence based check might be easy against one npc and difficult against another in addition to that the wording of the persuasion check matters some choices are traps which produce a negative outcome rather than a positive one the game doesn t tell you about that either then there are times where none of the persuasion options do anything at all despite showing a success or failure message the graphics are good i guess the voice acting is the best feature of this game every line of npc dialogue is voice acted and it s high quality voice acting to boot sadly even this has a drawback some npcs have idle chatter and the chatter repeats too frequently the main shopping area in act 2 has an npc that goes around talking to all the merchants saying the same lines over and over and over while you re trading
