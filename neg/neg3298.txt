2018 i used to love every paradox game and then they went public changed their dlc policy and clearly overextended themselves a paradox game in 2018 is no longer complete at launch at launch the game is in early access once two or three 20 dlcs are released you can consider it in alpha after 5 or 6 20 dlc beta once you re paying around 180 for a game and all of it s dlc then it is complete maybe 3 years after launch you may as well wait for this game and all of its dlc to get released and then go on sale features that should be included in the base game are locked behind dlc dlc packs with limited content are still sold at 20 there are no more sales until years after release it s a joke and paradox is basically milking all the customer loyalty they ve developed sad
