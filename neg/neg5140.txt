2016 a few words if you play the game too little no one takes your review seriously if you play it for too long no one believes you if you are not recommending it citing how can you play for that long etc it is simply not possible to do it just right on to the main event would i recommend this to anyone no i would not and this is why game has beeen out 4 months and is already clocking in at 95 euros and rising i think the ca dlc madness has reached new heights despite of this ca still refuses to let the 8th edition rosters this game is based on be fairly complete across the factions arguing that it costs too much to put the work in this is especially the case with the beastmen dlc i do not mind the eye watering ultra money grabbing high prices if it is reflected in game value here it is most certainly not do not even get me started at the blood dlc in a game wich is about war or the terrible execution of the graphics in it the massive amount of things i have to say about this can be found in my post here not enough text allowed here
