early access review i have a love hate relationship with this game i really loved it when i started playing a few years ago but the release of alpha 21 really killed it for me i can t think of 1 way that that update made the game better it made it exponentially worse in my opinion can t collect water i thought it was an oversight at first wrong it s just a way for them to force you to go looting for water instead of actually setting up a base near a water supply now your base location means nothing because you are still forced to go loot something as basic as water the learn by reading books mechanic is horrible whereas you used to just put skill points into cooking find the recipe for what you re making baam you can cook the dish not anymore even if you have you re cooking skills at the top level if you haven t looted a certain amount of cook books you can t even boil water why would anyone think this was an acceptable part of the game to change
