2021 few things you need to know going in don t bother qualify towards the top because more often than not you will be spun out t1 driver etiquette is so hit and miss sometimes you get great races and intense battles others you press someone to force a mistake and instead of a clean recovery they will force their way onto the track and more than likely boot you off so pass at your own risk if you punt someone off the track you should be instantly black flagged but you are not so there is no real penalty for driving like an a safety rating is not strict enough more often than not after a race i wonder why i even pay for this prime example of a race qualified in first with a 5 gap to second off the line is clean no one gets a break away t1 fifth place dives the corner with no brakes sending me into the wall fight back from last to fourth tight behind 3rd for 2 laps applied pressure hoping for a mistake he makes a mistake taking him off track instead of recovering he tries to rejoin by flooring it over a sausage roll to slam into my corner panel spinning me back into a wall going into the last lap by the time i recovered i was badly damaged and back in last place so glad i pay 100 bucks a year plus 100 s on cars and tracks
