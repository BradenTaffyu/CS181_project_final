2023 i ve waited for this game for so many years and then sunk over 500 hrs in it 200 on the beta version and looking back at all the time spent i realised i enjoyed very little of my time played this game is only good and accepted because it is the only game that offers this kind of experience no matter how broken poorly designed and generally frustrating that experience may be the vast majority of the playtime in this game is spent trying to exploit or circumvent poorly implemented and poorly designed mechanics the game actively tries to stop you from having any fun battles the battle ai is just sad it will either run to the edge of the map if you overpower it or it will just rush you in an uncoordinated manner when it thinks it has an advantage no tactics no skill no challenge overworld despite being told from day one that kingdoms are completely unbalanced nothing meaningful has ever been done to address that the khuzaits and aserai will just roll across the map if left unattended map ai is better than battle ai at least but there is some anti player bias clan this is one aspect i do enjoy it s decently enjoyable to grow your clan have members be born companions lost in battle assemble caravans assign governors and other parties economy probably the most poorly designed aspect of the game the devs actively want to prevent you from having any passive income as of the last patch they completely destroyed workshops cities towns castles and workshops provide no money while garrisons cost huge amounts you are actively punished for having many cities and high quality troops you re left with roaming the land selling blacksmith weapons and other loot for your warchest overall at the end of the day this game is just unfun game mechanics actively work against you and despite thousand of comments and years of feedback devs are refusing to implement common sense changes to make the game the fun sandbox we ve always wanted mod scene is basically dead as the game is unstable and any small update breaks all mods after waiting almost 10 years for this game i now have little hope this game will ever get meaningfully better
