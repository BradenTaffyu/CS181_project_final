shocked and saddened that the game was released in this poor a state i take no pleasure in saying it as i was note the tense a loyal co customer but releasing paid dlc when the game s known sometimes game breaking bugs still haven t been addressed in the several months since release is inexcusable update august 2024 the release of the economy 2 0 detailer patch fixed a lot of issues and is definitely a step in the right direction i will revise my review to thumbs up if co continues to right the ship there are still major bugs including the homeless bug which can be helped with a mod but is a glaring problem in the base game
