look i want to say i recommend this game i really do a few years ago i definitely would have but today i d say save your money i m glad i bought it when i did early on into it s development i put 219 hours onto this game easily over the course of a few years but i would never pay that much money for a game like this it s not even graphically interesting in this day and age it looks like a ps3 game at best that s not to say it s not an interesting game it has many decent concepts but it doesn t scream 45 bucks and it never will i understand the need to make money but 45 bucks is comical if you re still reading and still want it get it but you d be better off waiting for it to be on sale this game has been on sale so many times just wait a bit get it when it s on sale in two weeks due to no one buying the game at this insane price point for the value it was when i purchased it 20 bucks made sense 11 years of development doesn t justify overcharging your new customers especially since it s still pretty much the same game just extra rides and designs on the buildings which don t scream premium
