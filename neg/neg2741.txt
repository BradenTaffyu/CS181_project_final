2016 currently the game is rather threadbare without nothing to do after your empire establishes itself other than warfare which if you are playing space nazies is ok if you are playing a balanced to peaceful empire boredom sets in real quick if stellaris was as feature rich as eu ck then it would be an amazing game but it really does one thing warfare and it does that rather poorly quite why paradox released such a shallow game i have no idea
