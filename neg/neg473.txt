2020 after patch 22 the game is unplayable for regular players you are now required to use specific build to be able to play f76 i m a rather casual player and i like to set up my character to have fun while playing so i was using single shot rifles and revolvers shotgun for close quarters figting because of update 22 bethesda made revolvers and rifles completly obsolete due to the next to nothing damage output i had to switch to lmg and 10mm automatic gun to be able to hold my ground against trash enemies on starting locations regardless of that change in my build i m still unable to repair my armor because i can t farm mats without loosing all my ammunition i was so exited for season 2 and now the game is ruined for me
