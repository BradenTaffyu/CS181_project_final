2018 i know the downvote is controversial and that s on purpose so people who want to know the bad aspects of the game can find this review and make their own decision positives aspects have been covered to death already the bad there s no main story to speak of what you have is the nice little cutscenes triggered by gaining hearts with people the community center arc with two possible paths and a few secrets to uncover here and there i honestly was expecting more exciting reveals some plot twists or a satisfying overall conclusion it feels like the game peters out in the end with nothing to do but grind massive amounts of currency to buy the end game items some of which introduce abilities which you won t really need because you ll have done everything by the time you get said abilities this game can actually be really stressful for a bucolic farming sim days are short actions take energy which you ll be short on in the beginning and watering your garden caring for your animals and traveling around the place take a long time you ll gradually unlock ways to alleviate all of those things but this will be a reality for at least your first in game year then you have a lot of time sensitive things to manage plants that grow slowly that must be planted early in the season timed fetch quests birthdays of npcs which you shouldn t miss if you want to progress festivals you must get to by a specific time shops with limited opening hours trying to manage your schedule can be harder than real life of course some challenge is good and in this case it leaves you a lot of room to become good at optimizing this chaos but i ve would ve appreciated the game to remove the time pressure for some things like planning out how i lay out my farm or decorate my house time pauses when you re placing new farm buildings at the carpenters why isn t there a mode where you can pause the game and look around your farm imprecise and frustrating controls on controller even on console versions are clearly an afterthought you ll constantly miss the mark when watering plants and you have to go fast as days are short some menu elements can t be reached or take way too many button presses to reach cycling through your crafting items will skip some early in the game until you unlock more stuff so you ll be forced to reach for the mouse or use the steam controller s mouse emulation can t play with xbox360 controller alone you also can t name yourself or your animals without reaching for the keyboard the slingshot you get at some point is literally unusable with a controller gift giving as the only mechanic to advance friendship with people besides the rare dialog which i think gives you a heart if you answer correctly feels awkward i m ok with courting the opposite sex being done the old fashioned way but just hanging out with people you just want to be friends with should get you somewhere irl i don t have to offer buckloads of fruit to my work colleagues for them to start appreciating me after some time lunching together if you max out relationships with everyone that s single the game will simply assume you re bisexual and you ll have romantic scenes with everyone i m not talking kissing here that s reserved to official dating but rather a certain amout of sexual tension this feels bad from a gameplay point of view why would you have to refrain from maxing out relationships don t you want to be the best friends possible even if no romantic interest and means the overwhelming majority of heterosexual and gay players will be forced into flirty dialogue they were not interested in if you want to avoid that you have to keep your relationship with bachelors you don t want to romance below 6 hearts after that it starts getting awkward there are mods that turn all guys into romanceable girls or vice versa to fix that problem but if you want to have best buddies instead of turning the town into a harem no luck my friend you have to relinquish your tools for a day to upgrade them which for the watering can is very hard to plan as it sets the growth of your plants back unless you get a rainy day and the weather forecasts are inacurrate game forces you to add a nursery to your house before adding a wine cellar even if you are interested in eventually pursuing the marriage and kids options having that empty kids room with a crib and beds around really feels stupid to place new farm buildings you have to run all the way over to the carpenter at that point you can pick a spot to place buildings but there has to be an area large enough for them that s completely empty even a single tile with the tiniest tree seedling patch of grass or even tilled soil will block placement forcing you to go back to fix this without any preview of the size of the building you want to place of course by the time you get back the carpenter will be closed forcing you to come back next business day who the hell thought this out will you be forced to wonder if you re sensitive to realism the world will feel like a hodge podge to you people have cars electricity and tvs yet you use manual tools and not a tractor for farming but you use speed gro as fertilizer and not manure what there s a modern corporation yet caves are filled with fantasy monsters and there s a wizard in town the whole thing doesn t feel very well woven together with citizens only acknowledging the existence of monsters in game hint dialogue there are long stretches where you just grind to get more resources with not much to break the monotony except fetch quests this is aggravated by bad controller controls mentioned earlier the game does a bad job of making you aware of essential mechanics while overemphasizing unimportant stuff for instance when you have a coop you have to manually feed your animals by taking hay out of the feeder and placing it on a bench very easy to miss you d thought the local rancher would give you a hint of why your animals are grumpy and thin on the other hand when a train comes through the valley you get a text notification in addition to the sound as if it was very important but the train barely serves any purpose besides dropping some meager resources it s not worth the time spent rushing there the goodbeautiful music interesting world with layers of gameplay and secrets progressively unlocking the town feels somewhat alive with regular festivals each character has quite a bit of dialogue if you invest gifts in them the feeling of restarting your life from scratch and earning every cent farming ranching and harvesting is satisfying you can read the other reviews the game seems pretty moddable but the modding scene still seems in its infancy with in depth gameplay modifications being unpolished ex mod to invert the controls for the slingshot sounds nice but your character is always going to face backwards while firing definitely not at skyrim or minecraft levels yet the game is worth experiencing but it can be extremely frustrating and i don t think it deserves the perfect scores it s been getting
