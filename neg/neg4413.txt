2022 it pains me to give a negative review to civilization vi it s also at odds with the fact that i ve played over 400 hours but the game is simply not good enough to deserve a good grade although it s quite addictive here are the main issues the first enormous one is that the game constantly crashes it s incredible that paying so much money for this game we re not even getting the bare minimum a functionning game the second even with new gen pcs the game is extremely slow when playing on larger than standard maps that s incredible to me in civ iv i only played in immense map modes impossible to do so here the third middle to late game is very boring and one needs to really be into optimizing to find some fun after medieval times are passed and borders kind of settle down if you go for an expansion game it does not get boring in middle to late game but it does get painful having to deal with many many cities the fifth diplomacy is a really really poor experience in this game it lacks depths it s repetitive every game kind of feels the same in that regard one of the reasons why the game is so poor in the middle and late games is that there are no events so the game completely lacks interactiveness choosing a religion is just about the bonuses so is choosing a political system it does not change much to what will happen to your civ in the long run it plays into the repetitiveness of the game put simply the game lacks lore dramatically the difference between democracy and fascism are just different bonuses for all these reasons i can t recommend buying the game unless you re a historical civ fan but even being one you will be disappointed
