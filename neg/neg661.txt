2022 i played this game for about 50 hours yes it says 64 but the game was idle couple of times and yet the negative review well to be honest it s not that bad it s actually one of the best deckbuilder games on the market but after i finally gave up with this title i have started to look at it from the perspective that ultimately makes me go against the herd and leave negative review here s why let me start with the fact that this games proves that good mechanics are more important than stunning visuals do you hear me ubisoft the game is pretty ugly and modest in the graphic department the backgrounds are static digital paintings on the level of some teenager from deviantart site who just started playing with his graphic tablet he got for christmas and feels urge to share his art with the world the enemies look like doodles i make on the piece of paper while talking with someone on the phone it s ugly let s be honest here and yet no one cares now i agree that the authors managed to create such a cool mechanics with the cards that allow for incredible number of very different playstyles and this is an amazing achievment not many similar games offer such abundance and it s all pretty original and uniqe each character has his own set and they are so different you almost get completetly new game with each one so why do i ultimately thing badly about this game because with all those positive remarks this game is a kind of an unrewarding chore that you get addicted to with each run you slowly develop new and better strategies ideas for new approach to already known cards to find that winning set yet it all comes to certain level of randomness which comes with the roguelike character of the game so you have to play many many runs either hoping this time everything will turn out well for you or perhaps you ll at least get a new idea to modify your playstyle and improve the chances next time rinse and repeat it is remarkable how the balance between small rewards and almost constant failures makes you addicted to try again and again how the devs managed to find that perfect spot so you kind of stuck with very boring mechanical cycle of playing run after run feeling you re achiving something while actually doing pretty boring stuff and not progressing at all or not too much and then when you finally reach what you think is the end of the game it turns out there is last ulitmate challenge that is so incredibly difficult to achieve you realize your current strategies and ideas are like 10 of what you have to achieve to finally beat the last boss if you re already hooked you stay here for long stuck in the spire for ages to finally reach that last goal doing the same thing again and again cought in the trap like an addict who already lost the fun using the drug but feels the need to use it gain don t believe me check the positive reviews there are people who have hundrets even thousands hours recorded on this game and apart from the animation after beating that last boss they ve seen pretty much all i ve already seen in this game so no fellow gamer i do not recommend this game to you go play something else something that has the beginning the middle and the end that you can start experience and then move to something else that will have meaningful impact on you so you can appreciate you ve played it but now you re ready for something else to move on like a good book or a movie otherwise one day you will take a look at your steam library realising that you ve lost 1500hrs of your life not really having that much fun in fact
