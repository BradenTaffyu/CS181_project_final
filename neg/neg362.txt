2021 look let me be blunt let s say you don t care about the bugs you should they are still pervasive to a disgusting degree even after years to fix some of them let s say you don t care about the questionable decisions made for the story and lore let s say you don t care about the many lies that were told before the game was released and after it came out by bethesda is the game fun kinda sorta if you have friends are willing to constantly look up things and are willing to fight the game tooth and nail to enjoy it because it isn t just the bugs that bring the game down every major design decision in this game seems to be motivated not by a thought of what would be fun but what reinforces a gameplay loop or gets people to visit the atom shop i have a friend who i enjoy playing this game with and they like the game far more than me want to know what they told me last time we played the game had become like an idle game for them just hopping on every day to do dailies and some event quests i don t know about you but that s the most depressing way i could ever hear a fallout game or almost any non idle game for that matter be described for those who want a concrete example of bad design decisions all vendors in the world share an instanced server independent currency pool at the start of every day all vendors in the world have 1400 caps available for you to sell to get when you buy items from vendors they do not get the full amount you pay them added to their pool end result oh you want a nice plan to modify your power armor s leg pieces well even with maxed perks and drugs to lower prices have fun either grinding out quests or spending 4 5 days selling stuff to be able to afford it and once you do you ll only be able to get a fraction of your money back i m likely to continue playing because i enjoy spending time with my friends and the base shooty shoot is fun enough but my relationship with this game is not a healthy one it is that of an abusive spouse who beats me yet i refuse to leave
