2017 when released even now this game already had bad performance even on powerful pc because of the aging game engine i don t mind that and now they added creation club which breaks f4se everytime they add new paid mods which are mostly worse than free mods 4 for one armour no thanks i would rather donate to a free mod creator they probably make much better ones you can see how much effort there is in cc armour and weapon how you immersively get them by killing random bandit just take a look at the unimmersive creation club satire mod on skyrim nexus most fitting description of cc so far i think bethesda is crippling the modding community right now which is why their game is so popular in the first place otherwise story isnt anything exciting feels quite straightforward it is still a fun game just made by greedy company
