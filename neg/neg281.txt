2023 at first i still wanted to recommend the game beside its flaws and terrible launch because i like the base game and was hopeful they would fix all my major gripes i had the heists have depth the gunplay is solid graphics are decent and the skills feel interesting enough however in the recent dev streams they have announced that they wouldn t fix or it would be low priority to fix the issues i had with the game and thus i can no longer recommend the game obviously the servers are there is no way around it by the time you re reading it they are hopefully fixed but they do not work most of the time right now but when you even get into a server you will usually not have teammates which is why is specifically i can not recommend this if you don t at least have 1 2 people you can regularly play with the stealth is very set up for at least 2 people one person masked up and one person in casing and the matchmaking is trash 50 of the time you get zero teammates and no teammates will join over any amount of time i stealthed a heist for 2 hours and the 4th slot never got filled the bots they give you are borderline useless especially if you are alone as they do not revive each other so you are just constantly babysitting these bots playing with bots feels like you are playing one difficulty up over what you are actually playing i can do with very hard with team mates no problem but you got 2 bots it s a struggle every time if you have played a payday game before this will come to a surprise to you but i would take the average pub player over a bot yes they are that bad i would take david gonzalles2008 level 10 over hoxton bot at least they will try to attempt to use cover or move bags bots don t i usually don t bother reviving bots a lot of the time on very hard because they have died in the middle of nowhere because they have no sniper resistance do not attempt to hide from them or shoot back it is commonplace that you will hear 2 sniper shots and the sound of a bot going down and i will lose more resources trying to rez them then i would gain from them being alive on overkill they might not be there they instantly go down without any value in the current meta shield bags are king and half the time they drop useless ammo so not even their resources make them worth being able to choose the resources would be nice or at least lower the ammo chance you also often only have the assault breaks to move bags and obviously they don t help with that you can put bags on them but because they don t keep up with you it s an annoying process a collect all bags you come across and move them to x area if you are next to it would be incredibly useful also you can do certain objectives during negotiation as long as you don t get to close or shoot bots don t care they will immediately open fire when they see the cops and trigger the assault they have not said that the overkill system is getting any changes or not so assume they won t but it just feels bad to use what should be a big oh tide turner is reduced to the sniper being an easy dozer killer and that s its only use the nade launcher does more damage to yourself then the enemy its detrimental to use the weapon it s it s a pain in the ass to get it then you have to walk out of the heists during an assault on some maps like the art gallery is so far out where it really does not feel like its worth it at all then you basically can t do anything with it while you carry it if there is a single guy in front of you you can either 1 take the damage and run past 2 waste your precious ammo you had to get out of your way to get it 3 throw it down for 2 seconds kill the guy and pick it up again for 3 seconds why its hold f to pick up is beyond me it should be press it makes the whole system feel so clunky regardless of being unable to literally anything else when you carry it my suggestion is that you can always take it out and put away by pressing the ovk weapon button hold to call and then it drops a special ammo bag instead that you pick up they said they are happy with the current progression system i have never seen a less satisfying progression system you only get exp through challenges and not heists themselves i recently spend 2ish hours stealthing and beating 99 boxes for the first time on overkill i got zero exp for it thanks a lot sure felt rewarding don t care if its bugged or not the challenges should add onto the progression does not replace it there should be a base exp gain based on heist difficulty and bags amount having to do stuff based on what an unorganized spread sheet tells me rather than what is most fun to me sucks that the game gets incredibly girindly does not help at all i m at level 60 and the exp gain feels terrible slow now and have 30 hours and it takes as much exp to get to 70 then to get to level 100 and exp gain only slows down as the challenges get grindier and rarer there is only 8 heists in the game you will either have to do some stupid grind strat or burn yourself out on 70 100 hours of the same 8 heists just to get all the weapons or skills the max level is 150 and unlocks more cosmetic stuff the customization system is also extremely basic and sad and what is there is locked behind such a comical level requirement that you must had played 100 hours before you can make a mask or gun that doesn t look like a nerf gun you can tell that they kept all the good things for the paid packs and the microtransactions they have already announced in a faq page other annoyances can t que for loud only stealth only both not that you can que at all even tho pd2 had this feature the main menu buy system is just kinda annoying to use little stuff like buying a weapon and it not putting into your inventory but keeping you in the store page who wants to buy more then one of the same weapons especially given that you only need one build of the gun with no concealment in this game can t ping codes and have to manually write them down rip console users glass cutting is def made for controller and feels annoying on pc no chat in preplanning no unready button why do i have to buy favors 10k is such a comically small amount if they cant charge in the preplanning screen because their system sucks they should be free the special favors just randomly appear and the game doesn t tell you how to get more also doesn t refund them when the server the bed or you quit so if you use your rare favor and you have to remake the lobby because the restart doesn t work youre just out of luck no votekick so if a player is trolling you just must reque and risk not getting into a new match in general i am extremely dissatisfied with their response to this terrible launch given that the only thing saving them from bankruptcy was the community buying overpriced dlc for pd2 and pd3 has the exact same model plus microtransactions soon i would assume they would do right to their community however i doubt they will they will try sweeping this disaster under the rug when somebody is uncertain and angry the last thing the community needs is an uncertain idk we might look into an offline mode because our always online was clearly a mistake not promises tho they want to have their cake and eat it too and this is not what the community needs right now it needs strong commitments to basic features offline mode lobbies reworks of the exp system and bots the game should have had at launch because overkill can t do always online to save their ass the game needed at least 3 6 more months in development and till they fix the above mentioned issues i cannot recommend it which is a shame because a lot of the game is fun
