this game just hit 1 0 and i m here to tell you that this game is definitely not a 1 0 release the devs can t seem to figure out what they want this game to be it was in early access for 10 years and most of the updates were feature creep ideas the devs had during development one of the things they really like to do is take mechanics that work and completely ruin them for some reason like how the merchants no longer sell tools or weapons and how they got rid of glass jars making getting water a chore the devs even said that this update is basically just a name change because they feel like they ve spent enough time to call this a completed game the fact that they re charging 45 for this now is actually insane because i paid 1 for it the game has flaws it s kind of fun but i can t recommend for full price especially not with how they change stuff on a whim buy it on steep discount
