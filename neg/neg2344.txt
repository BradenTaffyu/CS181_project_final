2023 i personally quite liked this game why am i giving it a negative review because i feel like it could ve done a lot better we ll start with the positives i really liked the art style it fits the game and it s easy on the eyes the raft building is solid it s resource hungry and grindy sure but you can end up with a really fun and practical nice looking raft and it feels good very fun co op aspects of the gameplay great with friends and now the negatives severe lack of qol features for an example there s no crafting from nearby storage although you can fix this with a mod extremely grindy and time consuming now i m lucky enough to not have a lot going on in my life right now and the grinding isn t as braindead as a lot of games but do not pick up this game expecting to speed through it your equipment frequently breaks you can t repair it and must craft new ones the shark will take chunks out of your raft which you must rebuild you can stop this by reinforcing the outer foundations but this costs a lot of metal and is grindy in itself gotta love having to grind to prevent other grinding food and water constantly weigh you down running the raft is quite a task you ll have to keep the crops watered growing and the gulls scared away from them you ve got to harvest resources from your nets periodically you ve got to keep your food cooking your purifiers purifying the shark with their teeth not sunk into your precious raft foundations etc progress is frustratingly slow at times now you can unlock things to prevent all this advanced scarecrows to keep seagulls off your crops permanently and sprinklers connected to your automatic purifiers for free water and automatic purifying all you ve got to do is replace the batteries every once in a while pipe fed engines and an automatic biofuel refiner to fill your tank as i said before reinforce the foundations to keep the shark off them get better versions of tools to make them more efficient and durable but almost all of these are locked behind story progress heck you don t even get the third tier of tools until you complete the storyline entirely an anchor that you don t have to drop manually and can instead operate from your engine controls locked behind completing the second to last story island meaning you ll only ever use it to dock at the last island electric grill to prevent grinding for planks just to eat also locked behind the third to last island this is the part of the game i hate the most it s grindy as all hell and the only way to make it less painful is to do more of the story and unlock better stuff good survival games have a story for those who want it in raft you ve got to do the story to progress in any way and that s the part i most dislike want a backpack upgrade it s in the final story island so have fun using that to carry the loot from the final boss back home the only conclusion i can draw from this is that the game expects you to keep playing after you complete the story but why would you at that point you re just improving your raft for the sake of improving your raft yeah you can make a titanium sword now but there s nothing new to kill with it maybe that s how some people like to play it but as for me i just lose all motivation to play on a save after completing the story leading me to most likely never craft these endgame tools it s such an odd design choice why can t all these upgrades and stuff be available before you do any of the story tl dr grind is enjoyable enough but the fact that the majority of the game is grind probably kills the game for a lot of people
