2019 this game is great great presentation very cool setting the cinematic experience in this game is awesome it s so great that it hides a lot of ugly things hiding underneath in this sea of thumb ups and praise for this overpriced game are a few reviews that truly point to the state of the game in this review i want to point out the biggest cons that make this tw inferior to previous titles starting with factions and their unique units going over to campaign ai and diplomacy andunit balance 1 factions feel like really bad copy paste apart from yellow turban you get perhaps some special units but they really don t feel that great since they are pretty much overpriced notice the pattern there for the minimal advantage they give over the standard units to sum it up i ve felt more diversity in previous tw games 2 ai and diplomacydiplomacy has been praised up and down during the pre release advertising and by streamers who got it 1 week early but i really didn t see much of an improvement there aside from the fact that you can see some points indicating the likelyhood of a deal and why they think it s good bad but from what i ve seen in my own campaigns is this to compensate for ai weakness the ai has better income and has better diplomacy rating with itself in the end it s ai vs you long story short ai ends up fielding much more armies with highest possible tier units while you need to balance your armies for power cost efficiency than you upgrades cities much faster than you and now try doing diplomacy with an ai that has these advantages or the vassalized factions 3 unit balancei m confused about unit balance in 3k i ve played romance and the normal mode in both modes most of the time i see cavalry charges that decimate entire lines of braced non spear infantry making non spear units pretty much obsolete in normal mode i ve seen a cavalry charge of my general into the back of already fighing spear units just to hear the message that my general died most fights my general s unit killed more than 500 units per fight i tried comparing unit statistics to figure out new strategies and stuff but i gave up i barely can tell units of the same class apart and while some units have great stats for some purposes they really don t do great on the field because their weaknesses kill their strengths long story short i end up using the same few setups for most armies even though it s annoying to find 3 generals who like each other seriously redeploying is one of the biggest money dump ingame sadest difficulty modifier
