2020 i m writing this after steel dawnwhat have you done with lore why did brotherhood even go to appalachia from lost hills because there was radio silence of people you never heard about sending people around country that would take months to get to apalachia and the brotherhood is still forming around this year when there was roger maxson no outsider was really welcome and brotherhood just stayed inside and didn t recruit really anyone and whenever they met outsider they mostly send him to suicide mission like in fallout 1 where they sent you to glow but hey radio signal don t know the people let s send my people there hopefully they won t die while traveling yeah that s a good ideabrotherhood talks all the time about being from new california the thing is new california republic still doesn t exist in this yearwhy the are brotherhood of steel talking about ad victoriam when this line was never said before fallout 4 rahmani represents the bethesda brotherhood of steel and knight shin represents the original brotherhood of steel i don t want to get much into spoilers but anyways everyone thinks hey rahmani is the good guy she is nice and shin is well no she is the traitor shin is doing elder s work but as bethesda shows it it s just oh hey he is a bad guy you should listen to her you know and i say off to that no matter the choice everyone will team up anywaysi hope this game isn t canon in terms of lore
