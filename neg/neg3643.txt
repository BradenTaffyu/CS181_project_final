2023 early access review i have no idea what fun pimps are doing with this game anymore alpha 21 makes changes that don t make any sense to me zombies spawning in front of me in buildings what s the point of sneak when they spawn on a trigger and come right for you anyways the bowling alley is the worst example of this the skulls over poi s why changing the skill system again can you pick a system and stick with it now it s more rng because i need multiple magazines to craft a workbench i m on days 13 already and still need 4 more magazines to make a cement mixer but cooking magazines are literally everywhere glass jars are gone why i can just set up 20 dew collectors so this change doesn t change anything fov is still max at 85 assets like cars and containers pop in a few feet from you now so you ll be riding a bike or jeep and run into them this really needs to change fun pimps need to start going in a direction and stick with it maybe an actual director to direct they spend so much time changing systems in every alpha release it s why the game has remained stagnant for so many years
