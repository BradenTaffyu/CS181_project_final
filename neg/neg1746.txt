2020 this game will break you i only have 90 hours on the steam version of wt but i have been playing this game since before ground forces came out before tanks were added and the game only had planes back then it was pretty good but as time went on gaijin decided to enter a competition with ea for most scummy developers and won the grinding is unbelievable you can forget about driving any of the cool tanks you recognize or flying any of the famous planes if you absolutely must have the cool vehicles then i hope you either have a lot of disposable income or you re willing to sacrifice a whole year of your life playing this game if you re like me you ll start out patiently grinding but eventually inevitably this game will break you they say certain games are designed to be literally addictive this is one of those games you will suddenly find yourself willing to spend money you don t even have in order to buy your way to the next level of aircraft or pay just to have that new tank you unlocked upgraded so it becomes actually useful you will become tempted to spend just another 5 bucks to make your pilot an ace or to make your tank crew well trained you will be tantalized with pretty war machines to crack open your wallet once more just so you can buy a premium vehicle that gaijin will end up nerfing or even deleting a couple months later the entire game is designed to tease you and make you give up your money there are shiny premium vehicles galore you can pay premium currency to skip past boring vehicles after unlocking a new vehicle it will barely be able to move or maneuver and will even be unable to repair broken parts but you can make all those problems go away with another 5 tired of boring one tone paint for your tank buy a snazzy new camouflage have you finally reached the cool high level vehicles oh no if they die in battle it costs you more money just to repair them than you make in that battle better spend another few bucks want to make your vehicle able to be used more than once per battle give gaijin some money and you can do that are you tired of only being able to have two decals on your vehicle money can fix that do you just want one badass plane or tank to use forever and you don t care about any other vehicles you can buy most high level vehicles for 40 or more the jokes and memes are true this game makes ea games look generous don t play it even if you are the most pure hearted anti microtransaction player who has locked all their money in an underground vault don t play it the game is thoroughly engineered at every level so that you have to spend money to make the game fun enough to keep playing i barely went into detail if you want to know the full pain read some of the other long reviews
