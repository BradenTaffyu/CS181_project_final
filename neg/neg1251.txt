2019 even the modding community cannot keep this game entertaining for me from countless bugs to just simply bad writing and gameplay this game isn t worth it bethesda has lost sight of its games in favor of the short term money gain some short pointers as to why i dislike this game the story is just awful the main story doesn t engage you what so ever and you feel no connection to the people you should care for the most the whole settlement system feels so disconnected from the rest of the game it s like the teams working on it had no contact with the teams working on the rest of the game play the side quests get boring fast some are entertaining but most of them are only sad paid mods really bethesda basically all of your games have been upheld and made playable by the countless hours modders put into fixing your bug ridden games and adding content or simply adding mechanics and fleshing out ideas you might ve put into them pretending to do it for the modding community whilst alienating them and grabbing for cash is just awful practice most of the dlc s are simple cash grabs and not worth the money they demand for it
