2020 early access review tldr combat is slow and takes less skill combat was downgraded to timing based like mordhau rather than reaction based like warband combat feels like slow motion and was dramatically downgraded from warband input feels spongey and delayed feinting downgraded nerfed thus high level combat is non existent unless you count playing conservative safe as high level blocking is very sluggish in mp removing whatever fun there was in being good at fighting 1vx or blocking 1vx for that matter because blocking is too slow for multiple enemies it just seems way too slow this was quite balanced in warband the same block reaction speed in warband results in block input not registering as quickly as reaction you have to hold much longer for blocks to register or at least that is how it feels like a sponge attack arcs and hitboxes are larger wider but blocking window seems smaller and way too slow hitboxes in general are completely different from warband some of the same angles that would hit in warband will result in a miss in bannerlord i e above swing is not aligned like warband or the hitbox is at a disadvantage compared to side swing landing damage seems to be concentrated on your sides or the starting points of swings when you pull back a weapon to swing rather than at the end of swings in front of you where all the force would be which does not make sense if their goal was to be more physics based attacking blocking seems less sensitive to player mouse input than warband and i switch between the two often the same mouse blocking movements in warband can block 1vx but in bannerlord you have no chance because it s so slow delayed and less sensitive to input again like a sponge skilled players are capped by mechanics limitations forcing heavier reliance on lower skill classes like shields and non inf animations in general feel very slow and are also seemingly delayed to player input sound affects are downgraded from warband quieter and less satisfying shields sound ok custom loadout is gone in mp if you want armor you will need to go with sword and shield or cav you cannot spawn as an archer or 2h with full armor warband class system is superior 2h 1h would 1 2 shot in warband while missiles would need multiple hits against armor bannerlord sees that dynamic reversed now missiles 1 2 shot and melee weapons often require greater than 2 shots for a kill armor is nearly useless the new class system punishes anyone that chooses to play at a disadvantage since all the 2h only classes have very little to no armor and missiles lances can 1 2 shot even players with full armor warband was balanced enough to reward skilled play and you would see 2h melee players with full armor surviving multiple arrows bolts unless they were headshots headshot hitboxes are huge for all missiles and hits for all missiles are easier because of hitboxes making it less rewarding to play ranged you cannot opt out of weapons you do not need such as javs or extra 1h slowing weapon switching from what you want to use why do all loadouts force multiple weapons missiles what if i only want to use 1h or 2h disconnect issues and very few servers that close at match end rather than move onto the next match plus no map voting or pings showing for servers no ability to hide servers that are not in my region no na siege server removed team wounding friendly fire thus no punishment for facehugging and swinging wildly rewarding brainless unskilled playstyle good players can simply get swamped spawns in mp are all over the place there needs to be fixed spawns for both teams you can no longer thread the needle thru teammates anymore telling me hitboxes are not as tight that they are bloated sensitivity maximum seems to be lower than warband s max sesitivity feels like normal sensitivity in warband although hitting weapons against walls object that would impede them did exist in warband this seems much more pronounced in bannerlord but why is this so constant crashing and problems with missing file privelages most of my complaints are mp combat related if you failed in warband you knew it was your own failure but if you fail in bannerlord it is most definitely because of limitations and weaknesses set by the game itself slow blocks delayed input no ff weapon armor class balance etc don t fix something that isn t broken warband bannerlord sp is not perfect but still great i hope tw considers improving overhauling bannerlord s combat system to at least be close to par with warband all they need to do is ask the community as many players still go back to warband mp
