2017 i like stellaris and that s why it pains me to not recommend it i ve long loved 4x strategy games and outside of their dlc policy i ve loved paradox strategy games there have been so many stories i ve made in stellaris hours upon hours of building galactic empires filled with inferior xeno slaves peaceful federations of scientific diplomats anything that came to me on a whim however the ai is absolute and i mean complete it might do attacking well against you and your systems but outside of that it is entirely braindead the situation is so bad i made this entire review after a ragequit a 200 year campaign as a martial empire at one point the largest blob on the block and the strongest outside of the fallen empires it is at this single point that the unbidden appear to make my day pretty bad they appear a few systems away from my borders in the heart of the only local empire near my size and strength i figure things might get bad and the fox empire will need some help understatement of the century i d like to say for the record that i tried to avoid endgame crises spoilers and did not know the unbidden trick my upcoming point on ai still stands the entire 3 4 of my empire the fox empire and several smaller empires around us are obliterated by wave upon wave of 60 90k death stacks at this point i have a single 50k stack and thats pushing the limits of my naval capacity i fight lose a protracted genocide of my people and my xeno slaves as they creep ever closer to my homeworld at this point i m thinking clearly this is either or some deus ex machina will save me during this right some fallen empire answers my prayers and awakens to fight off the horde sprawling across the galaxy they have a call to arms for an alliance to oppose the horde unified i immediately jump on board praying for safety the caveat i have to ban slavery across my empire at this point i m desperate and accept significantly cutting in to my already depleted resources and await for the help that does not come after calling for a unified alliance and attack against the monsters the awakened empire proceeds to do nothing but war against some two bit empire in the opposite direction for decades because they re mean or something i m one of only two empires that joins the alliance the awakened empire sits with their multiple 100 200k death stack fleets that could easily beat the unbidden sitting at their planets my newly slaveless economy is in shambles as i fight delaying actions with an ever weakening fleet as i desperately try to reinforce with every mineral i have redesign the fleet to take on the unbidden research any technology that might even the playing field including taking an ascension perk that increased my damage against them by 50 but nope too little too late my fleet was gone shambles the unbidden take the last of my core worlds as my last two colonies hastily set up next to the awakened empire s border get ready to be consumed any other empire could have pitched in and fought the obviously more important enemy instead they warred amongst themselves as the only thing standing between them and oblivion was consumed from the inside out but hey at least i got that 150 opinion mutual threat buff and constant energy credit trade offers for my strategic resources when i was capped edit it happened again one system away from my capital gg
