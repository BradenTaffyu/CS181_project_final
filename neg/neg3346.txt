2017 as someone who plays a lot of paradox games and holds them in quite high esteem i find myself not really liking hoi iv despite the pretty steep learning curve the game quickly becomes repetative and the warscore system is completely indecipherable nations only tangentally involved with your conflict can claim territory on the other side of the world because of how the game lumps all conflicts together larger wars and hours of progress can be obliterated pretty swiftly the ai is poor as well often sending large armies to starve freeze or dehydrate in the siberian wilderness or sahara desert the friendly ai is guilty of this as well so it s better to micromanage your army instead of giving it to the computer despite the huge number of nations they all play pretty similarly and games can turn into huge grinding slogs where no progress is made for hours and air power is usually an ancilliary element at best however hoi isn t awful and there is some fun to be had recreating the war or forging your own alternate histories but it is much shallower than advertised and paradox has taken to releasing fixes in paid dlc which is pretty low even for them if your really interested in the second world war then there are probably worse ways to spend your money but i d recommend stellaris or crusader kings 2 over hoi both are to me at least more repeatable and interesting games
