2018 i love this game i have easily over 1k hours put into it via launching it outside steam because updates broke all my mods over and over again while it was still under development however the publishers i cannot stand they have unfortunately decided that selling my information to unknown corporations is more important than community goodwill and as such i cannot recommend this game to anyone i d rather tell people to stay away from it until the developers can finally see that the community which made their game amazin is more important than selling all of our data for an ounce of profit even if they remove the new spyware it s in their eula still even after the red shell controversy i won t recommend this game the publisher has shown that the only thing they care about is profit above all else and i cannot in good conscience support a publisher that is so eager to sell my data to make a quick buck i m just grateful i purchased this game while it was still drm free and had a community first mindset so i don t feel that i ve wasted my money on such a garbage publisher
