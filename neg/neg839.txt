2018 average fps terrible rpgas a huge fan of fallout franchise and fallout world lore i will try my best to review this game and do not act as a fanboy hurr durr new vegas was better good things power armor big heavy mean looking deadly i love the new power armor t45 t51 t60 and legendary x 01 a lot to choose from become a walking tank and skull everything to death customize it how you want apply some nice looking paint attach a jetpack and attack your foes from the skies choice is yours unfortunately you have to collect scrap to fix it but i will talk about it later weapon customization game allows you to customize each weapon however you like build a sniper rifle with a suppresor and kill your enemies from the distance modify your baseball bat with the rocket engines and destroy those lowlife raiders maybe you want a homing rocket launcher do not worry you can get that in game junk is usefull you probably have picked up a useless item in skyrim which just took space in your inventory and then you had to throw it away or sell it in f4 those junk items matter because you get scrap materials from those which allows you to build your settlement improve your weapons repair your power armor etc graphics a major improvemnt compared to previous fallout and tes games world looks quite nice finally you can create a character who doesn t look like an inbred wth autism just solid armor system you can put additional pieces of armor on top of your clothing all of those pieces can have a different effect on them and somehow benefit your character building system build anything you want bars motels outposts farming fields and many more only limit is your imagination bethesda has introduced new building items in the dlcs a lot of items to choose from robot companions design your own death machine with automotron dlc and together murder everything that stands in your waycons world empty and boring a lot of locations to visit but most of them are just raiders mutans infestations most of the time you will be using fast travel to get as close as you can to the objective location simply because you won t find anything interesting on the way there survival mode fast travel is disabled so you are forced to walk in this over and over again only way to save a game is to sleep in a bed game likes to crash a lot so be ready to repeat a boring walk through the wasteland again companions one reporter with annoying voice irish drug addict ghoul drug addict maccready the returning character you could not kill in f3 didn t spend too much time with him becuase i shot him after i saw his name supermutant named strong i often called him because for some reason he always managed to get stuck somewhere doggo who is just there he will bark sometimes and make some odd noises mister another settlement needs your help who you are not allowed to kill and rape his corpse while screaming i don t give a about your settlements paladin danse aka tincan who was quite alright often hanged out with me so we kept on killing raiders mutants etc the swagboi valentine probably the best companion you can have in this game your robot companion codsworth charming british accent you can turn him into bloodthirsty machine and he will always be nice and polite overall 90 of available companions were either annoying boring or useless there were ssome new ompanions in the dlcs but i do not even remember their names main story i guessed who the main villain is after first 10mins into the game campaign is short with only 2 endings well there is an ending for each faction totally four but three of them result in the same quest but you do it with different npcs by your side dialog trash sarcastic option can be funny sometimes but most of the time you just spam skip button choices complete illusion of choice nothing you do matters being a hobo pick up everything then scrap and build your settlement what if i do not give a about building and i just wanna enjoy good quests i guess nothing for me to do here building system glitchy you can t place this thing here because some dirt is blocking this spot you have reached the maximum space for this settlement because our engine can t handle it enemy ai spam grenades until your game crash sole survivor is using the sniper rifle let s keep our distance guy has the most advanced power armor known to mankind i will rush him with pool stick quests radiant quests go there kill everything and do it again go there pick sth up and kill everything bonus and small spoiler in far harbor dlc you are forced to play a small minigame somekind of puzzle solving to progress in main far harbor story so after an hour of annoying puzzle solving i have completed the task but since i was playing on survival and time was passing normally while i was in the simulation my character got dehydrated starved so i died and guess what my save file brought me to the beginning of the puzzle great game design bethesdamama murphy 100 years old vegetable who is telling you what to do and how you should do it thank god you can kill herpreston garvey the most annoying character in the entire game constantly talks about settlements and gives you radiant quests that never stop enemies varied but most of them are just bullet sponges you just have to hold lmb a bit longers p e c i a l you can create godlike character doesn t matter what you pick up at the start if you survive long enough everything will be maxed outgame difficulty early game challenging mid game easy late game walk in the park i am talking about very hard dif which is arguably hardest in the gamedlc a lot of building dlcs and if you have no interest in building you are left with far harbor which is in my opinion the best dlc available for f4 nuka world which allows you to become a raider and automotron aka building machines of utter destruction which make the game even easierlast wordsi know it kinda turned into a rant how the game is bethesda has improved on many things compared to previous games mods save this game and i believe mods are the only reason why i kept playing this game i have skiped on a lot of things such as poor performance even on good machines paid mods stability issues bugs and many more fallout 76 is coming and i am quite worried about the future of this franchise we will see cheers
