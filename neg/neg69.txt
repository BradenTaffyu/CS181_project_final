early access review i enjoyed this game but i can t recommend it as of now it s been almost 13 years march 2011 since the development began and 10 years since it was first released on steam and it really doesn t feel like it people have been waiting for more than 2 years for the next build namely build 42 and it does not feel like it s gonna be released in the next week as we don t even have an eta no npcs build 43 i ll die of old age before i see it released no hunting imagine buying an early access game to support development only to discover that it s gonna be your kids who will enjoy the finished game if it ever gets finished the game allegedly generated 108 million dollars in 10 years that s 10 millions per year mind you it makes sense that they make it last as long as they can at the expense of players who have to rely on the modders to get a more acceptable game to play with i have had this game since like forever and it doesn t feel like any progress has been made it has but it s eminently negligible given the enormous time span and i feel scammed so no i cannot recommend buying this game until npcs and quests and things like that have been added to the game and it probably won t be until year 2027 or something
