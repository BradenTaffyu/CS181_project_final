2022 positive reviews for the usual reward in game massive pay to win obviously premium tanks over powered premium ammunition obviously over powered most of the time matched against tiers two levels above you if they have a premium tank and ammo you get one hit which is often the amount of abuse in the chat looks like it s full of children using their parents bank cards any aesthetics you can do to the tanks obviously costs loads of money too it s ok for a while but gets rather tedious and boring
