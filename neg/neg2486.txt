2020 tldr it s quite entertaining and worth a go for the right price but the obvious dlc trojan horse mars what is quite a short game with not a huge amount of depth this is another one of those games i really struggle to thumbs up or down but the fundamental reasons i voted down are twofold one is that the game interface despite me buying the base game has many options i can t use it lists five levels but you realise actually those last two don t exist three s a freeform mode with three options but then you realise that much of that is unavailable and that annoys me i bought a game sell dlc fine i am fine with that but don t put all these dead ends in the product i bought don t rub my nose in the content i don t own blending it with my game so i don t know what i do own it adds to annoyance and it s disrespectful and indeed a lot of the marketing of this game and the dlc makes it hard to properly understand what you are getting the other issue is you then realise you have effectively three proper campaign modes three that s it that s quite poor yes the freeform mode adds a bit more but it s rather lacking in a point and again you will end up finding so much content is locked three levels i passed and was dumped at the menu each time after a short admittedly lovely cut scene there s nothing stitching these missions together at all no consequences for all the world building there s no narrative that pulls it together the game itself is quite enjoyable it is a game where you have to learn what it wants and do it this game does not value ingenuity when the game says you need to get 7500k coal in two days well you aren t going to do that you need to start again and reevaluate your decisions and it is rather enjoyable going back re thinking learning to adapt normally i m a turtler normally i like freeform modes this game forced me to to think and adapt and act fast that s where the game works well but sadly when you peel back it s not that in depth you are forced to largely play the way the game wants you to you won t build a hospital proactively because you soon learn that if you wait for the game to ask you and then do it you ll get a bonus for doing so the tech tree is quite basic and is the same across all missions once you work out that formula there is a sense of you know it and can repeat it some of the tough decisions you have to make for example do you let sick people die in the cold don t really have a massive impact at the end of the day it d be great if you had a sense of decisions really having an impact like so many board games are legacy games now where is the legacy of what you do here the game doesn t really care it s not terrible by any means it s quite fun but only get it if the price is under the 10 mark and be prepared to hit lots of walls as the dlc monster locks you out of the game you bought
