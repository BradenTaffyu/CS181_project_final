2017 here is a story about my gameeuropa universalis iv used to be an amazing game it was just like the last one but lots of improivements sure it was missing some features but hey maybe they just took them out to make the game run smoother and streamline ok cool game is still great so i was loving the game after buying it and hey a dlc came out ok cool lets get it dev s made a great game i don t mind giving a little extra so they keep patching and making it better then another dlc came out ok sure then another came out ok sure then i also noticed a lot of these dlc packs were just features that used to be in the game should have been in the game to start with but now i ve noticed hey i spent the total cost of the game again on just some dlc s that change a few game mechanics around and fixed things so i stopped buying the dlc then i noticed one day i started playing and i can t build building or upgrade my provinces anymore that s right these free upgrades made my game completely worthless and unplayable unless i pay them more money for the next dlc then another and another and another and another no i won t pay 140 more just to be able to play the game i already own with some bug fixes and a few rules changed around so i turn my glowing review into a utter and complete thumbs down game is not worth 300 plus another 300 in 2 more years seriously this is terrible there will never be a new eu game because all we get is milked for more and more dlc thank you for destroying your own company paradox i am sad
