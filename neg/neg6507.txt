2016 a game that i went into expecting to hate and was pleasantly surprised dark souls 3 is fantastic but unfortunately at the moment i cannot recommend it because of the utterly broken anti cheat system cheaters are currently able to and quite easily so get innocent players permanently banned as well as forcibly modifying stats wiping inventories etc as a result the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn t want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result as time goes on cheaters doing this will get more and more common until the entire community dies off until fromsoft namco bandai does something to remedy the situation i cannot recommend this game especially not at full price
