2017 i have 674 hours logged in civilization 5 and what made that game great was the constant refinement provided by worthwhile dlc content the expansion and development of that game in comparison to this one is a complete joke if you were to pay the same ammount of money there are far less features in civilization 6 as compared to 5 i paid for the digital delux edition expecting the same product i recieved with civilization 5 which when paired with the dlc was a masterpiece in my humble opinion this is not the case with civilization 6 there are amazing features in this game like city development the districts system expanded cultures and a seemingly more expanisve end game i am also not opposed to the art style and felt it did not detract from the game in any meaningful way however in stark contrast the ai is absolutely apalling the diplomacy warmongering is game breaking many civs with military focus are insanely powerful when compared to civs with religion focus the lack of world congress and not to mention that the game is easy here is a guide on how to win at nearly any difficulty 1 culture religion and diplomacy and throw that right out the window 2 have ai declare war on you declare war on them 3 have your military chill in your cities with plenty of ranged units 4 slaughter the ai s army as it throws itself mindlessly against your walls 5 counter attack the now militarily inconsiquential ai with a mix of mele at the front backed up by a load of ranged units 6 profitwhat the is happening firaxis civilization 5 was amazing and it showed in your reviews of the game then beyond earth which many people choose to forget as a blemish worth overlooking in the series because it was reasonable to try new things and now civilization 6 some of the things you did with this game were amazing and many people love it but it s painfully obvious you spent far too much effort on developing very specific aspects of the game while completely neglecting core elements of what made running a civilization in previous games fun it pains me to see all of these new and wonderful ideas sit idle and grow stagnent while you release dlc that pales in comparison to your previos efforts instead of balancing that with further refining in summary i am not a satisfied customer i am so dissappointed by the product i have recieved thusfar and will most certainly not be pre ordering any civilization game ever again let alone this i have been served as digital delux this makes me so sad firaxis i have loved your series since first purchasing civilization 3 and have since pre ordered every one of your games plus any available dlc digital delux content in the civilization series i will no longer be doing this thank you so much for the good times i had and i am perfectly willing to change my opinion and this review of the game if it develops into something i am satisfied with but seriously fix the broken stuff add relevent content and stop giving me 1 or 2 civs every month i dont want more civs i want more fun rant
