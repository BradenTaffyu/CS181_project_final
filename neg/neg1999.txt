2022 in short do not play this game it is unrewarding unfun unfair and most of all not worth anyone s time just relax don t download it and keep watching other players play it on youtube twitch instead unless you have a premium account you will not progress through the game at a good place also trust me you will not get any premium account time for free no matter if you have been for a lot of time or you just logged in and are ready to get your welcoming bonus of a pos vehicle hat you will play on once and then forget it exists at the lowest ranks you will feel like it take a bit of work to get a new vehicle yet once you will start getting clsoer to first mbts and ifvs the game gets ungodly bad it can t even be called grindy anymore because you will literally be spending more sl than you can make with a good kd even if you win speaking of that even if you will be doing great helping your teammates and keep winning sometimes you will be loosing money yeah even if you win to be completely honest i do not care how much anyone will say repair cost punishing people even for winning just because they died to some atgm enduced cancer too many times is too much your teammates will be braindead 70 of time they will not help you they will not do the objectives properly only sometimes will you get teammates that are actually healthy minded and know a word teamwork your enemies will always have some kind of wonderwaffle that you will not be able to fight properly or fight at all tiger 2 h t34 ikv 91 e b r and etc and although it is satisfying to kill them most of the time you will not be able to do anything about them because they are too far hiding in the bushes on your flank teammates will just straight up let them pass and get close to you the gameplay drive forward for 3 5 minutes get shot from a hill covered in bushes 2km away die that s it the same for air battles fly for 5 minutes realise that there is an enemy above you and that their climbing rate and energy is much higher than yours get a half of your wing snapped off pilot knocked out or some other rubbish return to the hangar although i have almost none of the hours here on steam i ahve played for about a 1000 hours in total all i got to were t 44 100 and t 54
