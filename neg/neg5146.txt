2016 this is a very fun very engaging and very beautiful looking game with interesting races and character customisation bringing a nice rpg element to the game which was sadly mostly lost after medieval 2 it has some bad features such as the one walled siege with really diminishes the immersion in a seige battle but does make the map feel much bigger my review of the game itself is overall very good however ca s dlc policy is really making me hate the total war series when i love the games so much because of the greedy money grab that goes on they were going to release the chaos warriors as pre order only free dlc a big part of the game and huge part of the wh universe they eventually relented and made it available with purchases 1 week after the release now we see another faction being released with a extortionate price tag half of the game price and adding relatively menial features it adds a mini campaign and a new race but does not allow you to choose to have the race as a playable faction without the mini campaign back in the days of rome 1 dlc added a whole new skin and feel to the game now they release unit packs or playable factions with a 10 20 price tag and call it reasonable tl dr good game ruined by money grabbing dlc policy as usual
