2020 early access review as it stands right now this is an excellent battle simulator gameplay feels really good and is a clear improvement over warband on the other hand politics and diplomacy are far from fleshed out tw had the perfect formula for success but they were way too ambitious with this project every patch changes the game drastically sometimes for the worse there is no way to make money that hasn t been nerfed yet and many of the perks have no effect whatsoever if combat gameplay is what matters the most to you go for it otherwise stay put and don t give taleworlds your money until they fix what s unfinished and find a direction to drive this game
