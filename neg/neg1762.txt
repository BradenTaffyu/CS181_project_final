the absolute prime example of you should not waste your time on something pretty a great case of an amazing concept tainted with bias unbalance toxic community and greed you can absolutely have fun in this game but you must have certain expectations 1 the devs only want your money they will release the most pay to win broken vehicles just to get it2 the devs don t care about balance i don t care what you say in reply a 36 win rate on one country is absolutely inexcusable3 certain mechanics are horrid and you cannot get around some of the gameplay ex 3rd person peeking around corners ex sitting behind a hill for 5 minutes waiting for someone to peek you4 top tier is worse than a nut punch the game play will tear apart your personal life at best prepare to be spawn camped by everything including helicopters and to be killed half the time by players outside of the map or using some other cheeky unfun mechanic prepare to have missiles going absolutely everywhere or being outclassed by everything you come across with no actual structure to the game play why does the f 104 have no built in countermeasures no guided anything except some piss poor 9bs no guided bombs and gets placed in 10 0 one example out of very very many i ve been playing over 10 years i played this before high school stayed up late playing skipped school and played more i ve thoroughly enjoyed it and i ve been around long enough to see the devs grow ever more money hungry and biased and i cannot get back into it my recommendation play until 8 0 and past there it get s dangerous don t spend any money on the game if you can help it if you re really dedicated to being the ultra dangerous and absolute best dog fighter that s ever existed don t be some cringy guy on wt just play dcs or any other sim or go outside and touch grass if you wanna be some ultra high speed tank metallurgy expert play steel beasts or just join the actual military even getting smoked in the actual army is better than playing top tier
