2015 i bought retail version of the game for 20 bucks i had some good fun with it rome 1 was and still is a masterpiece but has rome 2 reached that level of awesomenest nope but it s still damn fun so why can t i recommend this game to you guys pros i m just 20 hours into the game and the grand campiang has been really good so far custom battles are fun so are ambushes graphics are good collision is not the best but the battles are always great to watch and there is steam workshop for rome2 woohoo cons it s not worth the money retail version for 20 bucks is definitely worth buying but that s the price in my country serbia full price of 55 us dollars on steam would be a fair deal if the game contained all the dlcs there are 3 cultural pack dlcs which are the stupidest thing ever made you can t play as sparta or athens if you don t spend extra 7 bucks besides that there are 3 dlc campaings with emperor edition you do get an extra campaing but if you want to experience all of the dlc campaings you need to spend extra 45 dollars there are a few unit pack dlcs and there is blood and gore dlc that should be free shouldn t even be considered as dlc conclusion total war rome 2 is one of my favourite games in the series but it is not worth all the cash if you want to buy this game wait for a sale 75 or check dlcs are not worth your money buy them if you find them cheap on you can find greek states culture pack for 2 sega really has to change dlc policy nobody wants to pay full price for 50 of the game i just hope they are not going to up next total war game like they did rome 2 and attila edit i understand charging extra money for the campaings because they add hours of new content and if made good they can be worth getting but cultural packs should be free
