2021 early access review should you try mount blade 2 bannerlord it s a big maybe hang on a second dude you have 160 hours on the clock you might say but that was actually just to try something and it s the whole reason why it is a maybe 160 hours of gameplay for a 50 title is definitely okay but this title is falling short in a lot of areas and i don t think the finished game will be able to change that let me explain i tried to capture the entire world map which i honestly can only recommend if you want to see what this game is not good at getting clans onboard this is luckbased and you can only persuade existing clans to switch sides with a good chunk of luck and a lot of gold involved 2 5 million to switch to you is no rare sight even when you are ruling the vastly bigger kingdom no one will ever voluntarily switch over if you crushed one kingdom the clans will simply move over to different kingdoms but never ever your own managing your clans simply not possible they do what they want are are mostly incompetent breaking off sieges in the middle not trying to protect villages and forming armies on one side of the map trying to get all the way over to the other side which does not work because the army will run out of cohesion marriage and inheritance gives you virtually nothing as far as i could tell there is simply no system whatsoever that would give you any rights to titles or anything in fact something as rights and titles isn t even in the game it s just an attribute the game selects for the ruling dude and if he dies it randomly hops over to someone else in many cases even from a different clan battles great fun and all in the first few rounds with smaller armies of like 50 vs 50 once you go into the 300 s both sides combined you will find many battlefields are simply too small the enemy ai is also mostly trying to avoid fighting by going hard left or right from their spawn position where you have to lure them out since there can only be 400 soldiers on the battlefield at any given point enemies will simply spawn in as you are defeating them especially in battles against larger armies so you and your men made it to the enemies that just waited near their spawn point you overwhelm them just to get more enemies spawned right in the middle of your troops causing huge casualties this is just a really bad system especially if have to fight wave after wave of these spawns tiresome and not fun battle simulations basically random results even if you have 150 men vs 26 looters chances are they kill one of yours especially very high level units like battarian heroes or elite cataphracts this just does not make sense if you play the battle personally they are not even getting near your units before bailing and yet in a simulation they kill one of the best units the simulation also does not scale if you have very large armies 600 against similar sized armies you suddenly get away with just 8 casualties if you try a 200 vs 200 the results look quite different its just very unpredictable and intransparent i always avoided simulations for the majority of fights to avoid loosing good units sieges it really is funny that the video on this shop page from 2016 shows a lot more features than are actually functioning in the game sieges are boring and messy if you use ladders siege towers or you breached the enemy walls does not matter much in most cases you will still have to run up against a shield wall that you can easily run around and slaughter the enemy from behind there are no really strategic options that would make it interesting or challenging the only challenge you can have is going up against 400 men with just 50 also the enemies spawn directly in the courtyard in front of the gate which is great if that is where your men are currently fighting the spawning is just daft wars essentially the other kingdoms will constantly spam you with war declarations as there is no grants titles or rights implemented in this game there is no visible reason as to why this happens at some point you are at war with basically everyone further exposing the completely incompetent own clan ai since villages create an endless supply of soldiers those wars never end and you end up fighting an army against the very same guys you just had let go after a fight over and over and over again such fun own parties as the leader of your clan you can create parties that you can also call to your army at any time for free sadly those parties are constantly being wiped out and do not recreate themselves it has to be done manually while the enemy ai immediately sends out beaten heroes again to recruit from the endless peasant supply and go to battle again trading yes possible but you cannot achieve anything with it aside from getting rich you cannot buy titles or castles or land or anything since such system are simply not implemented and not even hinted at you can create caravans but much like your own parties they constantly get wiped out and not replaced it s just another hassle to deal with for very little benefit crime every city has a crime lord or two but in the end they are completely meaningless being on the bad side of the law is meaningless too even when you are on the good side you are constantly in wars with everyone so the reason why you fight comes down to your own roleplaying if you are into that sort of thing being an outlaw has no benefits special mechanics or anything just everyone hates you but that will happen eventually anyway economy since the wars are neverending in this game the economy suffers greatly the ai will just go from city to city and buy all the food that is there completely stripping it empty stationed garrisons will then desert since there is no food for them left its just a completely unmoderated system much like the endless peasants so all in all i hope this gave you an insight the tl dr of this is this game would need at least 5 years of early access to put all the required systems in place to make this a diverse playing experience the novelty of playing those battles wears of quite quickly and there really is not much else in this game any kind of systems to manage your clan or kingdom the economy diplomacy it s all not existing the mod community is trying to help out and they have created fantastic mods but it shouldn t be their job to fill those huge gaps this game has been out for an entire year now but is missing so much i don t have any hopes of the things i described ever to become a reality since their predecessors were not particulary good at those either and none of what is missing is even really hinted at if there is a roadmap it s a star citizen like one no thanks
