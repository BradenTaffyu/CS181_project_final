2020 the ai plainly put cheats horribly this is one of those games where rather than build up the ai to be intelligent manage its resources effectively and actually present an honest challenge to the player the devs just give a flat bonus to the ai instead if it were something that was optional for ultra hardcore players who want a game that gimps them i could understand however this standard applies everywhere i ve played a lot of games with cheating ai but this is definitely the worst i ve come across fortunately mods do fix some of it but that s always a really bad sign of a game when you have to rely on mods to fix things
