2019 early access review it is with a heavy heart that i write this negative review the game itself is okay however bad experiences with some toxic and abusive people from the official discord have soured the experience for me it just feels bad now winding rant warning skip to the tldr version if you want to keep it short and to the point so anyway i played roguelikes all my life they are great adom angband nethack tome dcss you name it i played it so when caves of qud came out obviously i had to check it out and it was nice a true roguelike unique setting lots of customization unusual abilities and artifacts to discover deadly monsters to fight what s not to love right right some time into playing it i noticed there is an official discord and being on like a dozen such servers already naturally i joined this one too and all was well for a time fast forward a bit there was this person let s call them b and i got in a discussion with them nothing special just civil discourse at first but eventually b became very abusive expletives berating language you name it and just then a moderator let s call them m comes into the room well i think to myself this is it this b character is getting muted kicked for sure now guess we ll have to continue this another time haha guess again turns out m and b are buddies so instead of addressing the actual misconduct m bans me for life from the discord just like that no warning no justification from the rules of which i didn t break any you mess with m s abusive buddies you get the hammer that s how it works apparently well c est la vie and all that jazz guess it s that kind of toxic place skipping forward a few months i m on some other social network and i see the very same discord recommended to some innocent bystander so on an impulse i share my experience and warn them against confronting bullies there you will never guess what happened next the same nepotistic m shows up accuses me of ridiculous stuff transphobia of all things and when confronted and asked to take back their slander or show any evidence whatsoever of me breaking the rules just continues to berate me same patterns as b which makes sense since they are buddies i guess ever since that incident playing qud has a toxic aftertaste and just doesn t feel good anymore so here it is the long story of why i m giving a pretty decent game a negative review tldr liked the game joined the discord confronted a bully was banned by bully s moderator pal despite not breaking any rules mentioned experience on social network same moderator popped up to sling more abuse game felt good before just feels bad now in the spirit of healthy discussion i leave the comments open please use them responsibly this forum is moderated properly i believe feel free to argue that i shouldn t judge a game by the actions of its discord my stance is that the food was great but service was terrible and as a waitress with 10 years of experience i think the staff should be fired on the spot is a legit negative review feel free to share a similar experience you had with the discord in question i feel for you friend feel free to convey that you have used the discord for years and never seen any mismanagement well then what are you waiting for go leave a positive review my experiences were different feel free to inform me that you re joining the discord right now because you didn t know about it before in which case good luck take care and don t confront any bullies feel free to imply that i m some unlikable imp who just brings out the worst in people and makes them abusive and toxic against their will however being on a dozen roguelike discords for years this is the only one this has happened on feel free to accuse me of breaking the rules in the first place but only by providing actual evidence of such misconduct feel free to sling some more abuse and ridiculous accusations my way but that s just gonna make me feel even worse about the game eh this is way longer than i intended peace out
