2022 there s no casual mode so you re essentially forced to play ranked this wouldn t necessarily be a bad thing but in lower ranks turns take so long you could microwave a hot pocket wait for it to cool down so you don t burn the roof of your mouth and order a pizza after you leave it out for too long once you get to gold rank and especially platinum rank though you think it ll get better right people learn what their decks do so turns go quicker well yes but actually no you only see the 2 3 meta decks that are played exclusively since all of the decks are basically the same the games are essentially decided by the coin flip you might win a few games by using odd decks outside of the meta since people wouldn t be used to countering them at the right times but after a while people learn the right timing for their negates so what do you do you think well if i can t beat em i ll join em you make a very original eldlich deck and maybe get to platinum rank if you re not obsessed with the game though it becomes monotonous at this point i just make fun decks and try to win 1 10 games
