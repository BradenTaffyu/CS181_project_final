i enjoyed this game but i cannot recommend anyone else purchase it now the publisher created a new eula terms of service that include forced arbitration aka you give up the right to use the judicial system to hold them accountable as well as them taking more of your personal information than ever before but the worst part they put their launching app and all games behind their new one sided agreement so now i can t even play this game that i ve put hundreds of hours into and bought all the dlcs for so i don t recommend giving 2k games a try right now they ve made it clear that they don t care about the consumer only their money
