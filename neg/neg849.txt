2018 let me start this off by saying i had fun with fallout 4 the shooting is good building settlements is fun and there is plenty to like in the dialogues and some snarky comebacks your voiced character has that being said the story is a complete and utter disappointment it feels like they were trying to pull off a new vegas with the ending and failed utterly the characters that come back from 3 feel at best tacked on the entire brotherhood of steel in particular seem to be a complete lost opportunity from a character standpoint with elder maxson and needlessly rebooting them to be more jackbooted oppressors rather than any far more logical way for them to still be the the story needs them to be particularly given what little information we are given for what happened after fallout 3 and it doesn t even give lip service to where the lone wanderer is even though they were kind of a big deal in the brotherhood so if you just want to run around in power armor nuking entire legions of super mutants go ahead if you want a story that can take more than a light breeze than any other fallout will provide
