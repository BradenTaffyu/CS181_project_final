2021 eu4 is my favorite paradox 4x it s also slowly getting unplayable with dlc content getting less and less thought out and game breaking bugs not getting fixed despite the community begging for it paradox dlc policy has become a meme but in eu4 it s no longer about not wanting to spend 200 for the dlcs on sale it s about there being too many poorly implemented dlc features all stacking over each other what this game needs is a break from dlc spam and the devs polishing what they have now but we all know that s not happening so i d recommend just waiting for the victoria 3
