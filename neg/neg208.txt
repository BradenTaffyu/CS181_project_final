2020 great game to come back to fro time to time but for the love of god dont buy the subscription via steam it doesnt work for many people and basically you wont get support from either ea or steam you need to call them because apparently you can only submit a ticket digitally in game if you are already a subscriber and likely they will tell you to call them anyway which is gonna cost you possibly more than the subscription especially if they don t have a number for your country steam will not take responsibility in any way they will just point a finger at ea which is totally useless because of this thumbs down as its a pretty big deal that they are busy ignoring really just a quick edit people that have called have been asked to send an email with their account name and proof of purchase to support swtor com however they seem to be slow to respond
