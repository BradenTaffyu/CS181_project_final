2015 the first fallout to leave me with a confused look and repeating the phrase is that it not looking forward to dlc high lack of quests compared to previous fallout i found myself completeing repeated missions that never endeg go kill grab x at y complete go back to quest giver repeat i have found these quest givers at numerous factions brotherhood o steel railroad institute tho they each have unique ways they give the quest end of the day its the same retrieval quest minor difference of rewards is all locations and map placement exploring is still as fun but not as rewarding most places seem redundant and merely exist to serve a bs quest dynamic encounters are ok no strong fellings towards it but given the ai pathing is wonky this effects dynenc somewhat that npc s will bug out on odd ocassions the gunplay is a no brainer awesome satifying gun mechanics imo the only issue i have is some weapons take 70 on screen space while un holstered due to no fov slider option weapons such as missile launcher rifles with scopes but that can be overlooked
