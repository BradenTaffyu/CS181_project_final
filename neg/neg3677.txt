2023 early access review 1 0 bata update tested still all the same freaking issues but with nicer graphics they didn t really listen to anyone s issues my review still stands sadly well this is probably the saddest thing i have had to do in a while when it comes to video games i have been playing 7dtd for nearly 10 years i have loved this game for so long that it is nostalgic i had forced my friends and family to get this game we would spend hours playing my favorite things to do was mine upgrade cook and craft a safe place for my friends to come home to most of my fellow girl friends and streamers also loved to be this role for the group it pains me to say this role is being phased out clearly the devs have no interest in the game being a sandbox any longer or letting us have creative freedom this rids the roles for a lot of female players i don t know what they were thinking why the hell do i have to have find and read 100 magazines just to cook why even f ing bother with a skill tree why do glass jars now disappear after one single use why can t i scoop up some up from a fresh body of water and boil it i have to look at water and not be able to use it why have lakes and rivers in the game no you have to make drip collectors how dumb what happens is this forces everyone to loot over and over not all of us like to loot i like making a home mining and cooking i cannot do that now i am forced into a role i do not wish to play i have have had 7 days on my computer s consistently for over 5 years and i even have the play station version of the game the devs ruined my favorite game i am so disappointed they are so arrogant it s clear that if the players of the game win in any way or achieve success in any from the devs take it as a personal insult we have seen this for years now however the dumb ass water system the leveling system and the stupid magazine system in the 21 update are the last straw for me i guess i am uninstalling and moving on not even cheating and adding mods can save this trash
