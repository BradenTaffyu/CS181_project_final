2022 i want to love the game it s pretty the cars are fun and there s a big variety of tracks and places to just throw your cars around in but the actual racing part of the game is just not fun ai racers are awful the ai drive on a rail they re faster more agile and more responsive it doesn t matter what car you have doesn t matter what car the ai has it s the most unfun artificial difficulty i have ever experienced in a racing game almost every other aspect of the game is so much better than past installments but the actual racing experience has been made utterly awful
