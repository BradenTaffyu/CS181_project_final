2023 early access review they constantly patch out player strategies water was even nerfed and overhauled to a less enjoyable form and i remember how they removed the zombies fall damage in an attempt to combat player strategies back then but after they nerfed water i can t help but finally give a review for this game that i was putting so much hope in now i will not deny the world design has come a long way since back when they removed the zombies fall damage for building designs and how sidewalks and towns look actually somewhat decent despite being procedural are amazing looking in my opinion though optimization is still horrible i forget how long this game has been in alpha but it genuinely somehow still feels like a classic early access game put my hopes in it for years and at every turn my hopes where crushed maybe the end result of the game isn t for me don t know as i personally don t even have a remote idea of what kind of game the devs want this to be when and if ever fully releases
