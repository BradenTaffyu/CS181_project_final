2022 great game quite addicting the updates not dlc are nice the base building can be very relaxing the modding capabilities are amazing i spent probably a good chunk of my play time just downloading sorting mods unfortunately ludeon have decided to hike up the prices everywhere but the usa get screwed poland russia brazil most of europe a lot of people really the dlcs are already expensive biotech s probably going to cost more than the base game before the price change november 11th the discounts are just laughable they also announced new cross expansion integration content in the same post people have been asking for cross expansion content but now they have even more of an incentive steam s becoming a hellhole the developers and publishers too maybe if we get more than 10 discounts
