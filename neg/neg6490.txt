2016 as much as i want to love this game there is one thing that really put a bad taste in my mouth first week i was playing fine the second week they started their anti cheat system which usually is a good idea i got a warning that i had invalid data on my pc and reading after several threads i decided to remove the game save games and blacklist in rivatuner so it wouldnt use it after redownloading the game starting fresh with a xbox360 controller i had fun for about a week until yesterday yesterday i got a message my account has been penalized and i had been banned from the multiplayer part of the game so i can no longer co op or invade i have no 3rd party software running no cheats no mods and no overlay software only the steam overlay i have read on many forums this thing is all happening automaticly and from software cant do anyting about it im pretty gutted since mp was a crucial part of the game and now i cant play it properly anymore and to think i even bought the season pass as well i wanted to buy the pc version since obviously that is supposed to be the best version well after this drama i cant really recommend it to anyone so either get the console version or avoid it at all cost
