2021 personally looking back upon this title i haven t really enjoyed it much the game s quite a mess out of the box and requires heavy modding and troubleshooting to get it to a stable state i get that some games really shine when the modding scene gets involved but i m not particularly a fan of the idea that heavy modding is required to make the game not censored itself 24 7 related to the gameplay it felt barren even with mods primarily due to the way combat and interactions with npcs were designed lack of visual fluff and lots of empty space which are all very much due to game engine limitations bad sound design unresponsive or buggy controls even after lots of attempts to resolve it lack of attention to detail there were lots for me to nitpick even back when it was initially released i dunno i understand lots of people are able to enjoy the game but 80 of my time focused on this game was focused on troubleshooting after something breaks in play throughs with and without mods
