2017 i ll preface by admitting that i m a grumpy old civ4 elitist but this game just isn t worth buying in its current state there are a lot of very cool systems the designers have put up a rough foundation for but it s still just too empty to really enjoy you can really see the potential in this game but there s still just so many little things missing or buggy that drive you nuts and as always the ai is dumb as rocks they keep making the combat engine more and more complicated without adapting the ai to handle it at all as a result you can win wars with maybe 4 5 units the ai is just not good enough to handle the system all the depth of the combat mechanics just aren t satisfying because of this it s like beating a dog in chess your great strategy and tactics are simply wasted on an opponent that has no idea what it s doing and a full year after release there are still missing hotkeys for actions you will do every turn the art is gorgeous the soundtrack is amazing the district system and the armies fleets system show so much promise but the game s just not deep enough and the ai so poor that it s simply not enjoyable after one or two playthroughs i cranked the difficulty up to diety on my 2nd playthrough and still got bored and quit 200 turns in because of how far ahead of the ai i was i played on emperor in civ5 and i think monarch in civ4 it s not like i ve magically gotten better at the game the ai is just that bad it is utterly incapable of threatening you militarily and does not know how to pursue win conditions at all again there s a ton of potential really disappointing game as it stands though maybe with a couple of expansions it ll reach its full potential but until then i cannot recommend this game update as of june 2020 and playing the game with the expansions my review remains mostly unchanged i ve gotten a solid 100 hours in the game now so take that for what it s worth but my main problem continues to be the ai the expansions have added some super cool systems and again the game continues to have a ton of depth to it but the ai simply cannot play the game they still place their cities seemingly at random put districts in random places shuffle their units mindlessly and make no effort at all to prevent you from winning the game i recently completed a game on immortal and two of the ais were not eliminated but effectively removed from the game by barbarians when i finally scouted their lands everything in sight was pillaged and they had not a single unit to speak of so many good ideas in this game but ultimately you are still playing chess against a bunch of dogs none of the depth of the game truly feels rewarding when the ai continues to throw warriors and arches at you 150 turns into the game
