2019 i don t really know what to make of this instalment of the total war series on the one hand it was quite interesting seeing the new heroes and duelling mechanics but that excitement was short lived as that aspect soon becomes incredibly repetitive and annoying i liked the game enough to drag myself through 1 full campaign as liu bei but then quickly gave up on a second campaign as the yellow turbans as everything felt essentially identical and thus superfluous pros the campaign map graphics are beautiful diplomacy is quite well fleshed out you can now do things like trade regions or ancillaries i like the 3 kingdoms time period and had fun recognising all of the famous heroes as they appeared they brought back small settlement battles yay cons the battle graphics are truly ugly with some really horrendous lighting not sure how they managed to mess this up after how pretty wh2 was for battles battles were a real chore throughout this title the ai s fondness for night battles meant that i played about 70 of my battles in the dark i really hated the way armies are now formed from 3 small retinues individually hired by 3 heroes per army it felt cheesy you cannot trade units between retinues even within the same army ridiculous unit variety is pretty much non existent very little meaningful difference between any of the factions making replayability very low the narrator s need to constantly talk over every single loading screen was annoying beyond belief especially when you ve heard the same piece of narration for the 100th time the ai is so easy to beat both in the campaign and in battles its a total walkover building options have become so prescribed that it really requires no thought at all anymore the best tactic i found was to just spam the same few buildings in every single settlement managing heroes and their ancillaries quickly becomes tedious and i gave up even bothering with it halfway through hero skill trees are just a mess and barely worth worrying about there are really no clear career paths anymore at the moment theres a small chance that i might play this game again one day but i doubt it the map of china is just one big circle making starting positions largely irrelevant and the various factions are all basically the same so i don t see the point in playing through again maybe when the mod tools come out i ll try to fix the game to my liking a strategy game that i only end up playing once is a fail in my books
