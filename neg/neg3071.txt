it s nice getting banned on forums with no way of getting unbanned because i spoke out about price increases 2 years ago now i have no way to talk to mod devs in a game where mods is 90 of the gameplay btw i got instantly permabannned on the first ever comment i posted and here s a quote from their rules penalties violations can lead to a warning temporary ban or perma ban depending on the specifics of the situation generally a warning should be issued before greater penalties are enacted well i guess happiness of their players wish i could refund this game but it s 4 years too late if not more never purchasing anything from this developer i d rather play dwarf fortress
