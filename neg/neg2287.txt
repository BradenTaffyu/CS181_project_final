2014 economy and progression in general have gotten more and more difficult for the casual gamer i don t have the time to invest to gain experience and silver lions needed to progress and in fact outpace the developers adding new content which 9 times out of 10 locks the thing i was trying to progress it was so bad i took a 2 year break and its gotten exponentially worse its a trend for most games but war thunder is one of the worst as a new gamer i would be completely put off from the daunting task of trying to progress through a single tree i personally prefer to go through all the trees so i know its a longer uphill battle i just think i shouldn t have to research anything introduced after i select something to unlock and have experience added to it i doubt their stated numbers about the vast majority of users not paying a dime since they started the game would be quite unplayable and boring to be honest the bonuses you get in boxes etc are timed as well which is just a stupid thing and drives the narrative to greed and a lack of caring for the user base from the developers
