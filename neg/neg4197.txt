2021 its a unoptimized piece of like dont get me wrong arma 3 is great all the game functions are greatmod support is amazing but it runs bad 40 45fps with a 3060ti and i7 processor utilisation of the components doesnt even hit 50 and it still runs like like how long has it been out how many dlcs can you buy i wont recommend this game untill they release a dlc that optimizes the game cheers
