2020 unfortunately i cannot recommend this game most paradox games are actually pretty good and can make room for nearly infinite content this is not one of those games this game is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle every game i have started has gone the same regardless of what kind of empire i choose pick a fanatic xenophobe a xenophile a hive mind a technocracy it is all the same the beginning of the game consists of expanding as fast as possible in spite of the administration mechanic that can be largely ignored it penalizes you for expanding too quickly but i found a few administrative hubs had me fine for most of my expansion then there is the second phase of the game which largely consists of sitting around doing nothing you can declare war on people for resources but managing the absolute cluster of an empire you have ended up with will occupy most of your time if you do decide to declare war you will inevitably end up ignoring your planets leading to rampant overpopulation and mismanagement also paradox ai is annoying as to fight you would think that paradox would have learned from victoria ii that using a pop system involves the pops making their own decisions as to immigration via push and pull factors such as employment and overcrowding but alas they seem to have forgotten in this second phase i have only ever been deprived of one resource consumer goods my food energy minerals have all been through the roof every single game the only resources i lack are consumer goods and alloys both require minerals to be made unfortunately every single important job and population requires consumer goods and has led to a massive deficit every game it is easy to play around this however by delaying the inevitable buying off the galactic market and colonizing a single planet where you just make consumer goods because you have this deficit of consumer goods due to your ever expanding population you can t focus on alloys it s all consumer goods all the time there are sectors to attempt and automate your planets but no one should trust paradox ai because it is not very good at one point i was playing as a xenophilic empire and a hive mind offered itself for vassalization of course i accepted but when i integrated them my nation began genociding the hive mind for seemingly no reason there was no unrest generated from my xenophilic empire enacting wholesale slaughter on a species it just kinda happened i couldn t even stop it i will find myself conquering ai empires and finding their planets so horribly mismanaged that getting them in working order seems not worth the effort i have also never been declared war on by an enemy empire not once even when my military was meek when i had no defences nothing the hyperlanes in this game also make it annoying to try and prepare for conflict the final phase of the game consists of a crisis where external forces influence the galaxy and you are forced to confront them rather than feeling like a worthy reward or challenge it oftentimes feels cheap and undeserved i have not managed to beat an end game crisis having them all been stronger than my own empire and many of the other empires in the galaxy in addition the game becomes far too boring before that point for me to care there are settings before you start a game that let you adjust the strength of the endgame crisis the game s pace and a number of other factors honestly in my eyes this is bad game design the devs should choose how they want the game to be balanced and played otherwise it s not fun i m not sure what settings make the game too hard or too easy i m not the one who works on this game the responsibility of making the game balanced and fun should be on the devs the most hilarious part is that you can get achievements super easy in this game just by changing the settings i made a game with no ai empires or other species and got the suffer not the alien achievement i have a large number of hours in this game because paradox games take a long time to play every time i look at this game on my steam library i convince myself that maybe it will be different only to be disappointed every single time even if i enjoyed this game paradox s dlc policy for this game seems particularly egregious i bought this game in a humble bundle and have utopia apocalypse and megacorp i m not paying 20 00 for federations when the base game isn t even that good already i am certainly not paying anywhere from 7 10 nine times over just for cosmetic and flavor the game s pop mechanics is really just awfully done like i said if it was more reminiscent of victoria ii i would be more inclined to enjoy it but as it stands it is dreadful there are a few main ways to build your empire based on these pops you can use slaves you can go with robots or you can be more pluralistic honestly both robots and slaves suck compared to just being xenophillic you will never have ethnic or racial tensions on any of your planets and your citizens act with more autonomy than the alternative of constantly managing robots and slaves you also can unlock xeno compatibility which just leads to ridiculously strong pops in your nation this game isn t fun it s boring dull and overwhelming all at the same time there are some really cool ideas at play in this game but it s just really horribly executed i don t understand how someone can continue to play and enjoy this game don t waste your money or your time on this game
