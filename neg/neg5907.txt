2020 i am very divided on this game but for what it was an what it turned into i don t recommend itpros better multiplayer than bloons 5worth the purchasecons the in game currency monkey money is in short supply making you do mindless games to get minor amounts of ityou can purchase monkey money with real moneywhen unlocking tower abilities the first thing i was greeted with was a purchase prompt to finish the tower for five dollarswhen you level up you get a point to purchase a perk the perks used to only need points and were free they now require monkey money as well as the points respec ing your perks also costs monkey money and you don t get the mm you paid already back races require entry and are very trial and error heavy you get a free entry every 3 hours or you pay mm to immediately retry edit the update added a purchase for a pass that adds unlimited retries for a limited number of races 4 for unlimited tries for four races or 10 for unlimited tries for ten races this game is adding more microtransactions with each update edit 2 i have tried to give this game another try but the numbers keep going through my head i paid 14 for this game i noticed there is an eighteen dollar item that doubles your cash income making the game a lot less of a grind so pay to win as well as when you lose a game you can pay 200 mm to restart at 40 or 400 mm to restart last round and it s like 50 000 mm to 50 so you are paying 0 40 just to try again which is hella microtransactiony that is hidden by the intermediate currency as the game is it is a pay to win or a pay to have fun game that i already paid money for i despise the route one of my favorite game series has taken and it pains me to hate it
