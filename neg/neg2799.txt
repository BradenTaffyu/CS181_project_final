2017 i was pretty excited for stellaris when it was first released i like eu iv but i prefer starting games like this as one territory planet city and building up from there i thought stellaris would be excellent if it could take the best of eu iv and allow me to do this instead i found the game mechanically uninteresting with the recent update that came out with utopia i thought i d give it another try the early game is ok scouting for new planets to settle building up the economy etc there is some balancing required of resources which is good keeping energy income in check with expansion keeping influence income high enough to be able to hire leaders issue an edict if need be grab that new colony for the most part developing the planets doesn t have difficult choices to make it seems to work out fine to just put down the improvement that utilizes the resource on the tile the one place a varied from this is the buildingd that generate unity due to energy or mineral constraints it can be important to prioritize the order things are developed like many space 4x games the military aspect isn t very engaging either try scout out what types of weapons and defenses a potential enemy has design your ships and throw them at the enemy i wish someone would figure out to make the combat interesting in this type of game i ve enjoyed space combat that is more tactical like in master of orion 1 2 but i haven t seen a more hands off appraoch be implemented in an interesting way even diplomacy the area the paradox usually excels feels watered down for all the choices there weren t a lot that were that useful or interesting i made some trade research deals but for the most part i was self sufficient i do like the wargoals system that paradox uses in their games you can insult empires to piss them off try to keep people at peace diplomacy feels more fleshed out in a game like eu iv and maybe one of the strongest features in that game but in stellaris it feels kinda watered down and not really as vital a system i had the same feelings about cities skylines a good city builder for those with some imagination or creativity but not a great game from a strategy game perspective i think stellaris may be enjoyable for those who can use there excitement to fill in some details to make their story more interesting but for a player like me who just focuses and the mechanics and trying to succeed it falls flat
