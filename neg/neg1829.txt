2015 why i liked and played this game 1 i mostly played ground forces tanks look bad ass the noise of the tracks the sound of the engine the force of the gun the dirt that would pile on the tank when shots landed nearby it was awesome 2 no health points your tank died once the crewmen inside it died either through the tank getting shot and shrapnel spraying inside the tank or a fire explosion caused by your ammo fuel taking a hit 3 disabling tanks depending on where you shot them depending on where you hit or get hit different things would happen if the driver or engine is hit the tank can t move if the gunner is hit the tank can t shoot if the loader is hit the tank can t load another round if the turret is hit you can t shoot or move it 4 driving around in what seemed like realistic tanks the terrain you re driving around also looks amazing great graphics what made me uninstall realising how horribly unbalnced the game really is and that it s never getting better only worse with every patch that comes out russian bias developer is a russian company and they provide unhistorical advantages to russian vehicles 1 russian ammo is coded to cause more fires than american german ammo 2 russian ammo is coded to have more explosions than american german ammo 3 russian tanks are coded to have a less chance to explode catch on fire than american german tanks 4 russian tanks are coded to bounce more shells 5 other tanks will wobble and screw your aim when moving or coming to a hard stop not russian tanks 6 i saw a friend go from 3 4 average tanks destroyed per match to 8 10 when he switched to russian tanks all of this i ignored the cards are stacked against you if not playing russian tanks but it was possible to make up for it with skill tactics and picking the right tanks to fight them the last few patches just proved they won t stop stacking the cards the highest tier is unbalanced and avoided due to russian op tanks instead of fixing the problem they patched the game and changed the matchmaking to force players from the second highest tier to fight against them ww2 tanks forced to fight post ww2 cold war tanks russian ww2 tanks allowed access to post ww2 cold war ammo and now with the latest patch they introduced a new spotting cammo system which makes a tank practically invisible unless you spend money to buy points to spot them every tank has a rating that determines their chance to be spotted guess who it favors more russian tanks have a 40 advantage compared to american german tanks and if that wasn t enough they wen t and nerfed the distance at which you could aim for everyone the way i survived and did well vs the russian bias was to snipe them from long distances now they took that away well that s it i m done with this one of the most stupidly unbalanced unfair games i have ever played this game will never have a competitive scene and it s player base is declining don t waste your time on it
