2019 early access review i ve played project zomboid on and off over the course of many years and through more builds than i can remember what has remained constant throughout is that you will find that once you ve secured your base and put some crops down you ll find yourself with nothing to do this is true whether you re playing with abundant or rare items it s all a matter of time before you re self sufficient and leaving your base is needless at this point you ve effectively won the game because you re too bored to continue playing and you start a new character for the thrill of finding a new location who are we kidding we all head to the same warehouse in muldraugh and find what you need to turn it into a bristling fortress while racking up a zombie kill count in the hundreds rinse and repeat what really condemns the game for me is that throughout all these years they have never fixed the problem with lag no matter how powerful your rig there will come a moment when you open a door or turn a corner to a crowd of zombies and your screen will stutter and your character will be bitten before you know what s happening and you ll swear and scream and want to through your screen across the room at the realisation of all the hours you ve now wasted
