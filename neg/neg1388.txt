2021 early access review i tried hard to like this game i really did i love those games where you don t feel like a chosen hero but a regular dude making your victories feel all the more important the core concept is great but the game is beyond unfinished first of all the game crashes constantly often requiring me to completely restart steam in order to relaunch secondly although the game only has one main central quest line you will encounter frequent and unavoidable game breaker bugs where the game consistently crashes when trying to complete objectives even worse when you encounter a crash and inevitably google it looking for a workaround you ll find people who experienced the same issue dating back to practically the game s release over 1 year ago at time of writing and it s still not fixed still no workarounds only year old promises from the devs that it ll be fixed in a future patch the core gameplay loop is fine lots to like but at present my primary game file is absolutely locked because the game randomly crashes no matter what i do next i literally can t play anymore i support creators with early access titles i do but the state of the game over a year after launch is beyond unacceptable
