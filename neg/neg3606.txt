2019 early access review i am sad that i have to write this review as you can see i have over 250 hours in the game apart from it being in ea state and haven t been released even after 5 years of development and only so little changed there is a change that came with a17 that i have to talk about i can t comprehend how can you simplify the game mechanics and call it improvement before we had quality range on tools weapons and clothes ranging from 1 to 600 that determined the normal damage block damage or defensive attributes of the said equipment even before that the range was from 1 to 6 i was really happy that they decided to increase the max cap it added depth to the game made you feel like you have to increase the quality of your equipments even if you found 60 quality axe you were happy to throw your 45 quality one destroying a wall safe that had 2500 health with 25 block damage dealing tool vs 30 block damage dealing tool mattered after 1 5 years of waiting from a16 version to a17 they reversed the system it ranges from 1 to 6 again there is no difference between fully repaired quality 1 vs half damaged quality 1 axe same flatted block damage it may sound such a little feature to whine about but after total of 8 hours of gameplay in a17 i clearly can see it killed my excitement for loot watching development videos reading notes in my spare time i still only see developers going at snail speed they can t see the real problem with the game they don t listen to the player base every player says similar stuff under their posts and videos none of them have been addressed in any way i don t think this game will come out soonedit allowing comments
