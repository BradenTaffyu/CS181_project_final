2016 quick review after reading some other reviews and having played many hours of this game following the other iterations firstly dark souls 3 does not disappoint in the areas of lore pacing rich and varied environments or visuals and audio in all of these ways i want to love dark souls 3 and most folks seem to agree with that it s only some of the diehard older fans of the series like myself that seem to have an issue and that issue is primarily with the gameplay mechanics i won t rattle off the myriad of things that other top rated reviews here have mentioned as being changes that some see as unfavorable like the general issue of the removal of poise or the lack of viable character build choices let me lay it out simply if you re paying attention this game s mechanics are so fudged they aren t even consistent with themselves example pick up a sword and shield approach pvp generic undead soldier who also wields sword and shield swing sword he blocks you recoil from his shield stability rating which exceeds the weight force of your smaller sword s swing undead soldier gets a free hit on you then you get invaded undead player approaches with dagger you think i ll use my shield no you won t because the mechanics for pve combat and the mechanics for pvp combat are literally not the same undead player swings dagger at your shield hits and reduces your stamina for taking the hit and he keeps swinging without pause because your shield does not recoil any attacks in pvp dummy you shouldn t have bothered bringing it except you like to play both pve and pvp what do you do apparently learn the unwritten rules for the differences between pve and pvp mechanics and conform only to character builds that thrive in both situations after hours of trying to figure out why issues like this exist without any explanation as a long time souls player i don t consider issues like this minor i consider them at the very least enormous gripes that generate frustration and break immersion at the most and at the current moment i haven t played this game in awhile because i find this sort of issue to skew my view so negatively to me dark souls 3 feels like they superimposed the richness of lore and setting of the best of souls onto the mechanics of a 7 year old somewhat fleshed out forgettable action rpg that s exactly how it plays for me i love it and i hate it take it as you will i hope you find this helpful
