i give this game a negative review with a bad and disappointed feeling i remember playing the original mount blade a long long time ago it was such a unique fun and perfect game for me at least i bought warband later on and warband is probably one of my most played games i really love that game with all its total conversion mods as well when bannerlord was announced i was super hyped warband was already pretty perfect so i had such high expectations for bannerlord new mechanics better gameplay better graphics it all looked so sick the wait was super duper long but finally bannerlord released in early access i obviously bought it straight away i don t know what to tell you the early access was the most disappointed i have ever been over a game sure it looked better than warband had better graphics than warband and some new mechanics and stuff but it felt empty and barebones it had no soul most of the new stuff that was promised wasn t even in the game i have put a fair amount of hours into this game over the years it s been out but i must say i am still extremely disappointed by the game and the developers i must still use 15 20 mods to make the game feel full and interesting 15 20 mods that the developers insist on screwing up with every single pointless update they roll out developers just stop working on the game and let the modders do the good work for you they are much better at it
