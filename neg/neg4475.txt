2019 i will admit it s a fun game but it can be a fun game and a complete rip off at the same time they re essentially releasing an unfinished game vanilla civ vi at 60 euros and then milking you for more than double that if you want to actually play a fully complete game i wouldn t recommend buying this game unless it s on a 80 or more discount including all dlc and even then i d urge you not to give your money to them
