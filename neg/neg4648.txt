2018 i played every civ version from the beginning in 1991 in realation to the prevalling options each time civ vi ist the worst one of all sadly they stop the evolution of civ and settled completely on stupid and primitiv monetization the dlc behavior is an impertinence stupid ai makes it ridiculus the kind of challange civ vi provides is monotonous and superficial the level of difficulty depends on bonuses of the ai and not on a scaling of intelligenz the developers tryed to add depth with a lot of civilizations and the implementation of culture systems and religion systems for example thats not wrong but at first you need quality and then you can work on quantity a game for simple minded consum zombies to detain them futhermore from thinking civ is dead don t worth playing it a waste of time but if you are a consum zombie i am sure you will have a lot of fun
