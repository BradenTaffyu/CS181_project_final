2023 tl dr as far as the developers are concerned you are walking talking cash cows to be milked for every cent they can fool you into handing over they don t respect your wishes they don t respect your intelligence and they certainly don t respect your expectation to be given a good product in exchange for your time and loyalty very few video game companies treat their players with as much contempt as wargaming do they are as bad as activision blizzard ubisoft and ea if not worse stay far away from this game and any other wargaming title this company hates its players in all ways that are not strictly financial and with that out of the way i m going to give you an in depth review below hopefully by the end you will see why i wrote what i did above i m not gonna lie i loved this game adored it it likely has the greatest amount of collective playtime out of anything i have ever played the hours on record here aren t even a fraction of the total since most of my gameplay has been via their dedicated launcher not steam all told i have something in the range of 2800 3000 hours played going off the number of matches and my average time spent in battle per match but world of warships is not the game it once was in the past it was fun it was fair it was legitimately an f2p game where premium ships were just an alternative way to experience the game from their national flavour s standard the pay to win factor was mild pay gold for stronger versions of consumables buy premium time to get a better earnings modifier on currency and xp that sort of thing the developers listened to the playerbase when we brought up concerns about exploitable mechanics and stuff that didn t make sense being able to shoot in the open undetected beyond a certain distance from the target they adjusted the game to resolve those issues none of the ship classes or nations felt like they received disproportionate favouritism and each had their niche that served a valuable role within the game s roster that was years ago these days there is so much wrong with this game that to sum it up in standard text would probably make it difficult to follow so in the interest of giving anyone who might read this review a clear and fair description of the current situation i will tackle it in bullet points 1 the engine cannot keep up anymore locked on guns will end up shooting in wildly different directions if the target is next to behind or colliding with an island or the map border sometimes the game will refuse to let you shoot even when your guns are pointing the right way for no apparent reason incoming fire won t be visible until it hits you because the game can t keep up with rendering all the additional ammo from all the recent high fire rate ships that have been added flicking the mouse upwards as you fire turns your guns into railguns giving you much higher penetration capability in a game all about angling and armour firing at a target while fully zoomed out will sometimes land perfect salvos that can blow them out of existence without any aiming or skill on the player s part 2 the balancing is horrific a game that was previously designed around a rock paper scissors formula is now a mangled mess where there is no clear pattern things that should be vulnerable to something are actually strong against it things that should be strong against something are actually extremely vulnerable to it as an example destroyers are the most vulnerable ships against submarines while battleships are the strongest against them as another example some cruisers which are normally squishy and rely on lots of medium sized rapid firing guns to do damage can sometimes have battleship like armour and armour penetration aircraft carriers and submarines are favoured classes by the developers having superior capabilities in a lot of respects to the other three classes due to the amount of money and development time sunk into them wg also balances them based on popularity so they will be buffed as needed to keep their player ratio high despite being relatively repetitive and boring ship classes by design 3 the aggressive monetisation is some of the most egregious i ve seen in the industry and has more in common with a mobile game than a pc game everything from difficult to find drop rates on items in bundles to the average 8 9 different in game currencies going at once in some cases you need to spend money on in game currencies to spend read gamble on random loot crates for another in game currency to spend on a long string of bundles about 20 30 on average that leads to a ship at the end of them it is ridiculous and can very very quickly add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars spent it is exploitative and predatory particularly towards individuals who are prone to gambling or unaware of the actual value of their money do not allow your kids to spend money on this game this has already cost some people literal thousands of dollars on individual ships worth noting all of the above has been raised as an issue by the community for years everywhere they might see it on their official twitch streams in which any complaint or negative opinion results in a quick permanent ban on their official youtube videos which have since disabled dislikes and where comments are often disabled or at the very least completely ignored and on their official forums which have since been shut down in favour of a tightly moderated and muffled discord server that s out of sight of potential future players the constant attempts to silence the community are the reason why the current reviews on steam are overwhelmingly negative it s the only place left where the playerbase can voice its displeasure and warn curious potential players of how nasty this company is towards their customers in short stay away from this game it s tempting graphically and it doesn t have many competitors but trust me it s not worth it not these days
