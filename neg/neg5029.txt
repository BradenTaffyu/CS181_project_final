2019 if there was a middle thumb 3k would get it it s not a bad game but it isn t a great one either for everything they did right they messed up somewhere else diplomacy options look cool until you realize they are as shallow as the puddle and the ai ignores most of them the battles look good but the unit variety is pathetic and balance is worse there is little reason to use anything but spear guards and trebuchets the campaign map is very pretty but half empty in the meantime ca has done a number of unpleasant things with the game they ve been as slow as ever with patching and clearly have a limited interest in finding or fixing actual issues they admitted the ai vassal snowball isn t meant to happen but haven t fixed it or tested it their first announced dlcs are the blood pack which i understand the reasons for but still don t love and eight princes which rather than addressing the limited unit variety half empty map or limited number of characters with unique art shifts to a point a century after the game s initial start dong zhuo and the opposing coalition so no new content for campaign just a spinoff the workshop is up and ca is playing moralist by banning an admittedly highly suggestive mod with one hand while charging ten bucks for the queen and the crone with the other as it stands the game is not worth paying 72 for including blood and yellow turbans wait for a sale a few patches and a better spread of dlc to flesh out the campaign experience i d say this falls between warhammer 2 solid title at release enhanced by patches and dlc and rome 2 awful at launch completely reliant on dlc and patches 3k is a decent game but needs work to become a good one so revisiting this in 10 11 2020 game still needs work the newer dlcs have done a lot to fix some of the game s issues with limited variety and an empty map furious wild fleshed out the south and even if you don t buy it the nanman are still there are interesting enemies the bandit factions have their own tech tree and mechanics now with yan baihu s campaign being quite a bit of fun unfortunately the bugs are still there and for every one fixed there are a few new ones i ve started three new campaigns in the past week and every one has been ruined by some bug or another unbreakable enemy unit glitches out at 1 hp now you can t win the battle losing a single turn of movement and replenishment can dumpster a campaign early on and certainly did this time on good terms with a neighboring ally suddenly be at war with them with no warning because ai vassals can start a war and invite their master into it against you without any notifications to the player aside from three stacks of units showing up on turn eight and never mind that those factions are being invaded by the yellow turbans attacking their han allies is the priority new gates along the yellow river only act as an impediment to the player the ai can and will ignore them on whim and ca has straight up said they have no intention of changing this have i had fun with this game yes would i recommend that people pay retail price for it no
