2023 this might be the first single player only game that requires an internet connection to start but still wont let you play because those other servers arent working after about 1 month now the matchmaking is somewhat fixed if you enable crossplay and play with people with disabilities which also included gamepass players because reasons with the massively diminished playerbase you re extremly likely to have at least one lowlevel player usually 2 when playing the hardest difficulty you cant filter out lowlevels also you cant filter whether you want to play stealth or loud the bots are worthless and die in 5 seconds hardest difficulty lowlevel player however eat up your armor bags so playing with the bots is usually better when disabling crossplay it s back to empty lobby simulator the required day 1 patch which should ve released at the 5th of october is 20 days late now from my current experience i d like to get impolite and violate the rules guidelines but that s against the rules guidelines clown world intensifies every menu is trash when selecting one of eight missions the selection screen has to be scrolled through because somebody who never played a videogame decided to slap 2 videosequences between each mission cant say anything about the quality of those videos because i have never watched one and only ever seen a second of some of them when i missclicked you cant see how many purchaseable extra mission equipment you have additional armor bag medbag ammobag zipline while you aren t in a lobby at which point you cant purchase them without leaving the lobby so just buy 100 of them and dont think about it you cant reorganize your weapon arsenal you can sell a weapon but i am too afraid that this will delete my weapon progress not to mention the waste of money time and fantasy currency the not irl linked one the real money currency one is coming tho there are 25 outfits actually it s just 5 and 20 recolors there are 25 gloves actually it s just 5 and 20 recolors all new masks are ugly i m simply using the hockey mask from one of the earliest pd2 dlcs that heist movie one mask customization is a huge downgrade to pd2 release state weapon customization is bad simply because the only unquestionable good thing this game offers are the weapon looks the weapon sounds however are mediocre at best the music is worse way worse every non gameplay related system is trash level up unlocking guns and getting more skillspoints is playing a toilet camping match on the hardest difficulty for about an hour per weapon best case scenario or starting a match dropping your equipment restarting the match and repeat that for 100 times obviously an intro sequence for each restart is included weaponmods add a few green and red pixels to not explained bars removing the current weaponmods completely wouldnt change anything except bigger magazines or silencers i wouldnt call it alpha state some forum mods delete posts without reason or notification claim false reasons and to quote steam support i looked into the details a bit more and it was a bit excessive i ve gone ahead and removed at this time not sure if they work for msm irl but the damage control is real the mission npc woman never shuts up thank god for mods all in all this is truly a game made by corpo suits for modern gamers and a complete downgrade in absolutely every aspect except graphics from pd2 release state
