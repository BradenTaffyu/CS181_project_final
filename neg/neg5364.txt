2023 i should have listened to all the other reviewers but i loved playing 1 and 2 so much the risk was worth it definitely either an unfinished game that was running out of money or a lack of any real leadership in an attempt to make a great game they have added so many options that actually take away at first from getting into the meat of the game then you basically have only 4 maps that pretty much all play the same way one thing i used to love about rts s back in the day was that good ones were challenging but had multiple ways to finish a map now its just rinse and repeat i know decades ago they got away from resource management as the currency and large armies due to the graphics and memory demand but if you going to cheap out and and just do flag capture and limit the player to only a few squads and vehicles that s fine but the fun story factor then has to be top notch this game has not only missed the boat but the boat has been sunk by 1940 s german sub and there are no surviviors lol
