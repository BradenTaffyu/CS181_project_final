2019 the matchmaking is so stupid honestly i ve been matched with t9 t10 ships that has been fully upgraded while im here still struggling to maintain my credits because the post service for t8 ship cost like 90k each battle even if i did decent enough i only get 100k without premium this game is pretty great and quite frankly fun but the in game currency is so heavily dependant on you whether having premium or not
