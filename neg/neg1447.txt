2022 love the game and it does look and play better than warband but it has many flaws tons of cut content voice acting and more for the campaign online being mostly dead mods constantly getting abandoned due to the spam of small bug fix updates and that will continue to happen since taleworlds continue to update the game on main branch instead of having another branch barely any new content added over all the time in early access no feasts no books randomized boring companions and much more there s tons of more i d want to point out but it would take a long time and come down to nitpicky stuff so those listed are the most severe ones in my opinion i don t believe in that mods should have to pick up the mantle and fix all the stuff the developers forgot about or ignored hopefully in the future taleworlds will add in all the missing stuff from their previous game mount blade warband then i might change my review
