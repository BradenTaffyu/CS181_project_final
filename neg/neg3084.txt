story generator is a very pretentious term to make up for this typical wide as an ocean deep as a puddle case everything is very artificial and inorganic not to mention basic and the colonists don t have anywhere near enough personality depth to generate stories around themselves it s just a rudimentary glorified base builder with mild survival elements and a pricetag that s higher than what i ve paid for better games that have lasted me a longer time and that s even without the additional what 80 or so dollarydoos worth of dlcs dlcs mind you that are mostly either glorified mods already made by someone else before or features that should have been in the base game
