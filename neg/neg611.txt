2022 unfortunately this is one that i wouldn t reccomend to any of my friends unless they are really really into power hungry dms and a little bit of self harm its not an objectively bad game in my opinion and the devs have really put a lot of effort into the game in some aspects and i respect that i also want to note that i did buy this game on sale for those who care about that sort of thing however in short because i won t want to bloviate too long about my particular gripes about the game i can break up my concerns with the game into three categories character building combat story character building standard attribute system nothing crazy there memory is one of the stats and it ties to how many spells you can know not too crazy but with the lack of a class system becomes a bit more interesting two attributes per level is a lot in this game especially noticeable when you re a few levels below enemies really plays into my issues with the combat system see that section for more deets but not a huge problem in and of itself game really wants you to play one of their own origin characters while they are interesting i personally don t usually play role playing games to play a role or character that has already been carved out its just not me role playing at that point i suppose i don t always have that issue with other games say bioshock i suppose they just manage expectations better lack of a class system when i first noticed this i was deeply concerned while theoretically it allows you to easily multispec and customize your builds however you like it is also a lot to manage if you re someone like myself who just came into the series it can easily be overwhelming especially on the normal classic difficulty it definitely feels like the devs balanced a lot of the difficulty and combat based on that premise see combat for more details combat systemin my opinion after 100 hours into the game i feel like this is the worst aspect of the game it is definitely unique and it definitely deserves credit for that however i don t think that alone makes it good environmental interaction system i admit i often found it pretty cool the kinds of combinations you can do with some of the spells like casting rain to make puddles and freezing people or using water to put out fire and create steam then electrifying it to stun people this part is both unique and good but not without its own unique issues definitely something i would like to see in other games though environmental interaction system everything is on fire and starting in act 2 there really isn t always anything you can do about it there are a lot of combinations to make fire its inevitable and starts to make some of the environmental system just become tedious and boring lack of a class system contd this really starts to mess with the balance of the game when it comes to combat in my opinion if only because the game is balanced against expecting you on normal b difficulty to already understand all of the mechanics to minmax the crap out of your builds disregarding any sense of what feels like natural party and class building based on what characters and schools of magic you like levelling leveling is tough at some points in this game it really expects you to grind for every last drop of xp that the game can possibly provide to you and punishes you if you don t being underleveled by 2 3 levels on normal difficulty pretty much guarantees you will get shrek d by anything and everything you come across with two attributes per level being behind by 6 points is something you can really feel it is very easy to get tpk d in the first round especially with how the initiative system works exploration with the above point because you re essentially being hard level locked outside of some areas to me it really removed the ability to just naturally explore much of the map until you ve pretty much gathered enough xp to hit close to the max level for the whole area its not also very well demarcated and there s no level attached to quests really gives a power hungry dm vibe to me it made me feel boxed in and oftentimes made me just want to leave just so i could find something else interesting to do because i was tired of seeing and hearing the same stuff the story mostly the endings this was the part that i really kept playing for that and i could be a magic lizard person don t ask tyvm it was interesting enough to keep me slogging through a game that i by and large did not enjoy but did honestly want to however after beating it it kind of just popped the bubble for me spoilers below six endings 1 canon ending hitler lucian wins and drains your source using it to close the veil stopping the voidwoken attacks meaning all the genocide torture inhumanity destitution pogroms of sorcerers and the literal genocide of the elves were actually justified you know the gods could keep the void at bay before but not now because it s hitler s lucian s time to shine now because somehow this is better than what the gods were doing kay real suck start an m1911 vibes right here 2 become the dictator divine rule rivellon with a golden fist not the worst ending but of course the other gods could keep the veil closed but neither you nor lucian can why because fk you hitler lucian needs to win larian probably otherwise not that bad but unsatisfying as eternal war still rages with the void3 raw unadulterated communism source reject becoming divine and give source to everyone they fight off the void but of course begin to fight each other because c est la vie my favorite ending to be sure sucks to not be divine i guess but people need to handle their own problems also your optional lizard prostitute lover forms their own ruling house in the ancient empire with this ending4 make a pact with a demon lord who helps you in the final fight but allow them to become divine fairly interesting twist5 god king kills everyone and enslaves the rest returning the world to the void cool story bro 6 you kill the god king and lucian but you re an undead eternal or allow fane to ascend who then enslaves the rest of sentient life in the world but allows them life an interesting twist on the above ending they really gave me a mass effect 3 without later changes style feeling on the endings some of them don t make sense to do and none of them feel particularly satisfying some of them really left a bad taste in my mouth especially knowing which one was canon it just made me look back at all of the time i played the game with regret and made me wish i d played literally anything else there is more i could say but this is turning more into a poorly written essay rather than a review so i ll cut it off here if you really like difficult ttrpgs with grimdark stories and reading guides on how to do literally everything in the game before you do it and it not ruining the experience for you then have at it i for one will likely not return for a future game in the series without major changes or a reasonable amount of peer pressure
