2023 early access review it s fun until you get good at fighting avoiding zombies if you manage to survive an in game week you realize just how shallow it actually is there s little to do besides fight zombies which isn t advised unless you absolutely have to and collect loot a single neighborhood probably has enough loot to last weeks even on the lowest rarity settings if i want to play shut in simulator i ll just go back to real life pay no attention to my play time i ve played on and off for years until remembering why i stopped to begin with a lot of it also comes from playing around with various mods in an attempt unsuccessfully to breathe some fun back into the game
