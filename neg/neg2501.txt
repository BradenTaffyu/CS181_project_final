2021 downward thumb is a bit harsh i do not regret playing this or buying it especially considering my deep appreciation for the devs this war of mine watching the stories and mechanics unfold once is worth it on easy and a bit harder once i got used to it definitely not at the challenge levels because the thing is that i just cannot see enjoying it as a game per se the potential challenges i envision are mostly just tedious and frustrating no sense of triumph only of having avoided failure others have described it as feeling like a puzzle game presumably at harder levels you must do exactly that right things in the right order that is just not fun to me i like many puzzle games but i do not like builders that are puzzles in disguise
