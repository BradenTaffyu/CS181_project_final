2018 let me introduce you with the most important sentence of this review it s a great game it s complex got a lot of depth and even though some mechanics are a bit weird like needing a reason for declaring a war chuckles sovietly overall it s maybe the perfect strategy game all the factors and actions and events that have an impact on each other is amazing and you have to carefully choose in which direction you wanna go right from the start that said there are a few cons however like the inflexibility and the unneccessarily complex attack plans planning them is awful taking time for the troops to get in position can take eternities especially in the quite slow late game literally and this is why i do not recommend it yet this is the only thing that really needs to be fixed by paradox it s late game has terrible performance and this is an issue i found in forums from 2016 and paradox seems to have done nothing about it and this is really frustrating my soviet save needs 15 minutes to load fifteen saving takes 2 3 a day goes by in approx 3 minutes and for all of you who play it you know how little a day means in this game small comparison with a fresh start in 36 a day goes by in 20 seconds saving takes 10 seconds loading a couple of minutes too but not that much but late game is absolutely unplayable and this is very sad because this way you ll never get to finish this amazing game i feel bad for not recommending this but i think paradox needs a kick in the ass to fix the issue there are even ideas out there demonstrated by other games and the hoi community like capping the number of divisions e g by making them cost upkeep so you don t spam your enemy to death hell in the very first strategy games i ever played in my life this was implemented in one way or another and you re telling me you can t handle the situation paradox after 2 years well i hope they do something about it hopefully quick i swear as soon as the problem is adressed i ll rewrite this review to show my great love for this great game
