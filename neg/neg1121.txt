2016 cod wasteland sims editionthe trend of dumbed down games by bethesda continues all the rpg elements are stripped don t bother roleplaying you re a good guy muppet who gets put in charge of a major operation 5mins after meeting a new character there is no karma the quests are always the same everything you do feels the same unless you re into playing the sims then you re going to have a blast in here the dlc s and the season pass are seriously not worth it there are 2 big dlc s where you can sink some hours into but only far harbor is worth mentioning playing nuka world dlc feels like you re in an amusement park where your parents took you as a kid one that sucked balls the worst kind you re forced to spend the day there battling annoying people in your way trying to have a good time but typical bethesda fashion you re just running around picking up things and shooting stuff the other dlc s are pathetic in a sense that they cost money and that they bring nothing to the table other than playing a sims game in fallout i looked forward to fallout4 i doubt i m going to be bothered with fallout5 if i wasn t such an achievementwhore i wouldn t have even bothered continueing
