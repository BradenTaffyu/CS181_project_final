2019 i couldn t image that one day i will make a bad comment to a total war game but increasing price policy definitely deserve this while full game acutally 1 5 part of the game and you need to buy the dlc s for 4 5 part of it this policy is totally nonsense and dangerously tedious i think we should make our voice heard and boycott the firm for the sake of this games future
