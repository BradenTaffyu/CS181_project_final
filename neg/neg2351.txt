2023 awesome game lots of cool logistics challenges with multiple cultures with different needs and trade across maps a lot of content with all of the dlcs installed it looks really nice with populated towns and nicely detailed buildings unfortunately it uses ubisoft servers for drm which doesn t have great up time and prevents you from playing the game
