2016 i gave this game a chance because it had some nice features but ultimately its negatives are just too much for me to enjoy it you might find your style of 4x space game play is different than mine i am a control freak positives has rpg style leadership control or scientists military and system leaders a different system of research with no fixed pyramid but a random option of which projects you can do nice diplomacy system lots of options and you can build trust over time graphics are fine not the best but it is pleasant to the eyebig negatives planet control system you have a very small limit of what you can control and must set up ai controlled sections of your empire for control freaks like me this absolutely goes against what 4x games are about the combat system is archaic you have virtually no control over the battles automatic systems are not the worst ever but with most space 4x games having an option to have some control this game leaves control freaks flustered the diplomatic system of war is completely worthless basically war is a no lose option if you re bigger than your enemy and you attack them you get what you want or worst case you get nothing but you don t lose anything but some fleet if you have the ai declare war on you it s a no win situation so just reload to your last save game and then declare war on them because as soon as you go to invade their planets in retaliation the war ends and you get nothing you lose good day sir
