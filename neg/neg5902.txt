2019 btd 6 a fun sequeal to btd 5 and it has good concepts behind it like having 3 upgrade paths and tier 5 upgrades along with knowledge points which kinda feel underpowered to be honest i have three large complaints with this game though 1 microtransactions2 monkey money is basically useless aside from a few things 3 i bought the game on one platform and im not going to buy it again for a second micro transactions have zero place on a pc game although its a direct port from mobile aside from buying a few more heros and your powers ie banana farmers pontoons portable lakes etc there arent any uses for monkey money luckily i only bought the steam version i refuse to buy it from the google play store as i already own it on one device but yet if you wanted to transfer progress and play while away from your desktop you d be forced to buy it twice
