2023 i have over 550 hours played on this game bit i still havent unlocked a top tier vehicle that isnt a squadron vehicle just because the grind is too much i even own a couple of premiums but it still doesnt help i love this game but the progress you make without premium is so slow u will retire before you get to play a jet we are not cash cows gajin you need to treat your community with respect and fix the economy
