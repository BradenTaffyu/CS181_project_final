2020 early access review for multiplayer cant play as naked no equipment customisation no significant diversity for factions in the meaning of gameplay skirmish game mode is garbage almost every aspect of combat are meaninglessdid i say cant play as naked1 how can you make worse game than warband while you are the developer of warband 2 if i have to play with helmet in every round why i should and can customise my characters face make the game customisable again bring the diversity back edit for singleplayer it s fine for an early acces but still for 8 years of waiting it makes no sense i don t think games current status deserves 85 positive comment but i believe when full release comes singleplayer would be perfect yet i don t share this opininon for multiplayer they haven t cared it since warband they still don t i will still play the game cause i was waiting for it for years but it simply doesn t deserve the succes it got so my opinion is still no ps i waste 3800 hours to warband probably 80 of them were for multiplayer
