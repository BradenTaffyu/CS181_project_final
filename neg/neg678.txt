2017 great start terrible finish i played almost solely vikings before trying native because vikings the game was a fun and has a hard start that was refreshing in the time of spoon fed difficulty games getting a small group of people to follow me killing bandits and deserters picking a nation far away and harasing them by destroying cavans of theirs and raiding their towns in true viking style then returning home to the jarls that i had done many quests for to keep them liking me did small favors for villages and jarls bringing back slaves killing more bandits etc it was a really fun start then i took my first city turned on the jarls that had liked me had a massive army and almost every city i could had a plot of land and business that i owned then through a series of well times attacks and retreats took the entire northern continent and proclaimed myself queen i was able to look past the problems and just have fun there are issues but it was still fun now as a queen literally nothing changes thats end game your own settlements ask you for mundane tasks jarls still talk to you the same suddenly all the problems dont seem so small when the ultimate payoff at the end of becoming a ruler is nothing couldnt hire someone to train troops you get troops the same way as before buying them in a tavern or recruiting peasants from villagesit wasnt anything difficult just extremely time consuming to ammass the wealth and army needed to accomplish my goals then the game didnt do anything to reward you for that time some village elder just tells you to go get his run away slave so sure buy it on sale play it for 3 hours and know that nothing will change except the size of the armies on the map you ve seen the entire game at that point
