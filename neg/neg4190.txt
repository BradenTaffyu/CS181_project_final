2015 arma 3 is a classic example of what happens when a company simple creates a game that is too ambitious for their own good a military simulator of combined arms gameplay the scale of the game the world and the things inside of it is massive and while normally that massive scale would be a good thing it s become clear to me over my many hours playing it that bohemia interactive has simply bitten off more than they can chew to be fair i have only played the wasteland gametype and i have no interest in other types all my experiences are based on that this game has the worst desync hit detection and general instability and clunkiness i have ever seen many times i have aimed directly at stationary targets right in front of my face and got nothing for the bullet players consistently zip and zap an teleport hither and thither as the server struggles to keep up with everything happening and the frames per second are quite low even on a very competent pc like mine large down time is interspersed by periods of being one hit killed or from players simply living through the bullets you send his way the inconsistency of infantry combat is incredibly evident from the first minutes you engage in it in a game that strives for military realism when applicable i cannot fathom why the most important parts of a game such as infantry combat are the worst parts of this game the only reason i think that a game like arma 3 has a player base is because there is not any competition in terms of the military simulation sandbox game if any other game had such a horrid execution of infantry combat it would be inexcusable controls are not heavy but clunky and unresponsive player menus in the game are the worst i have ever seen in a game and you will often fumble through lists of commands and struggle to perform simple tasks like opening doors or simply checking the inventory of a corpse i ve had fun with arma 3 i really have i still will play it but it s only possible to play this game and have fun when things work and with arma 3 that simply is not a reliable amount of time kill trading happens very often and the unreliability of infantry combat reduces the only working strategy to stay far far far away and snipe at other players i ve only played this much because of friends that also play it but more and more my sessions simply end in me staring at my screen with a gaping mouth dumbstruck that somebody soaked up a dozen bullets and somehow one shotted me from the grave the dlc weapons are all high caliber killing machines rendering the base level of weaponry basically useless enemies are bullet sponges for any caliber below 7 62 so thinking you can play this game with an assault rifle with 5 56 rounds or 6 5 caliber rounds is only a pipe dream fights are dominated by ridiculously high caliber weapons like 9 3 or 50 caliber rifles which betrays the realism that this game i think strives for other players can certainly soak up five six rifle bullets at times and still stay up the delay between hitting players and watching them go down can be literally a second or more meaning you will shoot precious bullets at enemies that are down with games like battlefield call of duty and counter strike arma 3 s only excuse for such pitiful execution of what should be the core pillars of gameplay is that it is so massive more isn t always better and i think arma 3 proves that tl dr arma 3 has its moments of genuine enjoyability but the inability to execute simple and regular commands and the horrid infantry experience ruins most of the time spent in game
