2022 early access review i really wanted to leave a positive review but i just couldn t the game offers a lot of fun but it is just a mobile game in the end with a classic bait and switch hiding predatory monetization which i do not intend to buy into gameplayi love everything about the game itself and the card mechanics the location system makes every match unique and even though sometimes you just get screwed by the rng you can just retreat and go on to the next match every match has a set turn count of 6 and both players plays their cards at once which makes every game just a few minutes long the devs also made the ranked system into part of the actual gameplay you play for cubes which are basically points you rank up with and you can double the bet of cubes for the next turn called snapping once per game when you think you are winning the opponent can also do that and it also doubles automatically on the last turn so the cube payout can be 1 2 4 or 8 this system makes retreating a match a good strategic option but the drawback of it is that you often don t see how a game would have turned out on the last turn which is less fun and also makes learning the game harder botswhen you queue up there s a high chance you will be playing against a bot when i first started playing i had to play against bots exclusively for like 6 hours until i finally started noticing human players if you know about their existence it s quite easy to spot them though they have simple names don t emote and do really bad plays they serve their purpose as a tutorial i guess but they just keep showing up my problem with them is when your opponent does questionable plays you will start wondering if they are bots or not it also makes me feel like i wasted my time on a free win i don t know why but it seems like everyone is fine with bots and acts like they are a natural part of the game for me it comes off as disingenuous and a way to make unaware players feel good and it s not like there wouldn t be any real players to match with you get matched with these bots after just 2 seconds of searching card acquisition and monetizationthis game uses a basically infinitely long pass system for obtaining new cards you can earn resources from games and daily missions and use those to upgrade the looks of your card this process also gives you collection levels cl at first it works fine you will get cards very often early cards have simple abilities which teaches you the basics and looks like a nicely designed progression system as of writing this there are five pools series of cards you can obtain cards from first you will only obtain cards from series 1 which are the simpler card designs after that progression will slow down just a little bit while you are obtaining cards from series 2 but you will still steadily obtain them which are guaranteed unlocks on your cl pass after unlocking all series 2 cards you enter series 3 where the bait and switch happens series 3 cards are the most interesting and deck defining cards but the acquisition of them slows down to a crawl and instead of guaranteed card unlocks you will find loot boxes on your cl pass which only has a 50 chance of containing a new card consider that series 3 has by far the most cards in it s1 46 cards s2 25 cards s3 77 cards and it will just keep growing as the devs keep adding new cards in the game the whole system is just gacha and an insane grind and the chance you get the exact cards you need for a certain deck archetype are very slim but it gets even worse after around 70 hours of playtime for me you will reach cl 1000 where the type of chests will change and the card acquisition chance goes from 50 to 25 this is the part where a player will have a set collection and can barely get any new cards anymore they either got lucky with good gacha rng until now or they can just uninstall getting crushed by meta cards all the time that you don t own is absolutely miserable i also mentioned series 4 and 5 well these are super rare cards that you can also open from the gacha chests 2 5 and 0 25 of the time so yeah don t expect to ever acquire these cards in your life time admittedly the devs introduced a way to buy the cards with a rotating shop with a currency called tokens when you open a chest and you don t get a new card there s a 25 chance you get 100 tokens instead a series 3 card costs 1000 tokens series 4 costs 3000 series 6 costs 6000 you can probably get around 1000 tokens in 1 month so for missing a chance for a new card the second best reward is 1 10th of a card instead rest of the rewards are cosmetics or other currencies there s also a monthly paid season pass which contains a newly added card with no other way of obtaining until the end of month once the season ends the card gets added to series 5 so it ll become basically unobtainable if that card is strong that means it s p2w another problem with paid card acquisition or even cards bought with tokens is that what if the card ends up being too strong so much that it needs a nerf are they just going to screw over all the players that bought it are they just going to let the card rampant to avoid backlash sooner or later this will certainly become a problem so yeah the main problem with the game is this the card acquisition there are a lot of other decks i would want to try out but i just can t because i have no way to get the required cards for them the rest of monetization consists of cosmetics buying resources to speed up the cl pass leveling and overpriced bundles exclusively for whales cosmetics are mainly alternate card arts which often look pretty nice although these are also ridiculously overpriced 10 for a jpeg or i guess gif also the shop is rotating every day with just a few of these so you are more likely to buy something due to fomo you can t just go and buy any cosmetic you d like steam clientit basically looks like a mobile emulator the ui is simply not for pcs when you click the edge of buttons it gets pressed down but nothing actually happens you have to click the middle i guess this is excusable since the game was mainly made for mobile and the steam client was rushed it even says early access on the steam page oh and the inbox videos and news tabs also don t work on pc so you can t even join events or receive login rewards or compensations it s been two months since the release i kinda would have thought this would be a priority to fix closing wordsoverall i still really like the game but i want to see major changes introducing tokens was a step in the right direction but series 4 and 5 cards were two steps back so for now i have to leave this as a negative review but that can change in the future
