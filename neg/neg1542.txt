2022 no feasts no good dialogue no meaningful world interaction no good quests in the end you re just the king of a bunch of empty lifeless throne rooms and skyboxes with some mute npc mannequins for decoration how long would it take to fill them with some minstrels jesters servants on a routine task loop etc give it some life mods will eventually fix the staleness but how long must we wait for other people to finish your game this is meant to be a sandbox rpg not just a strategy combat game put some damn toys in the sandbox before 2030
