2017 where to start a fun review on expanding your way through the world with appropriate cultural enforcement methods a serious in depth text wall praising the wonderful game size and mechanics well sadly none of it as the dlc policy have gone way too overboard it s been reduced to controversial base game price increases and abolishment of expansions in favor of immersion packs that only focus on one single nation naturally being divided into multiple dlc along the way even there at exuberant prices there is a truly amazing game behind it all the pay wall is just too much for me to recommend
