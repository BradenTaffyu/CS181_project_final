2020 welp 1st negative review i think great game everything is top tier easily the most challenge i ve ever experienced in a video game but from the devs are trying to destroy the game the anti cheat will ban innocent players because cheaters injected items into your game hundreds of hours wasted because from is too lazy if you intent to play the game normally and use online aspects you are forced to manually save your files download 3rd party programs that apparently bypass the broken anti cheat to protect you from wrongfully getting banned and even then you might still get penalized because another player decided to cheat in your game unacceptable they also recently got rid of family share which helped players who were wrongfully banned and lost their characters to still play avoid this until something serious is done to properly address the issues mentioned
