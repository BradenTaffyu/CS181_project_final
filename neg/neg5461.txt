2014 rome 2 was a serious disappointment having loyally followed the franchise since shogun 1 the expectations for this game were huge the marketing campaign in advance of release appeared to promise all a fan could wish for and more yet once released it soon transpired that the game had many cut or truncated features no family tree nerfed political system was dummed down to an arcade style tactical battle system magic power buttons and battles over in record time as well as many many ai problems and design flaws transport ships sieges despite all the patching the core issues have not been fixed mods help but they cannot cure the fundamental flaws paid dlc and generic content dlc just added insult to injury this game is a victory of presentation over substance and an abject lesson to never pre order wait for the game be patient it will be worth it when you save some bucks get a patched release and perhaps a dlc bundle 6 months down the line although for this game even if it were reduced in price and came with a fat dlc bundle stay away this is a disappointment through and through boot up rome mtw 2 and shogun 2 add some of the excellent mods and enjoy some great gaming rome total war 2 was a shameful display
