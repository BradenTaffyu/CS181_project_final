2021 i ve played cotw since early 2018 until today when i first started playing this game was great it was what i wanted in a hunting game it took me hours of dedication to find big animals let alone a single diamond rares were rare animals felt special it is a truly sad state as to where this game has ended up today in 2021 i ve uninstalled it multiple times and reinstalled it multiple times because of the lack of a true competitor in the hunting game niche this has allowed expansive worlds to effectively screw over and continue to screw over their audience because there is no reason for them to fix their game their audience does not have a better game to play in this category so they keep coming back to cotw and will continue to lower their standards because this is sadly the best game we have each update breaks more and more things within the game hotfixes come months later and if they don t fix what they say they fix they break even more features instead if you ve played for as long as i have and have special animals you ve shot long ago in your trophy lodges don t get too attached because in each update you risk having random trophies in your lodges permanently deleted or their fur changes colour or their score changes colour until all you re left with is a screenshot of your harvest screen if you remembered to take one at the time i used to be a content creator for cotw on twitch i decided to leave after i could not keep pretending the game was fine that nothing was broken i put in my leaving note and a staff member of ew took this personally and tried guilt tripping me into staying by bringing up old conversations he had had with one of my dear friends who played this game who died a year ago i have since been banned from their discord channel because i posted an innocent emoji which for some reason one of their staff members found offensive it was a clown face and banned me within 5 seconds the sheer unprofessionalism shown by their team their utter disdain for their consumer base is astounding you will be treated like garbage on the bottom of their shoes if you dare to complain about them breaking your save file and ew will continue to pump out half assed dlc which people will buy because they simply don t have a better option if they want to play a hunting game do not give them your money they will continue their disgusting company behaviour the more they are funded to
