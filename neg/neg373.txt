2021 tldr fallout76 is a mindless repetitive daily list of tasks with adequate building mechanics and an abundance of frustration if you re not prepared to pay an overpriced monthly subscription for what you get set in the universe of the previous games of the series the shop is updated regularly and the in shop game is quite enjoyable there s no point doing the main quest once you get the gold you won t have time for it anyway i made a game of seeing how i could break the building physics to actually make something that looks impressive using the pitifully few atom shop items i could afford with my pay 2 free 2 play lifestyle in between counting the events ruined by players with unobtainable and overpowered weapons after waiting many days for a special event that ended up being a massive letdown i accidentally wasted as many days collection of a certain coin on some items that were less that worthless i cleaned up the hole in the wall my head had made and uninstalled the game overall i would not recommend original this game really shows off the worst parts of the gaming industry the shop is updated more than the game and updates that do get released usually come with some new way to spend money it s barely a game it s more of a way to slowly manipulate money out of the weak minded but if you like fallout there s enough fallout content to really make you work for any enjoyment you re trying to get i feel bad for the developers who have to endlessly crank out new garbage for the atomic shop the shop isn t even consistent it ll have a 1500 atom bundle that contains everything you need for a log cabin next to a 1500 power armor paint this game is sad really i wish it hadn t been released update after playing an extra 400 hours i finally quit when i wasted time buying jumbo mister fuzzy plushies you can t place them in a camp you can t put them in a display case you can t do anything with them except scrap them and they weigh 1 pound each you can collect up to 9 fuzzy tokens a day if all 3 quests actually refresh for you i got about 1 2 of the fuzzy quests a day so i wasted 4 6 days of fuzzy tokens on something less than useless and i was disappointed that s what this game is a constant disappointment my friend suggested googling everything i do before i do it but if it has gotten to this point something has clearly gone wrong before i continue i want to say i didn t buy a single month of fallout first live service games do need a source of income and a monthly subscription is a great way to facilitate that income but this game asks for 40 to start 13 a month while you play and as much as you can spend in the atomic shop with new things weekly as well as things on rotation from the last time i played they have added in seasonal events that come around once a year but they are already repeating the events so in that time they have taken everyone s fallout first money and done what i consider to be all besides atom shop items which only benefit the fallout first players in a mediocre way if i had fallout first this whole time i would be extremely irritated because the atom shop is all just nothing it s shiny nothing building an interesting camp without atom shop items isn t hard with a little creativity and fallout first acts to just add a form of classism to the game in a really stupid way there was a few day event that made the game genuinely enjoyable by doubling the limit on the daily caps legendary script and gold bullion you could collect if they added more events like that or made the constantly irritating stash box less penalizing for players who want to support the game then a lot of people would probably consider returning because right now it isn t worth playing because of how much time it demands from you without really giving anything back besides the fact it exists below are my gripes with the current state of the game most of which are obvious if you play fallout firsteveryone needs to be irritated that a company would ask 13 a month and then not do anything with their game besides a scoreboard and some shiny objects for your camp while you run around shooting the same enemies in the same events you have been every day you log on for probably as long as you ve been playing at a certain point you ve done everything so you have the option to continue doing everything but slightly easier and you get shiny things for your camp the atom shop needs less emphasis in this game as it does nothing except cost developer time and creativity in order to release new items every week so fallout first could have a cheaper price and give less atoms or have a whole new fallout second subscription with just the junk box and tent or anything besides changing very little the entire time the game has been out and promising more goodies in the future regular events xp grind and xp sharethe xp grind is real in any game so everyone ends up defaulting to the method to net the most the issue is this game doesn t have a lot of places to get lots of experience you can grind west tek or you can do the event radiation rumble and hope someone isn t sitting there killing everything instantly there seems to be some sort of system to give people xp if they are near enemies being killed in an event but it s so inconsistent events end up having everyone do their best to hit everything once before it dies in fear they won t get the max xp killing the same super mutants in west tek over and over is also an option if mindless repetitive tasks is what you want in your free time an easy fix would just allow everyone in the event to get all the xp it would increase the amount of idle players sure which could be considered if they actually had developers long enough so that such complex thoughts could flourish but it would let new players and players who do the objective to actually benefit from what they re trying to participate in this game is competitive but with just enough players using tesla rifles and the right perk cards or a few people using legacy weapons basically the best group xp grind can be ruined legacy weaponsof course returning to the game means some players have past weapons from past updates but fallout76 hasn t removed those weapons meaning that some player and their friends can join a server spawn 3 scorchbeast queens in quick succession killing them instantly that s one of the more rare ones but there are lots of different weapons ready to ruin any event you join and sometimes your camp if you turn pacifist mode off at least once a day scoreboardwant to keep players playing the game and are so out of ideas you literally just put rewards in a list and tell people to grind for them fine that seems to be how games go these days but if you then run out of ideas and start putting things like a yellow door as a fallout first exclusive reward on a scoreboard full of yellow power armor paints and nuclear keycards then you re insulting your community absolutely developers will run out of ideas and i would be more forgiving if there weren t new items every single week in the atom shop
