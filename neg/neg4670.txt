2023 this was one of if not the greatest sandbox games ever it was a huge stress relief jumping on teardown and just destroying everything after a long day of school but after tuxedo labs the developers of the game got bought out by saber interactive it s gone to mods stopped workingthe ui changed personal opinion but most of the community hated it they added a season pass this might just be me but the game just felt off it didn t feel like the teardown i knew and loved the actually good teardown and this isn t just me hating on saber no i felt something was off when i played after the update came out while still not knowing it had been bought by them this game was worth it keyword was off saber interactive sincerely a former customer
