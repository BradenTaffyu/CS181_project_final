2021 this game could pay for itself just for the campaign mode however if you wanted to get into multiplayer rts this is not the game hear me out gamebreaking bugs are found every patch and all of them is not even hard to pull off to ruin any other player s game balancing feels terrible where certain civs are going to rekt you just because they have overpowered units that no one can counter fire lancers aoe damage with no fall off can disengage at will dirt cheap and oh deals double damage to building there is no counter to this unit at all unless you build a wall which they can overcome eventually if you are not playing a civ that is in the meta pairing with similar skilled players that does you are going to lose badly maps are rng based and sometimes resource spawn and map set up can favour any party the reason why they want to introduce this mechanic is beyond me hotfixes and patch takes too long to be pushed out which makes whatever issues with this game worse random issues mid match that would kick everyone out of the match for no reasonsdont get me wrong i have been playing this game alot with my friend and have been enjoying it but seeing these happen and losing every game to players would just build a single unit type to overrun your fully upgraded army is just disheartening why do i even bother to micro or play the game when the opponent can just build a single unit type and attack move my base and call it a day i genuinely enjoy this game and had lots of good time with it and it always felt so rewarding playing non meta civs and to win with it however at the game s current state i would not recommend if you are looking to play on multiplayer 1v1 is still bearable as end of the day it still comes to skill but on team games that is another story
