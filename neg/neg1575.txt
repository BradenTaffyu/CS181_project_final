2020 early access review the game currently lacks any sort of complexity or immersion the game is a total disaster and makes the dev blogs and videos from years ago look like a farce they appear to have really misled people i would avoid this game until the mod community has a chance to make it good right now its just a shallow boring game with nothing to do its a huge disappointment for the mount and blade community to say the least maybe it will be playable in 2 years with total overhaul mods
