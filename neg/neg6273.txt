absolute game developers only care about making money and deliberately bring out broken cards every season to bait players into purchasing them only to have them nerfed the next season so the cycle can repeat the power creep is insane the matchmaking is the most rigged you will ever encounter if you play a deck of a certain type you will only come up against similar decks or decks that counter yours the devs claim it s not pay to win but then bring out the most busted cards and you d have to grind a lifetime to collect all of them do not bother with this utter trash i ve reached infinite highest rank over 10 times and none of them were fun and enjoyable yes the game has addictive mechanics but the developers should not be rewarded for such micro transactions and matchmaking mechanics 140 for a card variants and a few collection tokens are they out of their mind
