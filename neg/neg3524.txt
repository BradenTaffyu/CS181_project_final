2019 this game was really nice not fantastic but really nice offered a good amount of hours to play nice little challenges it s not hard but satisfying the dlcs are bit expensive for the content though i still bought them the only thing that puts a red flag on it to me is the fact that it is a solo game i bought it as a solo game and then to play certain parts of the game i now need to have 3 other friends on steam that play the game totally separately to advance in a dumb part of the game thanks for reminding me that i m the only one in a group that plays that type of game and i don t want to bother with unknown people to satisfy a bad design feels like some cheap mobile games trying to get more people to play their game cheap and lame
