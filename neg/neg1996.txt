2021 warthunder is a very appealing game some historical accuracy cool semi realistic features and badass vehicle models along with over 1000 vehicles but with this the game is destined to have flaws i understand that the game is free to play and that they will need to make money through microtransactions however making the game unplayable without spending money is stupid the most the average player can grind to is br 5 7 and then the repair cost along with the amount of time has to be put in the vehicle becomes litterally unbearable now we have overpowered vehicles which should have a much higher br such as the r3 and the ebr running around this makes the game nearly unplayable at 3 0 5 0 fix your game gaijin just because you have no other games that can compete doesn t mean you can force your fans to do as you please
