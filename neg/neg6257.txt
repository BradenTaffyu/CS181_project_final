2023 early access review a sinking ship as you can tell from my playtime on this game just the steam version i have probably double this on mobile i have invested quite a lot into this game both time wise and money wise at one point i would have put this in my top 5 favorite games to play right now but unfortunately as you can see from my negative review this is no longer the case for a long time this game was pretty free to play friendly and if you did decide to support the game with the season pass or the odd bundle here or there you were definitely getting value for it and you could acquire cards pretty easily and it was fairly easy to get the cards that you wanted to improve your decks then with the latest update the developers revealed their true intentions they didn t want you to be able to enjoy the game as a free to play player no no no they wanted your wallets to be empty and your credit cards to be swiping the developers have found a way to make it nearly impossible to get any card that you want without spending tons and tons of money they ve taken out ways to get resources through natural play increased the cost of everything in the store and stopped dropping new cards into more common rarities all in the hope that you pull out the most powerful card in the game the credit card in the discord server they re ignoring the negative feedback and doubling down on the current system and removing negative feedback the once honorable second dinner is becoming greedy as greedy can be on top of this basic features are still not in the pc version such as widescreen ui a functioning news and updates section and once promised features that they ve gone completely silent on on top of this more and more cards are being released as buggy broken messes but it doesn t really matter since you won t be able to get that card anyway second dinner you were once a developer that i had no problem supporting financially but now that you ve shown your true colors i will not spend another dime on this game i highly recommend you look elsewhere for a tcg because this game is going nowhere but down and i will hate to see it inevitably crash and burn because at it s core this is a really solid game i ve had a ton of fun with but now it s a shell of it s former self which is a really big shame
