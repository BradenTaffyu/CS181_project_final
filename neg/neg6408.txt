2022 it started off so well but at this point i m close to dropping the game this is an utter joke now what on earth happened to the team for horizon 5 there has been so many changes and so many setbacks that i m actually starting to get annoyed and concerned it s quite clear that there is absolutely zero consideration and engagement with the community most if not all of these issues wouldn t be here otherwise it was the biggest release for microsoft so they have made their money so why would pg care about the community and player retention with no micro transactions to milk us with i love forza horizon i really do but at this rate i m questioning on what s going to happen at the end of all this and i regret shelling out the money for the premium edition horizon 5 has been a mess and i m sad to see it go this way cheating leaderboard times are still there cheaters hackers aren t punished random mass player bans for offensive liveries whilst the cheaters have free reign over leaderboard times no ranked races because losing hurts my safe space removal of wheelspins and super wheelspins from car mastery tree super wheelspins now have 1 2 and 5k rewards super wheel spin cash prizes are capped at 300k unnecessary tedious grind for all players and a big kick in the teeth for newer players to earn money basic bug fixes from day 1 still aren t fixed i e the game still stutters after any loading screen or challenging a new player in the eliminator engine sounds cut out and stutter when navigating around any section of the vehicle upgrades all transparent surfaces are blacked out on the vehicle thumbnails only two convertible cars actually have a convertible animation they removed online team ranked and custom adventureabsolutely pathetic
