2016 so disappointing the ai cheats you can t for instance make them run out of energy even a single planet without any stations can support an infinitely large fleet which isn t fun if your fleets are the same size they have a spaceport war declarations are stupid in this game you can only declare on planets they have settled which are very often not the ones you want you want ones that suit your race but you can t declare for an unsettled system you have to take a system that they have settled even if you don t want it combat s pretty bad the ai is exploitably stupid send a single warship from the other direction their fleet leaves the planet you can wipe out the spaceport and then the fleet separately which is the only way i ve found of beating cheating ais see above you also can t tell your ships hey stay inside the aura of this defense station it s actually what s going to win this fight or to retreat without leaving the system i just wanted them to back up a bit why get in range of the stations if you don t have to as for the rps system of lasers shields etc that s great and all but in order to find out what your opponent uses you need to invade hooray no espionage in the game nor are they likely to venture into range of your scanners with their fleet good luck building that fleet after your war dec forget getting the ai to make a deal either seems like even just to trade charts you ll need to send them more than a far share to get a deal passed the diplomacy of eu4 is gone replaced with the braindead why is this even in the game diplomacy of civ5 be it also happens between two screens you ll need to keep changing between endlessly yeah embassies and alliances happen in this screen but trades and pacts happen in this other screen no you can t exchange for systems that aren t settled i e useful ones and if you could i don t doubt the ai would never agree there s simply no tools to handle relations with other relations nor are there the nice and transparent summary screens of eu4 you get embassies and rivals that s never enough and the primitive planets there s no way for a xenophobic race to deal with them i just want them gone but no diplomacy with them to wage war against them you have four options and they become a ticking time bomb if they become a vassal they instantly take all the nearby systems with them even if the system they were in had a frontier station great guess i ll wage war against them in 10 years even if the race is some screwed up kill all other species race no paradox i get to kill them now also there seems to be no way of ignoring peace deals i m waging war just to destroy all life on their planets and they end up giving them to me i don t want that i declared war to empty their planets so i can move in if i m not a race that can purge what is my recourse then you can t deal with these planets of other races the tools for integration amount to an endless spending of your points to keep a faction happy and slaves suck oh boy do they suck 50 production what so they can starve also the tech drafting can ruin your game you want to colonise guess it hasn t come up yet you need bigger ships or better weapons because yours are out of date screw you research one of these instead i don t really want to play this game anymore frankly i appreciate some of the grind has been taken away from games like moo of managing planets and so on but that comes back the moment building stations on multiple systems becomes tedious it s also all the game really is exploration expansion dies off so quickly there s no reason to fight other civs because what you ll get you won t want stellaris is a 1x game at best because the other 3x s it falls down at so hard it s not grand strategy either not in the slightest if there was a faster speed than fastest i certainly would have been using it in the end it s just as shallow as the new moo is event chains certainly don t save it these are fundamental problems and maybe dlc will fix them cynically i think that may have been paradox s plan from day one but it will be a long time coming
