2023 final edit after the last patch my account was reset to a brand new account so all of that progress is lost goodbye forever edit i have reinstalled this game a couple times trying to give it a chance the feeling of pay to win rng impossible bot ai still exists you can rarely get above level 70 for the season as you run into impossible bots that play every hand perfectly it s win 1 lose 1 constantly you get stuck in place you ll play 2 hours and still be level 70 when you run into a real person it s constant emote spam toxicity and you have to mute then it feels like you re fighting the random locations far more than competing against the other players or even the ai overall it feels like a joyless grind where you hit absolute walls far too quickly your first 20 hours will be heaven you will swear you ve found your card battler to end all card battlers but then you ll hit that wall where you realize you re not winning anymore you re fighting against decks filled with cards you can t get without paying a lot of real money and you ll just stop progressing and that s where you ll fall off and leave the game like i m doing the credits and tokens you can get from games has been drastically reduced from beta while cards especially new cards has the prices jacked up so you know what that means this will encourage children small people with access to mommy s money and zero impulse control or whales gamers with bottomless wallets who don t know any better and who don t care to buy passes and cards if you do not partake in this predatory system then you will not progress ever so just pass on this and it s a shame because the core game is quite enjoyable so play it for free and see when you hit that oh this is pay to win trying to stick a hand in my wallet feeling hits you and see if my review was honest
