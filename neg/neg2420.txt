2023 let me preface by saying that i love this game however its glory days are long over the time to have wild battles and see varying decks and strategies is over its a lot closer to just the actual tcg ocg now for those who are new to the series and may be interested due to watching the anime just forget everything you think you know or knew same for duel links players or returning schoolyard players your 1 pal dark magician ain t gonna cut it this game is extremely fast paced and is less focused on a strategic back and forth using monsters and spells but more based around not allowing your opponent to play at all the power creep is ridiculous just like the irl tcg and this game very much has a meta outside of silver you ll be playing against the same 3 4 decks in a game that has thousands i think these three things combine to make an experience i can t necessarily promote to new players and it will only get worse as time goes on eldlich and drytron ain t got on tear or runicks also maxx c also gacha make of that what you will
