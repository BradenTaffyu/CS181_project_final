2023 payday 3 tries to do a lot but fails in a lot of it very unstable no options you are not the hoster and so if someone joins that you don t like you have no way to kick them no offline play no crime net server browser extremely slow updates first slowdown and most significant is due to crossplay pc has to wait for console verification second slowdown is before an update they shutdown the server for maintenance for 5 7 hours experience gain is awful and not fun the devs thought that pushing players to do challenges is a good idea cough cough stuff that are supposed to be optional and only for people that want an extra thing you get barely any xp after completing a heist i couldn t care less about the reasons it s just something you had to think about before implementing such unnecessary things that honestly costed you more than not having said features because no one actually gives a about crossplay nor is p2p that bad there are areas where the game has improved from pd2 and made more fun but there s still a lot missing which gave pd2 its charm
