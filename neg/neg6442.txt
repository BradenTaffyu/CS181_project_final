2021 note this review was written before the first patch it will discuss issues that may not be present in the game anymore i urge you to actually read the review before making an uneducated comment because i actually don t hate this game i genuinely love it and will continue playing it i m simply giving an honest unbiased review on some of the issues as a long time avid player of all forza titles forza horizon 5 is the buggy dysfunctional car game for non car people i really enjoyed this game this is the most fun i ve had in a forza title in a very long time and it s definitely miles above horizon 4 however i can not in good faith recommend a game that is clearly unfinished this game reeks of rushed for a holiday release there s so much wrong with this game but they neglect to remedy most of it there s a constant memory leak issue that reveals itself usually around an hour of playtime requiring a restart i physically can not run the game on extreme settings even though my computer physically could after 5 minutes of driving around on max settings the textures will begin to corrupt and the framerate will tank attempting to play with friends is a frustrating grueling task that will likely result in you giving up and closing the game never in my life have i seen a game with such an unstable online mode while trying to play with someone on the same wired connection as me the ai is also extremely frustrating i have no idea what they did between horizon 3 4 and now but the blatant disregard for the game s physics performed by the ai can get infuriating very quickly the rubberbanding is extremely exaggerated in online play as drivatars in completely stock c or d class cars will just decide to make manoeuvres as if they were on rails doing any sort of off road race is a no go unless you re awd 4wd why because the ai will awd swap every single car without fail every time this makes attempting to enjoy a rwd or fwd rally car a very hard task as every race will now become exponentially harder this game is chock full of graphical glitches too floating rocks botched collisions incorrect shading the works the can am maverick s rear quarter panels are void black most of the time i have no idea what factor plays into this but it s not a constant issue the mercedes x class lacks a modelled engine which it had in horizon 4 and the ford racing puma s hood will not open properly only the sound deadening of the hood actually goes up when you open it the rest of the hood stays shut note this next paragraph is entirely opinion a personal gripe of mine that doesn t necessarily affect gameplay has to be the lack of vehicle variety and progression if you re the type that likes steady somewhat linear progression where the supercars feel far more rewarding in the end this is not the game for you there is an extremely glaring omission of just ordinary everyday cars the potential for upgrading could be so much better if we were simply given the regular counterparts of the cars leaving the insane custom builds of them as a conversion kit i simply don t understand this because forza historically up until the mid 2010 s was always very good about vehicle variety where is the mexican domestic vehicles i counted one the renault 4l that is the only vehicle that is discernible as the mexican market version i would happily drive a ford topaz chrysler spirit peugeot 404 chevy caprice dodge ramcharger opel fiera the list goes on they really dropped the ball on including mexican vehicles in the mexican car game beetle this beetle that the beetle has been in nearly every title it s not new would it have hurt to include some more obscure ordinary mexican vehicles i would bet money that nobody at playground games has heard of vam another thing why the is there licensed traffic in this game just include the cars you guys literally have the models for all of them already because they re just ported from older titles anyways this concludes my rant this game has so much potential but it really drops the ball on functionality i wish people wouldn t happily advocate for pushing developers to release an unfinished game with the it can be patched later mindset i m very happy for the record breaking launch on this game but clearly something was done differently that breaks the multiplayer in this i just wanna play the game with some friends updates online sort of works now still nearly impossible to do a convoy free mode road trip due to players popping in and out all the time but i ve had 0 issues within races as of recently the texture corruption glitch that happens during a memory leak has been fixed but the memory leaks themselves still happen
