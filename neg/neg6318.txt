ps some story spoilers in here i want to like this game but after 100 completing it and seeing all the game has to offer it s really left me wanting more from the game this isn t to say there isn t good aspects to it but the good ultimately gets overshadowed by the bad in the end but lets start with the pros pros hogwarts this was one of my favorite aspects of this game exploring hogwarts was genuinely very interesting and finding all the different easter eggs and references was very enjoyable i loved seeing how interconnected the castle was and just walking around it was a joy it reminded me of the dark souls 1 level design just because of how fun it was to explore if you are a fan of harry potter you ll love exploring hogwarts combat this part of the game is really part pro and part con for me i played on hard and there was a genuine challenge for the first bit of game which i enjoyed the combat plays like the batman arkham games just with a wand you hit people with different spells until a little thing pops over your head telling if you should dodge or parry there is also potions and plants that you can use during battles to give you certain buffs so while it was sort of brain dead and boring i still found some enjoyment out of the combat room of requirement you get access to the room of requirement shortly after the start of the game and it was one of the better aspects of the game this room basically is your home base for the game and it s fun to add new things to it throughout the game also i m not really a creative guy but if you enjoy customizing things you will enjoy this room there are lots of ways to customize different aspects of the room and make it your own alright while there isn t much those were my pros for hogwarts legacy so now lets get into what i didn t like too much cons student life while this game was sort of advertised as you getting to be a student at hogwarts it s definitely not what you get the student aspect of the game is basically non existent the student activities basically come down to 1 different quest for each class in hogwarts then some teachers have assignments which are just shorter quests that reward you with a spell at the end i wish that the classes were treated differently than just a side quest that you need to go on and while this probably wouldn t be feasible it would have been extremely cool to see something like the persona games where you have to manage your time as a student with the other things you do in the story touching on a different subject you know how in the harry potter books harry had to sneak around because he wasn t allowed out at night well in this game there is absolutely zero punishment for being out at night which is sad to see it would have been cool to have to sneak around at night and maybe get different rewards depending on how well you can sneak around anyways it just feels like an open world game where you happen to be a student rather than a student who happens to be in an open world unforgivable curses in the game you get the option to learn the unforgivable curses and use them against enemies while using the curses is extremely cool the stupid thing is that there is again absolutely zero consequences for using these supposed unforgivable curses there s no karma system where people react differently if you use the curses more the most reaction i got from using these spells was one of my classmates saying i see someone s not afraid of the dark arts even further the use of unforgivable curses has no affect on the ending at all the only thing that changes it is the dialogue options in the final quest gear the gear in this game is not the greatest the gear is the reward you get from every single chest all throughout the game and it just ends up being so boring and similar it s basically just picking whatever numbers are the highest and nothing beyond that while you can upgrade your gear i never found better gear to help me in combat whatsoever open world the open world of this game was just lifeless and boring in my opinion while there were activities that you can do throughout the open world they were all just basic bandit camps and simple puzzles to solve also having to do so many of these different activities to 100 the game got incredibly tedious and definitely didn t help my enjoyment of the game also the rewards for doing these activities are extremely minimal so the incentive to do them is almost nonexistent also unlike the castle the open world wasn t very interesting at all it mostly consisted of hilly plains with the occasional town or forest here and there very disappointing story the story in this game was a bit boring in my opinion it basically came to there is a big bad man goblin and you have to harness your new special powers to beat the big bad man goblin while there is slightly more to it than that i just found it to be not enjoyable and if you compare it to the harry potter books the difference in storytelling between the two is very large side quests the side quests like the story and open world was more of the same blandness and lifelessness most side quests were just simple go here and kill this go explore this dungeon etc very few of these side quests were actually interesting and the actually good ones were drowned out by the rest of the boring soulless quests there are other relationship quests which are essentially main side quests if you get what i mean these while somewhat more interesting still ultimately came down to go here and kill this and go here and solve this puzzle just meh so ultimately this game ended up being an extremely basic open world adventure with harry potter over it fans of the series will enjoy the many references and callbacks but if you aren t a diehard fan i would recommend that you stay away from the game
