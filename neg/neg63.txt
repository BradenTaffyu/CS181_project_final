2017 early access review do not let the positive reviews fool you you will be upset but how you ask this game looks great a true rpg based on a zombie apocolypse that has an active community and very skilled modders i ve seen gameplay videos and the content in game looks magnificent well that s about it literally everything you see you get and promised features not too long down the road well that s what they ll tell you it been about two three years no solid big picture content has been added into the game since that time they ve been adding novelty features that aren t integretal to the game well maybe the crafting system but that s about the only game changing thing worth mentioning everyone was forgiving making jokes at the devs such as project zomboid release date 2020 they were making these jokes aobut 2 3 years ago but now that seems like a very real possibilty maybe even longer basically they are stringing people along with promised features that will be delayed over and over again npc s a big one for people they ve been talking about it for about 4 years and have leaked an occasional video update to the public it s been around a year before they updated us on any true progress towards it but i like to cut them alot of slack for that because npc s are fairly difficult to implement and it seems like they re focusing on more important things such as the new animation system animation system this one is a little annoying because its been in development for a year and a half i think that s fine but they keep telling the public it ll be out soon however it been a year since they started saying soon so now they said to themselves hey we got alot of things to do but you know what would be cool vehicles vehicle system well this one is a little funny after they announced both the npc update and the animation update they are now working on a vehicle update before they even released a basic update for the animation system this was announced not too long ago i think 3 months but im not too sure i have to look at the updates again this seems a little crazy seeing as how they already have two big features that they are working on i cannot recommend this game not in the hands of these people at least i ve never seen such a simple game be so mismanaged by dev s they won t go any lower than 8 7 50 on a sale because that was the original price for the game day 1 of their development that s a really convienient excuse to not drop the price any lower so now a community of talented modders and kind players have been duped by a company that keeps stringing people along by one of the first early access developers forever tainting the beauty that could have been and should have been a system that helps indie developers create games that they would otherwise have a harder time doing succesfully tl drdev promises features but never delivers keeps adding onto an enormous work load won t hire a larger team but occasionally hires an additional person for a short amount of time save yourself and your money the sad thing is this is a fun game really fun to play with friends a very cool concept but they aren t delivering key features and are keeping players in suspense by saying soon
