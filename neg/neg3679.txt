2021 early access review 7 days evokes so many mixed feelings in me as my hours in the game suggest it has and has had a plethora of features that proved endearing if not addictive the key work and sticking point in it all is had as many say the game offers a minecraft like experience with somewhat more realistic graphics and physics backed by a much more extensive scavenging and combative core gameplay loop it s basebuilding and management of time and resources require an extent of thought and the process of slowly expanding and working through the rpg character expansion is fairly fulfilling the problem lies in the unending years of early access while the idea and for the most part appearance remained the same the major patches come with often unwelcome changes in the gameplay moreover they stifle any longevity in a runthrough by outdating active worlds given that a statisfying playthrough might take you an easy 40 60 hours before boredom starts to set it the constant major changes disincentivize coming back to the game and making progress it s all rather self defeating it also takes an eternity to load into or make a new world and isn t the best optimized despite the low recomended specs making it function comfortably requires better hardware than it really should tl dr good game at its base but with practices by the developer that inadvertenly make playing it a waste of time in a sense
