2021 i have a bit over 200 hours played in this game and for the most part it s a fantastic game the game is well thought out has great mechanics and is overall incredibly fun it s easily one of the best hunting games ever unfortunately i can t recommend this game to anyone i m sick and tired of games being bug ridden and completely unpolished whenever there is a major update parts of the game that worked in some cases for years suddenly break there is absolutely no sense of urgency to fix these bugs as it can take months before some of them get fixed if ever i m not talking about small bugs either i m talking completely game breaking problems there are crippling audio issues fast travel not working on half of the maps frame rates suddenly being cut in half with no rhyme or reason on certain maps less taxing ones boggle unable to use hunting stands on half the maps etc it s ridiculous it feels like i m playing an alpha to a game sometimes with the release of the latest map it feels like the game is at one of it s worst states yet makes it very difficult to enjoy the game update 8 14 it has now been since july 1st 2021 when the game was last updated so going on a month and a half without a single issue addressed since the release of the latest map and once again these aren t problems with the latest map itself for some reason when new content is pushed in thehunter cotw the existing game suffers for reasons i guess shrug is this game going the way of thehunter primal they push an update that breaks the game and they just abandon it
