2016 honestly i feel a bit betrayed i feel like they took a step in the opposite direction from what everyone was expecting the game is more fps based than ever with shooting your way out as the only option surprisingly often hacking lockpicking etc is a joke if you want to progress all you need is a gun in fact you have to progress with your gun because gone are the days of talking your way through new vegas 4 10 i hate to say it but feels a lot like we needed money was the reason this game was made
