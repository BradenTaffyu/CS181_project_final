2023 i should first say i love this game loved it enough to put in at least 91 hours a fantastic sandbox a myriad of options to mess with beautiful graphics fun physics the works but a while ago tuxedo labs was bought out by saber interactive and knowing saber s history i was not excited just another good product bought out by a wasteful and short sighed profit oriented company i thought it happens so much in our modern world that i don t know why we put up with it and now a season pass paid dlc where before the old devs released it for free a horrible performance update that made the game a whole lot buggier just to apparently accommodate console players ugh i still love the game though i just won t be updating to 1 5 not until saber stops ignoring the desires of teardown s community 1 4 and the mods that were made for it are enough for me
