2021 early access review although i really love this game i cannot recommend it the open field battles are fun but that s pretty much the only thing this game has going for it every other aspect of the game is lacking diplomacy is non existent ai pathing is horrible units will charge whatever is closest to them this makes it extremely easy to cheese the ai you can just use your cavalry to run through the enemy while your archers pick them off siege battles are practically unplayable the ai sometimes gets stuck on the siege towers or simple refuses to use them all together characters are extremely shallow every lord noble or companion feels like an empty husk there are no dynamics between the player and the lords nobles companions let alone a dynamic between lords nobles themselves choices feel insignificant everything you do feels little of impact economy is lackluster you can have your own businesses or caravans and certain item prices will adapt to whatever the villages near it produce but it doesn t go further than that towns feel dead the only time you visit a town physically is to buy a business or for a catch the spy quest lacking features from previous game no companion quests setting up camp books we don t even have feasts promised crime system is non existent campaign map problems lack of features ai sometimes will go deep into the enemy territory to raid or set up a siege you cannot suggest a course of action to lords like you could in the previous game you cannot even tell your companion parties what to do even the pathing here is horrible caravans that are in the proximity of an enemy will not adapt their path but will just move back and forth ai is just pathetic overall in combat as well as on the campaign map if they siege one of your castles or towns just siege one of theirs and they will stop immediately when the ai raises an army it doesn t even bring enough food for a week ai doesn t use any tactics either during combat they just charge their horse archers first put their cav on the side and put the rest of their units behind the ai does 0 effort to protect their cav units it s only 2 months away from its anniversary release and overall we haven t seen much improvement there is still even small things that are broken like certain perks smithing item prices i am sure i am missing a lot of other issues it s a shame because this game has so much potential
