2023 development needs to slow down many of the core issues stem from short development cycles that need more time before release each week new content releases and this is okay however the new content always needs bug fixes and patches the community is okay with this due to the resource compensation but the quick production cycles are causing issues internally e g the previous update introduced ut4 while it was announced beforehand ut4 s cost in relation to the amount of ut4 s now available was overwhelming with the current announcement it is clear that it wasn t just overwhelming for players the update as it was released was mired with bugs and incorrect descriptions as a suggestion ut4 should have been released in batches to promote usage of lower tier ids and egos at ut4 please take more time to reconsider the message of your game and its production fans would rather have pm establish transparency than make patchwork decisions
