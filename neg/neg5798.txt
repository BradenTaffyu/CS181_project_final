2018 game was super bad at launch but i worked through the pain and played it becouse i love the seting and i was a super fan of previous total war games in the end they patched it but it still has some wierd core mechanics and gameplay that just doesn t feel as good as previous games it basically feels like a arcade downgrade on total war recent update introducing political correctnes and making almost all generals from ancient time women and devs telling people who do not like that to not play it is just pissing on a bonefire of a game
