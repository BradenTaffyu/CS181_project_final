2021 really loved this game sunk about 100 hours and who knows how much money on dlc which is mostly way too expensive for the content you get for each all the dlc combined should cost like 40 50 bucks imo end game crisis is just stupid as hell ruins the entire experience for me never fails that as soon as a crisis fleet shows up eating up the galaxy rather than fight back against it the ai empires will invariably do absolutely nothing to defend themselves and in some cases decide to start a war with you or other empires just to weaken themselves and you even further terrible ai empires there is literally only one way to win this game dominate the galaxy utterly and completely or the endgame will use the other ai empires to your disadvantage in one way or another want to play as a merchant empire that is friends with everyone and loves diplomacy that s great except the crisis will kill you want to play a xenophobic race that builds tall and avoids contact with other empires focusing exclusively on inward expansion and tech that s great except the crisis will kill you want to be the leader of a federation so you can control multiple empires ships in order to combat the end crisis that s great except as soon as the crisis happens you will be voted out as leader of the federation the ai will split the killer fleets into 100 small fleets and promptly proceed to suicide them against the crisis forces take over the entire galaxy before the crisis or you are dead plain and simple which renders all these dlc s that allow you to play different empire types playstyles etc totally pointless because if you use themthe crisis will kill youone star for the terrible ai management of empires which combined with the crisis ruins the entire experience for me game would be awesome if your allies would actually defend themselves once in a while conclusion don t waste your money on the dlc because they will end up being totally useless especially the one that gives you the subterfuge stuff absolutely useless
