2023 i still play warthunder i am falling away from this game more and more often due to the lack of support for actual free to play players tho a long time ago i caved bought a few premium planes and was actually able to enjoy the game before that i was gritting my teeth every match at the lack of silver lion profit and the minuscule research points rewards from non premium vehicles its not that i wouldn t recommend the game but i couldn t recommend it as a free to play game as it currently stands no realistic way to approach the higher tier vehicles without investing a whole years worth of passive gaming only playing 4 6 hours a week exists even if you do grind out a plane and unlock it some high tier planes are impossible to support the cost of specifically in the simulation modes i think that this game has great value it could but currently does not provide to people who value simulated vehicular combat and those who want to dabble in a watered down versions of simulated vehicular combat
