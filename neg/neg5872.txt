2018 i have played rhis for 141 5hrs onr ecord and hundreds more hours offline and i just want to say this game is very buggy and ca refuses to fix the bugs they will attribute the negativity to the resistance against their sjw advocacy but the real problem is that this game is broken how can you keep releasing new content but completely ignore the bug fixes that are needed i have come to the conclusion as evidenced by their reaction to the thread about female generals which i actually do not mind that ca does not care about us the consumers they want our money and are very self righteous about getting it do not buy do not support those who refuse to support you by the way if you fix the bugs and improve gameplay i will turn that thumb upside down
