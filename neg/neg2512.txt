2018 the game isn t bad the problem is accessability i am able to read but my vision is not optimal roughly 20 40 reading vision in 1 eye and 20 100 in the other it is extremely hard for me to read the text and it strains my eyes for a normal sim game this isn t a bad thing but for a story oriented building sim game where the story is the prime feature of the game everything is built around it doesn t cut it that i struggle to read the tiny text of the decisions i can t get any enjoyment out of this i played this when it first came out stopped quickly after because of the interface scaling i went to give it a try again and there s nothing in the interface or graphics options that scales anything
