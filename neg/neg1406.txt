2020 early access review if you re a massive fan of m b don t get this game it s not moved on youtube video mount and blade bannerlord the big surprise 8 years in the making views 214 mount and blade ii bannerlord released onto early access for 40 in march 2020 after some eight years in on and off development extremely poor follow up to mount blade warband early access or not this sequel has been in development for years and the lack of features development of the core game is dreadful other games have moved on this hasn t and doesn t look like it will not worth 20 in current state let alone 40 what s happened in 8 years of development it s hard to tellat first glance bannerlord sticks to the tried and tested format which has served it so well through the series amass a band of mercenaries and off you go serving and conquering the world of calradia as you please there s not much plot presumably because it s a sandbox and all that gets in the way of the fighting when it comes down to strategy it s a glorious mass cavalry charge or a pre peppering with arrows as the enemy is on you within a few moments the towns and villages serve as points to fight over or trade with but don t bother walking around them as you can t really interact with anything and there s a handful of generated missions which you can do to for money or to improve relations that s ok when you are playing an indie developer s rough and ready sandbox rpg in 2008 but to trot out the same concept 12 years later with so little progress is abysmal this is diablo 3 territory a real step backwards players sunk hundreds of hours into the original and some fantastic mods kept them coming back for more the core game is poor by 2020 s standards i can t see that happening here as the core game is so poor by today s standards now i know it s early access and that the game won t be officially released for some months but looking at what s planned and to charge 40 pounds for what is effectively a buggy revamp is scandalous cavalry combat is still exhilarating but overall the melee system looks pedestrian compared to the likes of mordhau 95 of the npcs are completely worthless firing out the same stock phrases while many can t say anything at all unbelievably there s no voice acting buggy clunky repetitive all civilian environments are sterile superficial afterthoughts you can t kill anyone steal anything or even smash anything up swing a sword at someone s head and it bounces off speak to people politely or passively aggressively nothing changes quests don t work and the ui system has got console port written all over it everything feels so monotonous larger battles add to the fun factor but it just feels like a mount and blade mod with hd graphics not one of the most eagerly awaited games of the past few years there s so much potential but in reality very little has been added to the core game you re left with a cavalry combat slugfest and a handful of grindy missions taking you from one soulless settlement to another sandbox doesn t mean you can t have background and narrative look at rimworld for instance but if you aren t going to bother then why force us to wander through empty towns and villages that aren t even procedurally generated battle brothers does this well as it stands early access or not bannerworld feels like a lost opportunity to capitalise on what was an outstanding concept it s not even close worth to buying until it s half price and the mod community have worked their magic the good huge variety in weapons mountsup to 2 000 soldiers per fight for some epic battlescombat while clunky and simplistic is funearly access the game should improve the bad far too many loading screens for even the most trivial things slows the experience down hugely extremely limited interaction with world objects non combat scenarios all seem a bit pointlessawful tutorial doesn t teach you how to use the rather poor strategy systemvery small variety in quests many buggedno depth to any of the inhabitants of the world aside companionsway too expensiveterrible ui makes everything monotonousno strategy in fights just a straight up slugfest 99 of the time
