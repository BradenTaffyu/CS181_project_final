2016 better then rome 2 and atilla worse then shogun 2 a faithful warhammer game bogged down by dlc cut content and simplifying sieges while i enjoy the game it s kind of like two steps forward and one step backwards yeah that s pretty much the best way to call it two steps forward one step back wait for a sale unless you are a diehard warhammer fantasy fan
