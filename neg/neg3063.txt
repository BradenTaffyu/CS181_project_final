2022 after putting a few hundred hours into this game including a recent run that i ended after creating a 30ish pawn colony complete with about a dozen slaves i m still vacillating between recommending this or not as i write the review that s ok because there s a million other reviews and youtube videos i m mostly writing this to organize my thoughts what i will say is if you aren t willing to deal with lots of mods it s not recommended i played my first couple runs completely vanilla and after reaching a certain size they become unmanageable there is no stack stacking so every piddly little pile of wool or wood takes up its own square a colony with 5 pawns requires a small football field covered in random stuff by midgame as a consequence the first thing you should do when installing this game is figure out a storage mod my most recent colony s storage would cover half the map or something absurd in vanilla the game s branding should be a story creator for people who like the way we tell stories or people who have an i t degree this leads me into their story creation they try to do this with mental health mood management random events raids and quests the quests random events and raids are all pretty good when you first start playing the mental health stuff seem to do a fairly good job of this but eventually it just feels like you re in a constant wrestling match with rnjesus you ll have slaves go into sad wanders because you cut someone s liver out because historically if your slave is having a bad day the owners who are willing to remove someone s liver let their slave have the day off soldiers standing on a firing line waiting for the enemy go into sad wanders because they didn t have lunch because historically if your soldier is hungry you let them wander around doing nothing and craftsmen decide to go smash up the piece of art they spent 3 days working on because they ate lunch without a table literally not a joke modeling people s mood as a based on arbitrary conditions without any context beyond an additional for expectations is stupid and it leads to a constant stream of the aforementioned idiocy i m now going to relate the high points of my most recent rimworld run tl dr the game didn t have enough basic sliders for me to play it the way i wanted to i started out the run with three colonists a transhumanist ideology and the goal of creating a 30 40 pawn strong highly stratified society run by a completely arcotech modded godqueen and her army of biomodded supersoldiers over the course of time i made the religion more and more extreme as the leaders moved further away from their humanity they captured enemies brainwashed and biomodded the strong and enslaved the weak eventually they came to rule their rimworld as a group of post human monstrosities who participate in cannibalism due to nothing more than convenience at least that was the goal here s the actual experience i got my head canon fleshed out and decided to relocate to a mountainous region for better defense while i grew the colony s power it was about 10 strong at the time anyone who has played the game knows that people in caravans never seem to have mental breaks everyone in the game is at their happiest when they re just a dot moving along the map as soon as we arrived and began excavating the base however it was a nightmare the same people who were perfectly happy sleeping under the stars every night while traveling were ready to kill each other doing the same thing without traveling in fact one colonist went berserk you know that totally believable thing where you try to kill people because your bedroom wasn t dug out of the side of the mountain in 2 days or less and i had to kill him i started using the end mental state dev command after this the next bundle of fun was the throneroom i excavated a massive area had my best constructor make a silver and gold throne filled it with dozens of artworks marble columns and braziers built an altar for our religion out of jade called the fallen empire to get my queen her titles and you can t have an altar in a throneroom why ludeon says so well there s a checkbox somewhere though nope you need a mod then the slave population started growing and we started having more rebellion issues that s fine though because all you need to do is build some tranquilizer guns which are not in the base game in fact there isn t an attack non lethally option or anything you can have a rebelling slave who is literally incapable of violence and completely disarm one of your super soldiers and instead of just punching the guy they will use their implanted elbow blade to decapitate the poor slave bottom line is you need a tranq gun mod or you need to start playing god and anesthetizing the rebelling slaves with the console yay this brings us to raids the game gives you all sorts of turrets and ieds and other traps to defend your base in vanilla they re basically useless my base was getting raids of 200 300 loincloth wearing tribesmen by the end of the game which should be fine the problem is they dig knocking holes in walls and stuff like that is one thing but these stone club wielding tribesmen started digging towards the summit of my mountain it s both senseless and infuriating to have a bunch of what are supposed to be cavemen digging what in reality would be a tunnel thousands of feet long through a mountain all the way to the top in 3 hours this game seems to be having an identity crisis i m a game that tells stories i m a game that doesn t want to be too easy unbalanced so i m going to have mechanics that make no sense to be harder i mean really and once again it d be fine except there s no checkbox for harder raids that are stupid vs easier raids that make sense so i end up with two more mods to fix the raid behavior yay then i got all of my super soldiers 14 of them into the super high tech master chief bad armor that takes a ton of resources and time to build and i thought i have arrived but of course it was just another load of problems you can go through one fight with the aforementioned tribals and have the armor lose 20 of its condition it s supposed to be armor that gives you a fighting chance in the horrible space y battles of the far flung future so it should obviously be completely impervious to arrows and clubs instead not only does it get beat up but the pawn wearing it gets bruised to hell you have to choose between installing yet another mod so you can actually repair armor just spawning in new armor for your pawns with the console or actually maintaining a level of trade economy that will support constant production of overpriced crappy armor and when i say crappy armor i mean crappy armor the thing that got me to alt f4 the game and start on this review this evening was one of those little resource raids the game provides where you have some tribals whoever guarding some steel or wood or food i had 8 fully armed and biomodded colonists five had miniguns 2 had persona plasmaswords and one had a persona hammer the raid went fine to start until another 20 clubwielding tribals came in as reinforcements and i watched 5 6 of them beat to death one of my supersoldiers with 4 bionic limbs a coagulator a stoneskin gland a painstopper full cataphract armor fibrous mechanites and a plasmasword makes perfect sense this game i hope i never get sucked back in edit glittertech would probably fix these issues and revitalize the game for me afaict but it s not updated for ideology because counting on modders to do your job for you isn t the way to go
