2023 this is a great core game in an incredibly unsatisfying ecosystem card acquisition is interesting until you get to series 3 so after you ve collected all the starter cards and new cards tend to feel very pay to win im not saying that they are but it feels bad to have meta cards locked behind a paywall that are nerfed into obscurity once they get released to the public so to wrap up fun core game not fun economics
