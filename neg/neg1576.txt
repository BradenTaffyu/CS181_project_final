2022 i thought the other reviews were exaggerating about how weak mount and blade ii bannerlord was compared to warband but they weren t the maps quests weapons and economy don t show the same effort into balance and design there just isn t much non random content and the randomized content isn t that interesting the combat is the same as before which is still good but not as good as newer games like mordhau the only thing i can say was really improved was sieges and large battles i think too much focus was put on making better graphics and not improving on what the older games had to offer
