2023 leaving a negative review untill the relatively new and persistant multiplayer disconnect issue is resolved this game worked perfectly fine with multiplayer for years and then suddenly in the past year or so no one can remain connected to a lobby i host i see this issue on numerous threads with no solution supposedly a time out issue the devs need to correct so the server refreshes instead of kicking people i have tried every fix i have found over the past year or so and nothing works i love this game but this is a seriously ignored issue that needs to be fixed
