2017 no just pick up civ5 there is literally no reason to pay the ridiculous price they are asking for what is essentially a lesser game even comparing civ6 vanilla to 5 with no expansions it s just a no contest sure there s more options but it s infinitely less fun to play the ai is rubbish the interface is poor the dlc is overpriced micro mods there s just not enough here to stop playing 5 i tried i did i played 50 hours trying to enjoy it but i just couldn t i bought the collectors edition and just feel like i flushed 70 quid down the toilet i ve uninstalled it now and it would take a huge change to get me back at this point the current patch july 2017 actually just broke the game for me and that was the last straw and given that firaxis are going mental with the pricing for expansions see xcom2 expansion 35 quid for some new characters and enemies i don t see any future civ6 expansions being worth either the money or the time learn from my example and don t bother with this just keep playing buy civ5 it s a vastly superior game
