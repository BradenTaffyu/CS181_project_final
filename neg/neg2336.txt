2016 looking at the timer i see that i ve currently been waiting some 9 minutes for a traffic jam to clear up or rather nine minutes since i ve started the timer after i got sick waiting and started writing this when it behaves this game is quite serene and relaxing not to mention addictive the mechanics of the trucks is quite impressive if only they would fix all the annoyances 12 minutes i mean as a dlc to euro truck simulator this would be ok but as a separate game with a few years extra dev time i would expect a better experience the addition of police cars seemed like a good idea at first but the zero tolerance for speeding combined with there sixth sense for detecting speeding makes for an unpleasant experience i d like to see the real world cop that would accurately detect a 5 mph speeding in the rear view mirror 15 minutes and who the hell is fining me for hitting a red light when there is no one around once i actually got fined for backing out of an intersection when the light turned red and it turns red freakishly fast and how difficult would it be to add some logic to the traffic lights so i don t have to stop at every single intersection in a town less intelligent then the traffic light are the ai drivers so i ve waited for 17 minutes before pausing the game or else i would get fined for delayed delivery there is a great tendency for deadlocks sometimes cars are literally standing in a circle waiting for each other when trying to get out of deadlocks it s not uncommon for other cars to crash into you they could avoid it they just don t try to seeing a car decisively running into your side at a steady 10 mph is somewhat fascinating at first but it quickly gets old especially if you get fined for it sometimes you don t get fined for crashes caused by others but you never get compensation for any damage and for some reason or lack of it all time estimates in the game seems to assume an average speed of 38 mph no matter what why and what sort of bank only allows 4 fixed loan amounts and for some reason or lack of it all time estimates in the game seems to assume an average speed of 38 mph no matter what why and what sort of bank only allows 4 fixed loan amounts
