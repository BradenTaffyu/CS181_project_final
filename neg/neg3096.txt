2023 could be a great game excellent ui great graphics engrossing gameplay a proper sim but for an online sim racer to have no report function or ability to vote kick or ban has unfortunately ruined this game most online friendly races are 20 min so not exactly your 3 lap sprints however there has been a recent surge of trolling these include parking on the racing line behind blind corners and waiting for the lead pack parking off the track to wait for cars to t bone blatantly deliberate t 1 crashing deliberately ignoring blue flags to hold up crash into lead lap carsobviously some people find it fun to ruin other people s but when a game is doing seemingly nothing to prevent this its inevitable that people are going to wreck it will update if online issues are addressed
