2018 buying the game gets you half of it that is the sort of slimy underhanded policy pushed by ca and sega i have never seen a more disgusting dlc practice than i have with this game day one dlcs were included in this game several factions are either unplayable without paying another 10 dollars or so or don t even appear in the game without paying for it that is how awful a company ca has become the game itself is ok but there is little value for the cost imagine a game asking you to pay extra just to add blood and it doesn t even do a good job of it even worse this game does not allow modding how could it people would simply add new content that is fun without paying an arm and a leg for it when you buy a game you should get a game not half of one its one thing if they added a new campaign and it was a dlc but this game has obviously had content taken out of it to be resold at an extra cost and this sort of practice should never be condoned or supported
