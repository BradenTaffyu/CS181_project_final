2019 early access review alpha 17i ve spent countless hours playing this game i loved the game in alpha 16 and i really tried to like it in alpha 17 and i played at least 30 hours in it s current state this game was amazing buggy sure well optimized not really but despite that it was a one of a kind game that accomplished exactly what it set out to an experience in survival horror with elements of exploration base building and character building rpg with the release of alpha 17 every single one of these elements has been undermined or ruined i ll explain how by comparing the new mechanics for each compared to the alpha 16 mechanics of each survival in a16 it was fairly standard hard survival you had health stamina food and water if one goes down you should probably start thinking of a way to get it back up however the game in its 17a version has put a huge emphasis on making survival even harder but in doing so they ve ruined the survival element everything has become far more lethal to the point that surviving is more a game of can you avoid literally touching anything instead of finding a way to salvage a bad situation if anything bad happens you are already dead so while it s not a bullet hell its a bullet hell don t get hit or its game over horror there was something so awesome about zombies causing you to jump out of your skin by surprising you because you didn t expect them to be hiding around the corner in a16 that was a constant reality well you d have to have amnesia to be scared by zombies in a17 once again in an attempt to make the game harder they ve littered every building with ridiculous levels of zombies there is a zombie in every room and a few in the wardrobes attics and beneath the floors for good measure is it harder to search a random house sure but it s certainly predictable exploration exploring the ruins of civilization and scavenging together parts for better items was an awesome and rewarding experience in a16 you d search houses and abandoned stores for parts to guns and other items to help you survive well in a17 with the massive zombie count in every location it s barely worth exploring any building before you could even approach the building you have to spend a large amount of time drawing out and killing each zombie turning exploration into a tedious grind but to make it worse they decreased the item counts and removed gun parts so now their is less scavenging for bits and pieces and the hope of instead of stumbling upon full weapons and getting extremely lucky to find items at all so don t explore just make your own stuff the game will punish you for exploring in a17 base building base building was a unique part of the game where you would work to design a base that was as zombie proof as possible you d think of ways to outsmart the zombie hordes but also give you the vantage points you needed to fight back and take out the approaching horrors in a16 is was a great challenge and rewarding experience using your superior intelligence you could outsmart the zombies and build defenses that cut them down well once again in an attempt to make things harder a17 has removed defense options but also made zombies super intelligent and tough as nails it s worthless to build traps because zombies just avoid them and if you force them into one they just shrug them off and kill you anyway so harder yes better base building challenge not really character building this is probably the worst thing they ve done to the game in a16 a system of allowing you to improve in the skills as you used them meant that if you wanted to get good with a bow you d have to use a bow a bunch made sense and felt rewarding well in a17 they ve replaced this with pure point system where you gain xp from all activities then dump points into whatever you d like but even more they restrict you from focusing on anything you are arbitrarily locked on progress until you manage to reach a high enough overall level but the real crime of this system is that no longer is it worth spending time doing anything but killing zombies why because in a17 since xp is the only way to level up skills you do the one task that grinds the most xp so spending all day grinding zombie kills is the only way to play if you want to improve your skills but there s more another thing they killed was the ability for you to scavenge and find books and manuals to learn skills in a16 you would raid book stores to learn skills and abilities well the experience system has killed this entirely no more scavenging for knowledge to improve your character no just kill zombies till you learn how to build a car i used to love this game and if they revert these abhorrent changes i d recommend it again until that day however avoid this game because it is not what it claims to be it has undermined and ruined its own mechanics in search of harder gameplay and become a shell of it s former self
