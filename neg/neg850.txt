2016 i will start by saying i have played fallout 1 fallout 3 and fallout nv and am a huge fan of the fallout universe and bethesda games in general i would recommend this game to anyone looking for an adventure fps similar to far cry post apocalyptic boston looks beautiful in fo4 the map is pretty big and there s lots to explore and of course the mods are pretty much what makes me continue to play however bethesda let down all the rpg gamers by stripping the roleplaying game elements that made fallout games so awesome and replacing them with mainstream mediocrity by dumbing them down in previous fallout installments various quest progressions and dialogue choices were unlocked if you re character passed skill checks in fo3 in the middle of the city megaton is a huge undetonated pre war bomb the sheriff asks you to disarm it and if you meet the explosives skill check you can if you want to or i could detonate it or i could use my repair skill to offer to fix a radio for a local store owner for some caps now there is no more skill checks and no more uniqueness to your characters skills are fully replaced with perks which is all fine and dandy except besides the benefit your perks give you it doesn t affect the game in any other way now there is no noticeable difference in story progression and roleplaying choices if you re a hulk with 10 strength who lives to smash your enemies skulls in with sledgehammers or you re the next nicola tesla who evaporates your enemies with energy weapons before they re even aware you re in the room speaking of dialogue choices and skill checks they totally dumbed down the dialogue mechanic as well instead of having unique conversations depending on how you chose to roleplay your character you re now restricted to only four dull options yes no repeat what you said and sarcastic yes what happened to being a prick and telling people off there s no more telling a general you want to kill them so much or telling a kid your face looks like my butt it s just bland dialogue and it s mind numbing and makes the story feel like it s dragging on another disappointment is the lack of moral choices fo4 offers sure there are some small choices like making a mom pay a drug dealer for the son s jet he got hooked on or to defend the family from the drug dealers but that s nothing compared to blowing up an innocent town and obliterating hundreds of innocent people effectively removing a whole town because someone offered you a nice house or even because you just wanted to be evil for funsies or in fo nv the starting town you can defend the citizens from raiders or you can meet with the leader and agree to help take over and have a battle royale with the people who helped you on your feet that s messed up and i miss being messed up even the main story lacks dramatic moral choices it pretty much consists of what faction you join and all the factions are morally gray anyways so it s more of what ideology you align with 6 0 10 all in all fallout 4 is a good fps adventure game vast open world alright gun and settlement mechanics but it really sucks that bethesda took one of the greatest rpgs and stripped a lot of the roleplay aspect out of it skills don t play an active role in the story lack of dialogue options and lack of opportunities to act morally reprehensible strip fallout of any meaningful roleplaying elements roleplay is was what made fallout fallout
