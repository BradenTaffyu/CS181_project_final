2021 early access review close but not quite recommendable in its current state this is a nice little factorio clone and does space better than factorio mods do but it has a small number of things missing some of which will frustrate you no end 1 no blueprint copy ability devs if you read this this is the thing that would change this review to a thumbs up seriously this game doesn t have blueprints undo cut copy paste the ability to lay out a build without having all the parts in your personal inventory the ability to lay out inserters sorters before the things they re connecting are placed by the construction drones and no way to build from non personal storage this makes scaling up which you do before leaving your first solar system increadably tedious and discourages clever direct insertion builds because you can t lay it out once then duplicate you have to lay it out by hand every time which means you re just going to do long lines of machines because they re hard to mess up 2 it s not actually grid based the planets have a square grid which you are mostly locked to but where you can place things is actually dependent on the building hitboxes not the grid this means that sometimes you can fit a power pole between two belts on one gridline and sometimes you need a second gridline left empty for no reason 3 unity and modding support it s a unity engine game so the mods will be buggy at best i ve certainly been spoilt by factorio here but i don t think comparing it to factorio is unjust since it is a factorio clone 5 no time pressure in some ways this is nice but the lack of time pressure combined with getting infinite power sources right at the start means that this game has no pressure at all you can leave it running overnight and have no consequences if you want to combined with the difficulty of scaling up and the lack of complexity in the recipies this makes it unfailable there is no possibility of getting to a state where you cannot win it s so close to being a wonderful little gem of a game but it just missed the mark it is still in early access though so all these things could get fixed with time
