2019 so all the fans that have already bought nier before goty release gets essentially screwed over by square enix for all the time and support they have given for this awesome game and can t even buy or upgrade their game to goty to get features that for some reason are only exclusive to goty version that everyone else beside those that bought the game before goty release can get they have also rereleased the game without fixing any issues that have been since first release date that you still can only fix by yourself using programs made by very dedicated modders from this awesome community that still cares for the game abandoned by it s dev clearly this shows that square enix cares only for money and couldn t care less for their games and their players this is very sad that this have happend to such great game as nier but seems like it s just another reason to the list as to why never again give square enix any more money until they stop being consumed by such greed
