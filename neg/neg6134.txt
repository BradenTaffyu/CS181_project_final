2023 the weakest entry to the series devs lazily selling nostalgia cartoonish world of warcraft graphics ridiculously short and boring campaign narrator is awful worst of all instead of using the in game engine to make cutscenes with the actual characters you are playing devs used real world modern day recorded drone footage with yellow stick figures superimposed while the narrator drones on about info not relevant to the missions embarrassingly lazy part 4 of aoe it s obvious the devs were hoping and praying the even lazier multiplayer would make them bank while putting less than minimum effort into the campaign too bad multiplayer is dead as well
