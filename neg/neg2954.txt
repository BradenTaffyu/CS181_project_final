2018 in an update this game changed for what i bought into something else lacking in features i previously enjoyed while stellaris has not been bogged down by dlc yet like other games from paradox the change that all galactic civilizations have to start and can only start with hyperlane travel feels very constricting compared to what it was before yes i could revert to 1 9 but as the devs and paradox choose to advertise their updates as free when they are taking the parts out i liked aslong as that happens i can t help but feel shortchanged since in reality the updates don t feel free when i have to give up game features for them paradox has many g en wikipedia org a en wikipedia org m en wikipedia org e en wikipedia org s that embrace unbalance and asymetric gameplay and other games clearly benefit from not being balanced an example would be binding of isaac where some items are just superior to the point that they can break your run so why would stellaris need these changes before the patch you were able to setup your game to force all civs to play with hyperlane only so if someone considered the other options too strong he could do something about it but i can t make my game the way i want it after the patch wich is infuriating gateway travel now is split up into wormholes wich are essentially hyperlanes that just go alot further than their normal counterpart and almost unecessairly overpriced megastructures requiring so much time that any warfaring civ could kill you before you are even able to set it up this is accounting for the time it takes research to get there and the randomness of research and jumpdrives leave the only type of ship you now want to use it on your army weaker wich makes it so that you just use the hyperlane network anyway that can not seriously be what they wanted right research ships get a similarly strong option earlier all in all if you are considering to buy this product understand that there was one more option while making your civ wich affected your nation the entire game taken away in one patch if the developers would feel like they need todo changes to anything else it might happen again and instead of leaving in a hold over they will just take it out completly and that feature might be your favorite thing about this game and due to that i simply can t recommend the game even if people would try to sway my opinion in the comments i can only hope that future patches can equalize this because it makes me sad that a game a like is being bogged down by a percieved lack of choice one that the devs did not need to make
