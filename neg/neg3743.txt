2019 early access review i played this game more than 350 hours and i believe i know enough to comment on this game unfortunately it will not be a nice comment it has great potential unfortunately this potential is wasted instead of fixing a lot of nonsense critical problems devs seem to be more interested in how to make pathfinding zombies exploding policemen digging zombies or spitting birds wtf this is the solution to balance the game spitting and exploding fat zombies because bases can be too strong for regular zombies make the bases weaker prevent anything stronger than reinforced wood to be built don t allow the player to build a damn reinforced concrete castle or a steel palace only to be challenged by an army of zombies which has spitting vultures as air force so freakin disappointing and nerve wracking yea sure it completely makes sense for zombies to have structural knowledge of the building and they always know exactly where to strike and all of them navigate and attack this particular place like its a orchestrated military operation while exploding policemen charge the base to challenge the player yes congratulations it makes perfect sense this all sounds very normal and realistic and fun i agree sarcasm i am not even talking about the potato graphics broken water behavior and some nonsense mechanics such as putting 1 tile of dirt and grow a 150 feet tree on it and to think this game sold over 10 million copies and this is the result instead of fixing all broken mechanics waste more time with zombie navigation which by definition makes no sense a zombie is a zombie it doesn t need to be smart use it to your advantage do not waste your resources on zombie navigation instead fix the 1000 broken and nonsense things in the end i would say stay away look at other games or at least wait for a big discount definitely don t buy for full price this is my first negative review for a game on steam
