after playing 100 hrs and finishing this game i found it very empty any choices that you make have no consequences for any relationships with the characters or the main story your basically following the story line and are unable to make any meaningful impact in it you can t save anyone or truly kill the bad guys unless that s part of the predetermined story outcome i there were features i liked and could see the love those designers put into them the baby beasts are super cute but over all i felt no connection to the world through my character
