2017 honestly i can t recommend this game at the moment people may not remember how boring the base game of civ5 was and how much better it became with expansions but unfortunately civ6 needs to get there too after 50 turns you ve pretty much won and by the time you have a modern army you can send your modern armor against their musketmen and knights with ease because the ai really can t tech and it never seems to upgrade its units diplomacy is non existent and just straight up doesn t work wonders are also generally pretty weak and very few are worth losing a usable tile i regret buying this instead of playing civ5 and the excellent community balance patch
