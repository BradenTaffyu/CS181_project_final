2016 if you like the first rome total war game you ll love this one i recommend it but have given it a thumbs down because of the dlc i love this game you can see that through my hours of game time it s an excellent sequel to the original 2004 game they ve done everything better except the damn dlc it s totally pathetic that they create and entire game sell you 60 of it and sell the rest off as tiny bits of dlc because of this i had to wait until the game was on sale so i could swallow my pride and buy the blood and gore add on for 60c they ve done exactly the same with attila only buy this game if it s on sale then you can get all the extras without breaking your wallet
