2021 rigged matchmaker a lot of players already know about the rigged matchmaker and have learned to cope with it but from what i read on the various forums for the game many players still have no idea what is going on there is no skill in world of tanks only predetermined matches dictate your skill based on how bad or good you are thanks to droodles blitz and company who took their time to expose wargaming and their rigged matchmaker for the full breakdown i strongly recommend watching their video apparently wargaming did not appreciate people exposing their scams so videos of them are being censored luckily i already quoted the important points from the video below youtube video the mm is rigged views 18 194 in today s video ill be talking about a serious topic when it comes to world of tanks mm my discord support my content if you want a short version here are some parts of the patent with my own comments each battle session is assigned a battle level each battle level is used to limit participating vehicles to predefined tiers that are included in that battle session thereby providing a unique method of creating a balanced battle session as players progress and advance in experience the player or vehicle will gradually be moved into higher battle levels based on the experience attributes and capabilities of each player s characters and or vehicles so a battle level is an algorithm the matchmaker uses to determine how good you are at the game and how good the tanks are if your battle level is high and you drive a tank the matchmaker also determine to have a high battle level you are going to get worse matchmaking and the game will try to screw you over like an online casino the hidden algorithm makes sure you don t win too much more on that below each vehicle may be one of a standard vehicle and a premium vehicle where a first premium vehicle is associated with a lower range of battle levels than a first standard vehicle of the same tier and or type as the first premium vehicle basically what this tells us is that if you buy a premium tank you are going to have better matchmaking in general because the lower your battle level the better battles you are put in this is a prime example of pay to win where players are fooled into a false sense of accomplishment when in reality it is the matchmaker boosting your skill players who have just aquired a new higher tier vehicle are encouraged by being placed in battle sessions near the lower boundary of that vehicle s accessibility range which allows the player feel more comfortable in the game with time the balancing system starts putting them into higher levels battle sessions which creates a challenge with more upgraded opponent vehicles ever wondered why when you buy a new tank the first few battles are ridiculously easy when your battle level decreases this instantly goes away depending on how good you are with the tank this is how wargaming sells their overpriced premium tanks when everyone praises the tank for being overpowered the first week when their battle levels decrease it becomes just a normal tank and the hype goes away this is usually when the sale ends the matchmaking server may store a win loss percentage for each user or vehicle at a given battle level as the player s win loss ratio decreases the player becomes more likely to be placed in battles having battle levels at the lower end of the allowable range whereas the player s win loss ratio increases the player becomes more likely to be placed in battles having battle levels at the upper end of the allowable range this when a player has been repeatedly put into too many difficult battles the balancing is done in favor of easier battle sessions thereby encouraging the player by providing an easier game environment similarly when the player has been repeatedly put into too many easy battles the balancing is done in favor of harder battles sessions thereby keeping the player challenged instead of letting the player become borded with easy games this point is self explanatory if you consistently win battles it will punish you but if you consistently lose battles the matchmaker will balance by helping you so again there is no skill in world of tanks only predetermined matches dictating your skill based on how bad or good you are
