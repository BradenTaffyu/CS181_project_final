2017 i really genuinely want to recommend this game it s definitely got some fun to it and has some very neat systems in place districts and adjacency bonuses while not perfect add a layer of strategy and planning that i appreciate wonders being moved to tiles instead of cities deters wonder whoring and adds potential for greater effects civs feel a bit more fleshed out and varied dlc civs in particular mind you in terms of both abilities and playstyles the science civic tree split both makes sense and alongside governments and policy cards feels better than social policies did in civ v religion espionage and city states have much more depth and impact than they had in civ v mods are easier to impliment and switch out and don t disable achievements and i do have to commend firaxis for recognizing complaints and giving digital deluxe folks 3 more civs than initially promised but the ai is ditzy and unforgiving agendas kill diplomacy completely and lead to rapid denouncements the soundtrack is inferior to civ v and very repetitive the tech tree is paltry and poorly connected researching flight before i can even build castles swordsmen progressing to musketmen progressing to modern infantry the late game is astoundingly boring movement of units is slow and stiff barbarians come in nigh insurmountable droves sean bean s readings are boring and the quotes he reads are lame hotfixes have to wait for slow periodic patches leaving glaring bugs in the game for longer than they should be not to mention the blatant cashgrabbing with how dlc is handled the full game is 80 let s be real it s genuinely repulsive to see civ stoop to this level tl dr it s almost there and is fun in some aspects but ultimately falls flat and has some glaring issues that keep it from being truly enjoyable
