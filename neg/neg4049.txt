2021 the game is fun and good quality rougelike its just so very often the design is plain stupid when game which one of main features is speed and tempo puts you spikes beneath some drop outside of your fov it makes you mad when creature which shoot through walls shoot at you outside of your fov its plain stupid design after 80 hours i just cant anymore to much stupid level designs to much rage to much bitter feeling never felt that with hollow knight never ever felt that with hadesi constantly leave the game in rage just because i dont feel that the f ups is my mistakes usually its some game design that f you scummy way and they call it challenge the fov is poor no widescreen option they said it will be cheating in a way well i guess limit your fov the way you cant see the danger is the right way in their vision il give you example in a game after you kill enemies fast enough you will get a limited but major speed buff that will replenish for each kill afterward you will get the tempo and will fly as fast as you can now as you run some times you will climb up or drop down both ways the fov just so limited that you will get hit hurt or killed by something something just cause you didnt saw it if you drop down its even more stupid you can drop slow and get fall stun at the landing or you can hard drop with power smash at the ground this is when they like to put some spikes beneath the intuition is lost like sonic games when the game is all about the speed and tempo but when you got the speed the game is punish you with some unseen spikes or enemies that shoot you beyond your fovits not challenge its unfair as i said never felt that with hades never with hollow knight every fail felt fair and my mistake
