tldr don t buy it get any other game or just go buy a nice dinner i bought the game at launch with no intention of buying any dlc and the fact forza keeps pushing to get you purchase more after you ve already bought it and the driving physics being last gen is a complete turn off the way most vehicles handle is samey enough that it makes me regret buying it all i do is boot it up once every 6 months look at some cars get sad about the state of the auction house look at the cars and close it i have tried to like it because i paid for it at launch and can t refund it but it just sucks it really just sucks its been such a disappointing experience for me so much so that i will never buy another forza game i do not care what they do next in the series i am done all forza is to me at this point is a glorified virtual hot wheels container not worth the money at all you would be better off spending what forza costs on a nice dinner and beam ng drive in my opinion have a nice day and be kind to yourself edit dev response clearly shows they did not read this continues to show the level of care they put into their products
