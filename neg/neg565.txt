i really tried to like this game i loved library of ruina and lobotomy corporation both of their previous games were heavily challenging and encouraged the player to think hard on how to tackle the obstacles faced in those games while providing great music story and gameplay limbus company s gameplay ruins the game by making it a complete chore pay to win i don t understand the majority of the community s abhorence to players using simple speedhack to grind through the incredibly boring auto fight dungeons to those against using speed hacks wondering why i and those like me don t want to spend 30min to an hour per dungeon run some of us would rather use that time to do anything else fun or jack off not oh man i forget to press auto fight for the 3000th time for the story mode if you didn t pick up an op character in a season you missed welp i hope you like cheesing the dungeons until you pick up a character that can beat the difficulty spike honestly just watch the story online without comments that s all there is to this game i really like project moon as a company hell i went to their cafe and bought one every souvenir in the gift shop really awesome place btw but this game is a miss aside from story characters and the music by mili also great the only positive thing i can put is just buy their previous 2 games instead of supporting games as a service
