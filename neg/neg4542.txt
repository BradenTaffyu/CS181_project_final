2018 the game is perfectly fun i ve enjoyed playing but it comes packaged with spyware redshell and sadly after removing the offending file civ 6 won t run the dll in question has as its express purpose to help the company advertise by checking things you do even when not using the game sadly again the game will not run when the spyware is uninstalled and the only recourse is to stop playing the game all together in spite of the fun i ve had with the game i can t suggest a game that not only comes with spyware but refuses to run when that spyware which has nothing to do with playing the game is removed
