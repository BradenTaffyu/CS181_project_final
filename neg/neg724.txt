2017 creation club microtransactions how about you choke on a moldy i honstly dont care about cc its the fact that any time they add something to cc the whole game needs to update which means f4se needs to update too probably any real mods that use f4se big issue is these things dont always update right when the game does you have to wait for everyone to make the needed patches thanks beth for breaking my game with your half assed cash grab your mods dont even look very good most of them i wouldnt use for free
