2018 creative assembly broke the hell out of the game with the new politics mechanic gameplay has been artificially stretched out by overly expensive political mechanics that only delay the inevitable civil war that always starts away from your armies forcing you to hold back to deal with it only to have you rinse and repeat this process many times rise of the republic dlc multiplies this 100 times diplomacy in the game is a joke as well as the ai refuses to deal with you once your imperium level reaches a certain point and the best part about that mess is every minor faction ai will declare war on you and descendant upon you with 3 full stack armies filled with archer spam i actually enjoyed rome 2 before the politics update but now its ruined do yourself a favor and skip this game if you must have it then wait a few months for the modders to update their no civil war mods because civil wars literally kill this game now
