2019 there was a time when i would have highly recommended this game to anyone but the developers of stellaris have apparently never heard the phrase if it s not broken don t fix it stellaris is the classic case of trying to improve something that already works and breaking it in the process it seems that every patch adds unnecessary complexity to a game that already demanded your full attention and breaks something that previously worked perfectly fine i unfortunately cannot recommend this game anymore it has become a shell of its former self riddled with expensive underwhelming cash grab dlc and three years of awful pointless fixes that have broken it beyond recognition
