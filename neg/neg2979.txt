2018 the 2 0 patch quite apart from the multiple game breaking bugs with which is ridden is a significant step backwards in both mechanical functionality and vision for the game not only has a wealth of content been cut from the game you will not have only the most boring of ftl types available for everyone boo hyperlanes but the mechanics put in place seem hopelessly incompetently thought out ever wondered what stellaris would feel like if the expansion stage of the game took four times as long both in game time and in player time investment required in order to produce a splotchy patchwork of a galaxy as every nation never claims the myriad of systems to avoid taking penalities to their science unsurprisingly it s really really this is without even getting onto war exhaustion the new raider things and the buggy as all hell fleet manager seriously this is more than a massive step backwards it a cataclysmic failure of vision and mechanical competence
