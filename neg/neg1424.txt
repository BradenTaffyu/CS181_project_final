2020 early access review honestly as much as i love warband i can t give this game a positive review in it s current state after almost 150 hours over the last 6 months the stability of singleplayer has regressed significantly since launch and multiplayer is both broken and effectively dead only region with a single consistenly full server is in europe i think this game will be good in a year or two but right now no if you re invested in singleplayer only then it might be worth it if you want to play multiplayer definitely wait until it s patched more this feels like a rough beta more than what i d expect of an early access title with this price tag
