2018 early access review imagine you re playing and you reach an area where you absolutely need an m 16 to get past a boss about a third of the way through the game so you go through the challenging bits to get an m 16 and then you go to the boss and you fire it and you suddenly are dying and you don t know why hours of research and forum searches and chat room conversations later and you discover that this game s version of an m 16 has a little poison injector built into the trigger that poisons and kills you every time you fire it and you have to arbitrarily know somehow that you need to find poison protection of some kind in order to use an m 16 that would be unintuitive and frustrating right well that s this game right now with heat as an example there s a device that s essentially a water filter you pump water through sand it filters out all the bad except mysteriously this sieve will take any dirty water whether it s near freezing or near boiling and magically output it at temperatures you d only find at the height of summer 40c 104f and you might need that water to grow plants except if they get above 30c they don t grow and so you spend hours trying to figure out how you re supposed to get a glorified britta filter to not create magic heat out of thin air only to find out you have to jump through crazy hoops to cool the water down after the fact because the device can t be fixed to not magic heat from nowhere the expected solution is that you re not supposed to use a sieve anywhere near what you re growing and you re supposed to skip past the second type of food available to you and immediately head to the third type which can only be obtained by braving toxic disease ridden environments long before you re actually equipped to deal with them that s this game right now frustrating non intuitive mechanics food heat other stuff that result in people getting mired in the early to mid game if you don t know the one specific expected solution or expected choice you should have been growing mushrooms rather than worrying about devices breaking the laws of physics you just fail some day this game might be worthwhile there s definitely something worthwhile in here but a free form base building game with multiple survival esque mechanics with what look like multiple possible ways of addressing issues should not be designed with only a single solution in mind and particularly not obtuse non intuitive ones that break conservation of energy
