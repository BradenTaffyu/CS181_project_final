2023 667 hours into this game maybe a 100 of those hours unmodded i cannot in good faith recommend this game in its current state to anyone new or old player alike the base game somehow feels less complete and less polished than warband mechanics from the previous game that did make it over feel stripped down and bare bones over world lord ai seems worse and easier to confuse than the relatively simple ai of warband the devs released an incomplete game and have relied on community support to make the game playable i should not have to add mods to add basic content that was promised as recently as 0 9 0 the trickle of patches the devs provide only serve to break the mods the make the game enjoyable
