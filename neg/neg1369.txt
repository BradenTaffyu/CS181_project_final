2020 early access review since it s early access i won t talk about bugs or missing features does bannerlord have the potential to be a great game absolutely but it isn t there yet not anywhere close the biggest surprise is the unit promotions which unlike other games of this kind make a meaningful difference on the battlefield as a direct result choosing any unit s progression path becomes an integral part of the fun to figure out one s best desired army composition as a side effect in the arena tournaments even standard units can become tough nuts to crack kudos for that the two by far most annoying features on the other hand are ai intelligence and kingdom status the troops are dimmer than a bucket of bricks the most hilarious blunder so far was my siege defenders deciding to climb down the attackers ladders in order to get butchered piecemeal and since that is not anywhere braindead enough they tried so hard to get on the ladder next that they elbowed each other from the top of the wall into the mote way to go knuckleheads as for the kingdom status my beef is not on principle but with actual gameplay so you somehow have to get a settlement that doesn t make you a king however now you have to ask permission in the main quest no joke as kind of a backdoor you can become a vassal instead sounds nice when you are limited to a 100 people and the possible enemies each have upward of 12000 but you get the fief your liegelord decides whether you want it or not so when your liegelord starts yet another braindead suicide run you end up with a fief smack in the middle of enemy central what s worse the enemy liege may be on his own suicide run so it takes them forever to overrun your defenses with an invariable ten to one ratio every day you own that hopeless burnt out husk of a fief it empties your coffers with expenses beyond those of your entire army in effect that kills the vasall option and you re back to bootlicking your path through the convoluted main quest they should fire the designer and every playtester another major design blunder is the character leveling instead of happily gaining level experience playing whack the head with variable victims you gain experience in order to raise skills only the resulting skill points now level the character which sounds nice in theory but has two major stumbling blocks in practice first you have a learning limit which means once a skill hits the current limit experience means squat second and maybe worse since the means to raise the learning limit you get by leveling is less than what you need for the next level you are forced to develop every skill or else watch your toon treading water that forces you to follow a skill development script rather than just developing the character you like again who designs something like that in case this is not obvious this also nixes the concept of the clan roles surgeon scout etc for your companions who cares if you have a 100 medicine surgeon when he or she is hogging the medicine skill points you desperately need to level and here goes yet another nice idea down the drain you may observe i already played some eighty hours so why whine about a game that is evidently worth two full work weeks well for one bannerlord is a time sink you don t get anything done quickly said eighty hours were my first campaign until my happy go lucky vasall found his untimely demise defending a fief he never wanted unfortunately much of these eighty hours passed watching my little band of scalawags follow looters over the landscape at the break neck speed of an air bubble drifting in a tank of molasses why i didn t give them horses because by the time i could afford them i needed 110 buying them four at a time i didn t live long enough to ever see it happen and just so this is clear the problem is not slow movement in an of itself the problem is that your decision process whether to attack a moving target invariably changes from can i do it to do i spend an in game day hunting something possibly in the opposite direction what s worse it kills the trading youtube has tons of clips that tell you where to get some fish and where to sell it they brag with riches like medieval carpet baggers they just conveniently forget to tell you that it takes a realtime hour to get from a to b and that is only if you ignore any moving target that isn t running in generally the right direction which brings me to smithing sure i love crafting sure i know it takes time and is repetitive sure i know that game designers think it s funny to eventually earn a five perecent chance for a legendary weapon but using every down minute of resting to heal in order to sneak in a smithing skill point i managed to hoard less than thirty points in eighty hours 30 out of 300 this is which changes the question at hand from how cool would it be to smith legendary to it takes me how many realtime weeks of exclusively pushing the same three buttons to get there in summation bannerlord is like a fantastic pizza which just hasn t been long enough in the oven please put it back in for another half hour pretty please with sugar on top
