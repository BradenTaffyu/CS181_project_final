2023 went back after a long time away from the wasteland only to find out that a lot of the mods i liked have been removed from the mod store and put into creation club mods that i already paid for with my free cc credits on console i refuse to pay 15 for a mod especially one i technically own i am so pissed they removed the mods from the built in store as well to force players to buy the overpriced cc content i know i can use 3rd party tools to get the same experience but i won t give them playtime for these scummy tactics fallout 4 is an experiment in monetisation
