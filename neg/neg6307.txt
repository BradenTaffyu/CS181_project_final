in light of warner bros games releasing an entirely separate quidditch game by unbroken studios it seems clear now why they chose not to include quidditch in this game they had already given the licence out to another studio overall as a fan of the harry potter world this game is a major disappointment with the games size it looks good but lacks any substance ultimately your left with a hollow experience it may be worth the 70 off price but do not spend 60 on this game spoilers below you should be starting as a first year student and progressing through an arc to learn and improve magic not a 5th year student with insane chosen one powers destined to save the world hogwarts and its classes should be integral to the game and its story not just a montage and a couple very forgettable missions for even more forgettable teachers there are no reactive companions or any morality system you can cast unforgivable curses without anyone so much as batting an eyelash the game severely lacks rpg elements that would make for a much better experience like reactive dialogue and not just 2 or 3 pre scripted options that ultimately lead to the same ending regardless literally only one choice this entire game makes a difference on if you get the good or bad ending and that is if you open the repository or not and even then you get the same outcome at the very end there should also be unique relationship options like being able to befriend classmates or shop keeps in hogsmead or even to play pranks on other houses and make enemies the choices you make with other characters should have an impact on the story i think there should have even been romance options where you go on a date and drink butterbeer or go to zonkos that would be the time to utilize the montage rather than a time we could be doing something fun in class like actually combining ingredients and brewing potions a feature that doesn t exist the story and characters really should have had 5x as much focus and content put into them rather than stuffing the game with useless puzzles like merlin trials and copy and paste treasure vaults or whatever they re called gameplay is passable combat can be fun but is mostly button mashy flying brooms should be able to move in xyz not limited to up down flat plane movement you should be able to do barrel rolls or any sort of arieal acrobatics but as it stands they somehow made flying on a magic broom boring this game should have quidditch no question you can loose the entire half of the map past the mines waterfall and the game would not suffer at all in fact it would be improved there only need to be like 3 villages i mean come on really the focus should be on hogwarts and your legacy that you make for yourself not the lands surrounding hogwarts and the legacy of someone else who s already dead that s part of what bothers me the story is not even about you its about isidora and ranrok vs the keepers there s no hero s journey for the main character you start powerful you get some more powers you end powerful with no growth or challenges to their moral character at all some choices in the moment may test your own morality but since they have no effect on gameplay or story it ultimately makes every choice feel hollow and without weight this game also has zero replayability in my books for a game where you can choose 4 houses you d think the game would want you to play multiple times to see how a character from each house might approach the story well right off the bat you are hit with 17 minutes of unskippable cutscenes and a built in tutorial that must be completed before you re even presented with a choice of house and that choice doesn t affect what characters you interact with or how you interact with them no matter what house you choose each character meets and has story missions with the same npcs they neither view you more positively or negatively based on which house you chose and the only reason you might want to try the different houses is to have a different common room with a few unique dialogue options but not nearly enough to justify another playthrough especially since to reiterate the game only has one real choice that affects the story i don t know why this game is rated so positively either this is a lot of people s first and only video gaming experience or certain harry potter fans really have their blinders on when it comes to the obvious flaws in design choice story gameplay etc
