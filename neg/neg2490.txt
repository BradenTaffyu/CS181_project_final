2020 i used to be a fan of this game ever since it was in development however recent actions by 11 bit made me seriously doubt whether i should support them and their endeavours in the future early this year they announced the project reclamation last dlc that would be about reclaiming the froslands following the events of new home it was really anticipated as something that would be a good ending to the journey quite possibly answering lore questions meeting characters from previous scenarios and the like however later they scrapped this dlc in favour of on the edge a tiny unambitious story about new london s outpost content wise it was supposed to bring the long anticipated feature of trading to the game a week before release they posted a gameplay reveal video which quickly gave birth to quite a few concerns namely the dlc feeling too small and shallow the narrative weak and contrived the gameplay itself flawed and not true to frostpunk s core formula removing the control over book of laws limiting what the player can do depriving the game of moral decisions or tough choices following this video reactions to which were mixed at best i made a thread where i reached out to devs with my concerns over the issues of the dlc the dev rufus replied that my concerns are based off wild assumptions everything would be fine trust in us have faith and the like with no concrete information or proof to back this claim in a week on the edge released and its issues quickly became the talk of the forums it is easily the worst dlc design wise gameplay wise stability wise it is clearly rushed with reused assets meaningless mechanics and broken features there are dozens of threads on this at this point so feel free to indulge yourself while i had my fun with the game especially new home and last autumn scenario on the edge turned out to be a disaster leaving a bad aftertaste and casting a shadow over the game as a whole as for me while i could stomach the developers releasing poorly made rushed content i strongly condemn them lying in the face of their community deceiving them to get their purchase worst case scenario this is a fraud and best case scenario this is a very shady practise that no developer should ever engage in and no player should support by purchasing games of this studio
