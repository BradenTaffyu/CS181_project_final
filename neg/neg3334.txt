2016 it s a pity that there is no option for neither good nor bad to rate this game i m happy they have released this game but it s so unfinished and simplified it s no longer paradox standard or is it you can see they have knowingly prepared this game for tones of their overpriced dlcs greedy bastards atmosphere is good but doesn t feel historically it s so easy to change history with not much effort it s not bad you can do that it s just too easy battle plans are okay but you need to look after them they happen to split and do some random stuff if you won t watch still not bad trade system is a joke it s an insult for playersi was expecting more i was even willing to vote for yes but i know that paradox is greedy cunning and did that on purpose to rip players pockets paradox move away from the same slope as ea and is edit after a little more time in this game i decided to play hoi 3 unless you prefer playing arcade game with no historical accurancy play this version hoi 3 was is grand strategy game this game is for casual players
