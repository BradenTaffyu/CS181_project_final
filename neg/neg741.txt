2016 i wish there was a middle option between thumbs up and down for how i feel about this game don t get this game expecting an rpg as good as new vegas get this game if you want something with a fallout setting but more of a borderlands or far cry feel theres a world to explore and the gun play is solid but gone are the rpg mechanics the story is nonsense most things are wasted potential or not fleshed out enough your special build is not imporant and most of the perks are pointless since there are some obvious mandatory ones gone are actual dialog choices replaced with an absolutely insulting 4 choice wheel akin to mass effect get a mod asap to flesh out the full dialgoue but it s still not good enough this game is a disappointing addition to the series but go in having very low expectations and theres still fun to be had running around the world and collecting loot and just rolling with the ridiculously bad story play new vegas if you want a solid rpg play fallout 4 if you want a solid shooter pros much improved graphics animations and gun play over previous modern titles some great music although some of it recycled from older games on the radio stations fairly big world to explore more intuitive system to sort throught chests a solid fps gamecons not an rpg stats don t matter very few enemy types very few animals get used to raiders and super mutants very very few towns cities unacceptably low lack of random events and a generally low number of actual quests all the locations on the map exist just to be kill or fetch radiant quests dumbed down dialog choices are meaningless and lead to same outcome speech checks are gone fun things like black widow don t have any unique options no stat checks pacing is awful within one hour of the game you have power armor with no training a minigun and become the general of an army the whole world revolves around you you become the most imporant person in every faction all the factions are poorly written none of them are fleshed out and i still don t understand the institutes motivations even after seeing all the endings terrible story the main plot is resolved about 50 through the game but for some reason the game continues handful of forced references to reference fallout 3 but continously ignore new vegas wasted potential locations such as the combat zone doesn t have a quest line the uss constitution kind of just ends abrubtly too many radiant quests for factions not all the compnaions have a quest settlement building is bare minimum very few build options difficult to construct multi floor buildings defense don t matter enemies will teleport to the middle of your town bypass defenes kidnap people and there s nothing you can do about it settlement happiness has no logic to it good luck getting the 100 happiness achievement armor pieces you cannot wear any of the armor outfits in the game as it disallows wearing pieces along with it even if you wanted to the stats are much lower than the armor pieces solved with a mod but incredibly poor design there are only about 4 5 choices for armor piece which is very low legendary weapons make weapons less unique and more rng finding a named weapon is just a legendary weapon you could have received as a random drop not many new weapon types compared to old games either one maybe two not really any intresting choices in the perk tree three five mandatory points into each gun style of your choice lockpicking hacking crafting and science this late in the series i would have expected something new 200 years since the bombs fell and the world is littered with skeletons for some reason they are even in towns and settlements and unremoveableedit i wrote this in the comments but people don t seem to know how to read so i ll put it here not sure what people s logic are with saying hey look he played it alot i paid 40 something for the game of course i m going to play it i also got all the achievements for it while not difficult shows i actually explored everything the game has to offer you re allowed to be dissappointed with something and still see good in it i don t want to see future games be dumbed down like this and expressing concerns is the best way to do that i m not alone in this seeing as how 4 s user reviews are drasticly lower than new vegas the review score average has been steadily decreasing as time passes as well
