2019 i have played this game for a year not through steam you can play through wargaming account or steam i will make this short and sweet do not start playing this game this game would have been the best warships game without aircraft carriers a year ago it was rare to see an aircraft carrier because they were difficult to learn wargaming made the worst possible decision and instead of removing this most hated class they decided to re work them they made them easy to play and here is the kicker there is no skill based counter to planes if you are in a destroyer cruiser or battleship you just have to put up with it imagine playing a pvp game where there was a character that could constantly harass and attack you all game and you could not fight them back anti aircraft is not controlled by the player and carrier players have easily learned to avoid it it has been the absolute most frustrating experience i have had in video games people have spent hundreds and even thousands on this game only to have wargaming turn this into a giant beta test the vast majority of players are unhappy all of the major content creators have made videos saying they are unhappy wargaming just doesn t have the fortitude to fix this problem the number of players is dropping everything about the game is designed to get your money it s free to play but you will end up with not enough credits to buy the ships you earned through hard work it is next to impossible without spending a lot of money one year of premium time and a couple ships can easily run you 200 the cheap ships are low tier and you will not make credits with them the game matches tier 8 ships with tier 10 ships 2 tiers matchmaking they will say this is to reduce queue times it is 100 to try and get people to buy better ships buy camos buy flags everything in this game costs doubloons which is the in game currency you cannot earn doubloons you must use real money to buy them want to change the way your ship is set up costs doubloons a couple months ago wargaming was going to take a ship that people had spent real money on and change it s tier and or nerf it they make over powered ships to either sell or have you earn then a few months later nerf them in order to release new over powered ships tldr without carriers over priced items and mismatching players this could have been a great game
