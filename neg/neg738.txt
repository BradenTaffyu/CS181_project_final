2018 first off we all know creation club is a joke it s addition contributes very little to gameplay aside from the game needing a patch more frequently to make fallout 4 take up as much space as possible on your computer in my opinion fallout 4 was already lacking even before the creation club kicked in the problem i have with fallout 4 is that it does not feel like a bethesda game the gameplay is actually quite linear with you almost being forced to continue with the main quest the freedom to explore which has been a staple in many earlier bethesda games skyrim oblivion fallout 3 and so on has been removed to give a story about how you need to find your son you can always try to ignore the main quest but this results in you either feeling like a bad parent or your fully voiced character brings it up in dialogue regardless i feel like someone is standing next to you while you play and keeps tapping your shoulder saying hey remember your kid was kidnapped go do something about it even if you try to ignore it and just run off in a random direction and explore two things happen one which may be good or bad depending on how you like your game you ll come across enemies that out level you and kill you in very few hits two you ll enter areas that are part of a quest so they will be empty until that quest has been started i mentioned that your character is fully voiced which might seem like a good thing in my opinion it takes out that roleplay element that bethesda is known for as well in many other games you can make up your own past in this game if you played as a male you are former military if you play as female you have a degree in law along with that a specific voice that will speak from dialogue commands that make no sense in dialogue you can choose up to 4 reactions in a conversation these reactions are sometimes just 1 word you have no idea what it means or what your character is about to say as the vague information given is hardly enough for example one option might just say money does that mean i m going to ask how much money they have how much money for doing a quest am i going to ask about how the recession is doing it s an interesting addition to have a voice but for some rpg fans it breaks the roleplay feel along with the game now making dialogue choices redundent and scripted the final complaint that is somewhat the main reason i don t play fallout 4 much is the settlement building mechanic if it was executed in a better manner i wouldn t mind but as it stands it s extremely fustrating and tedious if you take over a settlement random settlers will join these settlers are probably the stupidest a i ever to be made you almost think capcom helped make them they won t make their own food water housing beds defenses anything you have to gather junk travel to settlement build what they need tuck them in then read a bed time story look i don t have any kids in real life yet but i don t want to experience raising a child in my game either on top of that you will get random quests to help defend them because even if you placed 20 turrents down to defend them they still are too stupid to understand what to do and just call you for help it becomes a chore and all the fun elements of the game become overshadowed over the fact that now you have to cater to the needs of everyone in the game you are punished in this game for being a good person it s better to be evil and just kill everyone oh wait we can t because our character has preset dialogue that always gives friendly responses there is some fun to be had in this game the upgrading weapon and armor mechanic is pretty neat to tinker with allowing you to customize how you want your guns to function the graphics are better and the story itself isn t awful it s a big no one is the good guy technically except maybe the minutement but your punishment is having to baby every settlement you help them take if this game wasn t made by bethesda then i may have saw it in a different light from my experiences playing bethesda games this was way off their normal marker it s dumbed down repetitive and tedious if you avoided bethesda games in the past because you can t handle making your own adventures this game is for you if you like bethesda type games and rpg elements i d avoid and stick to fallout 3 or new vegas with mods
