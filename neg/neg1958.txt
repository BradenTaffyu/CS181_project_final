2022 i ve been clean for 6 months now and i ve honestly never felt better war thunder has been on a downward spiral for so long and i m concerned for all the new players picking up the game the grind is aggravating and intentionally so because the devs know people will pay for premium time to ease the frustration it s because of this and the recent economy changes which slowed progression to a near halt that the playerbase has been so much more toxic selfish and generally on edge it s no wonder chat was banned for three months but it s not the players fault update after update gaijin continues to develop their cash grabbing schemes while actively neglecting the dedicated players that time and time again willingly violate international law for a chance to influence the game in their image i don t mean to say noone is allowed to enjoy things but me and so many others who have been playing for years share the same sentiment about this game i only hope more people can find the strength to quit war thunder is one hell of an addiction but i promise you the withdrawal is better than the grind
