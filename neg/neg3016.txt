2017 i would not recommend a friend to get this game as much as i may like the genre because the company s policies paradox abuses their player community by releasing half finished games and then releasing basic and essential game mechanics as overprieced dlc even worse they ll release these dlc frequently by making each be a tiny addition to the game but asking full price for each you end up paying 500 what you payed for the base game and they ll keep doing this as long as players keep paying which is outright absurd and abusive this is one of the worst company policies i ve seen they re literally milking their players dry and turning a loyal fanbase away with their ruthless greed
