2020 early access review bought this game about 5 years ago played it on and off i don t dislike it i think it s a fine rl with kind of mediocre combat i saw the sseth video yesterday i was excited because he s a funny guy and he always invigorates the community of the indie games he hypes up in his videos i figured with the recent mutation overhaul it d be a great time for new players to integrate into the community same with what happened when he made the video on starsector the community welcomed the newcomers with open arms and the community as a whole is much better because of it it wasn t until i saw the video that i realized how toxic and awful the devs and the discord community are for this game the discord is just wow i ve only ever seen such a toxic group of holier than thou gatekeeping pedants on resetera which i can only imagine is where the mod staff was recruited from they heavily imply in the rules that while you re allowed to talk about the putus templars who are the in game equivalent to nazis and are the unequivocal bad guys horribly inbred abominations not intended to be sympathetic you re not allowed to ask for the option to play as them and doing so will reflect poorly on your character doing so is typically followed by a lengthy discussion where they accuse you of being an actual unironic fascist for thinking it would be cool to be able to explore the game world as the bad guy instead i ve been absolutely appalled at the way the existing community has done their absolute level best to completely reject the new wave of players because they don t like the guy that brought them there the dev unormal is acting as though sseth including the discord handle of the mod that banned him from the server is in his video is doxxing the mod which is patently absurd he s also taking the somewhat silly route of playing the victim and shutting down the discord server because bullies or at least is in emphatic support of the mod s decision whichever is more accurate i m not exactly in the inner circle to be perfectly frank it doesn t seem like they want you to become a member of their community if you came because of sseth i d always been meaning to leave a positive review for this game because it really has brought me a great deal of enjoyment over the hours i ve played it but what i ve seen in the aftermath of this video has left a bad taste in my mouth and i can t bring myself to recommend supporting these devs
