this game company ruins everything they touch from bugs to retarded game mechanics they have no clue how to build a decent all around video game the only reason bethesda games have any fun element in them is because they are lucky to have a formula that mostly carries itself too bad they can damage even that 10 years later and they only manage to make things worse when they go bankrupt someday i will praise
