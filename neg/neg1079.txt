2020 okay so here we go fallout 4 on the outside looks great with slick animations graphics and deep weapon customization i really wanted to give this game a chance and experience everything there was possible with it before passing judgement with almost 300 hours in it i cannot recommend it over 3 or new vegas it is a blemish on the fallout series but here me out its a perfectly fine aaa game however its a terrible fallout game the story rips all immersion from the player and choices don t matter when you have to be either nice or sarcastic nice there is no rpg elements here your skills do not matter your actions do not matter npcs do not react when you take down the boogeymen and stroll back into diamond city triumphant npcs do not care loot and shoot is the name of the game and it does that quite well gunplay is great with tons of stuff to collect and customize but after you ve made a laser sniper that kills anything in one hit whats the point having your character speak in a horrible decision as you cant control how they react talking about raiders yeah they re scum no ifs ands or buts in previous titles you could choose your side be a raider or a enclave purist cleanse the wasteland or bleed it dry what im trying to get at is after 290 hours in this game with around 50 of those hours modding it to make it more of an actual rpg its just not worth it when new vegas 3 2 1 and tactics offer your so much more in everyway except graphics do yourself a favor and retake a trip down the strip or stop by the citadel and you ll start to realize what im rambling about
