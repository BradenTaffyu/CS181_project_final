2023 early access review it makes me sad to write this but i have loved this game through several years and changes and i just can t recommend it in it s current version there are so many good things about this game zombie design build mechanics etc but the latest overhaul of the skill leveling system is the worst yet this game has been in development for 10 years they have completely changed the skill system more times than i can count some of those changes weren t great or somtimes imbalanced but a21 really takes the cake it basically f over multiplayer and makes it unnecessarily grindy and frustrating this time around you have to learn everything through magazines you find in loot if you level up in a specific skill it only makes you more likely to find magazines related to that skill basically this makes it impossible to truly divide tasks effectively typically i play with my husband and sister and the occasional friend that joins us i m usually the one who builds our base and makes the tools now if i want to unlock the workstations i need i have to either go looting myself wasting time i need to build defenses etc or hope that my companions find the right magazines for me which becomes difficult unless they also waste their skill points to include the skills only i need they won t find nearly enough magazines for me plus some of the numbers of magazines for basic stuff are just ridiculous i mean i don t expect any game to be 100 realistic but it does make your character look like a complete moron if they can t even figure out how to boil meat personally i like it best when you can learn the basic stuff through skill point progression and have to find additional specific recipes like for the advanced cooking and forge and find gun parts to craft weapons etc however the current system has sucked all the fun out of the game for now also the change to the water system is just bad until you can find a dew collector which just spawns screamers for no reason that is slow as and needs a lot of space or get a filter for your helmet both very difficult to find and expensive you re gone are the days of making glass in the forge or filling up and boiling empty jars you find it just makes no sense and breaks immersion for me to summarize it feels like the devs don t really have an end goal in mind for this game they make weird and unnecessary changes to already good systems and while in a pre alpha game i expect things to change around over time it feels like they just around randomly with about as many stupid plot holes as j k rowling
