game is clearly dead modders are the only thing keeping it alive devs have done absolutely nothing to move this title forward bugs galore some of which have been around for several years since launch with no apparent fix in sight early game is over quick and after that the gameplay becomes super repetitive and boring just not a fun experience in general wish the devs did more to improve this game especially late game but i m not holding my breath on it could ve been a legendary game do not waste your money
