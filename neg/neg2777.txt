2016 combining master of orion with europa universalis that just has to be the one of the greatest game ideas ever at the beginning the game feels awesome the races are well designed and researchable technologies are more or less scientifically realistic the 3 different ftl technologies give a nice strategic depth to the game which can also be at times frustrating the game lacks diplomatic relation mechanisms it is hard to see or understand why some races attack you even playing passively your neighbors randomly declare war on you trying to gain an ally is often hindered by missing a few positive relation points with no way to gain further points often i ended up as a strong lonely nation that gets beaten down by strong alliances if i finally manage to gain an alliance friend i get a declaration of war by some other alliance further away that somehow manages to pass through occupied space to invade my planets i am sure this can be understood after a certain amount of play time still the different map overviews in eu4 were a lot easier to analyze here are none further the ai tends to create many small fleets fighting 2 nations with different ftls at the same time each of them having 5 6 perfectly micromanaged fleets while you are trying to send your 2 3 larger fleets defending your empire is rather annoying not to mention bigger fights even bring the best pcs to its knees with 2 3 fps the cpu just can t keep up the early game has been nicely polished and gives a positive playing experience the further you get into the game the more unfinished elements appear the game just got released to early and seems unfinished i am sure paradox will release several dlcs and patches making this raw diamond into a great game but just not yet
