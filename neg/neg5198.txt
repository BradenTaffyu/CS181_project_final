2016 product received for free im gonna get right to it update in the bottom pros looks great plays well for me personally though i can feel i need a patch from nvidia v sync etc doesn t function properly other than that i got a smooth 60 frames but my pc is strong too it has tons of potential cool new skill system armor and weapon outfitting good rosters except for brettonia better collision better battle ai slower fights more realistic better music than rome 2 and attila cons pathfinding during siege battles are still its incredible that ca just cannot get it right it simply baffles me and here comes the huge one that makes me so angry i can barely contain my rage what in the happened to siege battles where are they where are our cities villages small fortified siege battles that we ve always had where are they where are the cool choke point matches the tactical setups offered by the village city design when you knew you were outnumbered and you had to hold off overwhelming enemy numbers like leonidas as thermopylae its all gone are you serious ca have you completly lost it you have removed one of the biggest aspects of what made total war total war a strategy game where you fight the enemy tactically your entire game now is horde mode let me repeat that ca your entire game entire warhammer is horde mode except for the huge city fights that will never change ever because you re so lazy and incompetent consist of the enemy zerging 1 direction whilst you camp the walls and afk towers are still retardedly op it seems hilarious considering we ve been complaining about op ranged since rome 2 arguably even shogun 2 but that was a kamikaze fest anyway so whatever i just cannot believe this i cannot believe comprehend that after everything you still cannot understand what we want from a total war game its like you re the blizzard of total war give us legacy servers to experience the good ol days nope ain t gonna happen and here you are doing the same removing with every game you release more and more of what makes total war a real total war game it has never been so dumbed down before i simply can scarcely believe your team of creative designers would have the gall to do this like wtf is your problem is it the ai is it the fact that you cannot find or hire or afford a good ai designer like wtf is going on we keep paying full price for this and everytime we get less less and less thats still broken sure it looks good and what is there is cool problem is it comes to a price as always with you ca and this time its just bye bye siege battles except for the horde mode wall camp one everthing else every village defense is stripped in your continuous attempt to dumb down why why in the are you dumbing down this game for who who wants this who the hell likes to fight the same horde mode battle over and over and over its no wonder people auto resolve because you keep making your battle more and more and casual this time its awesome eye candy but its repetative as there is no variation i dont understand this i fought a battle before and i was outnumbered 3 1 i was inside my city i expected to somehow be able to deploy within a village thus create a choke point and try to fend them off classic total war style leonidas style but nope i just got ported outside the freaking city and tada outnumbered outgunned outmatched outflanked and there was absolutely all i could do about it why is that thats because your battle map design is horde mode and nothing else they are small simplistic and doesn t at all encourage anything but to rush how can you expect or imagine we d spend enjoy hundreds of hours playing this if 90 of the matches are on generic horde mode fields the magic spells and graphics will wear off in a week and then what after that huh people complain mostly about the performance heh mine works and i can tell you performance is the least of your troubles after you ve been fighting 5 6 times i played almost 3 hours and i can already feel how i m doing the same bloody thing over and over its streamlined its very very streamlined and combine that with bad level design and yeah gg replay value i ll try to enjoy my gameplay experience because i actually enjoy the concept of the game but holy mother of god how you up no you us all of us by dumbing down siege battles that were iconic to total war freaking iconic thanks for trying to create a warhammer game you did well on a lotta things but you for once again dropping the ball and ignoring the aspects we love just because you either can t or wont put in the extra effort and give us the game us fans deserve ca is it a thumps up or down its up if you can handle the siege battles being at their worst ever plus idiot campaign ai never attacks just asks peace every turn wtf ca hell want siege battles good campaign ai dont buy if you do dont pay full price if you can avoid it they haven t given us 100 effort therefor they dont deserve 60 bucks another thing is that every map is so small which makes tactical elements harder its a rush fest by the end of the day 1 single music track plays with every battle which gets awfully repetative after a while at first i thought i could find some good replay value but after 15 hours of playing its getting worse its so repetative and unrewarding its feeling so streamlined and basic no talent or skill required and i m steamrolling the ai even on very hard i have noticed the only thing that changes from easy to very hard is that the enemy will actually kill your units instead of just damaging them to 50 of more intelligence doesn t change garrisons make fights hugely unfair i bought 2500 men to take a town ai had around 2000 men too but the garison game it another 1900 of top elite units and more and this is around 10 15 turns in its hugely unbalanced and in most fights you end up with your legendary heroes standing alone fighting 1000 men alone something i expected from a total war mod but not actual game design i cannot recommend this game most definately not at full price i had hoped for an improvement over the mtw 2 call of warhammer mod but this game is not remotely it not even close i expect a lot more from my games not streamlined to the detriment gameplay with a few extra additions to the campaign at the cost of siege battles being butchered not to mention the ai will either rush you or hill camp nothing else every battle is the same and hugely predictable combine that with everything else and yeah not even wall debrie anymore or crumbling visuals just gone streamlined and lazyi m not having a fun time as this game stands right now i cannot recommend it not getting an epic feel from it more like a headache from trying to have fun to enjoy the nice graphics cool combat though unbalanced but everytime i almost get there im slapped by the of this games dumbing down and its getting to be too much i will almost go as far to say this is the most casual total war to date its worth a buy it if you mod it but its that we gotta mod ca games everytime now to make them playable or fun update the game is a total face roll mods dont help on that legendary is a joke and 60 of cities are empty garrison defense mods dont help campaignai is deeply stupid invisible walls in sieges no reload animations on guns or cannons list goes on dont buy if you want a challenge the game doesn t feel finished this ai passiveness is worse than rome 2 splay the mod call of warhammer for mtw 2 instead its far better
