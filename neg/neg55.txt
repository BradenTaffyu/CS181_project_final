2017 early access review in light of recent events i ve been forced inside the exclusion zone it s not that bad the world seems more polished animations and vehicles are finally in on the beta branch which is a great improvement many of the systems such as hygiene cooking clothing tools medical are much improved zeds and combat actually feel natural and terrifying again the animations for these are beautiful especially the little head turn when you sneak past just a little too loudly if there was a maybe button on these reviews i d be using that it s in a good enough place but i don t know if i would still justify the current price so maybe i ll eat my past words and 2020 will be when it s complete i hope april 2017 review modders have done more for this game in the last 3 years than the devs 7 years waiting the last two years have been weekly news blogs of new features coming soon lol maybe do not buy until it s actually finished should be ready by 2030
