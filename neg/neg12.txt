2018 i want to like this game but i can t having played the games that stardew valley was based off of namely harvest moon and rune factory i have lots of experience with the genre and i very much enjoy these kinds of games but i can t like this one here s why none of the townspeople were interesting enough for me to like them each npc only has a line or two of dialogue per day so i didn t feel motivated to go out and interact with them daily if you do like the npcs you will have a lot of trouble finding them the npcs do not show up on the map they have unclear schedules and you cannot enter their rooms until after you have reached level two friendship i ended up standing outside a character s door for six in game hours just so i could give him a birthday present the control scheme can be very clunky at times the game operates on a grid based system and your character can only interact with the 8 tiles surrounding them you cannot interact with a tile that is more than one block away and you also cannot interact with the tile that your character is standing on there are a large number of bugs that still haven t been fixed despite the game having been out for two years sometimes your spouse children and pets will get stuck in the wall despite completing the quest to unlock an area i was unable to enter it because i couldn t interact with the npc that blocks your path in the museum inspired by animal crossing i repeatedly got stuck in the edit mode and had to restart my computer losing an entire day of progress there is no way to manually save your game the only way to save your game is to go to sleep and proceed to the next day the game does not tell you this even when you use the in game menu to exit the game you are not told that your progress will be lost furthermore you only have one save slot so all decisions you make are permanent unless you want to repeat the entire day i had to install multiple mods to improve my quality of life while playing in particular a tooltip that lets you know what a planted crop is and a map that shows npc locations i also had to manually edit my save file because you cannot change what bonuses you receive from reaching certain skill levels it s a relatively minor nitpick but your character moves very slowly after playing rune factory 4 stardew valley feels sluggish even when riding a horse of course most of the things i have a problem with might not bother you in fact there s a very good chance that you ll enjoy this game if a big update to fix some of these bugs and add some much needed features was released i would have a much more enjoyable time playing it but until then i m going back to rune factory 4
