2016 hey also good move to bethesda for removing negative reviews on f4 and keeping f76 on your own launcher system to hide your garbage good gamebad falloutugly dlcas much as i am a fan of the fallout series i honestly cannot recommend people to buy this game in its current state bethesda did a great job in the transition from the old fallouts to f3 and though i did not like the setting of new vegas it overall was even better it was an almost perfect formula of first person role playing and story setting that followed the originals fallout 4 is a completely different mixture and to me does not fit well with its predecessors fallout 4 implements new aspects that were successful prototypes in other games such as the dialogue style in la noir the building options in rust or 7 days to die and weapon modification in dead space 3 while these aspects were great in the list games individually bethesda did a poor job implementing them to work together and makes the game play with redundant aspects dialogue has over thousands of lines which though amazing work ends up pointless after playing a while you will find that while in f3 or f nv you could discuss multiple things and come back for more f4 s dialogue in short lists four different ways of saying the same thing the top option will be an informative version asking for information while answering the bottom usually is sarcastic the left can be optimistic and the right will be negative insulting example hi would you like this bottle of water yes where did you get this sure could use a tasty beverage wow thank you so much yeah now screw off when this occurs through the entire game you begin to realize it s less of an rpg with choice and more of a set track building settlements is a fun side hobby and it practically a game unto itself but once you complete hours of building defenses prepare to do battle with nothing unless it s a mission the only time i have ever had a settlement attacked is you guessed it when you talk to preston and this is only so you can grind xp same goes for weapon customization the issue is you can build almost any weapon instantly because you no longer have skill requirements usually only need level 2 of a perk can find the best off of enemies and there is no degredation in a few hours of scrounging around you ll have more weapons than you ll know what to do with and just drop sell them lately the big thing is survival mode and dlc which sealed the deal with this review as of now initial survival mode was a complete insult to hardcore survivalist players because the only thing it did was increase the spawns of legendary creatures that would be legendary mode now bethesda is scrambling to make it right and their idea of that is forcing players to eat and drink four times as much as a human would disable console good luck if you glitch or get stuck and only allow you to save via sleeping in a bed i have tried to see the logic in doing this versus using new vegas hardcore mode as a starting point instead and found nothing the current dlc is ok at best while i enjoyed and recommended automatron despite its sudden start and stop of a quest bethesda has been giving portions of what they ve been advertising by the time wasteland workshop came out several mods had already included most of what was included bethesda will advertise that f4 has the largest map and it does but a large fraction of the map is open water this applies to a lot of things they will say about this game the hype was real the advertisements and expectations of most were not
