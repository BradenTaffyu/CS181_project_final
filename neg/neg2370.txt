2022 very good game and recommend picking it up if it s on sale don t pay full price for a game that came out 4 years ago but give the og buyers an upgrade option with a discount for all of the dlc to make up for being weasels and screwing us out of them by running from steam after you had already sold a bunch of copies here and also for making it impossible to play with people who got it on epic during that whole time until then this stays a down vote
