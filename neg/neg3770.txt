2019 early access review the idea is great but let s face it soon it will be 6 years old and the game has not evolved much during this time laggy glitchy abusable unbalanced recently the title has become also very grindy it is probably worth trying in a good well buzzed company also there is no beta in observable future so don t get hyped about yet another alpha i am not going to focus on lags sudden teleportations disappearance of transport funky world generation clipping issues et c here is the lack of attention to them for several years justifiable in alpha with 2 5m copies sold it s definitely debatable we coped with these glitches for many years so it s not what bothers me now it s the direction in which the content part of development proceeds 17 alphas ago we had an exciting transformable world with a lot of promise since then we have got many new pois procedurally generated quests and transport but have lost freedom of choice of builds and general believeability of the world in a15 you could go straight for the zero city or snow biome from the start and have a very thrilling gameplay but you would also level your character quickly and have better items you could specialize into melee guns or construction skills go for loot or go for perks and be rather equally viable even in late game now ak 47 with anti rad mod is a must and constantly doing monotonous quests is also a must the leveling system is constanly in search of something and now it is at its worst if you level too much and loot those hidden crates too little it s a game over around lvl 40 50 you simply will have no firepower to kill the ferals and green ones what is funny you still can build an invincible base in a15 ai got crushed by vertical poles in a16 by horizontal ladders in a17 by ordinary open doors what is not funny all these alphas beared the ai weaknesses throughout all their respective builds devs did tweak ai a bit in a17 to fight the falling glitch but it was not very effective and nobody believed it would be to be fair the new houses in a16 17 now do not try to participate in an atmosphere build up they have turned into some early 90s fps levels run in a line entangled into a rather large multi storey building shoot 100 zombies half of which hide in the walls closets ceiling spaces et c get to the top collect your randomised reward no attempts from the devs to make the building look believeable to tell its story of disaster or at least to place the zombies in a more sensible way such design becomes old really quickly and you just pole yourself to the top for reward and skip the exciting fps part few secret rooms do look awesome and that distant sound of dying siren in the wastelands can still cause several chills with some help of imagination but secret rooms are now just for loot to survive the leveled difficulty spike wastelands no more spawn scary monsters at night and even the beautiful snow biome no longer can kill you in a minute with its fierce lumberjacks and hypothermia less excitement to feel fewer choices to make fewer stories to be told but more boring quests to do for some bearded dude speaking of stories on a17 release who believed they would give us behemoth in a18
