do not buy thisthe incredibly bad dlc beach properties that did not have any beaches or actual beach assets which justified it being the worst rated item in steam store has just been removed by colossal order to get rid of the negative reviews but oopsie the patch that was supposed to incorporate the dlc into the base game doesn t even have eta on release so if you had saves with those assets they ll just be placeholder gray boxes if this doesn t tell you enough about how amazingly badly colossal order and paradox are handling this game let s take a look at the ultimate edition i m the unfortunate owner of most of its content is now indefinitely delayed the beach dlc was so bad they had to remove it and instead we re getting 3 content packs and 3 radios that would be cool if we actually got them now but those packs don t even exist we don t know what they are or when they will release if ever based on the beach pack i m not looking forward to them i regret buying ue so much don t make the same mistake still not enough to never touch the buy button on this game if you re willing to overlook all these issues the base game itself has so many bugs unfixed since day 1 straight up broken simulation in some aspects we still don t have asset editor no eta again yay to solve the incredibly low asset variety all your cities will end up looking the same and the fun will be sucked out by the bugs it s like every time they promise it will get better they do something to screw everyone up even more it s ironic cities skylines franchise bested simcity only to shoot itself in the legs just like sc did with the 2013 title let s hope for someone else to take the reign because there s no hope for this title anymore
