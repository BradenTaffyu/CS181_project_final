i have been waiting for some update to past before writing a review for c s2 if you want a city builder and nothing more go for the original if you want to build your own city with style go for the original with dlc if you want realistic simulation go for the original with mods until your cpu is cooked if you want to use the game as a sand box and go for pure beauty go for the original with asset until your gpu is cooked if you want to use mod and asset go for the original which has steam workshop build in no 3rd party bs yes they even make the workshop a third party thing so no more easy click for modding this does not worth even half of its price in current stage
