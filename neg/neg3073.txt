2021 if you can get the game for 20 and it includes all expansions i recommend it but you can t the game has never gone on more than a 10 sale the game is currently 75 more than double most comparable games more than most aaa games with less to offer i do not recommend it as a quick comparison kenshi is 30 includes the whole game in the base game and regularly goes on sale for 40 off it has better base building better pawn automation a better research system and significantly better combat in all forms it also has an actual world to explore with interesting stuff in it and one that isn t limited by arbitrary map size restrictions it s all one giant map it also has a mod community if you re into it and it doesn t have advertisements on the title page as a product in a marketplace rimworld doesn t compete as a piece of art or a toy independent of cost it doesn t compete either the base game includes about 5 meaningful events enemies raid enemies raid but they attack walls enemies raid with cannons enemies raid by digging into your base enemies raid by dropping onto or new your base these events all feel fundamentally the same they repeat 2 3 times a season these raids happen no matter your choices you can be on a one tile island and enemy tribes from the mainland will attack your base on foot you can ally some of the other factions but that just makes the raids happen from other factions you haven t allied yet there are also quests deliver six hats to a tribe but they re self directed and are usually just free loot buttons the dlcs add a couple more similarly easy stuff some of which are a nice distraction build a monument the base game includes about 5 things to build walls minor defensive buildings production buildings in various flavors furniture and power infrastructure you can also build a ship but it doesn t do anything but cause the attack events to spawn faster for a while and then ends the game you can also travel on the overworld map this is useful if you want to avoid building the ship yourself and find a different ship instead to defend and end the game you can also use this to trade making any resource scarcity on your map meaningless there s no motivation for leaving the planet it is lousy with exploitable resources and all the wildlife is tame and plentiful there is no motivation for raiders to exist at all for the same reasons any raid against you even a successful one that takes everything you have is a bad move from the raiders they could mine for the duration of the raid and end up with more as a result for the time the game doesn t make sense you have to make your own fun with it which is fine in principle but there s so little here it s hard to find anything to hook into seems like most people use mods but my experience has been pretty bad they often conflict with the base game or dlcs in ways nobody considered for example there s the mod that lets you base in bigger mountains i liked playing in this setup until i got a dlc quest to defend a guy from a squirrel for a few hours in exchange for doubling my net worth the pawn to defend spawned fine the squirrel spawned fine but the guy couldn t leave on his shuttle because there was no place within the confines of my map to land it s just broken and there s another 12 hour run i have to start over because of a mistake i didn t make the game isn t able to challenge appropriately with most events being either trivial or game ending for example the world is dotted with six meter wide infinitely tall columns of rock if you dig under these and build something there bugs will spawn inside the room repeatedly forever this either kills you because you didn t know this could happen or it s trivial because you designed around it there s no middle ground the game claims to be a story generator but it isn t when my pawn s husband showed up in a crash landing it didn t affect anybody nobody cared they didn t bother to save them or check on them or even have an interesting conversation in the log i could change my behavior because of that relationship the game declared but my pawns did not with such a system it s not the game generating the story it s me you might as well just buy a deck of story cards for 5 or use a free website since you re doing all the work generating the story anyway you ll get better stories i do not recommend rimworld unless deeply discounted and even then only if you re a student or something with a ton of free time to sample 100 mods to find 5 that make the game worthwhile for you once you re past the fundamental problems it doesn t get better below is a list of unsorted frustrations that would be annoying even if the fundamentals weren t so broken there are a bevy of mechanical issues that have been around for almost a decade the cleaning task is just broken and you re better off cleaning by manual prioritization unless you have like 30 pawns and can dedicate a couple to cleaning exclusively hauling isn t much better pawns have an inventory and carry weight system but they don t use it while hauling so one silver coin takes as much effort to haul as ten days worth of food an itchy scar makes people more upset for longer than seeing a rotting corpse each day armor degenerates while you wear it even outside of combat but weapons do not there s no way to repair or maintain items just buildings there s no way to prioritize tasks within a category so you can t try to locate underground resource deposits if there s any science to do there s different science tech levels but no way to move between them or get help from pawns who come from a different tech society all of the starts are identical since if you re below 5 or so pawns the game literally rains new free colonists from the sky the game has a notion of wealth and i think the event difficulty is tied to it but it has no notion of how far word of your wealth is spread this makes for a bunch of stupid behaviors where building floors in your homes gets you killed because it makes more raiders spawn not fun transactions with visiting traders drops all the purchased goods at the trader s feet even though the stuff you sold to him comes out of your stockpiles you then have to haul these home one stack at a time if you bought food the traders animals will start eating it off the ground i ve seen this result in a net 20 rice for me after buying 200 it s stupid the roof layer is a constant frustration as is what is inside or outside a 100 tile deep cave fully roofed underneath mountain counts as outside a geothermal generator with no roof and no walls around it is outside which is correct but put a single wall next to it and now it s inside this is a problem because they release a lot of heat and now your pawns walking next to it get heatstroke or worse despite the existence of a roof layer you can t use height defensively which is how most defense has worked for the last 10000 years it s similar to oxygen not included omitting convection when fundamental physics of your world differ for no intuitive reason it s frustrating pawns have perfect knowledge of the whole map this makes every production building a disaster because by default they ll pull materials from the whole map yes please spend a whole day walking to pick up one heal root even though i already have 200 you can change this but it s on a per machine per crafting recipe basis you ll miss one usually items spawn as disallowed for colonists but not always maps are too small even on the largest settings supported by mods even tribespeople conquered in the 1400s had scouts and would know what s around them for a few tens of kilometers in this game your pawns are oblivious to the world beyond 250m from an arbitrary point
