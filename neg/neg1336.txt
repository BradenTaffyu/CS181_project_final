2021 early access review for anybody looking to buy this game i d say to wait until considerable improvements are made on it s development having said that i very much enjoy some aspects of this game and have sunk a fair amount of hours into it when i ve been in the mood to play it sieges are completely broken in my opinion you cannot order your men around efficiently at all without delegating command to the ai troops will crowd around the bottom of siege towers and not use ladders they also wait in large blobs getting picked off until the last minute before getting to the ladders then when they actually do go up ladders they do so as slowly as possible one at a time not very fun watching your party of men that you spent hours training up fighting looter parties getting picked off one by one by peasant archers due to their own stupidity this problem has been persistent since release and a major reason why i choose to auto resolve all sieges yet the devs spend too much time re balancing items and perks and updating sheep models and textures that no one cares about battles can be very frustrating particularly in villages due to the fact you spawn less than 100 metres away from the enemy and don t have any time to get into formation you should at least have pre deployment options like in total war for example large battles are utterly ridiculous say you are winning a 1000 vs 1000 battle and you push back the enemy they will constantly spawn on you and it just turns into a complete brawl with disregard to formation or tactics not very good if you are not in command i e in an army i don t see why you cant end the battle after the first wave and fight large battles in stages just like in m b warband for example aside from the known pathfinding issues the ai is questionable at times in one on one fights i e standing still and staring at each other for a few seconds doing nothing ordering troops can be very clumsy i feel like a command mode that allows you to place your troops using the mouse while you stay back as any good commander should would be beneficial you should also be able to order your troops to skirmish protect flanks volley fire spear brace etc as seen in mods in the previous instalment m b warband when you tell archers to advance they seem to run right up to the enemy at sword striking range without firing and immediately running away somewhere you don t want them to instead of skirmishing properly cavalry are almost impossible to control properly without delegating to the ai and may charge into spearman against your will for a game that i and every other fan have been waiting 8 years to play i feel somewhat disapointed even though i have fun playing the game after 30 mins of playing the game my immersion is broken in some way therefore i wouldn t recommend for new players until the game is out of early access if this had been released in 2016 or even 2018 when they had released videos of a seemingly functional game i would have said different but 8 years for what we have got here is ridiculous
