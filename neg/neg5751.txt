2018 honestly ever since medevil 2 i havent been a huge fan of any of the total war games released the franchise has really gone downhill as a whole to say the least half my time in rome 2 is me waiting for each turn to end i mean seriously the game is slow as dirt how do they go from each turn sequence taking like 5 seconds in medevil 2 which is a much older and smoother running game to each turn taking 5 minutes to load in rome 2 even in warhammer the turns take forever and the game dosent run as smooth smoothness aside tho both warhammer and rome 2 also lack in their depth of city management and relatability to the generals in medevil 2 i would get emotionally attached to generals and found it super cool how they had traits that described them like rabblerouser and then the developers actully took time to put cool little explinations of the traits where as in rome 2 and warhammer you just dont see cool little things like that in the game and your generals are honestly pretty uninteresting heck your general can even get the cuckold trait in medevil 2 which makes it hilarious also i have to mention the historical inaacuracies within rome 2 and how i find it disguisting that a game that literally was played by everyone for its historical accuracy when it first came out does somthing like that i can tell you that if total war started out a historically false fantasy tier game like it is today no one would ever have played the game and ca would be a bankrupted studio rn its only a matter of time until that happens though as the quality of their games are now trash and just because warhammer was a big hit they think their all high and mighty that they can get away with anything now and people will play their games regardless i can tell you their wrong and if they stay on this path the developers are gonna be collecting wellfare just like the sjw crowd they are trying to appease at the moment
