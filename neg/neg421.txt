2020 hello vault dwellers raiders toilet paper hoarders this is my review of the post apocalyptic mess that is fallout 76bethesda kept this game off steam in order to roll out their own launcher and secure higher profit margins cutting out the middle man now that the dust has settled and they have made a few more changes bethesda will repeat the process on steam to derive a second line of revenue for the title fallout 76 is a multiplayer mod for fallout 4 not a standalone game as they originally sold us todd howard the bethesda spokesperson touted that the title would have 16x the details of fallout 4 its just not the case they used mountainous terrain to populate the map with trees and foliage and added the buggiest light rays in existence with this iteration of the game rolling out on steam they have added npc s and additional story line this should have been there from the start i wont go into further details here for spoilers and such but one thing can be said the story flow is hideous i love rpg s but this game makes an absolute hash up of creating divergent story telling i m not going to dive into the negatives of the previous bethesda launch edition but in summary 1 it uses the fallout 4 engine therefore expect all the bugs with that engine to exist here 2 heavily monetized in the cosmetics section of the game stay strong don t throw your hard earned money at cosmetics in a game where the end game is very much short livedas gamers if we dont begin to unite and show corporate types like bethesda that we wont accept this kind of product rebaked to just further their profits they will continue to walk over us leaving the gaming landscape void of any new progressive titles stay safe everyone
