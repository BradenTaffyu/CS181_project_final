2015 so many other total war fans have left negative passionate reviews detailing what is wrong with this game like them i wanted to like it rome 1 remains my most played game of all time and enthralled me for almost 18 months straight to say that i was excited for rome 2 is an understatement my dissapointment is great but ultimately my review comes down to this it s boring and lifeless and that s the worst thing i could possibly say about any game the 100 hours i put in were in an effort to find the fun i didn t succeed but it did lead me to re buy medieval ii and pick up shogun ii for 8 during a sale i know i ll find the fun by rolling back the clock avoid this game if you re a total war fan if not meh maybe take a chance if you find it for a fiver but the older games are better
