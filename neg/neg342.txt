early access review i absolutely love this game and throughout the playtests the early launchers and everything else i have garnered well over a thousand hours of playing the game i ve recommended it to friends in the past i even bought it for my younger brother to play with me before free to play was an option the devs have been pretty good about adding content dealing with the hacker and rmt issue they ve been patching the game frequently literally a patch a week on average and yet in it s current state i simply can not recommend the game what made me fall in love with it the simple to learn but hard to master melee combat seems to basically not really be a thing anymore despite over a year of community complaints about ranger being extremely unfun to play against the class has only received buffs including on it s most controvertial feature the hunting trap nobody enjoys playing basically bunny hop medieval cod with everyone kiting all the time and yet every class and playstyle that does this has only received buffs in doing so bards got more tanky despite their movement speed survival bows were buffed the weapon master perk on fighters made survival bows better on fighters and most recently the warlock got a massive massive buff that makes him even more obnoxious to play against where he hits you once with a hitscan spell then runs away for 10 seconds till it wears off and he can hit you again wizards are absolutely busted and the only reason they re no longer considered s tier is because warlocks have completely taken over the only way to play melee now and have the remotest of a chance to actually play the game without avoiding all of the kiting classes which make up 90 of the playerbase since that is what works is to go into ungeared lobbies and play a naked barbarian that can feasibly keep up with all of the bunnyhopping in good conscience despite loving the game i can not recommend it in its current state the ability to bunnyhop must be removed or sway added to shooting casting on the move or significantly larger slowdowns when casting drawing a bow or the outright removal of certain classes weapons i bought into dark and darker not range and ranger or kite and kiter
