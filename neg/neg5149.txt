2016 the game itself is somewhat entertaining but that is where the positives stop the mechanics are significantly dumbed down to make it more accessible as it s clearly become more important to shift units rather than make a decent game i ve completed it 4 times with 4 different races and the only differences are aesthetic as it will always play out in the same way regardless of difficulty both battles and campaigns previous total war games have had dlc but it s been so minor compared to this absolute pay for additional heroes pay for additional campaigns pay for additional races chaos has such a huge role in the grand campaign so it definitely makes sense i should have to pay extra for them if i want to play from the other side beastmen too are present from the beginning of the base game but also require additional investment i would imagine for the next total war title i will have to pay to get past the tutorial stage and then by monthly installments for additional turns that you only receive empire 1 man faction of many dwarves 1 dwarf faction of many orcs 2 orc factions of many and vampire counts 1 vampire faction of many seems to have been designed to whet your appetite to encourage further purchasing of dlc this is even more ridiculous when you consider that the past 2 base games rome ii and shogun ii gave you more than 3 x as many choices from the off it cuts down massively on replayability which i view as a key element of tw games when i still find myself playing mw2 even if you can get over the sheer cost of owning the whole lot the game itself isn t anything special and doesn t set the world alight you would be better going back to rome ii and shogun ii rather than buying this turd there are no innovations to gamplay of previous tw titles and the novely of the warhammer theme isn t sufficient to overcome this as usual it wasn t really that playable until radious came along and saved the day how ca haven t realised people just want big armies and big battle yet is terribly confusing tl dr i ve left more valuable contributions to society on my girlfriends face don t waste your money
