2023 early access review i love this game its great its fun solo and with others and a21 did a lot of cool stuff the pois look great i even dont hate the magazine stuff like i thought i would but why do i lose the jar after i drink something do i just toss it away what the i dont wanna have to grind at a trader to buy water filters to make dew collectors the dew collectors are too big and why the do they have a heat map its a barrel and tarp what the i never used console commands till now why not lessen the sources of water rather than lessening the water overall or just make it so you need to do a bit more to boil water than before finding out about the water change as i played put a very bad taste in my mouth and kinda turned me off till its fixed if its fixed maybe its time i start downloading overhaul mods or just stick to zomboid they took something that wasn t an issue and made it unrealistically hard for realism and difficulty sake
