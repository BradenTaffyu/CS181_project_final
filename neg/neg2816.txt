2018 i can t recommend stellaris 2 2 in its current state there are several gamebreaking bugs that make the game unplayable past the early game 1 starbases and outposts are sometimes missing from stars and instead are all located in an enemy s capital star system making it impossible to wage war or occupy planets without an overwhelming fleet capable of taking on 20 starbases at once 2 every endgame crisis except for the unbidden is currently broken to quote a reddit thread on the bug originally posted by u smevis the prethoryn scourge i can speak from experience when saying this one isn t functioning correctly at all basically the prethoryn infestors which are supposed to purge planets of their pops and turn said planets into prethoryn domain aren t able to interact with them meaning that when you get the prethoryn scourge for your endgame crisis your situation log will never update into the state which allows you to capture the queen currently the queening achievement is unobtainable instead the prethoryn will destroy starbases and take territory but nothing else they are unable to spawn new fleets into the galaxy after you have destroyed their initial ones in my game they were hilariously easy to wipe out completely within a matter of months i was able to observe their infestors hovering over planets so i decided to leave them with a small 24k fleet in order to see if they would be able to bombard and infest any further this didn t happen and all of their ships civilian and military completely stopped functioning and froze in place for the next 50 years until i quit the game i haven t played it since the contingency not a great deal to say here because they suffer from the same problem of being unable to interact with the current planet system and therefore cannot get off the ground at all leaving their ai in a frozen or locked up state this needs to be addressed urgently i loved getting the new systems down and prospering but none of it means anything at all when the thing you were preparing for doesn t function it feels like a giant waste of time and completely pulls you out of the experience yes the ai isn t fantastic and yes there are some graphical glitches but this endgame crisis problem breaks the core of the gameplay simply hoping that we get the unbidden is leaving the game in a terrible state 3 lategame lag slows the game to a crawl it s even worse in some games than the lategame lag in the stellaris 1 0 4 the ai is unable to build anything other than corvettes or destroyers because it does not know how to utilize the rare resources necessary for larger ships and is completely incompetent at building a stable economy this is alleviated somewhat by the glavius ultimate ai mod but not enough to provide a challenge past the early game even on admiral or grand admiral difficulties the ai will simply swarm you with corvettes in sum there are a lot of great ideas contained in 2 2 but the core game is bugridden and completely broken this patch has essentially turned stellaris into shovelware i will retract my negative review when paradox patches the game back to a playable state which will likely be late spring or summer 2019 edit i m picking up the game again for patch 2 6 and some of these problems are alleviated although patch 2 6 brought a whole host of new bugs most notably sector automation being completely broken and the fleet manager not properly reinforcing fleets i can t tell you whether the endgame crises work yet because i haven t gotten that far i m suffering zero lag in midgame though which is promising still leaving a negative review until i play a bug free product which is probably never
