2023 1 it s indeed a pay2win there are multiple enemies in the game that are nearly impossible to deal head on unless the player is using gold ammunition which costs extra this will be a problem in tier viii x battles where gold ammo is 100 necessary even for an experienced player on top of this every once in a while wg would release an op tank that would ruin the mm for a while and then use the in the next patch we will nerf it sry as an excuse they re basically forcing the players to spend 30 50 on premium tanks and gold to win 2 arties what happens when you take a sniper from tf2 and give him a top down view but with crappier accuracy you get the spgs arties those things aren t that fun to use and it would serve no purpose other than annoying players of super heavy tanks on top of this they would be rendered completely useless when they re deployed in large city maps where their shots will be blocked by the buildings and there are some missions in the game that would force the players to use them those are just a handful of issues i ve faced with this game at the moment i would only return to it once in a while where they would have special events like return of the waffentrager or mirny but other than that i would more than likely keep it uninstalled from my pc
