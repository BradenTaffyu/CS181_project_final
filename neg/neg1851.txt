2023 i am writing this review to warn new prospective players of the hell you might step into playing this game the only reason this game survives is because fresh wales are paying hand over fist to skip its mountainous grind this could have be a great game but any high tier match up is pure torture because of course you have to grind for vehicle parts too just so you can use the fire extinguisher or unlock ammo types that are able to do damage early progression is deceptively fun and fast enough to lure the new players in however approaching br 4 you will start to feel gaijins money hungry claws pressing the slow down button furthermore this game is pay to win allowing you advantages such as taking more vehicles to battles in the air modes upgrading crew members premium vehicles etc the only reason this does not impact gameplay to much is because all of this is so ridiculously expensive you might as well buy a new car in addition this game is geared towards an influx of new victims players who will get destroyed by any veteran who actually faced the grind i ll give an example gaijin sells top tier vehicles like the f4 phantom for only 70 last time i checked this gives you a vehicle 2 of premium membership and some golden middle fingers for a price higher than a triple a game title the same price can give you a fully fledged video game or a season pass would there be a lot of players who d pay 50 a year for a season pass with premium however such long term strategies are beyond gaijins levels of comprehension i can only guess the reason but there is a 99 9999 chance it is because gaijin hates their player base if you absolutely have to play this game stay in the low tiers and enjoy yourself take care of your mental health and make sure not to buy premium because the game will remind you that it has expired everytime you restart the game for the rest of the games existence better yet hire a therapist and buy a car it would be significantly cheaper compared to unlocking a single tech tree
