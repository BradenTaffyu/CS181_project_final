2017 replacing my review as it was not informative enough as you can see from the hours i have played i greatly enjoyed this game i was not one of the people that disliked the settlement system or someone who was angry about the fading rp elements that being said i can no longer recommend a game published or made by this company again adding paid mods or some other method of rewarding mod devs for the hard work that is put in is not something i am against however the way bethesda has implemented this creation club shows it is not for the mod devs but is merely a cash grab for the company they are taking advantage of mod devs that do not know the value of the mods they create money being only a one time payment if bethesda wanted mod devs to get paid they would give them a cut of the profits or better yet all of them bethesda gains plenty of sales from people who enjoy modding and angering this crowd can harm fallout s status as a mod paradise bethesda has shown they do not care what people think only what makes them money tread carefully around any products they release in the future
