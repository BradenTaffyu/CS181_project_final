2014 this game sadly is so far removed from the rest of the total war games that we have come to love played 20 turns and during that small span of time i realized armies were next to useless when constantly assaulted with spies the spies are completely overpowered and the ai uses them every single turn against you apparently what i have taken away from this is that wars were won by spies and armies never meant back in the roman times this is honestly the worst title i have ever played
