2016 after playing a lot of european truck simulator 2 ets2 i was looking forward to american truck simulator ats however at the current stage is not up to the same standard as ets2 things such as the change in city design making larger cities with more stop lights the reduction in size of a majority of the non highway roads and the dramatic change in the economy increase in fine size and decrease in income has resulted in the game being a lot less fun than ets2 my recommendation is to buy ets 2 and the two dlc s for the same price as ats as you will be getting better value for money and a more enjoyable game later matt
