2018 early access review not recommended and the reasons are many old bugs keep returning new bugs get introduced the whole system gets overthrown every new alpha and from a17 it is now just a middle of the road kill some things get xp make a level get a skillpoint and spend it wisely game it s no fun any more like it used to be going through towns finding a toolstore or a gunstore and hitting the jackpot rummaging through some garbage on the road and finding the minibike book hallelujah now it s just mindless zombie farming for xp and points so you can level because you need it so you can buy the skill to make a minibike at a certain player level and a certain skill level then there is the ego of the developers and the mods that defend them like rabid dogs i have been coding in just about every language you can think of and can see right through all the bugs and glitches into the incompetence when i wrote that on the forum i got banned because feedback must be constructive and respectful calling the developers incompetent is not this after being told it was my fault for dying to the bug that hits things after you release the mouse button because well i opted in on an experimental that was released with trumpets blowing like the best thing ever only for youtubers with 5k subs though the plebs had to wait untill the best release day for games a monday so giving us an unfinished game riddled with bugs all the while yelling hallelujah is not disrespectfull then is it you can disrespect your comunity by putting out shoddy work but i have to be respectfull sure they raked in 60 million dollars in sales let s say half goes to steam and other parties that s still 30 million dollars but we have to be respectfull to you the new 4x4 is truely the pinacle of dumb you can hear it go through the gears while not speeding up at all the new encumbrance system if it wasn t so sad i d laugh really loud you can carry tons of stuff in weight but if you put a feather in a locked slot you slow down what but i guess that s why the players are here paying you for testing things like this because you could have never thought that looked stupid right i really liked this game that s why i got it the freedom of doing what you wanted avoid zombies kill zombies explore discover it s all gone an x amount of xp so you can get level x so you can buy a perk so you can boil a frigging egg lolyeah much better now also everyone i have seen playing laughs at the graphics but man they have improved sooo much the graphics guy is a true god amongst men self taught in only five years keep doing the old everyone is like me and keep thinking your players are stupid because you are i recommended this to my neighbour a guy with all the consoles all the games and every frigging peripheral there is he laughed at me after playing it and guess what he will never recommend to his huge group of gamer friends the steamcharts speak for themselves unlike your little poll that was filled out by a whopping 350 people of which most clearly are forum frequenting fanbois it looks good for you that poll see the final sentence of this review why rip 7 days to die it was fun while it was fun which it no longer is but i guess you have our money console owners are screwed who cares keep smiling keep being arrogant without reasons and remove everyone that sees through your incompetence and speaks up i have been banned from the steam forums now as well i won t even start about how the game runs but then again you can t run it on a potato like the developers keep saying the developers who can buy the latest rigs with our money 30 million remember and then tell you your rig sucks how many times do you need to upgrade to play a five year old game the arrogance incompetence and total disconnect from the playerbase is staggering they seriously think they delivered new blinders for christmas your old ones must be worn to threads edit a suprising number of positive reviews were posted in the last week s the majority with a few hours playtime and a lot that got the game for free people that got it on sale just after the a17 release no doubt just saying don t be fooled by this
