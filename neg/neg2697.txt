2020 this game has so much potential but the developers are not dealing with serious problems and instead pushing money grab dlcs there is a long list of issues well documented on the forums that have been around for a long time now including the excessive micromanagement that comes with the end game and relatedly the complete mess the population system has become after multiple ill conceived reworks it just isn t any fun after the early game wait for the next major update 2021 before buying it edit 21 april 2021 well the 3 0 patch has been released and it is disappointing this seems to be a symptom of the devs working too much in isolation from the community the changes they ve made to the pop system have improved some things reduced pops but made other things worse too many unfilled jobs it seems they are chasing their tails a bit and really should bring the community in on the inside of decision making like amplitude to help fix things i ve not really got much faith in this game going forward now and am looking to distant worlds 2 as my sci fi 4x game of choice
