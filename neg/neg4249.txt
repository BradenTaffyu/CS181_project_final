2023 i would love to recommend this game but i cannot this game is to difficult to learn and play many buildings i e gas pumps checkpoints etc don t work as expected it is in great need of additional tutorials for later buildings information on tooltips is inconstant important information at least what i think so is buried and hard to find i am tired of looking up thinks in a wiki in order to understand how things work after almost 800 hours i have still not been able to launch the rocket and complete the main game objective i am tired of playing this game however i may revisit it again later to see if klei make improvements p s the art music animations and sound are absolutely amazing
