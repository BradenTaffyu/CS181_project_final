2018 early access review if you re curious about playing this game don t be it is still in alpha 5 years on it once was fun but with non existant updates and bug fixes and forum moderators who ban you for asking a question about game a game breaking bug its just not worth the effort to play it s not worth the 25 price even on a steam sale as one of the moderators said wait for more information before complaining i would highly suggest waiting for some progress to be made on the game before purchasing giving a 3 10 because the premise is interesting
