2019 as much as i liked the game the fact that they sell your data to unsecured sites and governments has caused me to uninstall and i doubt i will be putting this game back on my computer and will be skeptical towards buying future civ games i would recommend the civ 5 and lower this one had nice ways to control your government and i liked that had more option for your economy but the battles are bland as its often 1 to 4 guy per a group fighting while in the past you would have 8 or 10 guy in a group and would make your army feel bigger the ai also sucks as they don t really get better at fighting when the difficulty is raised they just really get a better start than you
