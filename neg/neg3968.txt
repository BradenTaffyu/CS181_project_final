2020 dont invest they care little about customers after they have your money they have taken items from me then realized their mistake and put a portion of the money i need to repurchase on because they took wrong thing so i stuck with stuff i dont want and have pay 150 for stuff i do the other games look and play better iracing grabbed the web address first and won the sim racing marketing sweepstakes their multiplayer is ok and the sim itself is great for what it does if other titles had the same following and would do more for oval and spec classes in multi player with some marketing hype and they would crush iracing edit after 77 more hrs i still wish pj2 r3e or any other title new or existing could create a ui and mp format thet would take down iracing i would gladly forfeit the 300 investment i have in iracing and uninstall if i could race others regularly with good fps rating and incident managers i hate iracing as a company due to the lack of human personality in their cs but as i have said they have the monopoly
