2019 this is the game that punish the players who try to make plays hard while rewarding the one that plays passively if you re in for frustrating gameplay experience where nothing happens and waiting to be a punching bag 0 8 0 this is the game for you many many misturn made by the devs that willingly to push their idea that either won t work or outright breaking the game sterotype mmo grind quest system done in the most dragged out and boring way for the players to pad playtime each battle capped at 20 mins 3 mins spend in traveling and the rest is a battle of waiting for someone to make a move i don t use steam client so my playtime may seems on the low side but i had like 10k worth of matches in this game if you re curious about my stats and all that jazz look up for this exact username in wows sea server bugs that exist since beta never get address gui that is more of an annoyance full of stuttering and wait time so how come so many players and me put so much time in this game the answer is before all this dramas the game is at its peak with potential of being an absolute great game about warships we just put up with all the annoyance out of sheer will power hoping devs will soon make it better then comes this patch 0 8 0i don t intend to leave a review in this game knowing i m gonna be mostly negative about it but this patch pushes me here s my thoughts about it is the only game offers multiplayer naval warfare experience same goes for the other product of the world of both of them offers the players an experience they couldn t find anywhere else at the same time imprisoned them with their feeling of not having any other game offering this experience so yes if you re looking for a multiplayer naval warfare experience this is the best you get i don t recommend you ever try it unless you re willingly to throw away your time on waiting or being a punching bag
