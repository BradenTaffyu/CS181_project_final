2020 early access review with over 100 hours i feel safe to write a review of the game majority of the thumbs up reviews are certainly biased they just love the game because of what is is and not what it has first thing first the game itself has several horrible issues the primary one being it is poorly optimized in the current situation for medium to low end systems i highly recommend if you are in this group to wait and not buy reasons being that the game has known to use up to 16gb of ram and running with graphic issues with geforce 1060 s if you are in my boat and have a high end system you should be fine next the game is very very barebones with the devs locking features items and key ideas that they put forth for development are not in the game yet some examples of systems not in the game or are not completed sandbox none campaign the main storyline running your own kingdom perks are a mess xp gains broken children spouses family the content they do have is repetitive and lacking and most of the time breaks the few things the game has going for it are the graphics combat and battles the game is very pretty even with the occasional glitch the combat system is more refined and feels fluid finally the best part are the battles with no mods and a good pc you can get battles of up to 1000 soldiers which fills the massive map you can run strategies and different maneuvers you can also set the body count to unlimited which in the end feels much like a real battle it is epic as much as i love the game it is not really ready for ea let alone being 45 i want to love the game but it is not ready if you have any questions just ask
