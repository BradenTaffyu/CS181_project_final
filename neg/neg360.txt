2023 an excellent concept that could ve worked but the issue with this title is it was released so early in its development cycle that it was an unfinished prototype mess back in 2018 and to this day still buggy since this game is worked by a third party that s prioritising new content so anything from 2018 is either janky and or buggy if i hated the game i wouldn t have this many hours into it so want to say i love fallout love the idea of playing with friends in that world but for the love of tod make this free to play since its main issue is the price tag for a 2018 title and a mmo with 24 player servers 3 world bosses and the few public events that entertain higher level players take so long to wait since the game always chooses glorified busy work like free range or distinguished guests
