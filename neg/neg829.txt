2016 where to start well i figure i should start with the story put frankly it is not very good it s the cliche your child was kidnapped story and personally it does not feel like you have as much of an affect on the world as in fa nv overall the story isn t very entertaining but this is a fallout game so the story doesn t matter as much as say mass effect or the witcher that brings us to the gameplay and well it s alright guns feel nice and it s a lot easier to hit what you re aiming for you can customize your guns in a bit more depth than in fo nv you can change out barrels magazines sights muzzles stocks and on some weapons even add special effects it s a great idea but feels a bit half assed bethesda could easily expand on it and made it something great seriously why are a pipe pistol and pipe rifle different things i should be able to make a pipe pistol into a rifle by upping the barrel length and adding a stock but i can t along with the crafting system is a settlement system great you might say true it does give you the ability to get food and water as well as a safe place to rest no matter where you are which is especially useful in survival mode however in survival mode you cannot fast travel between settlements which is a bit annoying considering you cannot fast travel in survival mode settlements also have a scavengers workbench that you can place down assign someone to work allowing you settlement to passively gather resources for crafting though i do with the amount they gather would be increased bethesda has this thing for radiant quests so expect to hear another settlement needs your help here let me mark it on your map a lot i love the idea of building a community out in the wastes but no matter how many turrets i place or how many walls i build my settlers still managed to get kidnapped which is fairly annoying the world has a lot of cool locations in it but it all feels like a place on a map not a living world there is no karma like in past fallout games and no reputation system so unlike in fo nv you can t get a town to hate you by stealing from them and murdering them nor can you make them like you by helping them the story plus the static feeling world makes it so you don t really feel like you have an affect on the world in fo nv you can help the new california republic rescue hostiges from ceasar s legion and once that s done the soldiers move on from that area making it feel like they had a mission and are done with it so they are moving on now i believe that due to the lack of any real rpg mechanics contributes to the feeling of a static world gone are perks and skills now you just have perks since there is no level cap and there are only perks to worry about you could imagine that you would have a lot more freedom to build a character however that would not be the case some of the perks are so useful you take them as soon as you can like the ones where you can passify any creature or persons lower level than you some are fairly useful but are over shadowed like the perks that increase damage from a certain type of weapon and quite frankly some are completely useless but you will take anyway because you already took the useful ones ten levels ago now since there are no skills there are no skill checks none in past fallout games if you had certain skills leveled up or certain perks it would allow you to get a different ending to quests allowing for more role play possibilities but in fallout 4 that is not the case with the removal of skill checks comes a more simplified dialog system you now only have 4 options in any conversation and your character speaks a voiced player character is fine but with the restrictions on dialog it makes it feel like bethesda cut content to make it so your player speaks seriously you only have 3 real responses yes no sarcastic and half the time you get a different response than the one you wanted for example you can come across a character that wants some nuka cola and say you don t have some on you naturally you say no and you would expect your character to say sorry but i don t have any if you were playing a good character but no your character responds by saying get some water dirty bum and this problem happens pretty much anywhere the sarcastic responce which you would expect to be an evil way of saying no is nearly always a sarcastic yes now with the problems in the story and gameplay you could at least ask does it run well or are there any major bugs and the answer to those are no and yes respectively my computer has a gtx 980 sc 16gb of ram and an i5 4690k overclocked to 4 1ghz naturally you would expect this computer to run fo4 at about 60fps on fairly high settings and it does sort of on high ultra i cannot hold even 40 fps in the main city but in the wilderness i 100 and naturally fallout 4 runs on the creation engine so physics are tied to framerate so running fallout 4 at over 100fps causes the physics engine to run faster meaning small objects will get flung twice as far as they normally would hell i ve stepped on things and instantly died due to the physics bugs so it has some pretty major bugs has some bad gameplay and a bad story is it at least pretty well in some places yes it is looking over the wasteland from the top of trinity tower is a really nice sight and with some power armor you can jump down as the top of the tower is part of the main world texture wise even on ultra it looks pretty bad textures are smudged and low resolution models were reused and in some cases ripped from fo3 and fo nv overall i cannot reccommend fallout 4 yes it has some ideas that if expanded on could be very interesting but the bugs graphics and gameplay do not make up for it if you want to pick it up get it on sale
