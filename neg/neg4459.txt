2018 it doesn t add much to what civ 5 already did and keeps the same issues such as an absoloutely barebones ai that usually is unpleasant to play against this does not justify a at time of writing a 60 euro pricetag with an additional 60 euros for the dlc an absolutely extortionate price for what in effect is a dlc pack with nicer graphics now if you can get it for 80 off with all dlc included then i think you ll get your money s worth see ya in 2020
