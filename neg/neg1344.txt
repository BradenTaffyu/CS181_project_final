it s mount and blade warband with better graphics less features and less to do an that makes me sad i really enjoy the battles and the sieges and building a big army but once you in the mid endgame there is just nothing to do you wait till you can start a new war capture a few settlements and than you go back to waiting the developers havent released new content in years all they do are bug fixes and minor changes and they are not communicating with the community i guess they abandoned the game and develop something new to make more money if you want to play it buy it at a discount but its not worth full price
