2019 the only feeling i have when playing this game is wishing rome or attila had the diplomatic improvements aside from this one improvement it feels like a lot was removed from previous versions all the units look and feel the same across every faction naval warfare was removed completely auto resolve now but i m pretty sure there going to find a way to sell this to you in a future dlc the super hero action star focus makes it seem like this game was made for a much younger audience than previous titles the animations are cheesy and your regular army units are worthless bland and completely expendable telling everyone to charge right in has the same result as trying to implement any kind of strategy the turn based campaign map portion of the game has been improved significantly but the rts portion of the game is now a complete joke
