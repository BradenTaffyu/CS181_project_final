2018 early access review the game has a lot going for it i like the overall gameplay quite a bit actually the graphics are good as are the animations the ai is decent and pathing is solid the bits of technology you find tucked away are great and it s even got biomes good stuff the duplicant traits and stats are neat and your duplicants only get better over time well in most regards it s fun to explore and build up your colony the research tree is nifty and i like the constant balancing act amongst your various needs and goals i probably wouldn t mind hostile creatures being added at some point i have issues with the gas and liquid simulation they re terrible i don t know how anyone in their right mind could call them good in terms of how it flows even an ancient game like terraria had better water physics pressure equalization of gases is virtually nonexistant if you ve got a gaping hole in the floor with a ladder that a person can traverse i assure you that a large delta in air pressure between floors we re talking meters apart will be rapidly corrected i m not saying the game needs to be realistic but there s got to be a sane middle ground and this isn t it there s also the issue of non renewable water water should be re entering your system as vapor and that vapor should mix with your atmosphere and recondense depending on conditions if the temps are right you might even form low lying fog anyway the depleting water makes hydroponics completely unattractive until you find a magical infinite water geyser algae should be harder to find but self replicate so i don t have to replenish it or maybe make the self sustaining algae further up the research tree maybe add dehumidifiers to make it easier to extract the water where you want it i really want to love this game but i just can t recommend it at this time i don t mind that i gave them my money they re a good outfit and i ll revisit the game after a couple updates
