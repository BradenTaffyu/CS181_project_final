2022 i really loved this game up to this point got around 4 chars at max level and then 7 0 hit the new ui hurts to look at too much contrast they tried to use a minimalistic approach but it resulted in a new ui with blue s that are too bright blacks which are too black and no shading to ease it on the eyes besides that they even managed to only revamp the ui for some of the menu s there are multiple menu s they just plainly forgot to do when inspecting how items look on your character you can t move the camera up and down anymore so i can t even zoom in on the helmet i m trying to inspect the new character inventory menu does not allow moving either only spinning around your character the update wiped most of my hotbars some abilities have just disappeared others have been randomly moved around it seems i dislike how you now need to go and choose between abilities can be active or passives which in some cases really negatively affects builds and the second movement system is just a switch between classes style rather than being able to incorporate parts of another class into your current build the new level cap means all gear you had is now useless and new gear needs to be refarmed the newest endgame gear is also locked behind raids meaning people who don t have dedicated raid groups might have a very difficult time trying to farm some endgame gear even the gear for solo play ontop of that the new questline is short from what i ve yeard yet to play it myself but i ve already seen friends of me encounter multiple blocking bugs which prevented them from progressing without having to redo a part i really liked the game and put in a decent amount of hours before i switched to the steam version but this update has been quite disappointing and demotivating as i personally do not feel like needing to invest time again to level my previously max level characters again and farm raid gear again just to attempt raids with builds which will most likely perform worse than before due to the new skill system
