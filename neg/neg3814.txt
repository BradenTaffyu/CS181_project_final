2019 early access review i love this game ive put a hefty amount of hours into it bad news is the game is dead devs took a nice steaming pile on it with alpha 17 the only good thing about alpha 17 were some of the new vehicles sort of as a consequence to alpha 17 being so awful many had stayed on 16 which split populations which made people leave which killed population which made more people leave public servers are a ghost town discord is the same the only way i could recommend this is if you have friends who will play with you on a server on alpha 16unless you like playing alone which this game imo is not enjoyable after a short time alone
