2017 oh boy where do i start i have played over 450 hours modded and un modded and am still divided on this gamethe good gunplay the gunplay is the best it s ever been in the series with weapons being a statisfying means to an end the weapon modding by this i mean the in game weapon alterations the fact that you can mod most any weapon in some way or another to suit you style is quite nice and it means you tend to use your weapons longer than you would in previous installements a fully upgraded 10mm pistol is still quite powerful into the midgame visuals the game looks quite nice with good quality textures and effects on the whole the companions if you don t mind characters spouting the same boring phrases every few minutes the companions done quite nicely they have personal arcs but i personally found them useful only for their perks and it doesn t help that one of the best perks only works if you either use no companion or dogmeat the side stories there are some really interesting side stories happening in this game from the cabot quests to discovering a pre war cult s remains hidden in a mine the mixed voice acting the decision to voice act the mc was quite divisive with some people liking it and some hating it personally i find it to take away a bit from the roleplaying since the character now decides how something is said rather than me choosing to interpret something a great example of this is when the character is reuniting with their son shaun i couldn t care less about the thing but my character was almost in tears whithout me being able to choose anything about it large world empty characters there might have been about 4 characters in the entire game i could care about with dogmeat hitting the top spot and other dogs filling in spots 2 4 the world is quite big and it s not empty of buildings and cool places to explore the people in it are about as useful as a 3 pound note most characters would die if you didn t remind them daily that breathing was a vital human need i ended up adventuring alone most of the time and just didn t bother with companions the bad dialogue options while the voice acting can be nice it seems like they had to severely limit the main character s dialog options because of it the dialog system is terrible 4 options and none of them ever tell you in detail what your character is going to say get a mod that changes this to actually showing every line the character will say it ll save you getting into a fight because you disagree with how the devs interpreted annoyed the quests hoooo boy the quests if it s not a go here interact with object quest it s a go there kill that quest the quest variety in this game is exceedingly small and while there s a large number of them they all start to feel the same after a while the stories behind them can be nice but they all boil down to doing the same thing alternate options if like me you really enjoyed finding alternate solutions to problems that aren t telling a person to go away or a more permanent telling them to go away by accelerating pieces of plasma in the general direction of the local annoyance you are going to find them in short supply in this game in the whole of the game there are about 3 skill checks that aren t charisma most charisma checks boil down to gimme money there is one way to achieve a quest and that s the path the devs laid out bloody disgraceful the main story as i mentioned before i did not care in the slightest about finding my kidnapped baby why because the entire time i spent with the thing boiled down to it crying pressing a on it once and then nothing i have literally no emotional attachment to any character in the main story i literally only cared about elder maxson because i wanted his coat which is an awesome piece of gear btw there was nothing in the main story that interested me and in a game with this many chances to draw me in that s a blooming disgrace all in all the game is a mixed bag if they had not thrown a fallout label on this i could have accepted this as a good game but this shares about as much with fallout as dungeons and dragons does with programming while there might be people who enjoy both don t expect this to be good if you liked the old ones a lot but it s a decent game on its own 7 10 nothing stellar nothing great
