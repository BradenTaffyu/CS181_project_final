2023 one of the more unique gameplay styles in a game with one of the worst grinds this game is rather distinctive and definitely enjoyable to play as far as fpss go but it is very predatory in its pay to play tactics despite being free to play with huge amounts of monetisation opportunities already in game latest few updates are making game s economy less and less feasible if you don t pay monthly subscription premium account or buy premium vehicles so i would advise you to stay away from this game if you know you ll like it be prepared to spend a few aaa games in cash on it or just don t try it and keep your money and time and sanity
