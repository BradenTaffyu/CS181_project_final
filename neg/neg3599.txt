2022 early access review surely 9 years is enough time on steam to stop tweaking and stop the early access nonsense i ve been playing this game since the very early days and i ve come to dread every new tweak that come with yet another update i am convinced the devs hate their player base each update seems to invent new ways of hampering the players and pigeonholing them into the way they want you to play the game going underground invent digging zombies with infinite ability to sense you using a vehicle invent exploding birds with unlimited speed making a bunker invent expoding zombie bullet sponges that destroy all but the strongest blocks should you shoot them in the chest and lately even farming got the axe with diminishing returns and rng slowing you down with more busywork i could forgive that if only they just chose the way to go and stuck with it the game entered steam on december 13th 2013 let that sink in
