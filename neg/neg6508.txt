2022 dont mistake my negative review for disliking the game i personally think the game is fantastic however a remote code execution exploit or rce for short has been discovered in the games netcode effectively making the game a virus for anyone who plays it online this exploit allows anyone who invades your game or someone you summon to run code on your computer without your consent this exploit can be used to simply crash someones game or open up random programs on the users computer steal private information or even brick your pc the community managed mod anti cheat blue sentinel has patched out the exploit and it is highly encouraged that you install the mod before playing the game i have linked the mod below for convenience im thankful for the effort of the developers behind the blue sentinel mod and their speedy response in fixing the exploit the community should not be responsible for making sure a product works and is safe for its user base this responsibility should fall on the developers and the publishers i hope to see an official response from either bandai namco or fromsoftware soon addressing the issue and insuring us this issue will not be present in the upcoming elden ring until then i cannot safely recommend a game that has the potential to harm your pc
