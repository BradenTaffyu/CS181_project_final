2023 the game is fun for sure and then you realize you ve done the same quest 15 times visited the same towns hundreds of times and clicked through more menus then i wanna count the fun part of the game is the battle simulator it s fun riding around with a bow killing people it s fun implementing battle tactics but that is all there is in the game you kill the same bandit parties hundreds of times in the early game then as you progress to the 50 150 troop range the game really shines as combat is more than f3 charge then you experience your first seige and first massive 1k field battle and you love it then you do that again and again and again and again because that is the only thing that is interesting about the game there is no interesting kingdom politics or trading or anything related to non battles so you eventually get tired of it and quit the game because you are stuck in a endless loop of 1 hour fights there s plenty of reviews saying it shallow as a puddle and completely lifeless the dev s have done very little overall their native country has had issues aplenty recently but still it s a little sad how many of the core issues are still not fixed years later especially with the amount of dev time before the game came out stay away and check back in 10 years the base game might have more interest but the mods will have definitely carried the game just like warband edit i do wanna say that i did get 400 hours out of it mostly dropping like 50 hours into a play through every couple months i do afk in games a lot so who knows really but besides my very first play through it was all modded i d recommend experiencing warband first
