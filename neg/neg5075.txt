2018 amazing game great expansions via dlc good warhammer feel can not recommend why ca often abandons their older games after introducing game breaking bugs when patching the newer versions see empire total war vs napolean total war empire was horribly broken and left alone in favor of releasing the latter also medieval total war 2 armor shield bug for knights causing negative armor unless you bought the kingdoms expansion in warhammer s case two of the factions have critical elements that are non functional in the campaign specifically multiplayer wood elves clan angrund dwarves can not confederate in multiplayer due to a bug introduced in a dlc intended for warhammer total war 2 which also impacted 1 this bug on tww 1 has been known at least since august 2017 and was even confirmed by a ca staff member on their official forums it is still not fixed can not recommend i will alter my review accordingly if it is ever fixed maybe 8 months have passed and it remains unfixed
