2022 if you notice the announcements above you ll see that there has been no continued support since may of last year for this game beyond official integrations of various board games no additional tools no bug fixes nothing the game used to receive consistent support but this has since stopped in addition the devs have displayed that they are homophobic and transphobic on one hand this would be only so much a problem if this were a single player game but it s not search for the topic tabletop simulator studio berserk games kicks you for mentioning if you are gay or trans on reddit for this demonstration including implying that being gay or trans are fetishes or political this is unacceptable as it prevents any sort of lgbt community from forming in the game from the chat itself or finding any lgbt groups to play games with from the same chat do not buy this game until a change has been demonstrated
