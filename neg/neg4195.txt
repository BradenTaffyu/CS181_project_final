2015 while arma 3 is a great game that i enjoy playing i cannot support the practices of the developer and their 3rd party anticheat system by recommending this do not buy any bohemia product that requires the battleye anticheat in order to play on the vast majority of the multiplayer servers unless you want to repeatedly buy that product every time they accuse you without evidence if they globally ban you for a false positive as occurred in my case there is no recourse and no way to ever get your steam game to work properly and on top of this it will render you unable to play 2 other products if you own arma 2 and dayz sa bohemia doesnt help you and battleye support consists of an automated message telling you that they are infallible and that your ban is legit as far as they are concerned before they ever do any research into what occurred for people who try to tell you things like oh but you can still play single player i say try to play single player in dayz it doesn t exist if you get a fraudulent global ban in any arma based game you will not be able to play dayz sa anymore this is denying me access to a product that i purchased in an illegal and arbitrary fashion there is no way to get support from battleye and it has been reported many times as a scam company one of the greatest signs of this is your ability as a consumer to contact a company there is only one email address for battleye and it only responds with an automated message telling you that you are screwed and have to send bohemia more money to play your games again if you even try to find other ways to contact this company you will be sorely dissapointed as they have made sure to have no other public facing email accounts and no phone number that reaches a live person available to the public in every country i know of this is known as blackmail and fraud ps if you post here with some inane and call me a hacker like a stupid pre teen expect your inane to vanish i am 100 a legit player like many of the other people who have been banned by battleye for a false positive and i am an upstanding member of multiple gaming communities known for my legitimacy and my constant pushing for fair and balanced play i have thousands of screenshots of my gameplay that show this and nobody has a single shred of evidence otherwise plenty of other people have been slandered about being hackers in this fashion for the same reason by nitwits who know nothing of what occurred you can do this crap on reddit where you can hide behind the internet acting like a child but not on my review enjoy
