2016 it pains me to write down that i don t reccommend purchasing american truck simulator american truck simulator ats created by scs responsible for legendary titles like truck trailer extreme trucking german and uk truck simulator euro truck simulator and euro truck simulator 2 should ve been a slamdunk shoe in in all and every aspect and it just isn t the ai is a definate step back from the ai in ets2 and it will slow down and or brake violently where it isn t needed traffic rules ai is over zealous and will issue fines upwards of 700 ingame currency for the minorest of mistakes the map is tiny and the two states provided cali and nevada are so condensed that a trip from la to oxnard is in length comparable to rotterdam amsterdam in ets2 time flies so fast that your fuel tank is always empty and your trucker is always yawning the two brands of trucks the game starts with are legendary and speak to the imagination peterbild and kenworth the adidas and puma of the truckingworld but they re weaksauce dinkytoys that can t even pull a load up a hill without losing steam and are hardly the monsters they ought to be the highway system portrayed in the game which is a simulator does in no way reflect the actual highway system in use in america today and is in that aspect worse than the german autobahn portrayal in ets2 the handling of the trucks feel floaty or loose which gives the whole experience a very arcady feel ats is however a beautiful game much of which a follower of scs has come to expect but beautiful graphics do not make a simulator realism as much as possible anyway and depth of simulation is ats is an arcade trucking game much like big motha truckers but without the fun i would suggest that you buy euro truck simulator 2 it has more depth of simulation more destinations less absurd time compression more trucks more jobs more different trailers and a more diverse landscape it s also cheaper both in the meaning of the word and in what you get for your money
