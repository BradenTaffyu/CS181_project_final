early access review pretty okay overall obviously i have a couple hours in it good premise and excuse for the spawn craft die repeat type gameplay but boy howdy is it a mess the dev team outright sucks and their fanboys hold them on a holy pedestal and think they can do no wrong 11 years can you imagine how alarmed i was when i found out this game is 11 years old not quite as alarmed as i was to find out all the actual work done to the game to make it fun was done in the last year by modders that they hired because they put that stuff in the game when it should have been there in the first place see that little early access tag it s a lie and an excuse for laziness no game should be in ea for 11 years just call it a live service game and quit yanking people even ark fans called bs on the 10 year ea tag maybe the devs would have better luck getting content out at a respectable pace if they got the off reddit for a little bit but hey who s to know all i know is i see certain devs alarmingly active on the reddit assuring people struggling with their game not running that it s definitely user error and not the fact their 11 year old spaghetti flavored legacy code is garbage and breaks apart at the seems constantly game is just aight vanilla but mods are essential to making it more than a walking simulator and the devs know and rely on that 6 10 i m gonna play it but i refuse to just ignore behavior from dev teams that word indie does not absolve you of criticism
