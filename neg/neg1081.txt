2017 paid mods are a move and horrible idea not only for the most obvious reasons explained in other reviews but for people who mod their game f4se is a big dependency for modders but its dependant on the current fallout 4 version with the creation club bethesda have to update the game every single time they add another paid mod to their fiasco which means modders have to wait for the script extender team to update f4se bethesda i used to be a huge fan of theirs but they dont care about making good games anymore they only care about money now like every other big companies out there
