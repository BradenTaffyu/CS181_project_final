2023 this game has great gameplay but suffers from a completely jumbled visual design and frankly cringeworthy story there are three main visuals you will see when playing the game 1 actual gameplay2 cutscenes3 character portraitsall 3 of these things are completely dissonant from one another the gameplay visuals i would consider the best but also suffer from a kind of amateur design the cutscenes are what ruin the game to me the small character overhead stuff looks directly ripped from rpg maker and actually do not add to the storytelling of the game if anything they take away from it it is embarrassing to witness and the character portraits clash so uncomfortably with the other two designs they re weirdly realistic not saying anime is better but they do not match the other designs implying they really didn t have anyone who knew what they were doing or had different people make different visuals which is a terrible idea if they even made them at all i am 99 sure most visuals from this game were taken from somewhere else as for the story i can tell they tried to make something that both had nuance but could easily have been a fire emblem story the problem is they failed the story involving the demi humans reborn into the characters is just not compelling and invokes a kind of deus ex machina vibe in the middle of it the early stuff involving medieval court intrigue is far better but the faiths they created in the story are frankly too silly and ruin the whole thing for me by the time the optional missions unlocked roughly 20 missions in i was not compelled to continue which is a shame because the actual written dialogue isn t bad it s actually surprisingly natural feeling and as for the gameplay its not perfect of course a lot of things can be expanded and refined but it was easily the best aspect the problem is you can t not look at the terrible graphics and read the terrible story there is no pure gameplay mode those two things are inescapable the reason i m not reccomending this game is because the developers are in danger of losing the foothold theyve made if they do not address these issues the gameplay is all easily stealable by another developer and all theyd have to do is actually put more effort into their graphics and storytelling and then it ll be all over for this game and developer
