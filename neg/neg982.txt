2016 i m sorry for the super long review but with the addition of this new patch i couldn t keep quiet any longer i don t care if most people dont like this game because it doesnt t feel like recent fallout games i still love this game i was able to look past the dialogue systemi was able to look past the never original legendary weapons that replaced unique guns from past fallouts rewarded to you for exploring i was able to look past the sub par generic ass story and finally i was able to look past the bug towards the middle of the far harbor dlc during the puzzle sections that prevented me from progressing and the only way i got past it was because i spent a half hour deleting blocks using console commands and reloading my game more than i could count above all else despite all those problems i still had fun with this game however with this new patch they have established i have to put my foot down and not recommend this game and it pains me to do so and here s why this new patch now has the forced feature of adding a mods section in the games main menu which would be fine if it wasn t forced on you i will be using the term forced a lot in this review the game now forces you to go to the mod section of the menu and manually select all of your previously installed mods that you want loaded into the game why is this a problem well if you people are anything like me you have a lot of mods so i spend literally 5 minutes spamming the down and enter keys selecting all of my mods every time i start up the game so i can play with my mods and there is noo way to save your mod load so you have to do this everytime you start up fallout to add insult to injury the game has to reload itself to play your loaded mods so it has to load for another 10 minutes just so you can play with your mods essentially the game reboots every time you start up the game not only that but they now disable your achievements when you have mods installed this was my final straw most of my mods are just graphic overhauls and role playing items to make my gameplay more meaningful i am also sort of a completionist with these types of games so now that i can no longer get achievements just because i wanted my game to look prettier just completely broke my heart and to put the cherry on top of this patch you have to make an account at bethesda net to even have the permission to use mods in their game and half the time bethesda net cant connect so your stuck modless and for most modders that means you are stuck not being able to play the game so with a sexy man tear running down my cheek i have to give this honestly great game a piss poor review and not recommend it with this patch they totally ruined their relationship with the modding community and unless this patch is removed or tweaked i believe that my time in the fallout universe has been stopped to a grinding hault
