2018 edit ca releases in china netease gets their grubby little fingers in the pie prices go up and now if you have to pay 72 canadian for a 6 year old game and this is after ca decided to be huge pricks to their player base and lose a lot of credit and respect i very much doubt this will kill the company but ow boy you don t need to be an economist to see that this is going to hurt bad and they deserve to feel every little sting since its their own doing in all the game isn t worth it anymore base game is overpriced and dlc more so stay the hell away from it went with a day one purchase that came with a ton of bugs poor customer service poor development and now we have the developers calling us neckbeards and women haters doesn t matter how many hours i put into the game or how much i liked it at one point the fact the developers told off their customers is an automatic no from me i put up with a lot of their crap and this just nails the coffin i personally like the option to include women and mod them in since you can further fluff your army but this is a blatant political agenda to change history for personal gain all while killing my mod compatibility and attacking me as a fan
