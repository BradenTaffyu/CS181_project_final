2016 for all its new bells and whistles civilization vi isn t all that different from civilization v gameplay elements introduced in brave new world such as tourism and trade routes make a return while new elements like the civics tree and ai agendas provide new challenges and opportunities for playing the game of history it s a shame that civilization vi is so fundamentally flawed that these new elements feel ill thought out and basic mechanics are suddenly far more clunky and annoying than before as of right now at launch i would not recommend civilization vi civilization vi is undoubtedly a very pretty game especially when there aren t any battles being fought the level of detail is some of the greatest i ve seen in a 4x with your city centers growing and evolving with the technological era and units looking civilization appropriate the strategic map is gorgeous the colors are bright and vibrant while the terrain and resource drawings are lush with detail the leader portraits and animations as well as the victory movies are very pretty and much more satisfying than civ v s stiff images and animations unfortunately civilization vi doesn t know how to pace itself researching technologies and civic policies is simply too fast part of the problem is that the standard civilization tech tree is now split in two and researching both at once causes you to advance at a far faster pace than your economy can take advantage of with the new eureka mechanic it s astonishingly easy to start researching future tech before you get your first nuclear weapon resource yields from tiles improvements and buildings are so that you ll probably spend most of your time focusing on gold or faith so you can just buy everything instead of wasting dozens of turns building them i suspect the decision to make buildings give flat yield bonuses was so that policy cards and strategically placing districts and wonders would have greater impact on the gameplay but it was a dumb decision because production now takes forever meaning you can easily skip over entire eras of buildings and units and end up with crossbowmen and jet fighters in the same war and even if you buy an army moving units is far more difficult than it needs to be often times you ll be told your unit lacks the movement to go up a hill or through woods and no unit can cross a river tile if they had moved previously in the turn no matter how much spare movement they have it slows exploration and warfare down tremendously and it shouldn t surprise you if you cannot uncover a full standard sized world before you reach the atomic era and get access to the earth satellite national project which reveals the entire map it doesn t help that you can t build roads without an expensive unit making moving within your own empire just as difficult as moving in the wilderness the end result is that civilization vi feels both very slow and very fast you ll race through history snatching up technologies and civics far ahead of the ai but struggle to build an empire as your production queue bottles up thanks to low yields even with helpful civic cards you could easily and will probably be forced to bypass most unit and building choices to focus on achieving one victory condition and in a single player game it will probably feel like a completely undeserved victory the single player ai is terrible there s no other word for it it can t make strategic city placement choices it can t match a player in terms of technology or civics it can t even fight a war despite outproducing most players in terms of units because all it does is throw outdated obsolete units into range of your cities and wait for you to kill them and in every game there is at least one ai player that thinks it s a city state and focuses on pumping out units to protect its capital even if it produces a settler it s a terrible ai and the only way it could possibly be competitive is by cheating at yields to increase production but since it would still make terrible strategic choices it would still be a horribly easy opponent surprisingly early game barbarians are more of a threat than the ai civilizations by default they behave like raging barbarians in civ v they keep the ancient and classical eras interesting to play through if you can t find other civilizations to pound on it s a shame that they never improve though and it s a hassle to find that they continue to spawn outside owned tiles throughout the game since they re just a nuisance by medieval speaking of owned tiles spreading your borders is incredibly slow and the art for districts and improvements is disappointing you ll never see an endless legend like conurbation densely packed with buildings and sprawling across entire regions everything will be squeezed together and it will look like a small town until it suddenly springs skyscrapers in the modern era amidst fields and mines and wonders culture growth is slow no matter what you build and even now i m not entirely sure what causes borders to spread you ll always be wondering whether you should cannibalize an improvement or resource or spend gold to expand this is probably to balance the fact that cities now sprawl out over all tiles so that you have to focus individual cities down to a few districts but it means your empire will rarely expand to an impressive scale a lot of civilization vi s new mechanics aren t explained even if you set the advisor level to new to civilization vi in the options menu besieged a city great why and for what purpose so defenses and defenders don t heal but nothing explains it not even the civopedia not enough amenities for your city you have no idea where they went and little idea which ones they re benefitting from civilization vi holds your hand through the most basic mechanics but won t explain any of the more complex ones it introduces the ui is a major factor in obscuring information useful to the player while it is a little cleaner than civ v s it gets rid of a lot of information and shortcuts to more detailed information wondering how many amenities you have and if you can trade any of them away there s no list of them trying to see the attack range of your ranged units unless an enemy is actually in range you can t see it or see the effect of any terrain on it getting told your cities are getting unhappy because you re lacking amenities the actual information as to why and the rate at which they are approaching rebellion is hidden behind several buttons because the devs didn t want it cluttering up your city screen actually building things in your cities telling your trade units to move between cities or start new trade routes and even switching between selected units is a chore buttons for lists and views are spread to all four corners of the screen forcing players to focus on all the farthest corners if you need more detailed information and most of the information is too wordy and dismayingly uninformative it s hidden away because it clutters the screen but most of it is so much empty numbers and statistics that finding the data relevant to you in any given turn is more difficult than waging a war people say that vanilla civilization v was a mediocre stripped down game compared to beyond the sword civilization iv i actually enjoyed vanilla civ v and the expansions only made it better vanilla civilization vi is a legitimate mess the ai is like a child the ui is a chore and the game s mechanics actively fight you when they re not hidden and unclear and that s without touching on the game s sense of humor which injects itself into every sequence of text longer than seven words it might or might not be to your liking much like the game itself but i would say it s not worth the price
