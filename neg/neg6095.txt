2014 despite the steep learning curve i was very excited when i first started playing euiv i have played mostly singleplayer and over the past few months have seen the updates ruin the sp game paradox has clearly stated that it now wants to concentrate on the multiplayer aspect the head of paradox has come out and said that he has tested the latest update while only playing multiplayer which is idiotic as the vast majority of euiv have never even tried mp paradoxs response to fan complaints and critiicism about this direction has been hostile he delete threads in their forums if they are negative of paradox and their general attitude is if you don t like it too bad needless to say this will probably be my last paradox purchase and the one major flaw that you will discover as a single player is boredom if you are not fighitng a war there is simply nothing to do so you end up running the game on it s fastest speed until the nest conflict at least with civiliztion victoria 2 and crusader kings there were acivities to do even if you werent warring and didn t even have to be a war monger to find the games entertaining so unless you plan on playing multiplayer al the time or can get this game at 75 off like i did i would not recommend it
