havent even completed a playthrough trying to figure out what to do with the minimal amount of info the quests give is a pain especially when trying to play as a heretic certain parts of quests will be blocked if you dont use certain items at certain times which would be fine if the game told you this having to restart certain parts of the game because quests dont tell you anything is the worst part of the game unless you love warhammer or your a masochist i strongly dont recommend buying it
