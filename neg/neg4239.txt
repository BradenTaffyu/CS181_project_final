2021 if rimworld gave you the illusion of actually having any control over your colony maybe this will do it too as another reviewer said playing this game is an act of unending frustration because you can never tune your colony to become a well oiled self sufficient machine the game seems to encourage you to make increasingly intricate mechanisms in order to solve emerging problems similar to factorio unlike factorio you are not rewarded for producing solutions you are punished with new problems the gas physics in this game are unrealistic and complete unintuitive gasses just don t sink and rise and move around in any way that resembles common sense the game pretends to be smart by recording the precise heat amounts in every tile every tile has a conductivity thermal capacity and temperature and yet energy is not conserved in this game a number of processes will just destroy create heat and or energy it makes absolutely no sense your base will heat and heat and heat until your colonists die from not being able to work due to heat exhaustion you cannot do anything about this oh that is unless you read the wiki to find out how to deliberately abuse bugs oversights in the game code in order to remove heat from the map the only way to play this game is to read the wiki and min max everything abusing all possible game mechanics while you re at it nothing in this game makes any common sense there are probably tens of random little design philosophies you have to follow in order to work around the game s broken mechanics for example make sure every room has air permeable tiles as its flooring and it is essential that every door be raised up off the ground otherwise when your colonists pee their pee will spread like it s a bloody superfluid spreading out across 10 tiles of flooring dripping down your vertical access shafts oh now a cleaner needs to waste half their day simply getting to the bottom of the ladder cleaning it up and getting back up there s no oxygen down there gasses don t behave properly so they need to take breather breaks all the time food is a finite resource too the game is literally designed so that you will fail it is not possible to win and create a self sustaining colony resources for food must be collected manually e g fertilizer you cannot achieve a self sufficient state not even in principle food depletes far too quickly put this game next to factorio and you have a turd novel for a while but ultimately you can t polish a turd i enjoyed this game well enough for a while but it left a sour and frustrating taste as i realised that the goal the game was pushing me to achieve a self sufficient colony and infrastructure is actually not even possible you know there s a reason that we don t have more rogue like base building games
