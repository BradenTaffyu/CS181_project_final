2017 the ai is too unprediciatable and unclear at the diplomatic portion of the game if you attack anyone even in defense you are branded a war monger allies switch alliances for 0 reason without provication explanation or cause they will denounce you for the vaguest of reasons and then attack for no cause at all i m done playing a game where i have to walk around the ai constantly its like every single one of the leaders in this game are on an emotional rollercoster and you can t tell how they will act from turn to turn that s not life thats bad programming
