2023 great job adding a launcher that literally no one wanted launcher seems to be built with electron or something similar so every time you launch the game you have to wait for all that web bloat to wake from it s slumber then you can go back to the launcher and start the game again because starting it from steam wasn t enough i hope this gets removed soon and doesn t turn into an another deltav fight between devs and the players
