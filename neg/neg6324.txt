2023 i m only giving this game a negative review because it is ridiculously overrated this is a solid 6 10 game that can deliver a fun experience but also has some huge problems the good visuals and atmosphere graphics style and map design are done well and contribute to creating a great immersive atmosphere in the game the hogwarts castle is huge and feels very much alive just exploring it and the surrounding areas is enough to keep you entertained in the first hours of the game if you are looking to feed your nostalgia associated with harry potter movies or books this game will deliver the not so good gameplay and physicsthe combat is fast paced and throwing enemies around with your spells is satisfying the problem is that it s way too easy even on the hardest difficulty setting after you unlock teleport a level 5 talent there is zero challenge in the game every fight boils down to spamming teleport and attacking there is no reason to use potions other than heal plants block or counter attack even if you fail to dodge an attack enemies can t kill you in one hit and you can carry 25 healing potions which instantly restore you to full health these potions drop from enemies and after you unlock the room of requirement they can be crafted for pretty much nothing after this combat becomes a chore and you will eventually find yourself using stealth just to save time rpg elements are fluff and do not add much depth to the game process your character is always going to end up exactly the same there is no way to build differently all gear you find just passively increases either your offence or defence stat and scales with your level there is no unique gear this is not a role playing game this is an open world action game with role playing elements like far cry with magic instead of guns another big issue is the player s interactions with the world all immersiveness that the game is trying to create is ruined once you cast a spell that would throw someone across the room in combat on a civilian npc and they just keep walking completely unaffected or when you try to pet a cat and the screen goes black then a cut scene of your character petting a cat is played or when you break into someone s house in the middle of the night and they don t even acknowledge your presence the bad story and charactersi feel like the writers for this game were trying to make the works of j k rowling seem like misunderstood masterpieces harry potter fanfics written by 12 year olds tell more engaging and imaginative stories than the main story of hogwarts legacy you know everything about the plot the moment the caricature main villain is presented to you the only interesting story line is sebastian s who is the only character that is not either lawful good or chaotic evil and the only character that does something the player can t predict all other events in the game are as predictable as the ending of titanic or as insignificant as my most of the dialogue in this game is pointless you can remove 70 of it and nothing will be lost from the story almost all dialogue options are i will do it and i don t want to but i will still do it even when dialogue options seem like they are presenting a choice your character does the same thing regardless what you choose like when you can choose to take the villains power for yourself in the dialogue before the final fight just so your character can ignore your choice in the cut scene after the fight voice acting is also not great most characters just say their lines with no emotions including the player character conclusion the first 20 hours of the game keep you entertained with exploring the world and trying out different spells in combat if you were a harry potter fan as a kid this game invokes some good nostalgia as well beyond that it has little to offer i think the main problem is the devs designed the game for little kids forgetting that the kids that liked harry potter are now fighting each other over custody of their own kids
