early access review i spent over 5k hours playing ase asa on pc consol pve mainly and i think ive finally had enough of it i seriously cant reccomend this game to anyone anymore ark itself feels like its dying everytime they try to release something delay after delay dissapointment after dissapointment i tried giving it a chance but the game is still a unfinished unoptimized mess even after all the delays and updates and even a whole remaster of the game and it still runs like garbage on a brand new high end pc it also sucks alot because this game was a big part of my life and it used to be my all time favorite because there isnt anything like it yet now when i try to play it it feels like im wasting my time when i could be playing a better game that dosent take 12 24 hours of troubleshooting and optimizing on my end to still have a mid experience i know im not the only one who feels this way and its worse if you consider all the problems pvp and official players deal with if ark 2 ever releases i may give it a chance but i feel like that just isnt happening with how bad things seem to be going for wildcard snail dont waste your time and dont waste your money goodbye ark
