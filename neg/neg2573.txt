2021 i got it as part of a humblebundle and that or a heavy discount are the only ways i would recommend getting this game it s relatively fun in the sense of being a nature walk simulator but the amount of content that s locked behind dlc makes it feel like you d have bought a demo out of the 10 maps only 2 are playable in the base game and also there s no vehicles at all outside of dlc so walking everywhere takes forever if you absolutely need this game or if hunting is your thing then sure it s fun enough but if you just want a thing to mess around with an explore and stuff then i d suggest getting it for like 80 off or just looking elsewhere because you ll really only get 25 of the available content without getting tons of individual dlc
