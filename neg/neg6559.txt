2017 i have to say genuinely this is such a good game and ds3 is the most quality version in pc platform however i hope i am not the only one who wants to critisie its file checking system which results in so many true fans of ds3 got soft banned or even permenantly banned why because so many cheaters not only happy with editing their own files but also want to do so to others they are able to use such as ce to craft a weapon which is not belong to the game and this kind of weapon can achieve consequences like one shot kill or back to level 1 this very negative phenomenon causes many legal players banned by the system mentioned above when it identifies any invalid date in their own files what makes me even angry is the game operators do not give a about it especially for the customers in pc they even stated that this is only our faults to play with or recieve gifts from thoes inappropiate players however could you plz tell me how can i avoid being invaded by these players how can i know they are the ones someone might argue that you can just trun off the on line play option yes i can if the online content is optional i would rather ask a refund for castrating this content off to sum up if you really love this game and you like pvp and or any other online game plays pc version is the last option
