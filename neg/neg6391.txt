2021 tldr ai cheats as bad as the crew or nfs don t bother just buy an older horizon game forza horizon 5 excels in areas previous titles lacked and fails in areas the franchise had previously mastered car customization map scale and track design are all excellent the problem comes from the ai as someone who played most previous titles forza 1 horizon 3 on the top difficulty settings i expected the typical ai design but was instead met with the rubber banding of a typical ubisoft racing game release the mechanics directly punish you for doing better as the ai gets shorter lap times whenever you do this is further worsened by the fact that each race regardless of track size is flooded with ai racers that follow the exact on rails driving line the ai brakes turns and accelerates so similarly that every race feels like you are competing against a bullet train you will never beat an ai off the line since they have godmode acceleration for the first 5 seconds and they will take corners at double the speed a player could realistically take ai cars hit speeds normally unbachieveable at the class to win a race the strategy is to banzai bomb straight for the corner and then aggressively block the ai for the remainder of the race so long as you don t get too far ahead of them they wont gain rubber band acceleration and the ai all but shuts off
