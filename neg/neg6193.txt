unfortunately this game gets worse the longer you play it starting with act 4 bugs increase a corrupt savegame cost me 45 minutes of gameplay well happens just do it again but then the fight a sudden spike in difficulty makes the battle impossible unless i load again and respec my party to some imba online builds sorry game was great but this is just plain painfull i would like to give a neutral review but since i have to choose either i will give a negative one for now i really can not believe it it gets worse and worse on epitaph the game gets unplayable for me if i load in a certain area on epitaph all inactive necrons are activated and a battle starts but i can not target the necrons they are immortal
