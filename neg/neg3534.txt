2022 i can t believe i never reviewed this game with the advent of two point campus i decided to replay this game to see why i didn t like it my complains are mainly related to pacing the game is painfully slow to progress but fairly easy to play the size of objects and the layouts of the hospitals are very painful to design around and many decorative objects are locked behind a kudosh currency system what s the point of a game like this if you must unlock all the items decorative items level up rooms and makes your staff a lot happier but more importantly if you make a hospital design sim like this then you need to provide your players with adequate decorative items but all the stuff you need to do in the game are too slow to progress your staff takes a long time to train and it takes a long time to meet all the map objectives since many items must be unlocked either through spending kudosh or higher star ratings of hospitals you are forced to play for a lot longer of course you can sort of make a nice hospital in the game the items are relatively varied and there s a point to decorating your hospital the game remind me of the old game theme hospital but the jokes are worse and the game is a lot simpler this game is very pg and it shows there s nothing necessarily wrong with being pg but in this case it makes the game feel extremely bland the pixelated mess that is theme hospital doesn t have much personality but it s still a lot more charming than two point hospital is the music in two point hospital is also a lot worse than theme hospital i hate the constant elevator music in the game in addition the developers made the game as a platform to sell dlcs through they ve tried hard to make the game relevant through ingame events this is pretty blatant and might look like they re trying to sell the game piecemeal however the game does have a lot of base content and is time consuming to play if only because of grinding and a few items albeit thematically wrong otherwise has been released for free over the years i ve certainly never felt the need to buy any dlcs even though the developers invade my game with locked areas reminding me of that content i could have had but i really don t care i ve had my fill of this game even so i recommend against buying this game it shall be interesting to see if two point campus is any better
