2023 early access review i ve been playing since the very first week of december in 2022 which was the start of the power cosmic season i have played almost daily since then and have managed to finish every weekly challenge and every season pass since december i m a huge fan of the game and still am however i can no longer recommend this game it feels like for every 1 or 2 steps second dinner progresses forward in terms of the economy or card acquisition in the game they inevitably take 1 or 2 steps back not long after the game is becoming increasingly more gacha like from series drops being slowed down or ignored such as darkhawk which has been in a consistently stable and good spot in the meta darkhawk should have been dropped down to series 3 and therefore much easier of a card to collect for the general population however second dinner has shown they will change the series drop schedule in order to accommodate future bundles in the store such as the not quite a bird darkhawk bundle 3x vallue which was really 3 times the amount it should ve been for what was given they had great moves in making certain cards easier to acquire such as the weekly spotlight for new cards series 4 5 cards having a rotating slot and ultimate variants moved to their own spot in the token shop they then made it so those who haven t finished series 3 can acquire a free series 3 card each season great and then token amounts in collector s reserves were increased though in random amounts still a good change for some who lean more towards the f2p side of the game token acquisition amounts allowed you to get one series 5 card a month at the time all new cards were released as either series 5 or as part of the season pass now with the most recent update including spotlight caches which btw feels like it has a disgusting amount of fomo behind the thought process the ability to acquire tokens has been drastically reduced it will now take an average of 6 to 7 months to earn a series 5 card with tokens this has been lessened barely by having so far 2 out of the 4 cards released every month straight into series 4 which is half the cost of a series 5 card on top of that the ability to get gold premium currency from collector s caches has also been removed to be fair i felt like second dinner was fairly generous with the ability for a player to earn gold which helped mitigate the high and sometimes overpriced cost of the majority of all bundles which i feel like on average range from 30 usd on the low end up to 100 usd on the high end now the best way to earn gold is from reaching higher in the ranked ladder which i doubt even a large percentage of the player base ever reaches rank 90 and buying the season pass many of these bundles include credits which is the free currency that players use to upgrade their cards which in turn allows us to open more caches alongside the removal of gold from caches the amount of credits you can get from these caches has also been reduced which then slows down progression of the game which hinges on upgrading your cards now for the most recent problem the newly introduced spotlight caches you get one every 120 collection levels and a player who completes the weekly challenges should earn enough to be able to open one spotlight cache a week spotlight caches offer 4 possibilities when you open it which is the most recently released card two specific series 4 or 5 cards and then one random series 4 5 card if a new card is released and you haven t hoarded spotlight caches you now have a 25 chance to get the new card in under 7 days because every week the cards rotate out into another set of specific 3 cards not including the random series 4 5 option not only does this new system basically promote hoarding it almost necessitates it as you need 4 spotlight caches saved up for a specific week which is 480 collection levels which is almost a month of play to guarantee getting one new card when a new card is released every week you would think hey with the random 4 5 card you can get that should help right no there is no duplicate protection on the random series 4 5 card in the spotlight cache if you open one and you happen to get the random there is a significant chance you can get a card you already have such as kitty pryde which most of the playerbase has gotten for free now this wouldn t be so bad if you were compensated in some way right well the only thing you can do is convert the already owned card into a random variant when i say random it is completely random if you open galactus which is a permanent series 5 card and you already own it it could be converted into something such as a pixel hawkeye which is a starter card this this is horrible i won t get into balance changes which is generally on the good side of things and second dinner has made a fun game from characters and comics that i love yet over the past 6 months my ability to enjoy and have fun in this game has felt like an emotional roller coaster with more negative experiences than there are positive ones progression in a sense feels more restrictive now than it has in previous months
