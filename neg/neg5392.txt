2023 on release it was a buggy mess with potential one year later an update comes out that makes the game look like it should have on release however with an overinflated store cost for new battlegroups and a pitiful and greedy merit system forcing people to pay with cash to get what they want because otherwise it would take almost 2 months of free grinding hard focusing on the challenges the only way i can make my review positive after i wasted my good faith on buying this game is they have to at least add merit rewards to finishing games like in coh2 start releasing battlegroups and content like you promised and fix those prices in their store because let s be honest as gamers we love skins on our stuff so if the prices were lower they would have probably sold a lot more
