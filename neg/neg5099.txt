2018 i prefer the other total war games but as a fan of warhammer this hit the spot kind of unfortunately creative assembly has shown its true colors by including redshell spyware in the install and completely disregarding the person who uses buys their software we have no idea what data redshell really pulls from our machines because it s closed source so trust has completely gone out the window it s been great ca but it s time to let go of total war a series that frankly has gotten less challenging and engaging i assume because they want their game to be more mainstream ie more money
