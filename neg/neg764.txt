2022 while its an excellent fps with nice graphics this game falls desperately short in terms of rpg elements and being a fallout game compared to its predecessors the largest problem i have with this game is choice in particular the lack thereof i will demonstrate the problem by comparing fallout 4 s premise and first quest with fallout new vegas premise and first quest in fallout 4 your life prior to the game s start is cut and dry you re voice history and family already pre ordained only with arbitrary changes to appearances in fallout new vegas you are an amnesiac courier saved by a miracle with a mission to track down the men who killed you you are a nobody who could have been anybody and that perfectly compliments a game that then presents you with several moral choices the first quest in fallout 4 forces you to side with the minutemen against the raiders you are even given a faux choice in dialogue that says i wont help you upon your initial meeting with preston garvey whence you are given the same task anyway and a snarky retort from preston as if the devs are saying we know better than you and your path is preordained just get the power armor bucko you cannot kill or become villified by several factions in fallout 4 from the getco compare this to new vegas upon arriving at goodsprings you discover a dispute between gangsters and the town you may side with either and you may then use your unique background and skills that you have created for yourself to augment your experience fallout 4 gives you an illusion of choice while looking pretty fallout new vegas gives you real choices whilst looking janky that is why i dont reccomend this game to true fans of fallout new vegas is and always shall be the gold standard until someone takes a swing at the franchise again
