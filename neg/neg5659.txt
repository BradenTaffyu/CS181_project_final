2013 the game had great potential but was clearly rushed and released too early the engine is unoptmized the game is laggy and slow even on a powerful pc i played the first month and then quit because of the game s instability i had played coop campaign with a friend but each turn takes 10 minutes to cycle through the ai factions which burned out the entire game very quickly maybe in a year of patches fixes this game will be great like the original rome
