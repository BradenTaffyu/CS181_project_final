these greedy really just added an enormous shop button to the top right of the screen viable at all times on top of that major game features from expensive dlc are left broken and abandoned like prom from the high school dlc if you really want a life sim game wait for paralives or inzoi or life by you if you cant wait i recommend playing sims 2 readily available with all the packs and way more game features for pretty much free
