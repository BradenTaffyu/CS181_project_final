2022 so the first few islands are great and the survival mechanics while a bit of a grind aren t bad and can actually be fun the first few updates of the game were also very enjoyable my wife and i have played through the early stages of the game multiple times and really enjoyed all the improvements and new content a few weeks ago i would have emphatically recommended this game to everyone however the latest release is a total departure from the core game play which is essentially surviving on the raft hence the name raft the plot is nonsensical but in the early releases really didn t matter much as it really didn t affect game play the new section of the game forces you to pay attention and it s not worth it worse the last three islands are jam packed with meaningless time wasters and ill contrived puzzles to put it plainly the final release breaks the original feel of the game so badly that it taints the rest of the experience it started out as robinson crusoe at see and ends up well for the sake of not spoiling anything i won t finish that statement i ll just add that at one point it becomes a platformer and i will spoil this the control and collision system is not accurate enough for any kind of fun platforming experience it feels as if the devs got bored making a survival game and crammed in a bunch of content that simply doesn t fit seriously there are highly mechanical boss fights now extremely annoying platforming slap dash puzzles and poorly implemented control systems i may be wrong and this might have been the plan all along if so it wasn t a good plan
