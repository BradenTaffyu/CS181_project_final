2016 i cannot in good conscience reccomend this game in it s current state the game has a lot of cool systems that are fun to explore the systems are very poorly balanced your cities produce far too little production to pay for the incredibly expensive districts and the improvements to production come in the form of 1 here and 1 there not nearly enough there are a number of bugs i ve run into that ruined my plans missionaries of neutral parties block all military units when they walk through a warzone seriously how are religious units not on their own stacking limit separate from military units an english missionary wanders into the only road over a river which stops my entire advance for two turns then another one comes and does it again 4 turns later the interface and tooltips are missing a lot of information some information just appears to be blatently wrong while others are either nonexistant or incomplete no queue for buildings really ai is at least as bad as civ v ai and might even be worse i watched an ai settler wander in circles for dozens of turns despite being 4 6 tiles away from 2 different prime city locations on emperor difficulty if they provide robust modding capabilities it might be salvagable but i don t think i trust firaxis to fix these problems they ll make a half hearted effort and call it done like always and rely on the modding community to make it playable by anyone other than the most casual players
