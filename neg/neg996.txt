2016 what happened to you fallout during the e3 2015 reveal my hype was at a high i did have my doubts about a voice acted main character thinking that it would water down the choices you can make in game and the way you can finish quests my doubts quickly turned to bitter sweet mutfruit as i came closer to finishing the main quest and realizing how stripped of choice this game actually was i enjoyed the gunplay and the aestetics very much so but the game lacked the depth that gave the previous titles their charm its become an action game instead of an rpg 6 10
