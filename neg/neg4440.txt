2017 the game is fun but underwhelming the scope and magnitude feels greatly diminished from civ 5 the cartoony aesthetic may appeal to or repulse depending on your tastes i was strongly in the second camp but found it easy to get used to sean bean s performance as the narrator has received a lot of praise but doesn t carry the gravity of previous incarnations sadly when put together these elements make the game feel like you re playing sid meier s civilization jr for now the dlc situation is frustrating bordering on insulting individual civilizations should not cost 5 00 usd or any localized equivalent i felt a sense of sick irony when rewatching the opening cinematic a moving video illustrating the pinnacles of human achievement which once literally brought me to tears and convinced me to buy the game now when i watch it i can t help but reflect on firaxis 2k s greed and how they are trying to nickel and dime their player base the lofty ambitions of that intro video feel a bit insincere now if and when some major dlc is released and bundled in an affordable package i may change this review until then civilization 5 is a much much better and more complete experience
