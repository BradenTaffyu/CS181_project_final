2021 early access review years ago i would have recommended this game now no way far too little has been done to improve the still unreleased game and now even multiplayer is gone and has been for a long time no amount of animations which is being generous as the game is still very primitive graphically are worth giving up multiplayer for honestly when you have a single modder out there who can accomplish far more than your entire staff like modding vehicles in long before they did npcs and more it s time to look elsewhere for any semblance of hope at getting a competent response to a woefully lacking game and we hear it s so hard don t complain or how many games have you coded none same as these guys
