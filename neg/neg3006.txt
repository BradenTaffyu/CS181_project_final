2019 i ve been playing this game back and forth now for about 350 hours in total i feel that 2 2 has made the game worse in many regards here is my pros and cons ai is worse than ever even on grand admiral it s laughable i never get attacked and have equvialent fleet with 100 400 in fleet power the idea to remove surface micro mangement with a new approach was welcome however now it becomes even more micro management i feel that all i do is adjusting each planet back and forth to not run into negative with each and every resource not fun immense scrolling lag even on 600 star galaxy making the game insufferable to even zoom in out and scroll around it hits you later in the game not at the start pros i haven t really found any yet
