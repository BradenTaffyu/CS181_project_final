2017 this game has some of the worst ai i have ever seen the game introduced a newish idea that each civilization in addition to victory goals would be driven by their own personal reasons for example the vikings like anyone with a strong navy egypt anyone with a strong army brazil hates anyone who gets lots of great people and china hates anyone who builds a lot of wonders this had potential to make games more complex as it would allow you to form alliances that catered to your goal and the goals of the ai in practice the system is horribly done let s go through a few turns of meeting the vikings turn 1 oh hi we found the vikingsturn 2 oh they won t accept our gifts that s weirdturn 4 vikings your navy is s we denounce you turn 7 vikings your navy is still s we declare war you then spend about 20 turns at war taking some citiesturn 28 all other ai warmonger warmonger we declare war how does that make any sense gorgo one of the leaders of sparta will actually attack you for being weak because they hate the weak and the warmonger system makes 0 sense as well if someone declares war on you and you take one of their cities in return you are a warmonger did they capture some of your cities in a previous war and you took them back warmonger another ai asked you to go to war with them to take out a second ai well now they both think you are a warmonger it is absurd
