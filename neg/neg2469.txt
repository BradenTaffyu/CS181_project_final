2022 this game suffers from the balance team apparently being composed of ocg team members on top being best of 1 no side decks for some reason even though the vast majority of people playing this game will be tcg players who don t want maxx c to exist the game has maxx c legal at 3 copies the game launched with a bizarre forbidden limited list that had numerous floodgates that make the game frustrating and maddening to play and the game was months behind the tcg on card releases this meant we are perpetually playing a bizarro alternate history version of an old format from months ago where stuff that was never legal at the same time as these decks is available like swordsoul tenyi being able to play full power halqifibrax auroradon deskbot 001 cupid pitch combos or adventure phantom knight raid raptor with rhongo turbo the banlist updates always feel like half assed bandaids based on banlist updates we already knew were the correct hits from the tcg months prior but for some reason they keep refusing to ban maxx c the card that single handedly warps the entire game around it the people who decide the banlist are infested with such brain worms they actually limited crossout designator one of the primary cards used to counter maxx c rather than just ban maxx c not understanding that the only reason crossout sees such high representation is because of maxx c crossout is a card that sees next to no top cut representation in the real life card game because it requires you to clog your deck up with targets to banish for its effect and only succeeds in the ocg due to literally everyone having to run the same 9 hand traps the game being only best of 1 with no side deck system of any sort also makes stupid blowout decks that have absurd game 1 performance due to lacking foreknowledge of what they re playing drastically over perform and create a horrible coin flip experience decks like this are sacky game 1 thieves that rely on blindsiding people who can t realistically prepare for them but they would totally collapse under any sort of counters being swapped in from the side deck and thus don t see any play in the real card game floodgates being so prevalent also makes this vastly worse because if you play hand traps you fold to backrow decks and if you add backrow counters you get by combo decks if you try to run both your deck just bricks all the time master duel is a frustrating mess where 50 of the time you literally do not get to play the game
