2019 only reason not to recommend this game by now is the amount of dlc expansions you need to play it properly only company in the world who would be needing to release season passes is paradox interactive development studio and how about lowering your prices after years of having your expansions on the market the game came out in 2013 and is still 40 euro along with 20 euro per essential expansion this is a horrible business practice overshadowed by bigger idiots like ea activision and ubisoft along with tencent the ea of china paradox need to get more for their business practices their games are one of few on the market with this type of gameplay and style but that is not a reason to milk it until the cow turns into dust keeping up with a paradox game is an artform better be there when the game is released or else you have to toss out 200 euro worth of main game and expansions and such after a few years edit now with new mechanics power creep third rate nations and broken mechanics same dlc focus grand game
