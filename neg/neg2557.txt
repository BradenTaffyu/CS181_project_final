2022 tl dr recommended for casual players but those who are after realism will be disappointed to be fair i m not happy to give a negative review but i want devs to address the issues that s been going on for years specifically a b explained down below positive graphics are still decent some of the scenes look impressive performance is good i don t see major issues with the optimization playing ultra gtx 1080 ti 1440p locked 60fps animals look decent enough options to disable sound visual and other cues if preferred online co op works without issues as far as i can tell at least negative a b are major issues imo a damage system is unreliable first of all bullets and firepower feel very weak in this game for example 223 can t even take down red fox or roe deer effectively also i can t count how many times i land a perfect heart shot with right tier and caliber but sometimes animals shrug it off as if it s no biggie in addition to that sometimes you can kill animals shooting through the ears b animal animations lack natural behavior and animations need a lot of work for example animals lack feedback from shots when animals are shot they play this one animation where they go down on their legs and get up then start to run it s always that one animation also many animations play over and over again sometimes animals would stand still doing what i don t know daydream maybe or they d walk in circles in an area or walk on a rock and not touch the ground and they ll be floating while doing so bird animations are half baked when you shoot birds they don t fall down in a realistic way the momentum stops and they fall as if someone is throwing a trashbag from the sky there are still many bugs animation bugs sound bugs you name it some of the paid dlcs such as the atv saber 4x4 trophy lodge treestand tripod etc should have been included in the base game weapon sounds are weak it was a lot better in older versions imo but they changed for some reason and now weapons sound even worse no real world weapons weapons in the game are modeled after their real life counterpart but some of them look significantly different final conclusions buy if you don t care about realism and some issues look elsewhere if you want a realistic hunting game
