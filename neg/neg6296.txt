2023 early access review an unbalanced mess with one of the worst cash shops you will ever find on a card game new players are unable to get new season cards unless paying real money or after a lot and i mean tons of grinding which makes the game essentially a p2w fest and an absolute slog for f2p players the snap mechanic which is the main selling point of the game is just a gimmick there is no casual mode where to test new decks so you will be stuck in ladder losing cubes if you dare to try new things the developers seem to want for players to adhere exclusively to the 5 or 6 meta decks in existence which brings me to there s no diversity in the meta since everyone plays the same decks there is no heroes or different archetypes the meta consists of 4 or 5 decks that everyone uses in order to climb the ladder either you play those decks if you pay to have the cards for the most successful decks or you are stuck in ladder trying your pathetic crippled deck do not give money to these vultures
