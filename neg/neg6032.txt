2021 i ve been a long time supporter of this series so i know it s not just this game isn t for me even before eu3 came out i was sinking hours into for the glory i have around 2 000 hours between the three unfortunately paradox who create this game have a huge advantage in that they pretty much have a monopoly on grand strategy games so if you really love this type of game and this time period you may want to get it regardless of it s myriad flaws however please consider the following 1 this game is constantly riddled with bugs and errors the developers really don t care enough about the quality of the product to put the due time into it expect to get corrupted games on a semi regular basis and crash every hour if you can even get the game to start in the first place that is i can t get past the launcher as of the last patch and re patch 2 the base game is horrendously barren and unbalanced while the dlcs are almost mandatory to even enjoy the game and not to mention terribly overpriced 3 it s not really a game no i m serious it s a glorified excel spread sheet almost everything in the game is just an outright calculation or an rng nightmare for instance if you have x number of points you probably want to spend them on either teching up along a very simplistic and linear tree or you might want to develop a province and make a bit more money cool right no it s an illusion of choice there is always a right way to play and it almost always plays out the same way due to set number of points you are given and the demands static map how do you get these points you might ask surely i can affect that nope you just get a random leader who will determine exactly how many points you get and you have no control over that leader unless you by a 25 dlc which basically gives you a single use re roll leader button my point is you really don t get much choice in this game beyond which ideas you select for your nation otherwise you just start to game make more troops than your neighbours auto win their countries once you do and use that money to keep ahead of them in techs so you can do it again maybe the newest dlc will deliver on it s promise to let us play tall but it ll probably cost you 25 in the end what i m trying to say is that this game really isn t worth it eu4 needs to die so that a revamped and re imagined eu5 can resolve the plentiful issues at the root of the current game s gameplay crusader kings 3 was able to vastly improve crusader kings 2 and deliver a far more enjoyable experience so i really hope that paradox is able to move past eu4 soon and replicate ck3 s success
