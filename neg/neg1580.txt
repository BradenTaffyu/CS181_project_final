2020 early access review game has crashed on me 6 times since the time of this review would wait for further patches before purchasing edit i will say i was able to get it into a semi decent state by deleting the programdata folder as suggested by a developer it s crashed a total of 14 ish time and 2 within 5 hours after deleting the programdata folder would still not recommend at this point but the gameplay is blatantly fun
