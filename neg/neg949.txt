2020 tldr combat can be fun and addictive but the game is a buggy mess with terrible writing i ve put a lot of hours into this game and had a lot of fun but i cannot in good conscience give this game a good review my first major complaint is that the game has so many bugs it becomes nearly unplayable without mods some bugs are just minor inconveniences or funny mishaps but the number of times i have been unable to progress quests or had my game freeze is inexcusable frankly it feels like playing an unfinished product secondly the writing is in my opinion dreadful i came to fallout 4 after playing fallout new vegas which is a fantastic role playing experience fallout 4 failed every expectation f nv set for me the factions you can join are all terribly written the dialogue feels strange in part because there are always four responses to choose from regardless of the situation and bethesda broke away from much of the lore that had been established in previous games additionally the character building felt greatly simplified and geared almost exclusively for combat which makes the playable character have an extremely bland personality there is also a considerable incentive to just act according to how your current companion wants you to act rather than actively role play my final major complaint is that they implemented a settlement building system normally i would find that sort of thing very cool but it was implemented terribly the settlements are very buggy like everything else and they cost a lot of resources to build but provide almost no benefit to the player whatsoever you can ignore them completely for basically the entire game and be better off for doing so so why do i have 833 hours in this game mostly because of the hardest difficulty survival mode i enjoy survival games and survival mode makes the game a lot more interesting by adding some mechanics like hunger thirst and disease add a few mods to compensate for bugs ignore the plot and settlements completely and fallout 4 can actually be pretty entertaining if you are only interested in wandering around and shooting things it might even be worth buying but if you are willing to put up with older graphics and slightly clunkier combat i would advise anyone reading this to go for fallout new vegas instead for the peak fallout experience
