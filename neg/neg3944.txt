there are certainly people who will find this game impossible to put down and after 8 5 hours i m not one of them my first run through the game felt great the mechanics felt tight and clean the enemies were tough but exciting finding unlockables throughout the run is addicting then i hit a wall after dozens of runs losing countless souls and spending countless more i ve unlocked everything that i can reach without further game progress something that i can t be bothered to care to do at this point after all of these runs there are still aspects of the game that i cannot interact with because i haven t played enough to find the place to get the required permanent upgrades which brings me to the nail in the coffin for this game for me and a criticism often repeated in these negative reviews playing the first few opening stages over and over again having to take the time to get loot and upgrades for later stages results in an easy formula for dying in roughly the same place every 20 30 minutes in areas that look cool but are prohibitively difficult would it be easier if i could unlock the ability to hold onto the wall probably but in nearly 9 hours i haven t found out and now i m simply too burnt out on this game to care for the try hards out there who love a challenge and enjoy punishing platformers this game is for you for people those of us which life provides adequate frustration find a more relaxing game to play and remember that playing a game can be a lot of things but should be still be fun for you
