2019 update the red shell process no longer appears and is suspected to have been removed however paradox hoi4 have not publicly pledged to remove it from the game to my knowledge as a result this process can be hidden renamed wrapped in different processes and happen without our knowledge but with our consent in their terms we agree to as a result i will be keeping this review up here so it is known about do with it as you will so sad that this used to be one of my favorite games love the alternate history and the world war ii simulation if you will like any paradox game you are signing up for unnecessarily overpriced dlcs adding base content into the game but it luckily doesn t impact the game too much like others mostly thanks to an active modding community however this review would be a waste if i did not touch upon the red shell spyware new eula agreement that is running rampant throughout paradox games if you aren t aware of its incorporation of red shell into its new eula i encourage you to check out this reddit post as they are collecting data from your computer that is solely for selling to third parties and a complete violation of privacy this is a hot topic so i will leave you to the reddit posts and your own research but i for one am strongly disturbed by their incorporation of this into their game and will be refusing to purchase any paradox game until it is fully removed as some other game companies did reddit source 1reddit source 2note these reddit posts are for different games but it s the same program
