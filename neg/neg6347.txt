2023 prime example for everything that s wrong with modern triple a games ubisoft formula at it s finest a beautiful open world meets tedious unfun collectibles and side content of which there is way way too much side quests are utterly forgettable as is the main story combat starts robbing your of your soul after the 200th encounter the map and overall atmosphere was great and i don t hate the game won t recommend full price for it though it also has bad performance issues and glitches the voice acting feels very off too female main character sounds bored and disinterested as massive potential that hasn t been used i m very disappointed in the game
