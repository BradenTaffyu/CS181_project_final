2017 review update at launch the game seemed promising but the ai was either retarded or overly competent a great deal of players found the art style an eyesore and the content was lacking now two expansions later and still more on the way i can say that this game has somewhat improved it remedied many of its shortcomings except the art style for my part i still prefer the nearly perfect straightforwardness of civ v civ vi is at the same time more complex and more strenuous i see the quirky appeal of this newest iteration but for me personally the less of civ v is ultimately more enjoyment i just cannot give a thumbs up to a sequel that is not a definite improvement old review i have no doubt that this game will improve once all the expansions and patches are out do not buy it as of yet ai is not good at all and firaxis needs to get this message stick to your civ v for a year or two and then buy civ vi on a discount
