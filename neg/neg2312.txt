2017 at the time of this review i got about 33hrs on the clock i ve played other truck sims in the past starting with hard truck and hard truck 2 way in the day soldiered on with whole 18 wheels of steel set and both ets games this being the latest in the whole set is most disappointing to me to be honest the thing is since the 18wos alh i feel like the series is moving backward it s true we get larger and more detailed maps licensed trucks better graphics and sound but core gameplay is moving backward with every new game let me point out the things that bother me game is at this time only 4 states in south western us in comparison to 18 wos the whole of us northern mexico and southern canada more detailed but ultimately way smaller there are 2 truck makes kenworth and peterbuilt with 2 models each that s four models of trucks you can drive or even see on the road 18wos had without a license but 32 models across 8 manufacturers even ets2 beats ats with 13 models across 7 makes running your own company is dull and pointless the logo you pick doesn t matter at all you see it in the menu and that s it in 18wos it was on the trucks you owned you can buy garages and hire drivers but you can t order them around like in 18wos games they just go on random jobs getting some small revenue you can t even see them on the map not to say the game world it s a just a note in the menu that you have an employee and that he does something even the sort of the truck doesn t have any impact on their performance so you can buy the most basic truck with cheapes engine and gearbox with no accessories that truck will never be seen so skip the paint job and shiny rims too none of those things matter unlike 18wos games where the trucks you owned existed in the game world you could order a driver to a specific company and specific delivery and then you could follow him around in your own truck if even the garages had your company s logo on them when you buy them but even that is too much to ask apparently map is large and quite detailed ie not factually accurate but the cities are less 3x3 square grid and more there are ufos near roswell but the whole map is uniform in 18wos you could go to canada where it ll snow instead of rain trailers would grip differently on snow and on wet for that matter than on dry tarmac so your truck could jack knife if you hit the breaks on that bend or went into that bend going too fast none of those thing are present in ats tickets the way they work is just stupid i get traffic collisions and running a red light in a city fine but 700 fine for running 36mph on 30mph just past speed limit sign when breaking from a too often spawning cop car going the other way done running a red light on road works in the middle of the desert in the middle of the night with no one in sight done i remember outrunning a cop car in 18wos pttm when driving empty if they can t catch you they can t fine you not in ats you get the ticket always for everything as an arbitrary decision deal with it why i can t sleep in my sleeper cab and need to find a rest stop is way beyond me cb radio damn i miss this asking for road conditions weather bears or just random chatter radio is fine but why can t we have both i get that in ets many countries with different languages and all but in ats that problem is gone ai it was always dumb and nothing has changed here i got used to the way it works and i m fine with it it does react to blinkers and hazards will stop and let you on the intersection will give you way when merging will bump into each other from time to time and when that happens you re better off just driving around them since they don t get the idea of backing up and will continue to try to move forward even if that means bumping into each other again so in 10 years time since 18 wos american long haul we got a game that is prettier has a tool for making pictures and regressed in gameplay to the turn of the century i still kinda enjoy it but i just can t recommend it it s a glitter covered shell of what the 18wos games used to be update since many people in the comments are pointing out that there are mods i think i need to address this here mostly because i m bored of repeating this in the comments i know there are mods i know mods can do many things with the base game more trucks more accessories bigger map and whatever thing is when i bought the game there were no mods installed to be honest i visited steam workshop after about an hour or two into the game because it felt incredibly empty 4 trucks few ai traffic cars few options to customize a truck i then wasted another hour or two picking through workshop for few decent mods that weren t paint jobs only then the game got some more content content that the developers didn t put in there now i know that there are many other sites with various mods for ats but the first wall i got was for version x xx so every time a game gets an update and the mod doesn t i m expecting trouble and if there are trouble i m expected to dig through the mods to find the one s busted and update or disable it definitely not the experience i paid for the second wall was that many trucks don t look on par with scs made trucks i know there are people who don t care about it who are able to spend 5 hours fixing stuff so they can play for another 5 hours well i m not one of those and i know i m not alone another thing to point out it the game was released in feb of 2016 so as i m writing this it s out for almost 2 years at no point in that run it was marketed as an early access sort of thing so every argument of it s being made is invalid it s done and finished just still supported there s a difference lastly like i pointed out in my original post i know all previous 18wos games had made up truck makers but had a lot more of them as a result and i d rather have 30 detailed and polished trucks made by devs and a mod to swap the logos for original ones as i had in alh and pttm than 4 trucks with license
