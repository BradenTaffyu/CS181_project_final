2018 yeah it was a great game until they changed it and now all the fun of running an empire is gone the storytelling from the players perspective is gone how can i view all my pops different looks when i go to see one of my worlds i specifically turned into a energy planet culture planet or science planet where is the images of different landscapes beautiful and hellish that soon have a building placed over them once colonization and civilization spreads fear losing a planet might upset your entire empires infrastructure nah m8 just adjust the sliders why would you want to actually do anything in your game that might require slowing down readjusting and rethinking how you do things in your ever expanding galactic civilization when you can just use your sliders and buttons to ensure you never have to leave the highest speed setting they still have tiny versions of the buildings but they ve been clumped down into a tiny area and can only build so many until you reach the next designated population limit it s just becoming numbers and sliders which i don t have a problem with especially when it involves megacorperations but they ve taken away in my opinion a crucial aspect of the game do i get to actually see one of my pops get destroyed after being bombed from orbit for so long that the planetary defences go down no i just have less numbers than before resulting in the inability to make a building i can t seem to find planetary edicts anymore i probably just missed it but it is one small problem of the many i have with the changes to the planets and tiles i normally would never leave a review let alone leave a negative one but there s a certain thing encouraging me to do this and it has to do with the different versions of the game i can revert to 2 1 3it s the farthest back i m allowed to go and thankfully it still has planet tiles but what s worrying is it might not always be there because of a strange and stupid law i own ck2 eu4 vic2 hoi4 and stellaris i ve never needed a paradox account nor have i ever needed to go to a secondary website or program to use one of these games i ve payed for i m leaving a negative review because the game i paid for is changing in a direction i don t like and eventually i won t even be able to play it the way i was able to when i intially bought the game specifically the aspect of changing versions with a simple right click on the site i bought the game from if i have to create varify and maintain a secondary account just to gain access to what was once a common feature in a game i have almost 275 hours in so i can play you ve failed i should be able to just start the game up or right click into the properties and change the version to what i want i own 88 games on this one account if i had to create a secondary account that was linked to the developers site of even half of them i would just stop playing games entirely of all the games i own and of all of them that i can change versions on steam paradox is special in that i have to go another site besides steam to make any of these changes possible maybe it seems normal to everyone else but the concept is foreign and concerning to me i can only wish that these changes were all a part of the megacorporation dlc at least then i could have seen the gnarled changes made and not bought the dlc now i m not going to buy the dlc because it probably won t work in an older version of the game that isn t altered the way it is now this review and opinion are subject to change
