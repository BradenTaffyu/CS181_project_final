2022 i can t in good faith recommend this game the foundation is solid the historical accuracy the plane tank models the damage model are all there great and very realistic but all of it is ruined by the economy and questionable developer balance gameplay choices the progress in unlocking and researching new vehicles is very quick and satisfying in rank 1 but by the middle end of rank 2 of any nation progress will become increasingly slower and the cost to buy the already researched vehicles grows more and more so much so that you can barely afford anything at some point almost everything costs silver lions one of the many currencies in game even the ammunition for each vehicle and if you don t have a premium account and at a certain point even if you have one the mission rewards won t be enough to let you play at higher ranks continuously it s bad and it ruins the whole experience the worst thing is that when your vehicle gets damaged in a mission you ll have to pay silver lions to repair it or wait several hours or days for it to repair for free while in the first few ranks the cost is acceptable as you get rewarded way more than that for each mission as you unlock more expensive vehicles the repair cost will be too much to be sustainable which means you ll probably have to wait up to days to play with that same vehicle again this creates a vicious psychological cycle you don t want to be destroyed in a mission or get your vehicle damaged as when that happens you ll most likely become very frustrated the more you advance through the vehicle ranks the more skill and knowledge is also required which is kind of fine if the game was sustained by a fair economic system and didn t have questionable balance and gameplay designs i have mostly played with air forces throughout my many hours in game while the arcade game mode feels pretty balanced the realistic mode is not i ll make an example about gameplay and balance design choices that i dislike in the last few days i was going through rank 2 of the american air force there s this airplane the p 51 when you spawn as a fighter in a realistic battle you will have to take off from an airfield both factions do the p 51 has one of the worst climb rate in the game in its rank as a fighter and it s a boom and zoom plane which means the plane is required to be at a high altitude and have enough energy speed to be effective since both factions airfields are very close to each other with that plane you won t be able to climb high enough to have the effectiveness that the plane requires even if you side climb the plane will lose effectiveness once you reach 4000 metres of altitude and beyond due to its engine limitation and by that time the game is probably already decided meaning you ve spent 10 15 minutes climbing without engaging in any fight whatsoever i have tried to play the plane differently using it as a low altitude boom and zoomer or as a turn fighter if you play as the former any other plane which has the altitude advantage over you will gun you down and there will be if you play as the latter every fighter will outperform you and kill you as the plane turn rate is very bad compared to other fighters once an enemy fighter has you in its sight it s game over this happened over and over again as frustration mounted i felt helpless the plane was basically unplayable its only usefulness then was to use it as a bomber killer as at least its guns are formidable but since most bombers at rank 2 3 will stay at a altitude higher than 4000 metres getting to them will be hard and still take quite some timethis is just one of a few examples i could make bombers effectiveness is also questionable at best as most fighters will gun you down at some point during a match that is more a question of when not if the game also has several single player modes that you could play some are free dynamic campaigns is one them some are not the pacific campaigns which from what i ve read they were last updated so long ago that some missions have become unplayable over time as patches have changed the game and the specifics of each plane i like dynamic campaigns though but again gaijin doesn t care about them some missions are almost impossible to win they also have a daily limit which means the rewards get scaled so much after you ve completed a couple that you won t be able to get any research points nor silver lions by completing them developers want you to play online not some unfinished single player mode they don t care about do yourself a favour and don t play this game you may get sucked into it because as i said the foundations are all good and there but over time you will realize you re mostly getting frustration out of it and you re wasting your time as the economics is completely rigged and want you to spend money on every turn i almost forgot to mention after the war in ukraine the developers decided to remove the chat making coordination with teammates that much harder it s been disabled for more than a month now and who knows when it will be back go figure
