i really love this game the main problem i have is that the 1 0 release felt like a joke sure the battles are very fun but literally everything else feels way way to basic there is essentially no real political system or intrigue at all a bare bone management system for settlements the early mid game is undoubtedly the best part of the game and feels the most fleshed out once one begins to actually try to play with the political mechanics you realize very quickly that part of the game is bland as f without mods this game feels like its 60 70 done and we haven t had a major update in almost a year seriously very disappointing i do not recommend unless you really love nothing but troop management if you love that this game is loads of fun my main issue is that the game gets very boring and repetitive after just a few saves and doesn t feel like a game i ever have the drive to play i know most every game plays the same after the mid point of the game save your money
