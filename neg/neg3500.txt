2022 i cannot in good faith recommend this game i won t say it s a bad game though i also wouldn t say it s particularly spectacular but this game fails in some key ways that make me suggest you either go buy a similar game planet zoo prehistoric kingdom megaquarium etc or just buy the first game firstly the pros the game is aesthetically pleasing and by far one of frontier s most newby friendly games the game also gives you quite a lot of aesthetic options that allow you to decide how your park looks without actively impacting you financially and the challenge mode exclusive maps are quite entertaining the game also doesn t really ruin any of the mechanics ported over from the first game however this is where the problem lies all those similarities are similarities because this game is mostly a copy and paste of the original game just with the dlc content all compiled into the basegame the biggest improvements over the first game are the aquatics and the pterosaurs however the basegame barely makes use of these with only a handful of each and the dlc s only introduce three more aquatics attenboroughsaurus kronosaurus and styxosaurus and four pterosaurs geosternbergia dsungaripterus quetzalcoatlus and barbaridactylus two of the gamemodes also make almost no use of the aquatics and only occasional use of the fliers with challenge mode being the first time you get to use either to any meaningful extent while these creatures are probably my favorite part of the game at the same time they feel like a cripplingly underused addition that hurts the gameplay overall and i can t recommend you get the game even if this is what you felt was missing from the original because of how little you actually get out of it honestly the vast vast majority of the other changes from the original are either neutral changes extremely minor or actively negative ones the scientist system is tedious and awful it is there to basically artificially inflate playtime by forcing many many timers on top of timers in the game the medical system is just a complete slog research is somewhat better but also held back by the scientist system the sabotage system from the original game while absolutely a bad mechanic is taken to the exact opposite extreme where you have to basically intentionally cause sabotages half the time because they rarely happen unless you re not resting your scientists which it makes extremely clear when they need rested that s the meat of the issue the game focuses everything on this new scientist mechanic it s really the heart of the game but it also sucks the game also fails as a management game which should come as no surprise to players of the original but unlike the original where this is because the game really lacks much management at all this one has management mechanics that are all just very poorly implemented and done in such a way they become tedious and un fun on top of scientists there is now path crowding building modules and fuel levels for vehicles path crowding is not really explained anywhere building modules are not really explained anywhere and are extremely tedious and have no visual level to them making it feel less like a reward and more of avoiding a punishment as does he fuel level in vehicles to a lesser extent none of them encourage you to play any differently they just add a new mechanic you have to remember exists or you re punished all while at the same time you re constantly waiting for timers to tick down so you can actually add something more to your park the game has a fast forward button an improvement over the previous game however many of the tasks take far longer so i use the term improvement here broadly while it s true you can fastforward the game speed overall has been slowed down so it s not really any faster than the previous game so yeah tl dr the game fails to improve over the previous game in meaningful ways while also adding frustrating new mechanics i struggle to recommend the first game for its sheer simplicity but if you liked the first game this one does not make the game more intricate it makes it more tedious if you get this game for free or something you ll probably enjoy it but i can t recommend the dlc s because in typical frontier style they are overpriced and add very little content the game feels unfinished even now over a year after release
