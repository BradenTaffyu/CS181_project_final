2023 honest review after 500 hours of gameplay from a long time coh fan this game was released far too early i feel like i ve paid full price premium edition price for an alpha beta of coh3 the lack of content and the barely working ai are honestly shocking currently a full 6 months after release there is virtually no additional single player content even the skins aren t usable in single player the game has had some small fixes in recent months but it is still littered with bugs just for an example of a bug which has still yet to be fixed as of november the 9th 2023 the us m2a1 howitzer still doesn t work overall when the game broadly works well enough to play it s pretty fun but coh3 seriously lacks content when compared to it s predecessors and the graphics are barely improved from their previous games no noticeable improvements to the ai over the previous game it s still terrible the relic developers seem to be more focused on producing skins for you to buy at exorbitant prices rather than improving the quality and the core content of the game who on earth really wants to play a game like this on a playstation xbox anyway what a complete waste of development time and money would have been better spent making sure the game was working on pc before even considering that the single player campaign mode both italy and north africa have horrible acting voice overs the acting and their scripts are cringe worthy seriously disappointing from a game that demands aaa prices i expected something more immersive and more historically accurate whoever did the voice acting and wrote the script for rommel in the desert campaign has a special place in hell it was atrocious he doesn t even sound german i think relic have bitten off more than they can chew with coh3 they weren t ready the game wasn t ready it might be better in 18 months time hopefully after some changes of management at relic
