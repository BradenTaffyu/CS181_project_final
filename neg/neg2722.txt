2020 the ai military expansion is absolutely abysmal in detail they will never strategically place combat resources glaringly obvious choke points are ignored they will trickle forces into you rather than doing a full assault they will avoid your invasion force if they have no fleet bigger they will not combine their own forces they will distribute their combat resources inefficiently distributing 3 ships every other sector the ai will starve itself to death the ai has absolutely no situational awareness you can block it from a lane path with a territory and will just sit there trapped in a state of nothingness for the entire game the ai will declare war if it feels like it can beat someone 1v1 but it doesn t stop there it will declare war versus multiple people at the same time using this logic if you invited them to a federation for example there s no way to remove them from the federation while there is a war and they will never let the wars end meanwhile their fleet logic wont let them move their main fleet because it s afraid it will lose it in a 4v1 scenario so it just holds it back at a default main planet while the enemy ai takes their territories essentially the ai cannot and does not understand what its military is doing they will perpetually spam wars with people until they are weakened or destroyed meanwhile any member of the federation they are in is griefed the entire game the ai is incapable of making rational decisions and will gladly declare war with so many people it destroys itself diplomacy is essentially non existent in detail civilizations only want to be your friend if you re stronger than them there s no way to demand territories from ais without forcibly taking them from them there s no way to request to trade territories from ai only trading them to the ai claiming does nothing outside war context combat quality is basically an afterthought combat is whoever has the biggest number combat lasts 3 10 seconds depending on the equality of the encounter i should not have to mod my game to have a more enjoyable combat experience there is no strategy involved a 1400 fleet of corvettes will be destroyed by a 1500 titan and vice versa there s nothing else the ui is trash this game has been out for how long and i still can t see the total pops per planet for resettlement you cannot return to your previous planet from the resettlement screen you cannot organize your planets or sectors the outliner is useless about three hours into every single game the resettlement screen becomes a mess with only the option of alphabetical sorting other thoughtsdesigning a custom empire is fun increasing the difficulty does not increase the difficulty it increases how hard the ai cheats this by extension may increase the difficulty but in a very unrealistic way it does not increase or change how well they play they will always play terribly and try to expand randomly they have no logic to them whatsoever machine empires are 3x easier to play than organic populations 100 habitability ability to produce populations from alloy no food no consumer goods i had a 2800 pop and the next organic pop was 800
