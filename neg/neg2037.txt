2015 as usual gaijin keeps driving this deeper and deeper into territory with each patch worse than the last a redditor sums it up nicely it s less a testament of that and more a testament to how much people desperately wanted war thunder to be a good game hell i saw this train wreck 2 3 years ago and stuck for it for a year past the point of i don t like where this is going before i stopped playing more and more finally stopping outright at the 2 5 year mark all the while i tried to get the word out as best i could on what was wrong with wt how it was wrong why this actually constituted being called wrong and possible solutions to fix it this largely fell on deaf ears because the devs community representatives etc whomsoever it concerns are too busy being sycophantic self serving ignorant intent on dazzling the playerbase with smoke and mirrors and a general disregard for major problems in the operation of the game and its general gameplay that i stuck around for so long shows just how good war thunder is at its core that is its most basic gameplay is absolutely phenomenal even if it has problems due to imperfect flight models bad balance choices for tiering in both directions blatantly improper use of metrics for determining balance damage models that feel like the devs threw darts at a dart board to determine how strong things were my favorite being p 47 wings disintegrating to 0 30 caliber shells that the overwhelming majority of planes during wwii were largely immune to except in insanely large quantities measured in hundreds upon hundreds of individual strikes the list goes on but the devs don t care about fixing the actual problems with the game flat out aren t being told it due to incompetent community representatives for one reason or another and instead focus on pushing out more buggy imbalanced badly designed but gloriously modeled filler instead of spending a couple patches just making the game more fun at the gameplay level this coupled with the blatant cash grabs that they ve done making the game significantly more expensive to accomplish significantly less and people are finally starting to wise up to those who left before and why and choosing to leave as well or to put it another way for them they just had the final straw put on the camel and its back is broken this problem has been a long time coming and people were desperate for the game to improve but they re just now giving up the game could have been that good but it also shows that the problem takes a very long time for most people to detect and gaijin right now is banking on that high turnover rate to stay profitable the best anyone can do is try to make people just joining the game stay away from it by warning them that it has serious problems but this feeds back into the first point the core gameplay is just that good that it masks the absolute failure that is its metagame and mismanagement for significant amounts of time and until the reviews tank wt this will continue to be the case taranok
