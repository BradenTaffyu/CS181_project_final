payday 3 is a disappointment in almost every way payday 2 is one of my most played games the first i played on pc and one where i have many fond memories of playing it with my friends the hype for payday 3 in my social circle was immense the betas didn t change our expectations it only heightened them and yet upon the games release the problems were countless putting aside the terrible launch and server issues as the game could still be great despite these obvious inconveniences so many decisions were absolutely atrocious and this aspiration would never be met there is a discourse in game development between blaming the developers versus the corporate leadership for being the cause of quagmires in video games in this case i don t expect there were orders from the starbreeze ceo for there not to be any text chat in the lobby or any voice chat at all or an unready button or perk decks or any of the other innumerable absences of features that have been in payday 2 for over a decade was it corporate that dictated the addition of murky station as opposed to universally revered heists like first world bank or the diamond heist these were surely all choices made at a much lower level that have spurred a worse experience for the consumer all decisions made by the developers subsequent free content drops patches and paid dlcs have not alleviated the issues in any substantial way the so called operation medic bag is released slowly and with little to be excited about in some cases problems have worsened the spring dlc released in the summer and we all relived the same miseries and inabilities to connect to nebula that had occurred with the initial game release dlcs were poorly priced especially when compared to payday 2 s final new heists in the run up to payday 3 s release to compensate for this free outfits were announced to appease players although these are yet to be delivered upon starbreeze have looked incredibly greedy doing this even more so when they put the pre order bonus onto the steam store for mere chump change within three months of the game s release overall payday 3 has been a shoddy mess from start to the seemingly imminent finish prior to the game s release the final dlcs of payday 2 were joked about amongst my friends as being made by the starbreeze interns while all focus was on the sequel it is sad to see that these temp workers are capable of producing totally superior content to the development team of payday 3 outside of checking in for half an hour to see each new dlc i m entitled to from my ill advised pre order of the gold edition and getting all the achievements which are currently broken by the way i see no reason to be playing payday 3 especially when compared to its predecessor my sentiment is clearly shared by the community at large as payday 2 has thousands upon thousand more players than payday 3 at all times it is less than a third of the cost at full price has a vast catalogue of content and is particularly fun with friends payday 2 has my full recommendation and should be chosen in a heartbeat over this falsely advertised ill made and seemingly unsalvageable trash
