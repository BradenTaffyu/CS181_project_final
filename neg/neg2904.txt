2018 i was having a grand old time playing iron man some 50 hours into the game when i discovered that federations are inherently unbeatable conquer every single one of my neighbors planets occupy every single one of his territories crushed every single fleet that comes against me and forced to accept a white peace because i can t get at the federation member on the other side of the stupid screen inside of the 10ish years they give you before attrition catches up to you and forces you to accept whatever they offer in their horribly balanced diplomacy why is conquering the universe impossible it certainly isn t because the universe can fight you diplomacy is apparently invincible
