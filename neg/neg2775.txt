2018 stellaris 1 9 was a superb game i was one of those who frequently played mainly with just hyperlanes so i really looked forward to this uptdate which is broken mainly because of the war exhaustion which prevent any conflicts that last longer than one or two engagements the hyperlanes are also poorly implemented since you now have to travel through every system sigh now travelling in hyperspace is more about slowly travelling through a system than actually flying faster than light the game seems also much longer and slower mainly because developing your empire is slow and tedious i really haven t been able to reach the new apocalypse dlc that i paid for so i can t say if it s any good to avoid to hate i game i once loved i will now wait until there is a patch or maybe a mod which fix at least the war exhaustion and the speed problems i hope that in the future i might delete this review
