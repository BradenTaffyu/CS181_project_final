2016 this is a beautiful game the artwork is superb the fighting mechanics are nearly perfect and the story is fascinating if you take the time to search out the clues the game is quite hard but oh so satisfying when you progress through it however the community of pvpers are for the most part horribly rude there are issues of rampant cheating on the pc version of this game and there is really no viable way to avoid the endless invasions by cheaters and non cheaters alike if you want to play this game with a friend and that is the point if you want the pve coop experience do not buy this game i bought this game for myself and a couple of friends so we could play together i played it offline which is obviously solo and loved it i played online by myself and the invasion frequency was tolerable and i actually had fun at times however when i played coop it was one invasion after another it took forever just to advance the story now if you want to play pvp go for it the pvp is actually excellent if you want to play solo offline go for it like i stated earlier the game is beautiful and satisfying but if you want to play coop with friends for the pve experience it will just suck plain and simple i will not recommend this game because from software has an elitist attitude about this game and punishes coop pve players recently they just patched the game to make invasions occur even more frequently so now in coop all you will be doing is playing pvp frankly it sucks i am sure i will get alot of hate for this review and the hate is strong from the dark souls 3 pvp crowd but i believe the issue must be stated thanks for taking the time to read this if you did have a great day
