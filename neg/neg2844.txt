2017 the game starts out great but the mechanics simply don t scale into any kind of interesting mid or late game it takes the paradox blobbing meta and does it even more generically in space the ai and politics just aren t good you either kill everyone or form a giant alliance neither path is nuanced i m hoping we get some dlc in the future that gives this game some much needed depth but for now it s a pass
