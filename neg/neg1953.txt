warthunder is a free to play title that begs you for money like a heroin addict that just needs one more hit out of the 600 hours i have played i maybe had fun in like 6 this game punishes you for every second you put into it the only time it is even slightly forgiving is when you use an overpriced premium vehicle that in effect gives you god mode i was under the impression that the game gets better and more fun as you progress but the truth is that you only get stockholm syndrome and a deep resentment for the world around you please do not play this game it is awful
