2022 i really want to recommend this because the first few hours are sensational and the atmosphere humour and art direction is top drawer but the student ai is bugged to death and murders the whole experience when you get to the mid game students will go and do other things while still technically queuing for a facility meaning they could be off grabbing a drink while queuing for the doctor holding up the whole queue twenty students will queue up at one kiosk ignoring the empty one right next to it even if it sells the exact same thing they will ignore toilets and showers no matter how many you have or how many you scatter about and instead allow their mood metres to drain while they take classes because the ai priority system is completely broken i m fairly sure all this will be fixed and it ll be brilliant soon enough and i ll persist because of the promise it has but it sure is infuriating and i can t in all honesty recommend it at the time of review
