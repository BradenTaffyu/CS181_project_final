2016 edit paid mods bethesda won t ever learn not recommended at all bethesda won t learn otherwise and next games will come with paid mods first or only well launch was a mess the engine is utter crap on amd gpu even with high end cards and an i7 the creation kit was late by more than half a year and is still in beta then again everything by bethesda is in perpetual beta the game got an action game focus and lost quite a lot of the special system so if you are in for an rpg forget it the writing is not great to say the least the ui is crap although there are some good companions if you are looking for an fps there are way better ones out there and if you try to play it on 21 9 resolution displays google flawless widescreen beforehand now with 1 5 bethesda came out with official mod support but if you use mods achievements are disabled there are mods to disable this but the whole stance is simply unacceptable oh and to add a bit of salt to the wound i can t even play the game now as it craps itself on load and new game as well with no way to backtrack to the previous version that still worked at least i played through the mechanist dlc and had about 145 hours great going bethesda simply put it s still a mess wait till goty edition comes out cheaper
