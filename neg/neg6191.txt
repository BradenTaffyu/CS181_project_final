2023 up until a few hours ago this review was going to be positive but it seems that owlcat has learned next to nothing from its last release so here we are in the interest of being fair i will start with what i liked which is quite a lot the writing is very strong i ve read some posts that heretical playthroughs stretch credulity quite a bit but on my iconoclast route i felt like i was immersed in the grim darkness of warhammer 40k making hard decisions and trying to be good in a galaxy that sought to break such ideals few stories have been able to make me feel a betrayal as hard as i did in this game which speaks to just how invested i was in the story the combat is mostly pretty fun though it has issues that i will get into later and you have a lot of options of how to build your characters so having said this why don t i recommend it well unfortunately this game suffers from the same issues that wotr did bugs abound leading to broken quests unequipable gear and at time of writing i cannot continue with the main quest due to a bug and from what people are saying on forums it sounds like acts 4 and 5 are barely playable due to the technical problems the combat i said was fun but it suffers from a persistent bug in displaying damage ranges frequently you will find your attacks hitting for far less than the minimum projected or sometimes no ranges will be displayed at all also like wotr the combat suffers from balancing issues sometimes there will be fights that will be entirely undefeatable because your characters aren t built right this would be fine on high difficulties but on normal this feels pretty lame also as an aside the romance options are pretty limited especially based on your sexuality if you re a gay man all you have is marazhai which might just be worse than nothing so in the end it seems the game was rushed to market by a bunch of executives months before it was ready just like owlcat s last release so will the game be worth buying eventually probably wotr downright works nowadays thing is i didn t pre order the game for access to a beta i bought it at release and the product is faulty when i played baldur s gate 3 at launch i didn t even notice any bugs that comparison might feel unfair but larian and owlcat are companies of similar size so in theory owlcat should be capable of reaching that standard so why don t they almost certainly because of company leadership but i think digging any deeper into that is officially too much for a steam review the point is we should not put up with a half functioning game at release
