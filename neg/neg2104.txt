2022 war thunder its quite an experience is the game fun no can you have fun playing this game yes absolutely however there is so many things that are just frustrating about the game that really detract from it one of the biggest ones is having to fight tanks a whole tier above yours which happens to me and can happen to others almost every game this wouldn t be terrible if you could have the choice but unfortunately no matter what you don t have a choice so you have armor that works great at your rank and oh look now your armor is pointless then there is the planes oh boy that s fun i want to play a nice game of ground warfare and oh look i just got bombed pretty much happens every time i spawn so instead of having two separate ones like ground only and mixed battles where you can play both planes and tanks that would be fine but instead you are yet again without a choice there are just too many things that are frustrating about this game to list this is already more of a rant than a review at this point so if you have literally nothing else to do and are an extreme masochist who likes torturing other masochists then you might as well try war thunder note much later after a lot more playtime the game is somehow even worse
