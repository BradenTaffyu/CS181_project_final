2017 one of the main selling points of this game was the fact that unlike the hunter classic this would be a one time buy with no microtransactions well here it is 2 months after release that they have made their first microtransaction and labled it a dlc so that no one can go after them with a lawsuite for false advertising this is one of the most dissapointing companies i have ever seen i watched the livestreams that were going on and the devs just laughed at the bugs in their game most of the bugs ive encountered in the begginning of the game are still here but instead of fixing them they are trying to start the milking process of our wallets i spent several hundred dollars on the hunter classic and i will not repeat that process on call of the wild will not be playing this ever again
