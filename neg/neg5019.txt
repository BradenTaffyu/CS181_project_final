2019 tl dr three kingdoms is one of the better entries in the series with improvements and refining that were introduced in warhammer being furthered here development seems to have a more thought out process which leads to decisions in design that makes it one of the better total war games right out at the start however with fewer unit progressions throughout the game each faction being essentially the same with only one or two unit variations and a continued focus on small scale battles and small units still result in a feeling that total war could be much more than it is with only late game battles with multiple armies on both sides give the feeling you should have of grand battles and kingdoms at war for survival this coupled with the fact that half of the map is essentially dead space with no factions leaves a mixed feeling three kingdoms seems to herald a turn for the better but it still seem to aim too low in scale and grandness in both battles and the campaign map that still leaves a bit to be desired after all this time leaving a mixed feeling of excitement and disappointment at the same time and with the expectations that the dlc policy will follow similar steps as before which rarely improve the depth of the base game much makes me hesitant to fully recommend it at this time long version problems and missteps in previous games are improved in three kingdoms artistic and aesthetic designs is era location inspired but are no longer a detriment to usability or information as in rome 2 and even provide a choice between stylized and more tradition versions with unit cards they have learned from their previous mistakes and knows how far they can take it before it becomes detrimental some specific aspects of the game are markedly improved especially the diplomatic aspect of the game the launch furthermore seems to be one of the smoother ones with the game feeling less buggy problematic or rushed than other entries which is greatly appreciated however problems still plagues the series unit sizes seems to remain rather low and while it seems like the number on average has gone up since warhammer some unit s sizes still remains too low this leads to an anti climatic feeling to battles even when full armies clash the ultra and extreme unit sizes are the only ones that even closely gives a feeling of grandness and armies clashing this aspect is however one that has plagued the series for a while and a problem that increased in recent entries when the focus on looks graphics and effects seemed to have been more important at the cost of army unit size and the grandness of battles at this point however when graphics in games seems to have hit a plateau of sorts and further improvements are harder for players to distinguish between games focus appears to finally once again return to the armies and their size but while improved over warhammer three kingdoms still comes up short the only real time you get a sense of a grand scale to battles is when you are finally able to field two full armies against two or more enemy armies its only at this point that the scale truly feels like it should and you finally feel like you are leading the combined might of a kingdom fighting for dominance against great foes but here too comes some of the problems in term of design on the campaign map the move on recent games of lowering the amount of armies that are fielded seems to be something the developers still strives for with three kingdom keeping the numbers of armies low through economy and so forth leading to situations where having more than one or two armies in one place rare or at the cost of sacrificing fronts to gather them in one place difference in unit quality has also taken a hit with units only having more or less 1 2 variants you have your main militia type be it sword spear axe bow etc these guys will be the your main guys for the whole campaign the only real change in each type comes from generals where different types can recruit an essentially better version of units in its unit focus group instead of progression of quality of units throughout the campaign the developers has gone for a more broad stroke design where instead of unit which changes in quality multiple times over the game changing its tactics strategies and decisions you instead have a few more different types with each type only changing in quality with a slight variation thats slightly better than the standard but much more expensive while in theory this seems like an improvement more choices of types and variations should lead to a more interesting and strategic pick of which units you and your enemy has in reality this just means that you generally will pick out one or two unit types for each general that fits his or her specialty and sticking with that for the whole game with little to no changes to those units or army unless the enemy composition directly counters yours what this means is that gone are the feeling of progression and quality of your army or the strategies and questions of quality vs quantity as the game progressed and new units become available in the past questions would rise on whether you should you have armies only outfitted with the highest quality units at the cost of only being able to afford a few armies but fielding a stronger force on your main front of conquest or going with cheaper units to be able to field more armies or a mixture with some armies fielding a strong core of high quality units with lower quality ones as backup or when to pull your armies away from the front and refit in three kingdoms the question is more or less a straight forward one buy the units from the beginning that your general specialize in and you thing will counters your enemies ones on the battlefield with no other factors really being considered even campaign map situation or economy no real thought is given to quality vs cost beyond the special units which while only slightly better or specialized costs way more and often too much for the slight increase in power and just ends up with if you have more money buy the expensive version from the beginning of the game and is not enough variation this aim for simplicity and straightforwardness in army composition lower number of armies you field and barely making quality a question leaves a bitter feeling the army you field in the beginning of your campaign will be more or less the same army you fielded at the end with the same units you bought at the start and you wont get to a point where anything really change at no point in the campaign will you encounter armies that if you failed to keep up with tech buildings or refit your armies would increase the challenge or even defeat your army in terms of the campaign map the design has both positive and negative changes the map seems more thought out and strategic points where you may want to establish your border because its a better strategically placed that other cities seem more frequent and thought out however the best part of the map is the upper half where there exists a multitude of factions in the south however the quality and thought seems to markedly drop in the south the map becomes completely uninteresting with the han empire controlling about 1 3 of the southern half of the map with uncontrolled land to the east and west of it with only one other faction existing in the far south what this means is that if you play as a faction in the middle of the map you essentially have free reign to conquer the south without any resistance what so ever the han empire should theoretically be a threat but since its focus in split upon the whole map it tends to leave the south more or less undefended and allows you to easily conquer it and then the west and east part is just a money sink to buy more land when your army arrives
