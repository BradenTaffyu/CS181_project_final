2014 this game is an epic fail napoleon total war is what got me into the franchise because of the era shogun ii and fots were decent products even though there were 1 billion dlcs for them i didn t buy this game but won it from a tournament still i wish i didn t rome ii it was a pure waste of time even though i had sometimes fun when playing with friends and trolling on online battles i enjoyed playing campaigns but it is just not enough also so many factions are missing this means that there will be around 20 dlcs for this game the campaign now is kinda good but boring in my opinion there is not enough big variety of units in the game battles are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too fast even in shogun ii they did not finish their fights for 20 seconds wtf ca terrain doesn t matter that much at all and this reminds me of the long games on napoleon where you actually had to be careful even in shogun ii thanks to the units with muskets and the bow cav the games could be longer rome i and medieval ii s online battles were decent and fun in my opinion napoleon total war is the most balanced game in the aspect of online battles i will give you an example for those who don t know uk is the strongest nation at shooting in the game i rushed even kited when needed pushed on one of the flanks then ran back and let my friend to make the final blow the game was more than 30 minutes and our opponents were very good and it was all pure fun as you can see i am using austria which is one of the worst nations at shooting their skirmishers are weak their infantry is no match in melee even in shooting vs the uk ones the only thing i have that is better are the ulans even though as you can see if you think you can beat your opponent no matter what factions you are using and can you do that in rome ii you simply cannot unless you are facing a brand new guy who doesn t know what people usually bring what the ca are you serious why did you even release this game why don t you freeze it until you fix it better don t waste your money on this crap and play the other titles except empire which is still broken as d and have fun oh wait a minute i forgot ca what the happened with the soundtracks they were so epic in rome i m2 and shogun ii ntw and etw didn t have the need of those because the muskets were some kind of a music but seriously when i listen to these soundtracks i get even more bored except 1 or 2 i can listen to the rome i soundtracks all day anyday g g ca you failed i hope that you will fix this game if we can call it a game soon enough this is just unacceptable
