2015 this game has great potential yet the russian makers are extremely bias for their own country before 1 53 it was okay but afterwards the power of the german tanks has utterly been demolished the german 88 mm gun has virtually no affect on the russian tanks bouncing off t 34 s front slope if not placed correctly the russian tanks however seem to dominate the game with one shots on nearly every single tank they come accross a few years ago before war thunder groundforces the american faction was experiencing the same problems the american planes had extremely low max speeds such as the hellcat having a max speed of 200 km h this was made note of many of war thunder s fans and eventurely although not completely war thunder made american planes somewhat more operable hopefully by next update war thunder won t make such another mistake although it is unlikely
