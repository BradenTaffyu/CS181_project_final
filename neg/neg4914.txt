2019 three kingdoms is definitely a step forward from previous total war games since the decline after shogun 2 it brings in a fresh new diplomacy menu with many options that allow negotiations to be a lot less static and a scoring system that allows you to properly understand what you can do to make a deal work the new generals are an interesting concept as you are hiring specific skills for your army that lead to specific units customizing the generals is enjoyable at first until you start to see the same swords and armour with only a few actually changing the look of your general the family tree has been refreshed and the court is once again something to stay involved with as you need to balance the relation of the generals in your court and army the campaign map is nice and battles last longer to actually be worth controlling the fight settlements have a wide variety of buildings as well to make it necessary to manage your settlements properly however unit variety is especially dull and limited mid game comes to a grinding halt once you have seen pretty much all the units worth seeing once you finally unlock the new stronger units they are incredibly overpriced so much so that it is worth keeping your older armies with the experience they have making them just as good sieges are back but very limited as well the first few are enjoyable but once you begin to notice more advance settlements you see they do not really change much in design or with the units guarding them even worse your men have the hardest time navigating around the castle as units bunch up around corners and move slower dragging on battles i experienced a few glitches of the map disappearing or visual issues but they were forgivable the real reason i am writing this review despite never doing so in the past is because of the failure to properly finish total war games as well as the reduction of quality once you become emperor spoilers if you really call it that two other nations will declare themselves emperor as well and null your alliances once you drag through another tedious campaign of claiming their seats you win the short campaign i guess you either then already have 95 settlements or must continue to drag on the repetition of playing wack a mole by killing armies running straight into your territory or auto resolving capturing new settlements that have identical layouts by then too the legendary heroes have begun to die off and are being replaced by stock card generals that look and act the same this halt to enjoyment is brought by lack of unit variety lack of ai polish lack of city variety removal of the cutscenes that made total war games separate from the rest lack of a clear game objective as you are running around following a new one that could be the end game which takes way too long to complete and lack of other nations that i have read the han dynasty stretched to three kingdoms is definitely a step forward from previous games in some aspects but unfortunately the lack of polish makes it seem like more of a one time play dlc
