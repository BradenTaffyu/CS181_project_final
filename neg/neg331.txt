2023 negative review primarily because of always online requirement everything in this game is ran server side so if you have spotty internet this game will be impossible for you to play 18 hours of play at time of writing and over three hours of that has been lost due to crud tier internet add to that the time it takes to load into a mission even when in single player the unskipable cut scenes intro speeches etc and this game just loves to waste your time i have other complaints too in game voice chat isn t a thing pre mission planning from payday2 is no longer a thing and while we can see everyone s weapons we can t see their skills or communicate in any way prior to starting the heist so far this game is a massive step backwards i regret taking a day off to play it
