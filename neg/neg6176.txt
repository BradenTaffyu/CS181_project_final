this is one of the best depictions of the 40k universe yet it s such a buggy mess that i cannot recommend it i m literally unable to complete the game and after doing it 2 3 times i m done trying to mod my way through progression side objectives side stories minor plots at least 10 15 of it is was broken i m in the last stage of the game so don t know how much they fixed but what i do know is that i literally can t finish it landing on the next plot planet actually spawns me in the instance of the planet i already visited get it for 10 with the upcoming dlcs like 5 years from now when either devs or the community fixes it
