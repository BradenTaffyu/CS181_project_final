2023 i really want to recommend this game but even ignoring the performance issues which are being patched and have improved there are just too many basic bugs to justify buying at this price at this time i m sure the devs are not happy with the amount of negative reviews and as someone who works in software development i suspect it is a management push to hit a deadline regardless of quality that has hurt this game there are just too many fundamental things that are wrong only some of which have been fixed e g commercial zoning has only just been fixed was completely unbalanced with no shoppers regardless of population garbage trucks clone garbage instead of incinerating it leading to massive backlogs hydro electric power plain doesn t work at all the release should have been delayed until the game was actually working they knew performance was an issue and they must have known there was a massive list of fundamental bugs what should have been a well received game by an existing fan base is now just annoying and alienating and most former fans have lost all faith in colossal i certainly won t buy another of their games at release and for full price i m sure this will be a great game at some point but that point is not now we know there are some issues is no excuse for releasing what you know is a buggy poor performing mess of a game and expecting people to pay full price for it
