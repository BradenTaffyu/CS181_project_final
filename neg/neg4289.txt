2017 i love the civilization series i ve grown up playing the series since civ ii when i was only eight years old this series has shaped what i know and expect out of any strategy game and will forever serve as a litmus test to other strategy series i can play any number of games and genres but i always go back to civilization when i grow bored of the others keeping this in mind civ 6 has been a huge disappointment to me and fails to compare to its predecessors in any way many new features are welcome improvements though admitedly adapted from other comparable series the introduction of districts policies and changes to various science espionage religious and military aspects i even warmed up to the art style very quickly in my first playthrough they carried over enough of the previous games to make it easy for me to pick up and start playing right away unfortunately they left behind the soul of the previous entries civ for me has always been a single player game first making interaction with the ai one of the most important features in the game i like how they made the ai react differently to my playstyle i like that i can have reasons casus belli to declare war drastically reducing warmonger penalties to the ai unfortunately all of this means nothing since the ai is deperately broken they will declare wars against you and other civs for absolutley no reason and then beg you for peace giving you all of their resource city states will either be technologically inept in the later game or wildly advanced beyond any civ close to them harder difficulties don t make the ai play any better they just get more settlers and builders to start it took them six months just to patch the ai to make it playable but it still needs improvement to make matters worse firaxis is taking the paradox route by nickel and diming fans just to get the bonus content of new civilizations which are honestly desperately needed for the enjoyment of replayablility as of this review they are charging a minimum of 5 per new civilization i felt that civ 4 and 5 s expansions were perfect these expansions brought multiple new civs leaders and game changing content all for the better yes they were more expensive but they brought so much that they were so worth it until sweeping changes come from expansions or patches i do not recommend purchasing the game at full price in its current state
