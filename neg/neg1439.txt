2023 this was a very difficult non recommendation as the base game is fairly solid but we all know that s not the real reason people buy this game it s the mods with the developers constantly putting out tiny updates that break most mods they single handily slaughtered their mod community most of the best modders with amazing mods have long abandoned this game whoever is in charge of this we don t care if you patch quickly a sword that clips a tiny bit if it breaks everything some modders came back when version 1 0 came out then the developers released like 14 or 15 tiny patches that didn t do much yes one actually was nice but all could have been lumped into one and they left again devs you killed your following and continue to beat that dead horse patch when necessary not all day every day i was super disappointed by this developer with this game though to be fair they did release fire sword so no big shocker there they released this game what 2 years ago still making save mod breaking patches who does that that being said they released a product that was 90 unplayable with no content save better graphics it crashed more than 100 yr old blind lady how decided to wing it without her glasses i wish i hadn t bought this game and gave the devs my money shame on you devs shame
