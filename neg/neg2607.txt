2023 want a fun game with great potential and a wet fart of a finish look no further i enjoyed my time with the game until the last two story islands the pacing was a little weird and i had to complete about half the game before i felt comfortable leaving my raft for any amount of time but that gave me the opportunity to farm resources a bit and enjoy the vibes really fun especially great with multiplayer what went wrong you can tell what parts of the game were developed when and how much testing they got for example every fun little furniture item for your raft can only be crafted with basic flotsam instead of any precious materials this would be fine except it feels like a missed opportunity that i can t use metal or copper or glass or titanium to make more varied or interesting decorations just whatever they came up with in the first few patches alright but what about the story i m not really a story guy so i didn t find it very compelling of a narrative to each their own the real biggest problem is that this fun little collection survival game decides it wants combat at the last second despite not being designed for it in any way shape or form the last couple islands has you completing puzzles while struggling for your life to put it bluntly it feels janky this needed another couple passes at least and combat puzzles feels like the last thing this game needed for example in the last boss fight you hear someone yell it s no use you can t pierce his hide i took that to mean that just like every other obstruction in the game pure killing wouldn t be the answer what the game meant was this boss enters invincibility sometimes so just get out of the way i lost my entire inventory because of that fight speaking of dying in this game is a real drag i m all for punishments for making mistakes such as being pushed back on progress or only allowing a certain amount of failures but these items can take 20 40 minutes to reliably farm losing 2 3rds of your inventory each death means dozens of rare materials poof into thin air because the devs wanted a combat arena at the last second nice thanks overall i came back to this game because i enjoyed the feeling of making a raft that really felt like my own and setting up automated systems of taking care of my various survival needs that feeling still strongly resonates the entire playthrough once you ve been sent to an arctic island you can just drop the game if you re not feeling it the rest the game has to offer is very lackluster and you ll feel bad for having wasted your time
