2019 i have 337 hours of play and i don t think i have ever done any review of a game before this was my favorite game of all time until 2 0 i literally played this game only for several months unfortunately everything just went downhill from there exploration management combat even the little things like visualization of the population of a planet now sucks it completely lost its soul i hope they revert everything back to before 2 0 but i seriously doubt it
