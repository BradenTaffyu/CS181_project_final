2020 an awesome game built up by lazy devs and dedicated fans arma 3 after near 7 years still doesn t use more than 2 cores of my cpu not even close to 2 3 of their usage utilization same as dayz sa boheima stalled on this one and solely handed it to the players and sat back while enjoying user made content keeping their games alive note that this review is only and only because of bad optimization of this game after 7 years and continued support you have earned so much money use it on a new engine or buy one it s not acceptable to play relatively light mod like king of the hill with 30 40 fps
