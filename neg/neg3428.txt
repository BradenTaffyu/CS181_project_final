i am sure that this has been repeated ad nauseam in the reviews for this game but if it had not been for simcity 2013 s disastrous release the degree of popularity that the cities skylines franchise has attained would simply not exist one would think that nearly on that game s tenth anniversary it might be in mind for executives when determining a release schedule for their game why did cities skylines 1 succeed where simcity 2013 did not simply put it was unlimited where sc2013 imposed limits there are many examples of this that you have probably heard before community content map size one way roads yada yada why is it then that some the very things that helped spur the popularity of csl1 in the first place not the first priority in a full new release this is all stuff you ve heard before what i have not heard nearly enough people talking about is that this game seriously lacks charm compared to its predecessors i admit this is quite subjective but hear me out like it or not the donut vans and obnoxious sirens of the first game are iconic and goofy and felt like they gave the game a charming identity an unrealistic identity perhaps but it had spirit it also had outrageous ploppables like the hadron collider in case you wanted to embrace your unrealistic side simcity 2013 lest we forget had quirky thought bubbles a poorly disguised advertisement for progressive insurance the 100 electric nissan leaf the whole future expansion that changed literally every zone and on a more sincere note the most fitting music for a city builder that i ve ever heard ever there s a reason why the simcity 2013 music pack for csl1 was popular no shade intended that is hard to follow up what is the identity of this specific game spasm electronics i will give credit where credit is due the road system of this game is vastly improved over cities skylines 1 as are the building and vehicle models i prefer the zoning categorization in this game as it is a major step up in realism the north american style does feel pretty american anyone remember roads united and that whole fisaco roundabout support is very nice the tree growth and seasons are nice and adds value to every tree you place down the developers of this game are good people and i believe that they wanted to make a good and fully fleshed out game i believe strongly that they just needed more development time to create a proper sequel or they needed to release this game in early access like many others have already suggested one day i hope to revisit this game once it is in a more playable state but i am worried that it will never get there for me
