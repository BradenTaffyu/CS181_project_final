2017 in this review i want to state the five biggest reasons why i hate this game tl dr youtube video views 0 this video is not by me fallout 4 doesn t have anywhere near the rpg elements of the fallout games from the past excluding brotherhood of steel and fallout tactics the quests the dumbed down leveling system creation club creation club ok so first off i would like to say that i have a lot of time in this game as far as rpgs go for me around 100 hours the biggest problem with fallout 4 when compared to other games is that if you want to play as two people a distressed parent or a distressed parent who murders everyone i feel that a big reason many people defend this game is it feels better than every other fallout game in the actual shooting and combat mechanics which is definitely true but that isn t the point of a fallout game if i wanted good gunplay i would play battlefield or any other of the hundreds of triple a shooters on the market i would take fallout new vegas s sub par combat paired with it s absolutely amazing role playing features over fallout 4 s good gunplay supplemented by role play any day the game s retarded chat wheel function only allows for 4 options minimum or maximum this is really stupid as sometimes you need more options sometimes you need less you can see this in fallout 4 as often times different choices on the chat wheel say the exact same thing i think that the reason they chose this system was because they had voice actors and didn t want to have to voice more than 4 lines for every dialogue i for one do not much care for having my character voiced it takes away the be anyone you want feel that this game is already lacking another problem is the way quests are set up every single quest excluding the retarded radiant quests is just a stupid fetch quest there are never any interesting quests like you find in falout new vegas take one for my baby from fallout new vegas where you have to do some detective work to find the right person to be shot or if you want to just haul some random sucker out in front of the dinosaur and watch their head explode you also have quests like ain t nothin but a hound dog where you have to get a new brain for rex the dog you can get the brain from multiple places and depending on which one you use rex will get a new trait compare these with nearly every fallout 4 side quest where it is either a fetch quest or a radiant quest also bethesda can we please not have another missing family member storyline in the next fallout game next we have the dumbed down leveling up system where everything is a perk you can get based off of your special level this leads to boring perks like 20 percent damage the only reason these perks exist is to make up for the lack of skill points which in other fallout games did all of the boring leveling up and the perks were always fun i feel like many of the or removed features excluding the chat wheel are a direct result of skyrim s success it had terrible fetch quests and everyone loved it but i ve been typing for a half hour now and i m not reviewing skyrim so you can just watch the video by mistercaption where he basically says what i ve said lastly there is creation club which should be called give us your money
