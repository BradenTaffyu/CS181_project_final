2017 here s the long of it creative assembly delievered exactly what they said they would it s a new game with 4 new races and a new campaign as well as map it s essentially the exact same as the first game outside of that with a few really nice quality of life improvements imo things like heroes working much smoother than game one i m quite excited for mortal empires and will probably revamp my review upon it s release the negatives are quite glarring though interventions god this is just a horrible mechanic why would you think this was a good idea hardly worth the money and even if they work i felt quite cheap for using them bad bad mechanic for a game to just magically spawn an army right on top of your enemies just cause seems like they needed a way to challenge rituals and all they could come up with was this really sloppy and anti fun anti strategic mechanic naval combat being auto resolve in the first game was understandable at times inconvienent in this game its a down right travesty you have essentially 3 different land mass all seperated by massive seas plus plenty of smaller island provinces suddenly that being a forced auto resolve becomes a major nuisance ai armies and stop an invasion that normally you could win out easily it forces the player to bring excessive forces to the fight not that it s broken but it s certainly punishing and hand tying the short of it if you loved the first game and want more then this will probably be a good buy for you doubly so if mortal empires is solid
