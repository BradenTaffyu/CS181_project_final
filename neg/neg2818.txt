2017 stellaris is entertaining for a few hours but quickly becomes dull and tedious when you first start a game you re amazed and interested at how indepth the game feels with all the different mechanics plus if you re a fan of the sci fi genre it s a blast to just get yourself immersed in growing a space empire however once you crack the surface once you start learning about these mechanics it quickly reveals itself to be shallow combat is boring and unbalanced it always boils down to having the bigger fleet with few exceptions ground combat is even more boring and simplified with no strategy involved at all simply move your army to a planet land and win managing your empire is boring and tedious to manage your empire you have a few planets that you directly control and micromanage and then have to delegate any other planets to sectors these sectors give the ai control over the planets having them build and develop improvements a good portion of the game is taken out of your hands and put into the ai s and the ai is beyond inept i ve had sectors with plenty of resources still have empty planets with no improvements while they build nothing else to try to get the most out of your planets you have to constantly jockey with the sector system do the dull and tedious colony development yourself and then jockey with the sector system again it s very boring and adds more micromanagement to a system that was designed to reduce it of course the sector system is absolutely necessary because the other space empires are just as inept as the sector ai the only way to stop a player from completely steamrolling the galaxy is to cripple the player through using the sectors if you try to play around the sectors you get the micromangement hell i described above if you use the sectors as designed then the game is still unbalanced but still better than the optimal way to play i tried to like stellaris and at first i really did it just becomes so boring and tedious it s hard to explain how much time is wasted in this game just waiting waiting for resources waiting for fleets to build waiting for the invasion to end waiting for the warscore to tick up so you can end a war waiting waiting waiting the only things that could have made the downtime between conflicts interesting was the empire management which is taken out of control of the player through sectors and then handled ineptly by the ai in addition to the problems with the actual game paradox interactive has become a terrible company to support gone are the days where paradox made fantastic if buggy games for relatively cheap with great expansions to enhance the vanilla game now paradox releases broken games then releases a constant stream of overpriced dlcs that add one or two features that are inevitably broken or unbalanced on release the sad part is most of the dlcs are great ideas with terrible implementation or are great ideas at the expense of ignoring vital areas of the base game i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone the game is boring and unbalanced plain and simple if you think you cand find some enjoyment in this game perhaps through modding then i still don t recommend buying this game if only so that paradox doesn t get your money
