at this point they may start releasing battle packs and loot boxes the base game is great and very satisfying beyond that there are a lot of dlcs that prey on the fact that some people are die hard fans and then lock achievements behind those paywalls i would rate the game positively if there were more updates to the base game the dlcs didn t feel so predatory and expensive and if there was a future for the game i d recommend it if you don t care about the achievements or have money to spend on the dlcs which never seem worth it for the price
