2016 never played warhammer tabletop before and i m very unfamiliar with the lore so i m not going to base my opinion on that although it does seem interesting for me being a fan of lotr pros very well optimized compared to past total war titlesbeautiful graphicscool and interesting skill and quest systemno pitched combat and better collisionszombie hoardsartillery pornfun gameplaycons battles too shortno small settlement siegeslimited unit formationsarcade type strategy in battlesskill ability spamming in multiplayer seen not experienced dlc ripoffscopy and paste factions if you are a traditionalist total war gamer then you wont like this game i m mixed about it myself but i do find it fun to play but compared to the other good total war titles its just over priced and bare bones i recommend this game only on sale its not worth 60 another thing is segas and ca s horrible dlc policies i m so tired of this practice 3 for blood that should have been free to add later by players choice i know they wanted a t rating to be able to sell more but they shoud have made it free to download 8 for a race that is not all that great to play in my opinion and also they have the nerve to charge that much for an already limited roster yeah it was free when preordered and free a week after release but whats the big problem with just making it free now this really ticks me off 18 for another race and a campaign map add on what happened to the freelc that they promised you re paying 90 for base game a unit pack blood effects and another race with a campaign map addon and still you have a small race roster a small campaign map and you re also going to have to pay even more for races and content that should already be in here or atleast should be free to download c mon sega and ca this is gaming not used car sales last total war title i will ever buy
