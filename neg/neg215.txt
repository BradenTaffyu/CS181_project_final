2022 this review is not meant to paint the game as bad more so is it meant to share the subjective negative experience of someone who wanted to play the game primarily for the story the content on display here will probably grip anyone who likes bioware storytelling or star wars there are 8 distinct class stories of considerable scope and with a free 2 play account you could theoretically play 4 without deleting another character which is not too bad after 50 hours and making my way through most of the sith warrior storyline according to online discourse one of the better ones albeit clearly not the best i feel justified in saying that the narrative aspect of this game is much better than the gameplay side which is a shame at the start you are spoiled with dialogue narrative progression and somewhat meaningful choices the role playing element is also quite solid allowing you to express your character in more ways than just yes maybe but yes or a sarcastic yes getting your own lightsaber feels great and rising up in the ranks of the sith does as well the start to this game really is fantastic however the gameplay which pretty much exclusively consists of running from a to b often over fairly large distances interacting with objects and fighting enemies with generic mmo hot bar combat never feels like more than an afterthought to the story as far as i am concerned the only redeeming qualities of this combat system are the classic star wars sound design as well as the badass animations of powerful force attacks and as the game goes on this problem becomes so much worse the rate between interesting story moments and long stretches of thoughtless and mundane gameplay gets more and more unpleasant the further you progress there are some exceptions in the form of longer story missions but they are rare even the narrative declines in quality during its middle stretch sending you from planet to planet to hunt down uninteresting key targets although this particular criticism may only apply to the sith warrior storyline the dull gameplay is surprisingly only worsened by an experience system that involves free boosters and special events which allow you to level up at a much faster rate yes you will never really have to grind for levels but due to that the sense of challenge quickly evaporates as well at first it might feel like you are suitably overpowered especially as a sith lord but having no sense of challenge can only entertain for so long and going through a single storyline in this game takes longer than that in the end your enjoyment of the game will come down to your willingness to grind for a good story not bioware at their best but still head and shoulders above most videogame writing while also enduring the sharp difference in quality between presentation and gameplay maybe the entire experience also improves suddenly and drastically with its endgame content and story addons but any game whose gameplay takes more than 50 hours to get good is very hard to recommend even if it is written by bioware even if it has the star wars setting and even if it is free
