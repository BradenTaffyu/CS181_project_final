2017 do i recommend this game i reckon that after having considered both what it brings to the table and its cons i don t think i can don t get me wrong total war warhammer is probably one of the tw games i ve enjoyed the most so far but i have two gripes with the game i ultimately cannot ignore and i am aware that they might seem as minor nit picks or that they can be circunvented by mods but i don t want to judge a product based on what the community has done for it and the problems i have are in the end too big to ignore first of all the pricing model the absurd drip feed of content for outrageous prices is literally the worst aspect of the game the interface looks as if we were playing a free to play title tw wh is 60 constantly reminding you of the content you don t own and all the fun you could be having if you just spent the 17 bucks the elfs cost so maybe they will stop creating a woodreich or something the base game only includes the possibility of playing 4 soon to be 5 different races and all the others are locked behind dlc ranging from the 7 50 to the 17 odd bucks i know this is usually an overused word but that s just a greedy pricing model bleeding your customers for the bare minimum of content also the ai is stupid they play some kind of agent swarm game and elves are kinda of op when played by them expanding really fast and reaching critical value in no time not to mention that the map s way too small in my opinion i am aware that this is supposed to be a 3 part launch but still the warhammer world is way bigger than what we got here and compared to games such as empire or even rome it feels really constrained i will give shogun a pass for being japan centered oh and the load times the load times man they are horrible having said that the game looks feels and plays right and it s really fun just really hindered by some weird business decisions in my opinion and some other flaws here and there maybe get it for cheap but i wouldn t spend full price
