2018 although i enjoy this game i dont recommend it for one reason its monetization everything in this game is designed to make you pay not once not once a month but constantly 12 a month for premium account is too much especialy when you need to spend more money if you want premium ships to retrain your captain to redistribute captains skill points camouflages etc if this game was buy2play or like 5 sub only without all the cancerous f2p crap it would be nobrainer but as it is its not worth it the only positive thing about the f2p design is that its possible to play for free but very very grindy and tedious
