actually love the game but man do these developers seem dedicated to terrible updates and patches every single new patch adds literally nothing but a handful of minor fixes addresses none of the glaring game mechanics design issues that have been noted and complained about forever and breaks every single mod it s honestly astonishing to me the modding community is incredibly talented and comes out with fantastic qol mods huge sweeping insanely detailed complete overhauls or minor tweaks that developers seem incapable of doing themselves but every single update somehow breaks the code for this game causing every single modder to either constantly be on their toes and dedicate a good chunk of this life to keeping up with the erratic update cycle of this game or they quite understandably just walk away and leave their mods exclusively for those who set their game version to a previous version this games developers don t actually make any meaningful changes ever the last big update was adding weather and a temporary status effect after a battle this game only survives past 20 hours of playtime due to the modding community and the developers seem hellbent on screwing them over constantly in order to make a facade of caring about this game to the developers start actually making the game have more depth and more interesting content rather than releasing mod breaking fixes for years on end thanks
