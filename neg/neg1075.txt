2016 great shooting game horrible rpg the voice acting murdered and defiled the witty dialogue and keeps you almost permanently locked with 3 ways to say yes and a 4th option to say nah i ll do that later there is very very little variation between quests they re almost all railroaded from point a to point b with very little options if you want this game to be enjoyable for more than just a shoot em up set in fallout you ll have to mod it out the ass
