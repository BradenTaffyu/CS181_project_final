2016 fallout 4 is more streamlined than any other fall out game it s basically gone from being an rpg to being single player call of duty that is to say the story aspect of it which made fallout new vegas and fallout 3 so great isn t there in the slightest the sim s city feature of the game is a joke all it really does is waste some of your time so you feel like there is more content in the game before you ultimately realize it s not worth your time beyond making a single outpost which is just for your player home the combat is a bit better which i do appreciate but this is honestly the only good thing about this game i played so many hours of this because i love the previous fallouts and i just wanted this to be great and i was always looking for a different way to try to play this game to improve it and i couldn t the base game is the problem the makers of the game also got lazy so many quests and npc s are basically just copied and pasted every quest is usually go to this place kill a bunch of people and then grab something or turn something on they would have thought this means there is more content and interesting gameplay hours but when your doing the same thing over and over again it is the opposite of fun i would not recommend this game even for somebody with far too much free time the only thing this game is good for is wasting time i won t be buying any dlc for this or the next fallout game probably not even the next elder scrolls game if bethesda keeps on with this streamlining this act of trying to appeal to a larger audience and make more money for their producers while ultimately alienating their loyal fans who played previous installments of their franchises
