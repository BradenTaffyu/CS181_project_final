2022 i played this game i liked it too but motion twin inflated the price for it in argentina and turkey all thanks to cheapskates abusing regional prices and valve for failing to prevent it while dead cells itself is a genuinely fun and engaging game i cannot ignore the fact that removing regional prices will simply hurt those of us unfortunate enough to live in countries ridden by taxes i m from argentina and i completely want to support indie developers but the fact mt felt forced to do this to avoid losses proves that steam as a platform needs to take action
