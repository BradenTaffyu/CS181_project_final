2022 i bought bannerlord back at the start of the pandemic because it looked like good fun though unpolished 2 years later it still is poorly executed and seemingly unfinished sequels ideally improve upon the successes of the franchise such as the leap in quality from the original mount and blade to warband this game fails to iterate and improve upon mount and blade warband something clearly went very wrong with development i d recommend playing warband instead and buy this game when heavily discounted or heavily updated to bring it to a complete state i would clarify that this game is still fun but if you have played warband you won t find anything here particularly impressive or interesting if you re new to the series you will likely still find this game more enjoyable than not
