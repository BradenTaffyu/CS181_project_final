2017 early access review i m so conflicted on how to rate this game on one hand it s my highest play time game by several hundred hours it s a good game but on the other hand i am eternally frustrated with the devs and their inability to move out of first gear every update is long and arduous since mp dropped there has been literally no significant updates in 12 months just bug fixes and screenshots of cows there was a blog post where they outlined their roadmap for npcs to be implemented and in that year they haven t even got past the polishing phase of the current build here s the roadmap this should give you a feel for how long you ll be waiting between build updates for this reason i feel the review has to stay negative i hate how slow the game has been updated i understand they re an indie dev but when mp landed they made a fortune there s really no excuse to continue moving at this pace i can t suggest this game to anyone that wants more than it currently offers because they will be waiting literal decades for them to be added and it s funny because you will find the community particularly on reddit are supportive of the devs taking their sweet ass time but i put this down to 90 of the player base joining when mp landed in dec 2021 it s easy to say be patient when you ve only been waiting 1 year some of us have been waiting since the original tutorial landed in 2011 give it another few years delays and broken promises and i wonder if that will change the bannerlord crowd have started to slam the devs inability to push out updates since their early release and i imagine the same will happen here edit it s jan 2023 that means this game has been in early access for nearly 12 years something to think about
