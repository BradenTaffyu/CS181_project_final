2017 early access review prior to the last few months i would have highly recommended this game and had highly recommended it to all my friends i have purchased eight copies of the game and have gotten countless people to purchase the game i run a large minecraft community and converted many of them to playing on my 7d2d server i am heavily invested in this game and as stated heavily support the developers the fun pimps until recent events 7d2d does its builds in large patches rather than many small patches due to many of the updates requiring players to restart their maps it is currently on its alpha build 15 about to enter alpha build 16 prior to getting into why exactly i would avoid purchasing this game let me give an honest review of the game and why exactly i had previously loved this game i am massive fan of the theorizing zombie apocalypse scenarios this game allows you to live out many of those day dreams in that the entire world is breakable and buildable if you are familiar with the ideas behind minecraft then 7 days to die will instantly feel very similar there is something very special about finding a house out in the woods and fortifying the windows and sitting on the toilet all night praying that a zombie out in the darkness doesn t detect you for an open world sandbox game the amount of magical moments that just send electricity racing down your spine is really something commendable as with all early access games it isn t without its flaws zombie pathfinding is horribly buggy furthermore once you reach a certain level of game knowledge cheesing it becomes very easy and zombies become nothing more than an annoyance that threatens to damage your base every 7 days the last comment i ll make on the actual content of the game can be both seen as negative and positive base building can be obscenely grindy and can become a massive time sink if you got plenty of extra time and you want something to occupy you then its perfect however if you don t want basebuilding to become a full time job then smacking rocks for hours can be extremely dull for recent events that has led my overall opinion to shift from positive to negative the current build of a15 2 has been out for 4 months and a15 itself came out over 8 months ago 7 days to die initially launched on steam early access in 2013 after a successful kick starter campaign in which they raised over 500 000 more than double the amount they asked for in the kickstarter they said they expected the game to be done by may 2014 well here we are in 2017 4 years in steam early access things take time and the argument can be made that they drastically underestimated time needed and we should be thankful that they supported the game this long etc problem is that haven t met their many of their kickstarter promised goals i am now of the opinion that they intend to keep this game in early access for as long as people are still buying the game and when the revenue stream dries up the project will be abandoned never to be finished to get into the current drama and issues as previously stated it has been over 8 months since a content update to the game and several stated release times have come and gone it is expected for newest content patch alpha 16 to be going live sometime soon the issue becomes apparent in that the fun pimps decided that rather than realizing oh hey we really dropped the ball in releasing this in a timely fashion lets get this out to our supporters asap instead they elect to try and turn this into some kind of marketing scheme releasing the update early to streamers to try and promote the game by generating hype naturally this received a lot of negative feedback from the community rather than realize mistake many were banned from the forums furthermore the lead dev goes out of his way to insult the community saying that they haven t done anything to deserve access and that you have to earn access to early access the game is pretty fun in its current alpha15 i simple cannot recommend anyone purchasing this game and financially rewarding such poor behavior from the fun pimps
