2016 too little too many missing points too many badly thought out features do not buy yet and wait for at least the next three patches and possibly some dlcs ui is lackluster badly designed forces to repeat too many actions lacks even basic functionalities of other pdx games like separate all units of a class or a searchable database of discovered planets ai is completely idiotic will never try complex manouvers like splitting their fleets in multiple points or attacking more sectors just attacks head on or sometimes sits in a system for ages while their empire is methodically destroyed not that they mind since it cheats on resources there are no winning condition except conquest mid late game are extremely boring trade espionage are non existant diplomacy is a mess worse than all other pdx games game lacks internal consistency
