2020 early access review after quite some hours of playtime since the release of early access i finally write a review because the development direction steps taken and things said by tw so far show that those points are not only ea problems but resemble the general direction of the game bad design decisions throughout the game unlogical troop recruitment battle map got deleted so you have even less tactical possibilities every faction plays the same city and village management is superficial and boring missing soul no recognizable society or culture no depth although that might improve soon which probably means in some years possibilities are not really more numerous than in warband characters often look the same ridiculously bad battle ai spearmen don t use spears and you can t even order them to do so horsemen don t hit every battle looks the same and is over after 5min troops don t use their shields as long as you don t order shield wall which just means lift your shields battles still as superficial as before no spear brace no working shield wall not many battle orders even less then ever before battle map removed no skirmishing no volley orders no order which weapon to use political correctness vassals and everyone else except the normal soldiers appear to have a 50 50 quota making the game even less credible and the cultures even more look and feel the same this game is meant to resemble medieval cultures obviously and the events before warband where a female vassal was a rare exception so this is obviously a political decision and not one in favour of the actual game world smithing doesn t really bring much is implemented boringly affords to wait after several crafted weapons no armour without any reasonthe whole game shows that taleworlds just wants to have as many buyers as possible making the game as arcadey as the standard ubisoft or bethesda title running after modern political ideas instead of creating a consistent credible world stuffing it with cities and vassals but leaving out every place or event that would give the world some depth there is no real customizability there is even only a handful of banner colors the game is much more linear than warband was except the clan gameplay which actually is a cool idea nothing really has improved besides some quality of life improvements not worth the title mount blade ii if you look at the many positive reviews you will see that many of them haven t played the game much and probably even haven t played the predecessor bannerlord is loved solely because it is the only one of its kind not because it is a well implemented game many people brag about it being in early access insulting every critic as stupid but all those things are far from being mere ea problems like bugs or performance issues they are core topics of a sandbox game and especially m b where you see how little thought they have put into it and keep in mind this has taken 8 years instead of fixing easy to fix things and wrong decisions they do multiplayer stuff or introduce dozens of new female lords and that is how it will continue edit bugged quests are declared as intended behaviour couldn t turn in a quest because of a bad reputation without reason there was no possibility to hand it in otherwise neither to improve your relations this is bull and just shows how stupid the whole game design is
