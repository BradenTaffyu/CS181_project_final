2023 honestly the game itself is great but it s playground games that s made me do this imagine spending 100 on the premium edition and not even getting all car dlc s while you re supposed to be getting all of them this game is going downhill real quick people are putting negative reviews on the dlc s itself that aren t included for the owners of the premium edition but honestly this deserves a negative review on the game itself because it requires attention in general if you want to buy this game please don t buy the premium edition you ll get scammed
