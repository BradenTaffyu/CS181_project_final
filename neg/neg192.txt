2017 it s a good game i enjoy playing it what i don t enjoy are the bi hourly crashes and out of the box rendering problems this game is an utter technical embarrasment that has more problems with it than anything bethesda ever out i would be ashamed to put out a product of this quality for 80 these issues are terminal it will never be patched
