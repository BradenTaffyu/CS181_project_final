2023 i d rate this neutral if i could but having to pick between good and bad i gotta pick the latter i m afraid pro the world hogwarts is awesome hogsmeade is nice the rest is serviceable combat is better than expected music visuals voiceacting atmosphere in hogsmeade hogwarts anyway cons all the copy pasted open world garbage it s all so basic and identical that i don t think you could even simplify it further cairn dungeons is the phrase they use to describe a tunnel of 200m length with a chest at the end they copy pasted the very same cairn dungeon about 150 times spoiler the tunnel has right left turn don t get lost combat falls entirely flat towards the 2nd half same enemies no customization and the stat system shows it s flaws troll 3 levels above you will 1 2 shot you which is fine but a troll 5 levels below you can t even touch you there s about 10 enemies in this game total and that s being generous goblins dark mages trolls spiders these 4 cover 99 of enemies you ll fight performance is still fairly poor it runs okay ish on higher end hardware but nothing more and on this point the promised day 1 patch came 1 week after pre launch and did little to nothing difficulty i played on hard and was a breeze i understand this isn t a souls game but there s difficulties for the casuals where is the difficulty for people who like a challenge controls are kinda clunky both on controller and m kb consumable wheel especially bunch of minor bugs but mostly non consequential the only notable one for me unfinishable sidequest biscuit you spend way too little time in hogwarts and the game encourages quicktravel and following the map blindly way too much accessibility settings aren t well thought out i wanted to play without minimap and assistances to stop myself from mindlessly going from one world objective to the other but there s not even a compass without the minimap hogsmeade more like alohomeade seriously there s nothing here other than shops and about 50 alohomora puzzles doesn t matter at all what house you play this would ve been better as a regular rpg focusing on hogwarts and its immediate surroundings with a regular character experiencing hogwarts first time instead of all these grandiose plots but its warner bros so of course you re some random 5th year who just so happens to be the best wizard of all time excelling at everything the moment you touch it oh and your magic is special too of course no one else has it and of course you re the hero too no choices on that matter no dark path
