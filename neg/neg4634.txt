2022 borderline unplayable it was a dumpster fire on launch but i gave it time for fixes and new content to be added around two or three years i don t know if it s a recent update but it now crashes almost every 5 10 turns the time i did get was pretty unimpressive play some of the older versions the graphics and gameplay is honestly a lot better there s sort of an odd mobile game cartoon style they ran with it s pretty unfortunate
