2015 total freedom that was the premise of past fallout games quests which can be done countless different ways fallout 4 falls drastically short in this category because of the streamlined path you have to now follow the dialogs are heavily simplified without the need or option to dig deep or follow different avenues of action there are a few parts in the game where you are able to choose between two options going forward but those are few and mostly reduced to yes or no i like the improvements made to gameplay interface and graphics but without the feeling of a dynamic world which reacts to your actions theres something important missing in a fallout game settlements you visit feel like islands with no connection to each other what so ever
