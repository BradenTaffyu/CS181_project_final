2023 wow i actually have high hopes coming into this game having played the first and a number of other prominent modern crpgs where do i even start armor system funnels you to playing a certain way to really optimize shredding them especially on higher difficulties i d rather they remove them in future games and use the old fortitude reflex will saves to counter over cc ing rather than use this system tactician mode numbers bloat enemies have way too high of damage and armor values to not cheese the game in some specific way else that mob would just teleport to you and 1 2 shot you within the first round what do you do cheese them in such a way that i d argue to be closer to cheating also source points being limited means nothing when you can set up a teleport waypoint near them for infinite refill but it s extremely tedious to do should ve gone with limited use per combat or something i feel dirty being this italian unequal exp distribution for quest choices most of the time combat path would net a higher exp than diplomatic or better yet do other path with higher exp then killing the quest associated npcs for the combat exp makes certain rp choices way less beneficial than the other as going psycho on everyone after you re done with them is the best exp resources farming method over reliance on gear level hate finding legendary unique items only for it to be total trash because a higher level normal weapon have such exponential base scaling it makes using underlevelled legendary uniques extremely gimped also gearing for good gear involves scrounging for town npc everytime you level up rather than being rewarded in some difficult quest encounter most of the time i ll probably mod it a little to make it bearable and finish it but i m extremely disappointed with how out of whack the balancing is i understand any game would have some cheesing at higher difficulty but this is too much i feel dirty with each combat encounter i find myself wishing i was replaying pf wrath of the righteous a great number of times
