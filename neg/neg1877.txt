2023 let me try to find a perfect metaphor for playing this game playing warthunder is about as fun and enjoyable as hammering rusty nails into your kneecaps but slowly and the nails are made of angry killer bees broken glass and acid for people who enjoy this game and want more i can recommend a few other activities cutting your fingers off with a spoon pushing barbed wire through your nostrils setting yourself on fire while swimming in angry ants overall i think existance in this day and age is suffering enough without adding fuel to the fire that is warthunder but there s no alternative for people who enjoy tanks just none so i have to get my fix through more suffering and pain yay
