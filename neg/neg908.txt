2017 was not a huge fan of this game from the start it takes everything that was great about the fallout universe and dumbs it down to the extreme you no longer even know what your character is going to say due to their shortened dialogue because you just had to voice act it add to that the fact that everything feels unoptimized as all hell and not to mention limited to consoles then you want to sell mods to us again really call it whatever you want mini dlc mini expansions wtf ever hell i wouldn t even consider these stupid skin mods actual mods to begin with what a rip off add to the insult and include horse armor for nearly 5 and you wonder why you look like jerkoffs 3 10 bethesda mod selling services at it again
