2017 if you re interested in this game you should instead get civilization 5 with the dlc when it goes on sale or continue to play whatever version of civilization you have been playing if you re not a fan of going tall like civ 5 favored i would suggest going back to civ 3 or civ 4 for more wide friendly gameplay this game is honestly disappointing as it is now given maybe two more years and several more dlc packs i could see it becoming a decent game to sink hundreds of hours into without heavy modification the current game is just unplayable and as a final very minor thing i hate the art style
