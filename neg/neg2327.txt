2016 i badly wanted to like this game and i really like scs and understand they are a small company with lmited resoucers but i just can t ignore the problems this game has nothing really new compared to ets2 the exaclty same ui is hard to ignore the performance seems optimized but that s it nothing new was introduced still terrible a i shimmering effect on fences poles anything vertical the a i is still the same terrible one from ets2 no open window feature despite many requests over the years no smoke on trucks something umbelivable since 18ws had smokes 10 years ago i get it that the scale had to be smaller than ets2 as u s is really big but as pointed out for many us players they went too far on a 1 34 scale a lot of stuff feels off and everything is rushed jesus christ what is going on with the fine costs was forced to disable it was really not a good idea to launch a game with such a small scale with only 2 states in the end the feeling that ats should be at maximum an ets2 expansion is really strong and despite it costing a lower price on us they didn t customized the cost for other countries so it s costing close to full aaa games in many stores it just doesn t worth it
