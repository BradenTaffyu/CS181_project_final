2021 i am almost 60 years old and from the day s of my amstrad 64 all the way to my new gaming computer this is the game i always wanted but and it is a big but the battle mode is a place for better players to bash there way through the co op mode leaving players like me who are not that good to sit on the side lines the random mode is even worse as i am always sunk within the first couple of mins and don t get me started on torps unlimited torp reloads on ships is stupid it is the only game i have ever played that leaves me feeling depressed a great idea of a game ruined by the game play
