2018 i can not say i can recommend this to a fan of the series it is a good shooter with rpg elements no doubt much better than many others but to me it is a bad bethesda game the world is great to look at the visuals can be interesting but this game can only make me think vast as an ocean shallow as a puddle the gunplay is great i actually perfer the more stern and ridgid gunplay of this to a shooter like cod but that s not what i want from this company or this game the story failed the quests failed the towns failed the rpg elements failed i have a lot of hours in this game a third was most likely me just sighing and leaving my computer leaving the game paused after an hour of playing the game my eyes glassed over and i played with a smile not because i liked this game but because i wanted to love it i just can t and it hurts to admit it i played this game for ten hours hoping i would reach a point that would magically make me fall in love but it never came the remaining 200 hours i actually played were just me playing because it was fallout and i wanted it to be good i wanted everything bgs made to be good though now i can honestly say i would not have played this game if it weren t from bethesda the world while pretty is just something to look at as you kill and loot there are stories in small places but very few grab me the majority are so uninteresting that exploring for the stories is just a waste of time because the few really good scenes just can t make up for the rest the interaction of any location is go here shoot this the towns or let s be honest town in fallout 4 was interesting and i loved the design even as tame as it felt the rest of the towns are hollow save for a few quest givers though all towns are practically nothing more than a place to build a base and quickly forget there is in all honesty two towns though good neighbor is a hardly a street corner that tries to be another hub though you mostly run though for three things then most likely never again one of the best companions in the game the best quest in the game and just to rush through the main story you can decide which companion i mean but that leads me to the characters there are not any actual character you can connect with aside from faction leaders and your companions both feel shallow and under developed you get about three to four interactions with each companion meeting them them becoming your friend them asking for help the end of their arc did you enjoy that good because thats the entent you get with them after this they repeat comments or tell you how great you are as they carry all your things there is one moment i felt like the characters in this game were something to be impressed with in nick s office he piper and you all talk in a group about what to do about going off to kill the man who shot your spouse and nabbed your elderly son they both tell you that you don t have to do this alone offer you sympathy then their help it was truely the only moment in the game that felt human though i loved curie i didn t have much time or interaction to bond with any of them except for nick who is my personal favorite character even before the massive expansion he go in far harbor sadly he is the only character of this game that shines the quests have devolved so much it s really sad and i want to meet the person who designed the last voyage of the uss constitution and shake their hand and apologize for them quickly being shoved back into their box this was the only quest in this large rpg that had anything to do with stats yes their are speech checks but f5 f9 retry amirite the rpg elements of this game are disgustingly absent i can t describe how much the scrapping of character stats hurt this game in favor of this awful perk system i hate it it s not so much building who your character is as much as what weapon do i want to customize and how hard do i want it to hit no matter how much you say getting rank 4 in the hacking perk tree instead of the lock picking tree for role playing reasons you are always a military vet or a lawyer with some weird hobbies the voice acting has been beaten to death all i can say is ditto aside from the uss constitution there is no reason for you to look for quests the factions have maybe three interesting quests each aside from that i hope you like going to rolls dice back street apparel and killing squints at level chart raiders there is very little reason to do any more effort to look for a quest other than walk within a mile of preston once an hour or god forbid unlock his radio station or you can go look at the bounty board in diamond city want to be a bounty hunter too bad the quests here are rolling the dice for places you haven t been and saying go there and kill your reward is the chest at the end you would have gotten if you didn t read this anyways seriously adding picking up like 50 caps from the mayor or the jail i ve never been in except once would have really done some good edit i wrote this last part before e3 i ve been sitting on this for a while and needed to get it off my chest after seeing the teaser for vault 76 i plan to leave behind any negative feelings and look forward to it with optomism i truely feel bethesda is a good developer and can not only acknowledge their mistakes but learn from them
