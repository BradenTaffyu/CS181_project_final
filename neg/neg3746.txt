2019 early access review first of all i have played this game since it first came out in alpha i eagerly followed the dev blog and became part of the commenting horde demanding more content patch after patch some minor new content some tweaks of old but few bug fixes a full rework of random gen new biomes smoother terrain and an xp system that rewarded different play styles i recently came back to see what had changed what had been fixed hit boxes are now worse than ever before melee range is sketchy still zombie spawns are still a joke clear a house to have 4 zombies spawn next to behind and above you in a closet death perma debuff rendering skill points spent on health and stamina futile the skill system rework is poor at best xp is best earned through grinding zombies as nothing else is comparable for the xp value 1 strike to a tree 10xp 1 zombie kill 500 800xp the stealth system is once again broken even with a low value of under 10 zombies will still begin to rip walls down to get to you day or night even when stood still from the end of the day hours npc traders are dull their missions are dull they hardly qualify as an npc a vending machine could do the same job npc s do not defend their outposts the outposts are just impervious to damage spawns happen close to the outposts and they just dumbly clang at the indestructible walls zombies can now smash walls down with little to no effort making it pointless to build anything and that players will just gravitate towards structures with the thickest stilts and move on when the damage is significant land claim blocks they prevent zombie spawns and are so cheap they are now the fastest way to clear buildings place block walk out of its radius walk back and there will either be few or no zombies then there are the devs and ownership of the rights to 7 days to die telltale own the rights after the fun pimps ran into cash flow issues people are now trying to petition telltale to give the rights back to the fun pimps who made boat loads of cash from 7days and a tidy sum for selling the rights all said and done this game had potential 5 6 years ago it has none of that potential remaining devs who no longer own the rights to their game and bugs that are almost as old as the game do not invest unless you can look past these issues if you can pick it up horribly cheap then its a fun multiplayer game with friends for a short time
