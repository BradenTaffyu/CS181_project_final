2022 offline single player needs to be addressed i ve been playing over 300 hours all solo and this is the first i ve tried playing away from an internet connection sad to say that the devs won t be transparent about why we can t play single offline it doesn t matter that the artists intended for this to be a co op game saying a game is single player without allowing for offline play is dishonest
