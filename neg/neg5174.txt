2017 good game but many strange design choices and bugs make playing a chore if you have not bought it you should wait a while and get it a bit cheaper to me the worst offenders are the chaos warriors that spawn an insane amount of stacks all over the map and only attack the player by the time you have eliminated one wave the next will be on your shores thereby preventing you from doing anything else the new hability mechanic is popular with some people but i preferred the old one the ai seems to ignore penaltys and so will make silly lore breaking choices like take over all the mountain holds i like to play for the story and this new mechanic makes that hard
