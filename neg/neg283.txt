six months later barely anything has changed about the game i think you could count the updates we ve had on one hand too they re gonna spend the next few months doing qol patches so come back in a year or two if you re looking for an actual game if it doesn t reach end of service by then another overkill flop forget pre ordering this ain t even worth post ordering
