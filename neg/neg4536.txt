2020 pleasant enough as a city builder no challenge at all due to moronic ai also insane dlc prices and nasty cash grab business model giving up this game as i ve tried numerous ways to create a challenge for myself against the brain dead ai but its always a forgone conclusion even when the ai gets super cheating buffs which the developer calls difficulty levels the ai is incomprehensibly dumb no strategy required at all to win the grand daddy of strategy games just build march directly toward the enemy it won t even try to fight will buy civ 7 if they completely re write the ai otherwise so long civ s 1 4 thanks for the memories update over a year later and there have been many updates so i thought i d re install and check if the ai has improved no it hasn t i just finished a game where i attacked all ai players right from the start not a single counter attack not one nada zilch zip ai may as well not exist there have been many new dlc packs released for sale since i last played it s clear the marketing cancer plaguing gaming these days has taken hold of firaxis too
