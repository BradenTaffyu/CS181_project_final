2018 a lot of bad things have been written about this game here sadly they are all true garbage ai bad pacing less unit types than in previous games and so much other crap yeah they re trying to appeal to a broader audience you could probably call it a try hard at this point changing stuff to reinvent the game is one thing but here it seems like people made the decisions that never even played the f ing game imagine some paid creative dude looking at civ 5 and saying i know what this game needs more micromanaging so you have to move every single builder manually genius and so immersive what do you say you think it s not entertaining to move 20 builders every turn when you have a lot of cities well f you you want a building queue f you again you want an in game screen that isn t cluttered with mostly useless information while making you search for the few things you really need to know f you very much the list goes on and on sure you can mod the game to an extent but that shouldn t be necessary for such basic things it s just bad design all over the place speaking of bad design what s with the comic look of the game itself we re not talking frank miller here more like some bad disney rip off you love it or hate it personally it gives me eye cancer another thing are in game options for single player in civ 4 you could easily adjust what you want to see show my moves normal and full fight animations but speed that crap up for the ai no chance of that here you either skip all or nothing why i actually enjoy seeing my units move and fight but i can t say the same for 8 other ai players plus city states this pumps the turn time up to a ridiculous degree if you skip all fight and movement animations that s faster but sure feels dull for my taste dlc policy is a kick in the nuts for the consumer too the whole ages and influence stuff was just cut out of the main game to be sold separately later their mentality is so bad they re risking going full ea on us at this point like the whole red shell thing they spy on you in a full price game get called out on it and are like no no we re totally not stealing your data and even if we are what s it to you everybody does it so the suits said we should do it too so f you stupid customer they took it out by now but it leaves a sour taste one last thing multiplayer is terrible when you play with strangers there is no safeguard system for quitters and people who go full in the chat the host can kick players as he sees fit but that s it so sometimes you will be kicked because you play too good or because the host feels like it so basicly in most games you will be with 4 players or less in under 50 turns the quitters can enter a new game right away without problems there is no ranking or consequences whatsoever i hate that but i can t blame those noobs too much if you make it that easy to abuse the mechanics of the game then you shouldn t wonder when people take advantage of it bad design again in conclusion if you like civ and you have a few real life friends who feel the same get the game mod the crap out of it and play private with them that can actually be fun if all of you can get the game to work that is there s a 50 50 chance there will be some kind of problem for at least one of you you can work around that but it takes time buy the game and the dlc on sale for under ten bucks for all of it you might actually get happy with it otherwise stay the f away from it
