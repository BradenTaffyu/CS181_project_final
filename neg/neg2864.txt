2021 i strongly suspect the changes in management direction prior to nemesis were part of brain drain being made to other projects as stellaris aged in its lifespan ultimately what i suspect is the b team now on stellaris made sweeping heavy handed balance changes to the game mechanics coinciding with nemesis which were ultimately about addressing processing bottlenecks experienced by a subset of users this is not unlike smashing the wineglasses you re mailing your friend for his birthday so they will fit in the box you happen to have the game runs better in the late game at the expense of no longer being fun from a strategic perspective as a result stellaris now utilizes an impressive 0 of my cpu because i no longer run it rubber band mechanics tamp down on economic success in ways that could not feel more artificial which is devastating to the experience of playing a game that is now chiefly dependent on an immersive narrative to be memorable this game had its day today there are better strategy games and there are better narrative games i can no longer recommend stellaris
