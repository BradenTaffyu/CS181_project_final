2018 early access review change for change s sake is not a good thing graphics update good thing everything else not a good thing a16 worked balance was ok skills worked and the game felt unique a17 doesn t work encumberance limited storage space pick one guns guns everywhere no challenge or feeling of acomplishment when you get a gun the modifer system why the change it feels like fallout 76 without robots so if you are one of the 4 people who like fo 76 get this game for the rest of us not recommended
