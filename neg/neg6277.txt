2023 early access review i initially really liked marvel snap but the game has been going noticeably downhill as of late why it s essentially pay to win some seasons when cards like silver surfer or zabu dominate then after you ve paid marvel nerfs the card in the next season some of the store packages are wildly overpriced the progression to getting new cards after you get to a high enough level is frustrating random and ensures you will lose to players who were lucky enough to get she hulk aero magneto etc before you matchmaking is awful and you find yourself often playing bots that have no idea what they re doing or much higher level players with cards from pools you haven t even gotten to yet the game can be fun and addicting but it s more frustrating than anything
