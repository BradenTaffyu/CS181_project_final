2016 in start when i first started playing i liked this it felt a good breath of fresh air after being able to dig in and see especially post patches this game just falls on so many fronts despite that it has some good things pro catagories good graphicsgood musicgood animationsgood sound designgood religious designgood diplomacy interface outside of a few issues con s stupid ai even post patch horrible ui game seeks to hide information almost from you at times no penalties for going tall and wide and stupidly easy to do so war solves almost every problem so many ways to bleed folks offensively and defensively ai feels stale and uninteresting diplomacy with the ai is never worth it what it will agree to in weakness is suicidally stupid or demand equally so difficulty again just gives the ai free units not stronger design i wanted to hope this would be good i love civ i ve countless hours in 1 5 and loved them but this design just hurts it maybe just maybe they can salvage it in a dlc but i don t have hope they will avoid until its under 25 maybe might be worth it then
