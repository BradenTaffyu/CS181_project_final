2023 lacks any semblance of a standalone title its more akin to a dlc for a previous title than a full blown game there have been very few updates or tweaks made to the games emberassingly boring battle styles the unit roster is by far the smallest and least diverse of any title to date and the lack of more than 2 ambitions gives the game a coin flip campaign style where the player can strive for only one of two endings i would only recommend this game after all future planned dlc and updates have been rolled out and even then it d depend on the state of game play at that time
