2013 update 07 05 2014 so i decided to re install the game after my initial review about five months ago and about 8 months after release and what do you know i can finally play it from not even being able to play on the lowest graphic settings to being able to max everything out god knows why it took this long i still can t reccommend the game however as the ai is still pretty pathetic and i still feel as if i have wasted my money but at least i can play now pre ordered this game couldn t wait to play it useually i don t jump on the whole whaa my game doesn t work properly this is awful band wagon but 3 months in and i still can t even play it it s been on sale before it s even been fixed which makes me really feel like i ve wasted my money if you ask me this is worse than the sim city launch at least they sorted that out in a week and the blood and gore dlc are you serious that s on par with the horse armour of oblivion call me a whiny whatever i ve waited patiently for them to get this game playable for me but with no avail avoid this garbage unless you know for sure it will run on your set up
