2023 after playing this miracle for 500 hours i can state the following at the beginning the game is addictive and it s even nice to play at low ranks but only after you get a rank of 4 does world class begin after receiving it the progress seems to stop this not the game makes you spend several hours playing it so that you pump out a modification of equipment and not a new one the economy is complete garbage if you have an m4a1 crew then according to some logic they must learn to ride the m4a4 again and a lot of money is spent on this the cost of technology also wants to be better anyone who wants to play anything about tanks play anything but this low ranks are the only thing in this game that could be left and everything else is cut
