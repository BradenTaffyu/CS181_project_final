2018 the game is mediocre bad with the traditional total war problems and them some poor ai glitches poor balance decisions and laggy graphics on even high end machines however the community has been willing to overlook this mostly because they are die hard historical armchair generals me included however ca decided to make a political stand with their game by telling the community to shove it while they proselytized to them i play games to relax not to get lectured on american politics negative review and i suggest you buy stellaris or europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2 instead they offer great gameplay and won t lecture you
