2019 early access review if you are tired of woke politics in your vidya then you need to do the right thing and give this a hard pass aside from that this game has giant pacing and balance issues and encourages you to grind harder than you would in your typical mmo as you pick up everything that isn t nailed down and go back and forth to a trader to sell all of your junk it s tedious and results in spending more time walking back and forth than you actually spend fighting also they are always breaking the saves so enjoy losing that successful character that never died because he is no longer compatible with the new version which did nothing more than add some weird flavor text to some random items
