2018 game developers are once again abandoning their main fan base it happened to dice ea it will most likely happen to creative assembly if they choose to go in the same direction with their games i love the total war genre and one of the main reasons is my interest for history being able to jump into a historical scenario where you accurately can change the course of the era is a great concept once you leave the accuracy of the historical headline it does not really feel the same anymore the games can never be 100 accurate in the first place but if you aim towards a particularly precise goal it is certainly helpful
