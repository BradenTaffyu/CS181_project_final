2021 early access review i wanna start off by saying i really enjoy this game and i ve been playing the hell out of it for the past week at the time of writing i bought the game on launch and honestly i was pretty unimpressed and decided i d wait a while then come back to see how things were going with that out of the way here s some of my thoughts on where it s at right now i cannot recommend anyone to buy this game in good conscious unless you genuinely don t care about value for money the game is still m b if you loved warband you will enjoy this game the problem is that there s nothing at all beneath the surface gameplay the choices you make and the people you befriend or make enemies of simply do not matter at all the game outside of combat feels extremely lifeless every npc says the same 2 or 3 lines your dialogue choices don t actually matter either companions have less depth than warband and spouses might as well just be your acquaintance that occasionally carries your child towns and villages are absolutely dead as well taverns are especially funny with musicians consistently playing invisible lutes and maidens pouring ale until the end of time don t get me wrong the gameplay is obviously the major selling point but at 50 i was hoping for a world that s at least more interactive than warband s not somehow less the ai is incredibly easy to manipulate and often quite stupid you can stop any siege in it s tracks by starting a siege on something of theirs close by there s almost no semblance of actual strategy for your allies or enemies in battles as well 99 of large battles have one or both sides forming an infantry circle around their archers and letting the cavalry fight among themselves you haven t experienced true hell until you get knocked out in the arena and all that s left is two horse archers circling each other for 20 minutes missing every single arrow until they finally have to pull out their swords that s not to say the combat isn t fun but it s certainly not polished at all my final reason for not recommending this game comes when you look at the patch notes it s all crash fixes there s some new singleplayer content some future plans that s all well and good but scroll through all the patch notes and 90 of them are fixing crashes that seemingly occur for every interaction in the game i m not implying they shouldn t be fixing crashes but rather pointing out a worrying trend this game has been in development hell since it s announcement and i doubt it s coming out of early access any time soon i want to see this title and tw reach their full potential so badly but i m also a realist this game still has years to go before i d wager i ll be able to proudly proclaim this product is worth 50 usd tax i will be ecstatic the day i can come back to this review and update it but for now it s a no from me
