2017 good game ruined by greed and poor coding the graphics engine runs like total garbage even on very high end machines its only saving grace was extensive mod support but they are busily putting nails in that particular coffin as we speak the mods availible on the creation club are very poor compared to the free mods on nexus i recreated several of the crappy re texture mods 1 00 a piece in less than 15 minutes even if they do manage to put some decent content on there the mod devs get so little of that money that its a real insult to their talents the modding community has corrected all of the glaring flaws and bug in this game and made those fixes free of charge for anyone to download now zenimax bethesda wants to make money for terrible mods they did not even create adding even more pain to this is the 2gb of useless garbage they put on my ssd to support this travesty modding has been bethesdas bread and butter for so long its really hard to see what they were thinking with this patch i did notice that the tos have not changed and the previous tos for modding gives permissions to use and modify any and all assets provided by a strict reading of that tos its sounds like its leagal to mod these assets in yourself as long as you dont sell those mods go to it
