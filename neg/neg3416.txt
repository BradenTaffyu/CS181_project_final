i have been trying to enjoy this game for a while coming back update after update hoping that the developers will have fixed some of the core gamplay issues but whenever some seem to be fixed more just pop up i am tired of waiting for this game to be playable it isn t dlc s i have payed for are being delayed and delayed and i am tired of supporting such an incompetent studio i don t recommend this game because ultimately not once during my significant playtime had i ever thought that this borderline unfinished game has justified its pricetag i am extremely frustrated with collosal order for continuing to promise to make the game more fleshed out understandable and enjoyable
