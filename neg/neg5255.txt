2016 more than 200hrs on record yep i love this game the vanilla game is good its my first tw game even if you re not a warhammer fan it s epic fun with mods tw w becomes great new units new factions new balance you can personalise your own gaming experience so why i do not recommend this game yeah dlcs f ing overpriced dlc seriously 20 for one race without a full roster and don t forget there is already two more games announced i can t image the full game price i was mad by the chaos dlc day one at the lauch of the game i hate this kind of methods but ok we could have it for free i was mad by the blood gore dlc 3 for a graphical option but i took it cause i love this game remember the call of beastmen is the last straw which breaks the camel s back so buy the vanilla game enchance it with mods wait for steam discounts
