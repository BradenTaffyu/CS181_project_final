2020 maybe i m not someone who s played this game thousands of hours but i ve played over a long period of time beginning in 2014 then in 2017 and now in 2020 i ve always ended up uninstalling it due to sheer frustration and an almost complete lack of fun not only do i have to play an awful lot just to be able to buy the vehicles i m fond of or like the most but then i m bashed by this game s horrible economy spending hours and hours where the most i get is to enjoy about 10 seconds of a 15 minutes match from penetration to the game literally completely breaking on me flashing particles over my screen when they shouldn t flashing vegetation in and out or simple stuff like enemy tanks being literally invisible until the game decides i should see them that sometimes being when they are 10 meters in front of me in an open field with no cover and about to shoot even if the game wasn t broken bug wise i ve come to a point where the game literally offers no fun to me and now i only use it to play with friends who can t afford other games i don t think i will uninstall it this time for that reason but seeing this game progress over so many years has been a really bad experience for me
