2023 early access review after playing the game for 20 hours i can say this game is not worth the purchase even on sale despite the game being almost a decade old as this point the fact still remains the devs are not implementing changes that actually improve the game experiencing the lack of user interface the inconsistent movement combat system and the fact you can die from random sickness with no interface warnings infuriates me when i see the devs attempting to bring animals into the game when important features are already missing broken overall this could be a game worth purchasing if you enjoy frustration and wasting your time on broken game mechanics but after almost 10 years and still very little improvement to the game play experience it is not worth waiting another 10 years for them to potentially fix issues
