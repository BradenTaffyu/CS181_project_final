2020 early access review having played over 100 hours in the closed tests and now playing the ea version of this this game is an absolutely huge let down the combat is absolutely painful and just not enjoyable at all even after digging around in the files for over an hour mp is unplayable as it refuses to log in i m far from the only one with that issue too 8 years ago we all heard the fantastic news of the announcement of bannerlord today we are greeted with this absolute mess of a game eight years and this is it do not buy this game in its current state thousands of forum posts threads and discussions seemed to have been ignored by the developers who knows if those in charge of management armagan actually give a damn about making a good game but it seems like the devs who actually care are bound even after almost a year of closed testing feedback this is simply the biggest let down of a game i have ever witnessed
