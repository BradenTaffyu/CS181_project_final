2017 not a bad game in itself just a terrible fallout game it doesn t feel like fallout to me it just bears the name i mean it s playable and i ve played it alot but if i d known back then what i know now then i would ve probably just watched a lets play to get the game s story and save myself both the money and the disappointment i had high hopes for fallout 4 coming from playing fallout 3 for hundreds of hours outside of steam but they changed what is fallout to me and probably many others so i really hope that obsidian gets to make an entry to the series in the new engine like their masterpiece that is new vegas i m not angry just disappointed
