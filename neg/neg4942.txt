2021 there are many good features to tw3k the graphics are nice the concept is interesting though the three kingdoms period is over represented in western game media and i would have liked to see the warring states period of the east zhou dynasty represented instead the factions their techs and their units are meaningfully varied and present different strategies for different playthroughs the general game play mechanics all work well unfortunately i wouldn t recommend that anyone buy this game the reason is that the developers have abandoned it and have announced that there will be no updates even though several annoying bugs still exist i m only on my second playthrough and already i have found two major bugs specifically yellow turban characters don t spawn in the late game and one of the nanman tech trees is impossible to research to completion the presence of these bugs makes the game unintentionally challenging in the sense that you must fight against the game s mechanics in addition to the other factions that isn t fun after searching online for solutions to these problems i found that these were bugs that were reported to the devs long ago acknowledged by the devs but never corrected so the game is functionally unfinished and never will be selling and abandoning an unfinished game like this is irresponsible and shouldn t be rewarded by the general public throwing their money into this
