2019 fun game but do not buy on pc install a community mod that kinda fixes the pc version if you still do so having to re do a 20 minute side scrolling mission 4 times and having your save corrupted half way done is not fun otherwise one and done game play on hard if you will commit to doing side missions to gather enough chips to customize your build important story parts too or play on medium if you want to breeze through the main story play this on console note the new yorha edition probably won t be ported well either and idk if the community mod will help with the newer edition 4 years later they are finally fixing the pc port lol
