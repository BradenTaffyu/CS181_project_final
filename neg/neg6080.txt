2017 the game is ok but there is a dissconnect between the game devs and the community that is not healing what do i mean by this what i mean is that the community wants a complete and stable game that works the devs release games that are hollow when it comes to many things and then over time revamp them in order to earn a bit more profit the dlc whoring has really gotten out of hand recently as of right now for the full game all dlcs it is about 240 that is insane paradox needs to change the way it does things and fast
