2017 first the good many of the gameplay mechanics are an improvement over 5 districts combat amenities lots of good ideas which make the game more engaging then 5 some things are liveable the ai is still dumb as all get out the interface is terrible they have only been making the games for 25 years how we end up with the same terrible interface agin and again is beyond me fortunatly those can be fixed somewhat with mods the biggest problem though is the game just crashes all the time at seemingly random itervals sometimes to desktop sometimes bluescreen this wouldn t be so bad if the load times were sensible but to wait 2 3 minutes for it to crash again in 10 is just too painful
