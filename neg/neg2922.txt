2018 i loved this game when it was released i felt i had finally found a spiritual successor to master of orion unfortunately paradox seems hell bent on forcing everyone to play the game in a specific way if you think you like this game now just wait a 6 or 7 months they ll change it i ve never seen a developer actually remove content from a game before i feel i should be able to get a refund on the basis that this isn t the same game i bought at all i ve reverted my game to v 1 9 1 i will never buy another paradox product
