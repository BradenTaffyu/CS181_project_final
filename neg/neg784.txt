2018 this is less of a review and more of just rambling thoughts on the game my like hate relationship is hard to describe on the one hand i do enjoy just around building things or pretending to role play a survivalist farmer i say pretend because the ever present have you seen my son constantly hangs over you and the gun play is miles ahead of what it was in fallout 3 as are the companions which actually have personalities unlike the glorified pack mules of 3 buuuuut every time i find myself started to enjoy the game or get into it a game breaking bug or a creation club update stops me dead in my tracks they got the time to charge 8 bucks for blue power armor paint which i could do for free in 3 minutes but not fix game breaking bugs and optimization issues that have been in there since it came out also on creation club as with every bethsoft game you need mods to fix the problems like bugs and dumbass design choices in order to enjoy the game at least for me buuuut a lot of those mods require f4se fallout 4 script extender and every single time they add some new crap to the cc it breaks not only f4se but every single mod that uses it this is a massive pain in the ass because while the f4se team tend to update f4se pretty fast other mods take weeks if not months to be updated in fact as of the writing of this a mod i use had only just been updated when a new cc update came out breaking it all over again it s really annoying made even more so because creation club is something nobody wanted or really asked for as well as the fact that it just keeps slowly eating away at your hdd and on the game itself it s a typical post morrowind story anti climatic story wise the game is a void with no depth the wasteland can be fun to explore but the lack of interesting towns and people makes it get old quick the lack of interesting towns can probably come back to the underwhelming settlement system while i love the idea in execution it didn t really come out all that great even though this is probably what i spend the most time doing when playing i hate this game yet i keep coming back i like it more then 3 which is a game i really hated but it s no where near as good as new vegas bethesda needed to step up and out do obsidian with 4 and they didn t as well the likely willful lack of understanding of fallout s themes and satire is painfully obvious on bethesda s part like the pre war us was a fascist dictatorship by the time of the great war yet that s almost completely ignoredthe main reason i m giving fallout 4 a thumbs down is the creation club microtransactions in a single player game is a terrible precedent and makes me worried for tes6 and fallout 5 the lack of depth and interesting story the lackluster settlement system the lack of role playing capabilities and the bugs bethesda having broken and buggy games isn t cute or quirky it s bad development and laziness but creation club is the big deal breaker for me i would have not bought it had i known this would be a problem however there are redeeming qualities that you can find some enjoyment out of the gun play is better then ever weapon customization is nice the companions are largely great and well written the environmental storytelling is good in places and despite bethsoft s efforts there is a thriving modding community i would say grab it on sale for cheap and are ready to mod the hell out of it otherwise just skip it i hope fallout 5 is better but with the way bethesda is going i m not holding my breath
