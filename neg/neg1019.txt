2017 again the introduction of paid mods is a scary precedent yet bethesda seem to be unable to understand this is not what their customers want i for myself was willing to wait before i judge as i hoped they would actually use the creation club to introduce large scale original mods that greatly add to the base game s content however the ones i ve seen so far are low effort sometimes already exist on free modding platforms and are obviously nothing but a petty attempt at introducing a microtransaction system into the game fallout is my favorite game series but the decisions made by bethesda have made it impossible for me to justify a pre oder of the next installment of the series this does not only apply to the creative club but also the base game and the dlcs i m simply losing trust in the series becoming nothing but a streamlined experience lacking in substance i myself won t stand for this neither should you and whilst i assume reviews won t change bethesda s mind the wallet of you the customer can
