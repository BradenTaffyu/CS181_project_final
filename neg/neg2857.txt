2018 it is clear after two years that paradox is not willing to fix the core features that are still in a very bad state i am talking about the ai that is not even able to sustain itself even with a huge bonus let alone be any kind of a threat the sectors a huge part of the game not working properly the really tedious micromanagement the very shallow diplomacy the fact there is only one victory condition destroy other empires conquer x planets and a lot of other things they will rather keep making useless dlcs even though their game is still buggy from last patch i don t usually write negative reviews or reviews at all but as it seems they delete any posts on the official forum that calls them out for this practice i felt compelled to make an exception go get another 4x game out there that is not going to cost you 150 and that is made by people that actually care about their players
