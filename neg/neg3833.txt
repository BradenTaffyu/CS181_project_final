2018 early access review i wasn t going to make a negative review but then the devolopers deleted my comment on their update page when i voiced my displease this game is a wreck right now and it always has been it rarely recieves updates we just got one today for the first time in an entire year an its absolute garbage all it is an graphics overhaul a rework of the skill tree and new zombie ai that should of been in a long time ago this team spent an entire year making this update that really did nothing to the game except make it pointlessly harder a carrying capicity was added for some reason leveling up became much harder and zombies became bulletproof on a normal setting whenever you get close to death a wack graphic appears making it impossible to see what you are doing oh yeah and its super laggy even on lowest settings
