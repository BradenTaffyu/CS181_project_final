2018 as a huge fan of the original tw rome and someone invested in the history of western antiquity i had extremely high hopes for this title unfortunatley it never attained them i have no idea what they were thinking with this game why ca sega launched it in such a broken state and how they managed to design it so fundamentally flawed when you have something that works is critically aclaimed and adored by fans you don t tear it down and start over you build on the successful foundation over the years and updates i ve come back time and again to see if i could get into it and see if the game was redeemable it has never been able to grip me like the original it s watered down confusing and takes liberty with fundamental history for contemporary political considerations some of the most engaging aspects of tw titles like the family tree were absent on launch added years later and feel tacked on province management is a mess so is military management and recuritment with the general system i believe the world is full of players like me who wanted rome ii to be the tw rome experience enhanced and evolved it s telling that rome 2 is one of tw s best selling titles if not the best while also being one of its worst rated it s a tragedy
