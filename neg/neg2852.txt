2017 stellaris is a great game but unfortunately is made by paradox interactive which means that even though it has a good idea and decent execution half the content that should be in the game will be cut out and sold to you as dlc if you want to see what stellaris could potentially end up being take a look at crusader king 2 s current dlc list the dlc is good but it s still more money you have to pay the base game in my opinion is not worth playing without dlc the free updates have really helped this game however at first the game was literally half done the first 2 3 hours of each game was amazing and the end was climactic but the middle was just putting the game on 3 times speed and occasionally clicking the research tab while everything plays itself it slowly has begun to pace itself better and better but to get an actually fun and engaging mildly because things are still missing experience you need to be ready to put down another additional 30 dollars which will likely turn into 50 100 over the course of this game s lifespan the game even adds feature creep with each dlc that seems halfassed for example hiveminds are a playable race that pretty much remove half of the mechanics of the game with nothing really added to compensate you might say that this is a good tutorial kind of race to play then but a their playstyle is sort of unorthodox because of these removed things so you re not actually learning to play the game properly and b it s a dlc perk so if this statement is true you re essentially paying 20 dollars for a tutorial sure you can get gene modding as a hivemind and start doing interesting things other races can t but usually this happens so late in the game you ve already eliminated pretty much every other race so it s pretty much pointless the perk trees end up adding some depth in utopia but they aren t really fixing or paving over half baked ideas just adding new sort of less half baked ideas on top of everything this isn t a review of the dlc though but i thought i should put those out there as examples the main problems with the base game are combat and diplomacy the trade system used to be terrible now it s just kind of bad it s pretty standard for other 4x games but it could be a lot better you just jostle things around until the ai finally accepts through you manipulating the fact that it s a computer the combat seems very well designed with a good rock paper scissors style battle system but in reality you can just spam corvettes with kinetic weapons this is due to the fact that upkeep is based on the cost of the vehicle so even if you go way over fleet capacity you can just keep churning them out and overwhelm any opponent the ai is also faulty you can just split up your fleets and spin them around the enemy and they ll switch targets so much you ll half your expected casualties now look paradox games are usually not really about perfect gameplay and combat more about roleplay and having fun situations but the problem is that the roleplay isn t very deep in this game it feels like no matter what you re going for in each different game you end up getting funneled into the same path not only this but some playstyles are so bad due to the mechanics of the game that you can t even have fun playing scenarios with them i try to get into roleplaying my faction but it always ends up being the same old crap and abusing the ai to stop them from immediately infringing on my territory with twice the power i could have possibly gotten due to random tech i recommend this game but not for the price of the game all the dlc this review is mostly criticism but these are just the things i wanted to bring up it s very well polished very addicting and has some absolutely brilliant ideas it s just a shame that it feels gutted without paying additional money to add more gutted content maybe sometime down the road a bunch of dlc will finally fix everything and way later after that the entire pack will be sold for 50 dollars but until then i can only really offer a ho hum recommendation edit i forgot to mention something that annoys me the most about this game the balance between tall vs wide if you re new to 4x essentially tall means you have few cities planets etc that are absolutely massive in production science and wide means almost all of your cities are crap but you just keep churning them out and take over neighbours so it ends up evening out tall is absolutely useless in this game in other 4x games there is a bonus to going tall in civ you get a culture and science bonus compared to other civs etc tall gets bonuses in stellaris but at the very end of the game by the time you get megacities or ring worlds the game s fate has already been decided and likely you re going to lose you have such a disadvantage at the start of the game and it s not made up for by the amount you gain at the end i hate playing wide because there s a lot of micromanagement and i m not really a warmonger so it s really bothersome that my favourite playstyle just lets me get run over by other civs
