2023 i honestly want to give this a good review because i love stellaris i ve played it for years single and multiplayer so you can trust me when i say that the full game is good but that s just it the full game is locked behind all of the dlc purchases on top of paying for the base game even with all of the content calculated for its most effective discount price you re paying so much that its just not worth it paradox is a great studio but there s just something wrong with how much they fleece the people that have supported them through the years
