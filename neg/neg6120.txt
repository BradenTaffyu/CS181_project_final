2021 ui hotkeys and controls in general are an absolute disaster fundamental features like a command panel waypoints or remapping keys are either barely functional or not implemented at all it feels like relic got pushed to release the game or just stopped giving a i m not saying the game is bad per se it s mediocre in a lot of areas and the music sound for example is great if you want to give it a try i d recommend getting the 1 1 month trial of the xbox game pass but 60 for a game that s essentially still in development is a joke 2023 update bought the game for 20 in sale and while it has improved a lot basic stuff like a key bind for all religious units is still missing if aoe4 would ve been like this at launch it would ve been great but all things considered this game just feels like a huge waste of potential
