2022 i have played some games for 1000 hours whether in steam or other platforms have clocked yu gi oh duel links past 1300 hours mark as of this writing have played old ygo games in various ps consoles watched the anime collect some cards am a fan so 75 hours in i have to ask myself am i having fun in master duel the answer is no because most of 75 hours i kid you not is spent on waiting for the other player to finish their turns there will be time i will be hitting my head on the keyword waiting for my turn no joke honest feedback i have spent while waiting for my turns to actually play master duel have completed watching hours long videos afk gone to the toilet with no rush knowing it would still not be my turn when i come back made myself and finish eating sandwiches while waiting not playing swept the floor and did general house chores did some general excerises and so on 75 hours in which is enough time to complete a meaty jrpg game i ve reflected most of the time in the game have been spent waiting for my turns to actually play the game and the reason why i cannot recommend master duel to be fair master duel off the bat it offers a layered card game with thousands of easily accessible cards you can with effort build yourself competitive even fun decks just by playing and being rewarded for playing so props to the devs but in terms of game design game flow when i as a player am spending most of my time in the game waiting for my turns to actually play the game i cannot recommend even if i am a fan of the ip too much waiting unfortunately this is baked into the cake in terms of game flow when playing master duel
