updated 4th august 2024 the very core of this game is great the art style masks music are excellent level design is great on some missions very odd on others but it lacks the absolute basics that need to exist in a game like this and were already existing in the previous entries of the series the management and production leadership of the company along with the game direction just ignores what needs to be addressed to fix the game doesn t listen to what the community wants and seems compelled to just focus on driving the game very slowly further into the ground no ability to kick players in game either by host kick or vote kick no in game voice chat no server browser for example 11 base heists x 4 difficulties x 6 regions 264 server queues that you have to hope enough people are in the same queue as you and this doesn t account for the dlc heists no text chat visible by console users keep on adding skills but not additional skill points forcing an imbalance for character progression two very lack luster dlc heists not terrible not great minimal replay ability heists lack rng elements like previous games the ui makes no logical sense unless you flip it portrait and then it makes more like this game was originally designed for mobile for example if you are in mask editor and are in colour selector mode the description overlays above the mask stopping you from viewing the mask completely and seeing how it actually looks the content is not the problem it s everything surrounding in that is just inadequately non existent or broken on launch and we re now 11 months after launch and only with two major content major patches and we re supposed to have another two major ones before end of september somehow and yet still some basic features don t exist or just are straight up broken just go buy crime boss instead at this stage it s not perfect either but at least it s more fun
