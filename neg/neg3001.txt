2018 so this game just went to 2 0 and wow i am unimpressed with a few things some of which have never been done right some of which have been freshly made bad let s start with the obvious look at the dlc list for this game unless you get them all on steam sale at sharply reduced prices you are paying for the game three times three times that s ludicrous now the game systems so stellaris played a certain way from day 1 it changed bit by bit and many mods were added to change it in certain ways as of 2 0 the ai can start plopping star bases down to give them territory next to your capitol planet in the previous system your colonized systems exerted influence over neighboring systems that prevented this which was a good thing boo hiss etc bad change is bad how about picking my starting hyper travel option gone hyperlanes for everyone the most boring and restrictive option is now the only starting option which feeds back to the point about system influence with that gone the ai can just zoom by making poor infrastructure choices that would penalize a player in order to land grab spots on the hyper network this is made possible because ai gets free resources without planning or structure boo hiss bad choice diplomacy started out weird and got weirder the system is basically bribe the ai over and over very patiently the number of idiotic space religions that automatically hate any materialistic society off the bat with no timeframe is ludicrous and here s the thing ai is willing to have a starting opinion of your species with almost no contact but if you want to change that massive deficit into something remotely positive lots of bribes lots of pointless trade deals that don t benefit you at all it resembles relationship building only if your idea of a relationship is buying someone a bunch of stuff in the hopes that they will later put out which tells you things about the programmers of this game not good things don t buy this unless you want to buy it three times to get the content that makes it whole don t buy this unless you want a worse version of the diplomacy from sid meiers alpha centauri don t buy this unless you want the devs to drastically change systems that work at random junctures mucking up some of the better elements of the game for some reason you probably can t fathom
