2023 big edit after playing logging about 46 hours on the game most of which was waiting to join a stupid lobby what game does that makes you look for a multiplayer lobby just to play solo with bots i still stand firm of the whole this online only they are peddling towards us the game itself is a great and fun experience when it works massive improvement from payday 2 its got fun stealth good gun play even though loud can be slightly a chore every now and then armor system is kinda weird and dumb but overall i dig the game but with that all being said it still has a lot of glaring issues not gaining xp for solo stealthing heists on overkill due to the stupid challenge xp requirements is dumbfounded to me i also feel like the armor system could be looked at a little bit being that if you don t run a few certain skills you re just in higher levels and of course the always online crap if you re interested in this game just be warned that there are still a lot of huge issues that s why i recommend waiting till a sale comes around and picking it up then instead of wasting your money on another unfinished anti consumer product
