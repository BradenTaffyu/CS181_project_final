2022 the potential that this game could ve achieved but never did is what makes me write my first ever bad review sure i got my money back given the hours i ve spent paying it but looking back those were hours spent searching for a game that is simply not there main quest line has no soul and does nothing to improve the rpg part or making a good purpose for a cause i found myself avoiding the main quest line just so i can play more of the early mid game because as soon as you declare yourself every army plus their mother is going to come down on you or the faction you are part of and your ai allies are a bunch of saltless crackers and the crappy implemented settlement management comes into place so you are basically turning the game into a boring attrition sandbox that is painful to keep together and a chore also you assemble the banner and then what nothing you can t even wave it around in battle people don t treat me different doesn t give any bonus etc etc all this in a game called bannerlord what gave me hope and kept pulling me back to play it was the early mid game it is really fun at the start you create your warband you go around bettering your army improving your character there s lots of choice here catching some bandits going to war against similar low tier factions doing stuff for other houses or making money by pledging your warband to a lords cause for a fee joining them in battle raiding caravans crushing enemy legions etc this is all fun and games but in order to keep your army going strong and growing big you need money this means steady income unless you want to cheese and make the game even more boring by this point which will at some point obligate you to either fully join a faction or creating your own don t make me go into how soul sucking it is to create your own so you can start owning settlements castles and get that steady income this is where the fun stops and you start having to manage cities politics and your allies which would be fine and an enjoyable part of making a kingdom if if you didn t have to physically go to those settlements just to manage them yes really you can t even delegate this if your allies wouldn t make stupid ai decisions that eventually cause you to lose your settlements or theirs they are like kids given a button to destroy everything you worked for always laughing at how much renown you have to spend just to keep them in check if enemy factions couldn t replenish big armies in a blink of an eye killing army leaders is not a good option either if mechanics were explained at all i have 100 hours into this game and there are still things i am not curious to find out what they do only superficially or why they are not working as expected if killing a lord leader wouldn t make everyone in the world even your allies hate you and yes i m talking about you killing a guy that you are at war with and has just up your entire kingdom if interactions with the ai lords chars were diverse the dialogue is always more or less the same be it your wife your nemesis or the guy who just got his entire family murdered by you if everything wasn t so soulless stale or devoid of meaning that being said battle simulations are really fun there is a lot of variety in terms of troops mechanics equipment mounts and strategies this is where the game excels and does it better than most command of your troops could be done better though it s a pain in the ass specially at the start to find the commands to command your troops there is little in a way none of a tutorial for this either the game just sends you into battle with the enemy army already coming for you time ticking and hopes you can figure it out so yes f1 f3 or f1 f4 since the beginning because you don t have time to try out i bought this on ea years ago or something like that sad to say the game hasn t changed much since then with the updates main campaign is still boring there are still annoying bugs and many promised feature missing all in all a big disappointment made bigger because there s not only a good base game here but also because it could be so much more why ultimately obligate me to play a certain way when the map is so big and everything is in place to create different experiences ps kudus for the modders whom i m sure will make me keep playing this game for years to come to think the workshop was at some time discarded as a feature by taleworlds sad
