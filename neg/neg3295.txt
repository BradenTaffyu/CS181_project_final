2017 i have to say i love this game the graphics are amazing and the game is great i have yet to play more than 10 hours of this game in vanilla most of my time is with mods and i still use mods when i want a vanilla feel i rarely buy dlc in the first place and if i do it s because it s during one of steam s sales i like the mechanics that have been put out wait one moment is there a feature called license production or something like that is it in a dlc wait one moment again i remember it was in the base game for hoi iii the precursor it came as a regular feature and hoi iii and all the dlc was around 10 bucks if you have a computer that can play hoi iii still do it it s curve is harder and steeper but it s easier it can be more hands on or even on auto pilot but that s the best part i love strategy games i do i love hearts of iron it s probably my favorite game i almost have 300 hours into and will continue to play it but i have to play with mods it s the only reason why i play the game new mods with different ideas and stuff is it sad i m missing out on things that would spice the game up hell yea i want to be germany and equip my men with the m1 garand and use the p 51 in the skies with my bf 109 it bumps everything up into a more life like quality but if they expect me to pay any sort of price for a feature that was included in the game before as a standard feature that s ridiculous i hate how games are half assed now and as you can see so are a lot of people if paradox wants to keep us happy and loyal start including dlc content in patches or start giving away the dlc for free drops mic if i m wrong about the license production feature in hoi iii lemme know
