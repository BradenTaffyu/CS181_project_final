2018 as someone who s spent almost 400 hours on this game and will very likely spend much more in this it s disheartening that i have to make this review civ 6 has a lot of problems it has some cool features too but many many problems first the good since this list will be shorter 1 the district and wonder mechanics are the shining beacon of this game and sadly the only beacon of this game while it s odd at times and can be confusing for people new to 6 properly utilizing districts can have amazing returns especially if you use mods that make the gameplay actually remotely viable omnibus loaded districts quo s etc wonders taking up a tile can hurt but it also provides massive benefits assuming of course you re using mods wondrous wonders quo s etc natural wonders also make a comeback and often provide amazing bonuses themselves dead sea making your scouts immortal against the barbarian horde lol the new mountain allowing units to ignore hills until they get promoted for some reason though many are usually decent at best and some are downright weak districts also helps combat the build a city every 4 tiles in a grid that you see in all of the earlier civs due to taking up tiles on their own cities need more tiles to be able to remain self sufficient getting good cities where each of your districts have several yield points means spreading your districts out unless you re japan cities take more space than they did in earlier games and compacting your cities now means you re worse off than in the earlier civ games when you could build markets and libraries without issue in your 7 hex 9 square city really the introduction of districts has done a lot for the game and is the single best feature of the game even with the new expansion 2 speaking of the expansion thank god they didn t pull another we re removing a base feature from older games and making you pay a bunch to have it back again golden ages were re introduced but they behave completely different from the same of older games there s loyalty which is the peaceful city grabbing but it doesn t count as re adding base features for a different reason and i ll leave that for later the ages mechanic is actually interesting the dedications are very powerful if you can get a golden age and strategic dark ages can result in steamrolling the enemy especially if you can get a golden age afterwards that said if you re playing on slower games like marathon it ranges from very difficult to nigh impossible to not get a golden age much less get a dark age a problem made worse with 8 ages of pace later in the game but they re working on that and that doesn t effect the middle of the game unless you re an ai of course so another hopeful mechanic and that s it for the positives now for the negatives 1 the ai first off i want to mention what difficulty does in civ games and most games really a higher difficulty means the ai gets benefits and you get disadvantages it does not have any effect on their ability to actually play meaning they will behave the same way in easy as in deity just that if you play in deity you ll never get any wonders because of said ai benefits as such the ai in this game is bad a common issue deals with ai simply not expanding even if they have plenty of room or plenty of resources to go for they just don t sometimes you ll be in the atomic age and finally go to explore that continent you ignored find another civ and they re 3 ages behind you with only a single city i ve had games were 3 civs did this hell i ve had games where i had more cities than everyone else in a 10 player game combined without engaging in any war the ai has plenty of other problems as well sometimes leading to exploits that for a unit to walk back and forth forever without actually attacking you because of how the ai works though i believe they might have fixed this with the expansion they ve had a year and a half to do it after all the mod that would fix the ai can t actually do much because of the lack of tools given to modders 2 speaking of year and a half and mods the devs have been completely and utterly irresponsive to practically everything that actually matters there was no teams when this game came out oh but there s teams now some might say but that doesn t fix the problem teams weren t introduced until the australian summer update neither was any real mod support both of these were supposed to be in the game at launch but weren t and instead delayed to a day 0 patch which inevitably turned into a month 5 patch by then hype had died down and anyone who could have been interested in the game lost interest it went from a game a heard about daily to a game i only remember because i look through my steam list for something to play between burning myself out on other games i honestly have no clue where the slew of news regarding this game gets its it s amazingly popular considering the reviews for this game and its dlc are either mixed or mostly negative but back to the responsiveness or lack thereof the team made absolutely no remark to the public over a fix for teams or modding for months and at one point removed the only evidence they were actually planning on adding it from the code removed the existing teams code as well as the day 0 patch comment which only further served to anger the playerbase that had been waiting for a few months to play the game they pre ordered there are a large number of players who only play teams it wasn t until even later that they actually made an official statement remarking that they knew about teams and were planning on fixing it which seemed more like a remark to the they won t speak comments than an actual promise to release then the australian summer patch came and fixed everything right wrong more bugs were introduced into the game including a frustrating bug that makes playing the game extremely uncomfortable that s still in the game a year later with no comment that s caused by something seemingly completely disconnected if one of your units discovers the edge of the map it causes the game to stop playing sounds for some reason at first it s just one or two actions of a couple units or buttons stop making sounds or longer periods between music changing but eventually all sounds other than ambient wind completely disappear including button clicks cutscene sounds all music and the most annoying part barbarian spawns resulting in the player needing to reload the save in order to fix it for a couple of turns before it breaks again this doesn t get fixed until you research satelites or use the debug command reveal all for people who play on marathon speed and circumnavigate the world in 150 200 turns this means spending the next 3 400 turns without sound or reloading the game of course this isn t the only game ruining bug the game is chock full of them a year and 3 civ packs later and r f comes out and completely borks mods somehow they managed to mess it up so badly that dlc now load after the mods that reference or otherwise rely on causing a return to the title screen the only fix for this is to overwrite core game files overwriting core files is always treated as a last ditch effort by modders in every game but in civ 6 it seems practically necessary to get stuff to work properly with this being the latest affront to modders so far they haven t commented on this at all oh but i sure am glad they re putting all their effort in making their new hidden agendas less sexist sarci don t have enough characters to finish this review so i ll continue it in the comments
