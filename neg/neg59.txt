2021 early access review if you re seeing this review you re likely filtering by negative since the majority of reviews of this game are positive there is a good reason for people s general acceptance of the game since it has a lot going for it on paper it has a huge map to explore and a focus on scavenging crafting and base building that not every zombie game has as you play the default mode you ll learn that the game isn t about fighting waves of zombies pouring through a hallway in a building but more about avoiding attracting the zombie hordes picking off small groups when you can and staying out of sight when you can t that kind of stealth based zombie gameplay may not be for everyone but it is filling its own niche however there are some functional problems with the game that make it more and more frustrating the more you learn how to play in my opinion they make the game very frustrating to play in the long run or when you ve finally gotten your character to live a long time those frustrations are the reason i m giving this game a negative review despite all the unique things it has to offer the first issue is the game camera and interface i have no problem with an isometric view in a game but if you re making one in this day and age then it has to work well the isometric view in zomboid has a few glaring issues one is that you can t see behind buildings to check for zombies or open doors windows because the roof or upper floors of the building block it another similar issue is looking into a building through doors and windows from a distance when you finally create a storage room in your base and fill it with boxes you ll find that if one row of boxes overlaps another it becomes impossible to access the boxes hidden by the camera angle or to move them somewhere else on top of all that there are moments where so many things are stacked on top of a tile that opening the right context menu becomes very buggy such as when doors are near to containers or the like most of these problems would be alleviated by allowing the camera to be rotated 90 degrees but this is not something that seems to be on the development radar at all picture how much more cumbersome a game like rollercoaster tycoon 2 which came out almost 20 years ago would be if you couldn t rotate the camera to see behind objects or get an angle to exactly the object you want more importantly the default settings of this game make it a very hardcore experience i have no trouble that it is a hardcore game but when i die in hardcore games i expect it to be because of a mistake i made and not a mistake the game has made however combat and some parts of the movement in this game are too buggy to be part of a hardcore experience in the default game a bite or even scratch can be fatal for your character i ve started a backstab animation on a zombie only to have it turn around and bite me and then have it stand there with no damage after the animation completes there are times where your character will stop moving or not open close a door with no explanation it s quite common for your character to attack a zombie on the ground after it s already gotten up or vice versa and refuse to attack the zombie on the ground in all these cases it s as if the animations have become desynced with what is happening in the game even though it s a single player experience often they make it feel like your character is dying even though you ve done everything right even after you ve successfully snuck up on a zombie or navigated the perfect escape route that is extremely frustrating when your character is always in a life or permadeath mode the main redeeming factor of this is that the zombie rules are customizable so i eventually started playing with the zombie infection set to non fatal but even then some zombie 1 on 1s just turn into buggy messes that frustrate me to no end the last point of disappointment with the game isn t about how it functions but with one thing that it s really missing i must caution you that the game has no real multiplayer experience at present there is multiplayer available in versions 1 and a half years old or older but since the latest major build of the game the developers have disabled multiplayer in order to fix update test it internally i understand that there may be a need for testing and updating however this is something that was in the game previously and was likely the core source of enjoyment for a part of their playerbase at this rate i would caution against expecting the multiplayer to be in the current version of the game for another year at least so if you re looking for a multiplayer experience in a game like this it probably won t be around any time soon it seems strange that it would have been disabled for so long or have such slow progress since i would expect it to be a top priority for them you ll find a lot of talk about this game s features and it s slow development online but really it is a playable singleplayer game at present and a lot of the features that have taken years are new additions to the mechanics but updating the multiplayer system that was already in the game is a different matter and it seems very strange that it hasn t been done already now one last note is that i really don t play this game with mods there are definitely mods that rebalance the game and add a ton of content to it but i can t speak to them the modding community can t be expected and probably isn t able to fix the issues i ve stated above however and as much as it pains me i can t recommend this game in its current state
