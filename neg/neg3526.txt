2018 edit i put in 120 hours as i m rather silly still very broken i ve put in over 24 hours of gameplay and am genuinely sad to say that my early thumbs up has gone down at the moment i have to say i can t recommend it due to bugs mostly around queues and pathfinding the game seems to get stuck in some odd states and your hospital will go from making lots of money to making huge losses sometimes at such a rate that you can t fix it and you lose hours of progress on a level example i was just playing a level where there was a sudden swing in income i have four gp offices and their queues are empty or near empty yet reception has 30 people waiting receptionist is well trained and has done fine up until now but the game has just decided to stop feeding the gp queues properly i ve also had issues with patients getting stuck and them and the gp are just stuck in an office and effectively taking a gp office out of action i remove the room and the patient still remains sometimes or in the case i just saw i got someone who was quitting but was also feeding into the gp queues i could remove the room to force the patient out but they rejoin another queue i had 2 of my 5 gp offices blocked in this fashion again financial meltodwn there s also just a lot of inefficiency a patient will sit half a room away rather than outside of the required office a member of staff will complain about being thirsty yet won t use the water fountain in the room they re in you can place them in a toilet when they claim they are desperate for the toilet and they ll just wander off elsewhere you can place three changing cubicles in a ward but the patients will just queue for the first one rather tahn use the vacant one right next to it argh this is maddening emergencies will leave you frustrated how can i have two clown clinics with your best staff in them and they fix two out of seven emergencies 25 days to get to the clinic out of 90 day target isn t a great start how does it take 25 days to get to the room then i still can t fathom why the heal rate is so low but as a possible clue and seemingly another bug you can even get to the end of the emergency and you have a clown which claims it s 1st in the queue but if you go to both clown clinics there s no one in the queue this doesn t add up the advisor needs to be taken out the back of the hospital and shot he just keeps on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on repeating the same messages to you over and over again if you don t upgrade a certain machine i had used it twice it didn t warrant upgrading yet then he will punish you until you either delete the room or upgrade it he ll say after 24 hours of gameplay things like did you know plants make things look nicer no s t sherlock he ll be telling you have too many janitors as your plants are dead and litter over the floor increasing prices is totally pointless for two reasons firstly mr advisor will harass you until you drop them but i ve seen a patient take gp service not pay for it then go for the next part of the diagnosis price increases should be a way to throttle demand but this game instead thinks it means free service madness you create wonderful staff rooms and i remember in theme hospital you saw them using and enjoying the rooms but often the staff barely use them missions are not always fun sensible in one you had to upgrade your hospital so i ended up building loads of stuff i didn t need and dumping it in an empty wing this is box ticking rather than truly evolving a hospital there s so much i do like the aesthetics are brilliant and i like how much control you have over the environment the medical issues are fun and some of the treatments are great the clown clinic is amazing the level of control over staff and their training is very well done and plays well to those that like to delve into the detail of a game the trouble is due to the issues i mentioned above the game is broken at the moment i hope that gets fixed with future updates however i m still not sure the game will be as fun as it promises to be i guess i can t tell until it operates properly and some of the mechanics are fixed update shockingly i seem to have played for 50 hours so you can t say i haven t tried but i remain a thumbs down the beta branch patch has fixed some of the issues ive mentioned above mostly about people getting stuck but fundamentally the game isn t fun it s a slog a micormanging slog i love micromanagement when it comes to tinkering and tweaking what i don t like is oh one of the team is once again threatening to quit and if i just put them in the staff room they ll say there s no fun in that or constantly trying to work out if i have 30 people at two receptions when multiple gp offices have zero or one person in their queues or why three nurses and eight beds still can t cure seven patients in a hurry is it perhaps because the nurses are sniffing flowers while patients wave for attention i m not joking so much is arbitrary box ticking just keep on shoving stuff in a room until you hit a certain level put loads of lovely stuff in your staff rom then watch as staff ignore all of it but hey you ticked the box of level 4 i built a brilliant hospital today laid out logically almost everyone was trained every machine was upgraded and i m making lots of money then once again the money plummets almost a swing of 100k a month yet nothing has changed sadly deleted
