2020 early access review wait until april 2021 all the core mechanics are there fun combat party building basic castle management but the majority of decorations and progression on the core mechanics are either broken or not implemented for example multipler player progression skill ability player perks probably 60 are not implemented or are poorly balanced tactics perk to pre deploy your troops in battle does not work at all a lot of actions don t increase skill points eg collecting gold tolls don t increase your rogue skill some skills have poorly balanced progresison ie trying to upgrade your tactics skill takes over 1000 battles where as progressing with two handers may only take 100 battles it s like when you microwave a burrito it s hot and tasty on the surface but when you take a deep bite into it the deep inside is still cold and uncooked so my advice is to wait don t bite the burrito let it cook a little while longer and you will be immensely satisfied
