2023 early access review this game is extremely unfair some people try to frame it as a game is difficult imho if game can make your 20h character permanently unplayable by a threat you have never seen before and was never warned there is no difficulty its just knowledge that devs force you to google the funny thing is there is a number of those enemies so if you like to sink tens of hours of gameplay into character just to be spoiled each time you meet a new one this game just for you i would like to enjoy the game without being forced to google every 2 minutes but its not an option here not just because of enemies that can spoil your char there is no description to the most of the items even if you try them there is a large chance you won t even know what they do same goes for enemies an enemy that permanently draining your stat you would think it should be warned in foe description nope after an hour you just open you stats and wonder why 30 lvls of progress missing so google wiki open em up and even when description is present its unreadable for some reason game chosen weird pattern where commonly used words substituted with synonyms you have never heard before most of the time you don t bother to read because you would need once again to google what half of the words mean forcing player into internet also has a number of negative consequences most likely will end up on reddit where during read of your topic someone will mention game breaking tactic and here it is there is no more reason to play you already know what to do to win i would like to love this game it has a lot of potential and mechanics but after spending 120h it just seems like a big waste of time it seems like all those positive reviews made by people that not really played the game that much as good to bad review ratio is insane considering the problems oh yea and apparently devs are somewhat mentally unstable their twitter is wild if you are into us left drama there is a good bit of fun you can make of their accounts
