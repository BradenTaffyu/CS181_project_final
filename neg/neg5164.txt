2016 total war warhammer is a pretty good game i ve had fun playing it and i keep playing it a bit now and again i ve also bought all the dlc graphics are nice it does capture the warhammer universe pretty well but there are just too many negatives ca are pretty incompetent patches will often render your current game unplayable i lost a 120 turn game between patches when the game patches it clones the entire game this means that on an hdd it can take upwards of an hour and on an ssd you need at least 25gig of free space i paid 25 for the beastment dlc which had pretty much copy and paste ork mechanics lazy lazy gameplay development for an expensive dlc i get huge frame drops whenever there are undead zombies on screen i ve had to find about 8 quality of life mods just to make the game playable and fun speed boosts in friendly territory or you just get kited indefinitely i was so mad when i manoeuvred 2 armies to corner a raiding army and they just off in boats camera mods enemy unit composition mods or they just kite you for days with cavalry archers mods to make heroes more fun just basic things that should have been in the game incredibly lazy game design for dificulty levels harder level ai simply cheats more gold better stats in game increased morale etc they don t play any differently as in they don t employ better tactics ca has literally just buffed their stats unfarily
