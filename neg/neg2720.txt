2016 i was excited after the first few false starts but when the game clicked it suddenly felt really really empty midgame is unsatisfying micromanagement and the endgame is bare the technologies are not interesting and weaponry is a simple rock paper scissors type deal despite the scifi name currently balancing is terrible so there are lots of invincible strategies that break the spirit of the game it lacks enough variety for 4x and unlike their historical games there is no character don t expect political intrigue within or between empires the sectors do nothing similar to activating a governor in old civ all of the aliens have similar behavior behind their flavor text and the same dozen or so events happen all the time for example in a typical game you will unexpectedly discover a gigantic alien carcass about 20 times and when you investigate the result is exactly the same it gets tedious very quickly either this is the skeleton of a future good game or they got it out the door quickly because they lost vision either way the experience is shallow at the moment
