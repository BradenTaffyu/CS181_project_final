2023 as much as i love this game i cannot recommend it and here are a few reasons why lack of content boring quests diplomacy system is a joke economy is unbalanced lots of bugs while sieging ai feels dumb formations doens t feel like formations your soldiers will disorganized in 10 seconds commanding your troops could have a better system mount blade warband still feels better than this shame i understand the challenges the devs had to bring this game to us and for sure the game had some big improvements but honestly it did not feel worthy to wait for this game to come out hope the devs do better in the future
