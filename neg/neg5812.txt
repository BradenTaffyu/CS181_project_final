2014 bugs side the design decisions made to this really ruin what has made this series so great certain changes aim to make certain game systems less complex i imagine this was to attact more people to the franchise but it really ruined the late meta game of the series the biggest stand out from many is how you manage armies you can t manage an army without a general given that you can have a finite amount of generals you are thus stuck with a limited number of armies late game it forces you to lower the amount of stratgies you can use late game in constrast the other entries in the series an unfortunate change which waters down the game the aforementioned change encapsulates whats wrong with the game
