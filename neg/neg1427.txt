2022 review as of release 1 0 1 9th of november 2022 after a few years of early access the game now released and i can just warn you to carefully consider if you really want to buy an unfinished game before i get into the details i want to mention if you read the patch notes you will quickly see they simply re branded the last beta build into a release version without adding anything significant to me this shows they never intended to release the game because it s finished but for some other reasons maybe attention and sales this is so out of touch with the community and the modders who wanted to wait for a finished game before modding it because with constant development mods break and modders have to update the mods and all the dependency an impossible task which quickly leads to many abandoned mod projects but let s get to the state of the game the idea is to put you into a large medieval world where you roam around as mercenary assembling an army and fighting battles because immersive first person medieval battles together with ai simulating every single infantrymen that s the niche mount blade can fill in the gaming world but at some point you may want to enter service at a kingdom and become a lord with your own fief or even found your own kingdom have large scale battles and even city sieges the main quest is designed in such a way to support you conquering the huge campaign map however the idea of free choice remains as for example you can resolve battles only on the campaign map or avoid them completely by trading smithing fighting in the arena or focusing on family and friends and doing quests with the locals sounds great doesn t it the graphics of the game are indeed great and the battles and sieges have a unique and immersive feeling to them but that s basically it at sieges you will realize the ai struggles to correctly group and assault or defend the walls units prioritize the wrong areas and as soon as the gatehouse falls it s basically just a field battle on the open field large scale battles will quickly get out of control if commanded by the ai sometimes fatal decisions were made by commanders of the superior army leading to a defeat so bad you would have wished for auto resolve instead they charge the cavalry head on into a spear wall or put the archers in the front row right when the enemy cavalry comes in the units are sacrificed in the worst possible way yet the battles themselves i would still count to the positive experiences of the game the real frustration starts on the campaign map the main quest must have been written by an intern it s so badly worded you feel like it s a placeholder for something more decent the characters seem to just exist to provide generic quests to you and you quickly loose interest until you get so annoyed by the generic timer quests you wish you never progressed to this part of the story all lords ladies townsfolk and companions in the game have the same few generic lines of mostly unvoiced dialogue rendering concepts of diplomacy family friendship or rivalry obsolete npcs also weirdly distort their faces trying to show emotions the kingdom has a king and vassals who act mostly arbitrary and are always in need to wage war even if it means the downfall of their kingdom they act so inconsistent everything happens at random and the kingdom diplomacy is a mix of bugged and unfinished options if you are in hold of a fief or town the mechanism is also unfinished and boring there is really nothing interesting to gain except some gold for your troops the skill tree is unfinished and mostly a passive grind with useless notables finally you can encounter a variety of bugs for example i got kicked out of my own town while being besieged and this bug is still there as a beta sandbox experience riding around and fighting medium sized battles was definitely fun but the game lacks so many mechanics has bugs and the developer gradually decreased their interest in the community that i just can t recommend it for the full price wait until they either finish the game which may never happen considering the few things they added in the last two years or put it 60 on sale
