2015 early access review i remember when i first started playing this game the first hour of frustration trying to figure it out before it finally clicked and it was suddenly so much fun it was literally my favorite game i remember calling my cousin just to tell him he needs to buy it so we could play together he doesn t even play games i was just so excited i wanted someone to around with on this crazy new game i found it was so fun that was back in a9 or so though and i hate to say it s gone downhill from there while the game improves visually it s honestly damn sexy for a voxel game especially if you get to play it on max the fun just slowly disappears i m not getting bored of it it s just getting not fun crafting is being dumbed down while survival is getting harder the interface has been so simplified that it s become complicated it makes sense if you ve played it and the scavenging foraging has turned into literally nothing more than hold click until the tree rock dirt s healthbar reaches nil which takes absolutely forever on everything now and just makes it feel even more repetitive than it already was i ve tried a few times to play it during a13 and now it s finally reached the point where i just can t i ll try again in a14 but for the time being i can t even reach the point where i can craft a forge literally the point where the game actually starts without giving up out of boredom it s just grinding now except instead of killing zombies you re killing foliage it s much less suspenseful if they can stop trying to complexify and simplify at the same time i think the game s still got a chance but right now the game s developers seem more confused than i do and that s never a good sign
