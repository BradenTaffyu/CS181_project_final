2016 early access review i bought this game some time ago and enjoyed my time with it even though i had trouble running it on my rig at the time recently i decide to reinstall it to see how much it s changed and honestly it s worse than i remember it the optimization is no better than it was a year and a half ago running like hot garbage on my rig which more than meets the recommnded specs the mouse sensitivity is all sorts of messed up no matter what setting it s on some of the textures honestly look worse than whan i originally bought it the new crafting system is needlessly complex the combat is absolutely awful and i just can t recommend this game to anyone looking to buy it for 25 i really miss what the game was a year and a half ago because honestly it s not worth it
