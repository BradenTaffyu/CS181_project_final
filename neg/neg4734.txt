2022 tabletop simulator has by far the largest workshop of games mods to play however if you re looking for a vr tabletop experience i strongly recommend shopping elsewhere first they shoehorned vr into this game back in 2016 and it feels like development in that area has been mostly ignored ever since basic vr ui best practices have not been applied here you won t find things like smooth locomotion or turning moving around the board playspace or even navigating the menus is a chore the controls are so unintuitive that you end up distracted from whatever boardgame you were trying to play because you re too busy fighting the sloppy vr controls so many bugs and it s been six years without even any acknowledgement of them i had to go under the hood with this game to mess with the controller bindings to even get some functionality and it was still such a headache to interact with the only vr experience in it i can actually enjoy is the jigsaw puzzle because that s literally just sitting in one spot while dragging dropping pieces on the board without having to do anything more involved like rolling dice or something good luck to you if you d like to zoom around the board a little to get a different angle or a closer look at a piece it ll be at least a minute of awkward teleporting scaling up and down while trying to just rotate your view etc the only thing tts has going for it over any other titles like tabletop playground etc is the expansive workshop of mods games supplied by the community take that user submitted content away and you ve got a game platform that has been able to rest on its laurels because for a long time they were the only game platform in town as soon as the community discovers other more user friendly platforms with vr support that actually works straight out of the box i wouldn t be surprised to see users abandoning tts tl dr if you re looking for a vr capable supported tabletop genre game this isn t it playing it in vr is like time travelling to 2016 when vr controller support was often bugged broken required heavy lifting from you to implement maybe they ll address the issues some day but they ve made no indication that they will as far as i can tell they haven t even acknowledged anything is broken
