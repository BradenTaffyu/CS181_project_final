2018 early access review no just no don t buy this if you don t have a very good pc i was able to have 80 90fps in alpha 16 with medium settings now in alpha 17 stable i have max 25fps no matter how much i change the settings this is just unacceptable after waiting more than 1 year the main problem of this devs is that they keep changing removing the things that work already very well instead of focus on the real problems of the game
