2022 i hate this game please stop negating every card i play edit i still play this game because it can be fun if you and your opponent aren t playing modern meta so y know like 0 01 of players edit 2 this game at least for casual plebs like me has devolved into either winning turn 1 or 2 or not quitting before your opponent like why would you try to have fun when playing a game right if you are just an old school fan make sure you have a few friends to play with otherwise don t bother
