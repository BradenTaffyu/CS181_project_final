2017 oh ca sega what happened i got this game on sale after most of the glitches and performance issues had been sorted out so i can t speak to that account however i cannot recommend this game my reasoning is ca and sega s attempts to milk their customer base for everything they can get rome 2 is a full priced aaa game seems pretty standard until you realize that the dlc total is more than the actual game seriously cmon devs not only is the pricing sad but the actual content of the dlc is as well the amazing culture packs are just factions that the devs locked away from player access they re in the base game but the player cannot use these factions unless they purchase them creating a game only to take parts of said game out and sell them back as dlc is a disgusting marketing scheme especially when the base game is 60 the game is fun and i ll probably still play when i m in the mood for it but i cannot condone these practices do yourself a favor and buy something like shogun 2 this game isn t up to the total war standard
