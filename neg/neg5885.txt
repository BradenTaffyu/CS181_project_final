early access review it ll be a great game one day but that day is not today there s plenty of fun to be had in this town builder but for me i cannot recommend this product at it s current price point there simply isn t enough game here to justify this steep asking price the current build is quite buggy and feature lacking progression system is fairly broken and key functionality can make the game quite frustrating to play at this early stage the product is no where near ready for purchase it simply shouldn t be sold hopefully the injection of cash from the early access will enable the developer to actually hire someome to turn this product into something ready for consumer purchase given it s current state however i would not expect that to happen in anything less than 2years i will continue to follow the development of the game and revise this recommendation when the game actually presents a value proposition to the consumer
