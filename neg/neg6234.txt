2023 tldr very buggy and unoptimized game is hardlocked due to missing companion quests i m not leaving the space puppy behind you seriously need not only better business practices but better quality assurance the season pass should of been included in pre orders instead of a day 1 you like every other gaming company but i guess that s what you get when you have the corporate brain akin to electronic arts especially if i am paying 50 usd or more while it s a good story it s not worth the hardlock the bugs and the unoptimized i had to go through and it doesn t excuse the greedy practices owlcat exhibits i will eventually come back to this game maybe in a year or two i paid over 100 usd for this game the developers digital deluxe and my name is apparently not in the credits worst off season pass is not included day 1 season pass and now you want even more money on a different bundle a terrible oversight and an extremely scummy move that a season pass was overlooked and or not included when they decide to launch a season pass day 1 of the game release and then release bundle that includes it via steam that s a nice you to your community owlcat when the price point for this game was already anywhere from 50 usd the standard edition to 300 usd the physical collectors edition pre purchase you might want to fix this oversight or your next game wont be doing as good you ve already lost my faith in your company i wonder who else lost faith with your tastic practices do and be better i know you can do it also caligos winterscale screams like a girl when he fights it s really hilarious please don t change this idk if its a bug or not but i can t stop laughing
