2023 as most comments will state the game mechanics are fun and balance is somewhat achieved with rng elements i think completing the series 1 and 2 pool of cards is a fun time even though you are discouraged from playing much as you cannot progress more than earning the available rewards once you get to the series 3 grind and truly understand that every design aspect in this game is geared around the monstrously predatory monetisation you will probably have far less fun i would not recommend for kids and i would not recommend for people with addictive tendencies play casually and expect to take a very long time to unlock cards unless you are willing to pay a lot to speed up progress
