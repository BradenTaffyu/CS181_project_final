2019 the game itself is great but the way they treat their customers is beyond redemption after years not a single patch you cant even play in 1080p fullscreen without third party software and now they release a goty to grab additional money but still refuse to release a single mini patch to fix something what the community has fixed years ago its not rocket science they dont care about the pc community i dont recommend buying from this publisher get the game on console or somewhere else
