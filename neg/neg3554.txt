early access review not a mod friendly dev teamthis game is fun i love the complexity of it thus far however since there were a few bugs and balancing issues i did what any modder would do look into the game files to temporarily fix them myself and share the fix with the rest of the community now as of right now everything is open and in plain text format and easy to edit and look through if you know what to look for but once i started finding errors and easily fixable bugs and started to share them on the discord that s when one of the devs took it personal he and started deleting my posts and said should i consider adding a control that blocks the game when you edit the save file externally this way we could get rid of spoilers wydt first of all its a supermarket sim what spoilers xdsecond doing that would severely cripple and slow down the development of the game as that would cause the community to find bugs a lot slower and imo games last 10x longer when there is open coding safe to say that they won t be adding mod support and don t like their community trying to help them quicken the games development tl drgreat game bad community relations with modders tsk tsk
