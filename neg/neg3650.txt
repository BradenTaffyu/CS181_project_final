2020 early access review here s the deal the last good update was alpha 16 4 after this point they took their difficult survival crafting game and turned it into a runaround shooty looter with no balance there is essentially no hope it will go back to the way it was as at least one of the devs has made comments indicating he regrets the original direction of the game it s sad i appreciated what was essentially a more hardcore and realistic sandbox game
