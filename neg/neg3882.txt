2019 early access review this is so hard type because the game i loved feels dead i am being highly critical because i did not expect this i did not keep up to date on the happenings as we crossed over into 17 so sue me but wtf has happened to this game i dont care about the long load times or the graphic glitches i hope they improve on the zombies because right now their not horrifying their disgusting looking and not in a good way the skill list what in the flying its been dumbed down i guess i loved how big the skill list was before when world of warcraft started to steamline and make stuff easier oh boy bad news almost feels like their going with the flow of other games here and its lost its identity and why does the music now sound more like resident evil now not to say that is bad i hope funpimps has a grand plan i know far as employment goes their struggling so good luck
