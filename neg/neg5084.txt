2016 text got way longer than i wanted it to so here s a tldr really wish there was an average not thumb up or down the game is decent but not worth full price if you want a total war with skelletons and orks you got it but it suffers from some longstanding series issues and some new onces that desperatly need changing as it is i wouldn t buy it again i just finished my first campaign actually its my 3rd campaign as i restarted a few times and feel like this is a good point to give a few thoughts firstoff i like the total war franchise and have played all the games exept the first shogun also i m not a warhammer fan not that i dont like it im just not that much into fantasy and the warhammer franchise is only known to me by games vermintide i didn t get the game at first because to me a historical setting always seemed superior to a fantasy setting but since every magazine website and youtuber praises the game to the sun and back i decided to give it a shot anyway also the nonsymmetrical factions sounded like fun with that said the game starts of rather rocky by not only having an avalanche of dlc but by constantly reminding you of the dlc you dont own just to start a campaign you will have had more than 5 reminders that you are missing content that s just insulting well since i m a boring person and will probably be playing the empire for the majority of the time anyway in all the other total war games i also tend to have 2 3 factions that i keep playing i didn t mind as much so after that i started my the empire campaign and was astonished that a game priding itself on the differences in factions would have me kill my own faction and an almost identical faction for the first hours of the game however since all other total wars also were mostly fighting your own species exept for dogs and the occasional burning pig i went with it i could do without the slight comic touch in the graphics but it s ok not a dealbreakter only about two hours into the game i have conquered quite some land and the thing that has become the most obvious to me is that whoever said the total war campaign ai was improved was lying out of their orkloving buttocks it is as detached from logic as it is otherworldly as ever anyone who ever played a total war game knows the braindead ai and this game is no exeption whatever the fanboys are saying so the lord at the border who is fighting the lords of chaos all by himself decides not to trade with me because reasons guess he doesnt need free money while fighting the personification of satan when i asked him if i can move my troops through his land to at least help him fight the lord of all that is evil he declined appearantly afraid i d take away his chance to die like a champion which of course he did after a bit factions will declare war on you just to sue for peace in the next turn handing you thousands of gold factions that love you and fight besides you dont want to trade or factions that love you and are 1 10 of your strength will not sign a non aggression pact and when at war the faction will send their armies to the end of the world leaving their capital undefended how in the name of the lord is this not something that gets mentioned more often have we gotten so used to the of the total war ai that we dont even mention it anymore anyway the inability of the ai also means that both the ai and the game itself need to cheat like crazy in order to pose a thread now i can live with the ai getting a bit of money even though this means that literally every 1 city minor has an army half the size of my 5 province empire but ok would be boring to only fight mini stacks however the game constantly spawns full stacks of orcs beastmen nordmen or chaoswarriors somewhere on the map to keep you busy in addition every faction declares war on you on a regular basis and sues for peace moments later and public order is almost impossible to control meaning that you are always fighting everywhere i finished the campaign long victory without ever feeling like i m in control of the situation now i get that earlier total wars had the problem that the endgame was too easy but i dont think this is solved in this the endgame was still easy there was no way for me to lose the final approach of chaos was completly destroyed in the first turn of reaching my land as i had horrendous amounts of money and the game lets you recruit about 5 units per province per turn i you not you can literally recruit like 20 30 units a turn but the game got really annoying and frustrating later because the ai would keep burning down settlements just to be killed by me just to magically reappear somewhere where theres no units now the game has a few good new ideas but one thing thats new to this game what previous total war games thankfully didnt have is the ai cheating by movement points and knowing your reach what this means is that armies can run away from your army forever i once spent 20 turns chaseing a chaos army through my land the army always was exactly one step ahead of mine and before the fanboys jump to the rescue yes i had the 10 movementspeed thing and yes i did try to sabotage the army with my witchhunter this is just no fun and it always happens any army that is too weak to take on your army will stay your exact movementrange away from your army if you use multiple armies like i tried the enemy army will use subshniggaraaaah mode and teleport just one meter away from the reach of one of your armies it s the most annoying thing ever actually i lied the most annoying thing is the corruption corruption is a mechanic where once chaos arrives your land gets more and more corrupted which lowers your public order ie more rebellions and has some other minor mali this is the dumbest decicssion ever made it forces the player to prioritize happiness buildings over anything else now exept for province capitals all cities only have 4 slots 1 being the city one being the happiness building and one being the garrison theres only one more slot to work with and probably that slot will make money this means there is no more thinking or tinkering about your cities what i ask is added in terms of fun to the game by this stupid ass mechanic it just means you dont get to build what you want and you keep getting rebellions on higher difficulty level even though you built the happiness building in every city further adding to the annoyance in lategame i ended up spening the absolut majority of the game fighting humans first part of the game rebellions and hordes of beastmen that randomly spawned well this text got longer than i inteded hope it helped
