2020 i played fallout 76 at launch and for several month on the bethesda launcher this game was bad when it first launched it is still as bad now bugs are still the same input lag is still the same quests are still boring world is still boring with fallout 4 bethesda had managed to make a bad fallout but a good game with fallout 76 bethesda just made a bad game just to enumerate the some bugs immortal ennemies crash to desktop sync issues lag input lag to fix a fps exploit the devs locked the game to 60hz and forced vsync on the result is that if you have a monitor that goes any higher the game will force the panel at 60hz creating a whole lot of graphical issues in and out of the game you ll have to manually reset the panel at 120 or 144hz
