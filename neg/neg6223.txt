this game has decent writing that manages to capture the feel of warhammer and gives you most of what you d expect from a good tabletop roleplaying campaign i really want to like it but unfortunately every other aspect is so bad it s aggravating character progression is atrocious every time you level up you re presented with 50 different talents most of them add about 3 to this or that but couple are game changing and you re tasked with finding which ones done with wading through this swamp you ll have to do it 5 more times for other characters then again and again on every level up combat feels fine at first there are guns cover some abilities but then your party grows to 6 characters there are 20 enemies in each fight spread out over a large area it s very tedious and doesn t feel tactical at all everything is solved by argenta doing her thing 5 times a turn one of the problems is that the developers made effort to place enemies in a way that would make sense like putting some snipers on the roof of a distant building without thinking that it would just add an extra 3 rounds of running to hit them all of which makes you regret that you can t just command your troops to clear the way random encounters there is a chance to stumble into one as you warp from system to system and you have to do a lot of it sure there are points that allow you to stabilize routes but you run out of them quickly the first few couple of times is fine but it is just a waste of your time with another pack of 50 zombies that you have to dispatch personally bugs bugs bugs quests bricking ui and animations glitching guns sometimes dealing thousands of times more damage than they re supposed to it s easily the most buggy game i ve ever played and if you think that cyberpunk or some of the troika games were bad you need to adjust your expectations the most annoying thing was that the game would freeze repeatedly for seconds at a time when selecting the target for full auto burst i guess highlighting tiles in a cone was really a non trivial task
