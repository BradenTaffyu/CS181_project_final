2021 early access review disclaimer this review is a brutally honest critique of the game made by a player who has played a lot of both bannerlord and the previous beloved title mount blade warband and who is not blinded by only playing two hours of singleplayer in either game first off the steam reviews suck and don t really give any idea about the game other than hey i ve played a couple hours and it s great or i ve never played anything other than super mario and chivalry and it s really neat the main forums online for bannerlord hold true fans of the series who have thousands of hours in warband and alternatively really many in bannerlord they have a bit of a more similar critical perspective on the game as me don t buy the game it s unfinished unpolished and really overall just not worth 50 by any standards it s a straight up downgrade from the previous title mount blade warband which was released in 2010 that s over 10 years ago it was a beloved cult classic game with an extremely devoted fanbase and modding scene which i was a part of for many years now bannerlord doesn t have any of that while warband was restricted only by the outdated engine and the fact that it was made by a relatively small indie team bannerlord is restricted by absolutely horrible management and greed for that sweet console money they claim that after over 8 years in development it s all because it s not finished the early access was launched over a year ago and absolutely no notable progress has been made only minor patches bug fixes and some features absolutely nobody asked for the community has made a meme of the terrible time management the developer taleworlds has when someone asks when a feature or a simple dev update on a matter is coming many just reply soon this means that in taleworlds time it s at least several months to half a year the gameplay has been made simpler just so they can sell more copies to casual console players which is absolutely disgusting combat has also been made slower and ai dumber on purpose so that tactics don t matter the infantry has been made dumb on purpose so that cavalry charges are more powerful the devs have told that along the lines of it s more fun this way yes if you don t get bored of pressing only two buttons to fight a battle every single time zero tactics involved even if someone tries to tell you otherwise the lifeblood of warband was always the multiplayer communities who would play every day for hours not unusually on multiplayer mods like persistent world crpg mercenaries and full invasion 2 we obviously have none of that in bannerlord the devs told that bannerlord will be even more moddable than warband but still they haven t given the modders custom server files so they can start making the multiplayer mods it seems they might ve been annoyed when a certain member of the modding community managed to make their own custom server it was taken down by the devs there is pretty much no communication about any real roadmap or anything of the sorts by the devs they might release some random minor patch mostly for singleplayer once a couple months they don t care about multiplayer as far as we know there s a couple fellows making it they ve made the multiplayer according to some dumb fantasy about bannerlord being the next cs go or some other matchmaking based competitivee sport there s a major ai exploit in one of the multiplayer modes captain mode which completely defeats the purpose of the mode and can be argued to be complete cheesing of the mechanics in warband on custom servers with a similar custom gamemode to the captain mode of bannerlord there has for a long time been a fix for the abuse still the devs haven t done anything to prevent the ai abuse they have told that soon it ll be fixed i m pretty certain it s been several months already since it was said also there are rumors that taleworlds will begin work on a sci fi space game while their current project is broken plain and outright unfinished just disgusting how they can even think about making a new game when the last one is so unfinished are they just going to call a half made game a finished product and sell it for a full price apparently here are quite the reasons not to buy the game until the devs get their s back together and stop at one point pretending it s a finished game and only polishing it and at the other telling people that it s in early access and not finished yet if it s in early access maybe implement actual big changes and stop messing around with something as small and useless as minor balance changes to weapon stats
