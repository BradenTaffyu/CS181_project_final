i can t recommend this game in the current state it is still chock full of the typical owlcat bugs the devs are simply lousy programmers who have not a clue what they are doing not to mention that acts 3 4 and 5 were rushed and unfinished even though the game is much shorter than the pf games it is still not worth your time not to mention that they say they will finally release their first dlc a full eight months after release which is cut content from the game and which will release a new raft of bugs into the mix this is not a developer i trust and neither should you
