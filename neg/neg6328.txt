2023 still unplayable for me what a shame you wait so long and can t even play it a little fluently with an rtx 3080 in what damn world do we live in it s probably game of the year for me even if i ve hardly been able to enjoy it so far but people should wake up and not always let such damn get away it can t be that every damn aaa game comes out on the market completely unfinished these days which is also a joke you have to pay extra money to be able to play it 3 days earlier only to not be able to play it in the end because the performance is so that i have to ask myself why i spent thousands of dollars in my damn pc if i can t play with it anyway until the performance doesn t improve a big thumbs down from me
