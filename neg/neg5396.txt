2023 a really good game far better than coh2 at launch with insultingly greedy mt and supposedly support model which will only get worse when the new battle groups will come into play expecting a serious expensive pay 2 win problem slow content development focused on crappy skins instead of maps perhaps with most resources moved towards paid expansion development when base game is still somewhat lackluster or unpolished in terms of skirmish maps mod support or features try to crush infantry with a tank rotate an hmg team in a building or watch a replay no mention of extra national va no info on planned battle gropus the pre release bs mentioned frequent content drops with stuff like last tank standing or some other bs like that d be the thing we re looking for in this game devs said they want to offer a good and fair paid vs free content ratio right now that ratio is about 15 1 great and very fair indeed oh and you blocked merit earning with mods which are still keeping many of us in game which is keeping with the trend of apparently trying to kill off bore alienate rest of your playerbase still no bunker for uk too only faction without a bunker and still close combat is about as awkward as your usual dates still no melee fights there s a reason review score plumetted and here i am contributing to voice my displeasure change your damn ways relic and to you fellow gamers of all genders and engine types we gotta stop this madness somewhere as companies and studios more often than not start forgetting what the word micro in term micro transactions means
