2023 been out for a long time and still totally unfinished the campaign still isnt complete its basically a sandbox map with some distractions they call quests they implemented mods support which is good because basic features that should already be a thing have to be added by modders then proceed to release little 400kb updates that dont really do anything but fix 2 or 3 bugs that really arent big deals every couple of weeks that totally break your modlist and you have to spend like 2 hours trying to get it to run without ctding again if your mods even get an update this also dissuades talented modders from even creating mods worth trying overall i wouldnt recommend this until its much much farther in development
