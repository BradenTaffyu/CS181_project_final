2019 this game isn t perfect but it s not terrible either it s just middling and mediocre and forgettable and that s so disappointing after the incredible civilization 5 graphically cartoonish like a mobile game maybe you like it but for me and many others it looks childish and annoying it makes getting deeply invested in the game difficult because you re no longer looking at realistically depicted cities roads and empires you re looking at candy crush ripoff crap there are mods to fix this if you d like but i m not reviewing mods here am i gameplay ai is similar to civilization 5 pretty bad play at higher difficulties for a challenge gameplay is also a lot more unbalanced than in civ 5 due to the increase in units some units are simply better for no apparent reason excellent example horsemen horsemen require horses pikemen traditionally an anti cavalry unit in the medieval age do not medieval era anti cavalry gets utterly obliterated by ancient level cavalry simply because that cavalry requires a strategic resource it feels unbalanced and helps break immersion however i adore the new strategic resource system save for unbalanced units every so often owning critical resources now feels like i m gaining constant benefits as a result i can build as many nukes as my uranium production allows over time allowing me to build a stockpile unlike in civ 5 where i might be limited to one or two at a time also engineers allow you to build roads silos forts etc it sounds small but it really feels like you re building your empire when you construct a cross continental roadway i hate the district system i like it in theory expanding your city and specializing as you go hate it in practice it feels like i m playing settlers of catan in the worst sense it requires extensive micromanaging and requires prior understanding to how the bonuses of each district work if you don t understand those bonuses coming in you are absolutely screwed as a new player as it will affect what wonders you can build how many hammers you re getting whether or not you ll even be able to found a religion and what government policies are available additionally it feels limiting on what each city can do i shouldn t have to decide between a port and a fort when i have the resources and production and time to build both additionally it reduces each city to the sum of its districts nothing more i don t have a city on the coastline that acts as a trading hub this city i build is now just a harbor commercial district and faith district it feels too needlessly gamey and only hurts the gameplay even more and speaking of gamey the way governments are handled is atrocious each government had its own card slots of various flavor as you develop your culture you unlock various cards representing components of your government like slavery or mandatory conscription based on the slots your government provides you slot in these cards and get bonus or drawbacks as intended basically it reduces the difference between fascism and communism to a change of 3 different card slots and a handful of special cards in civ 5 a fascistic nation would experience major changes to diplomatic relations and had an opportunity to develop its government or focus on its culture now the difference is minor at best and rarely impacts gameplay i barely know my own government once i hand in my cards let alone the governments of my allies and that s an issue it s gamey childish and really takes away from the experience mods extensive maybe not as extensive as civ 5 but very extensive if you have a fantasy universe got warcraft lotr etc there s a map for it and probably some factions too best part of this game tbh dlc rise and fall is interesting but also annoying it forces you to prioritize certain decisions in order to push for a golden age rather than naturally rewarding how you re playing the game did you build a faith district and are now the world leader in faith production nope no points developing science at an astronomical pace enjoy 1 bonus point when you research beyond the current era oh but you found a random tribe that gave you 40 gold enjoy your massive boost to your era score it s overall not bad but could ve been so much more rising tide is okay it s an interesting late game concept but the environmental crises throughout the game just aren t that much of a factor also it doesn t change the fact that by late game you empire is an unstoppable juggernaut that you simply micromanage until you can either conquer everyone with guns or religion or win a science culture victory it s just fine not really exceptional like bnw in civ 5 the dlc ultimately improves the game it certainly adds more to do and is interesting without the dlc the game can be really boring at times but the dlc certainly isn t great and only adds more average content to an already middling game overall civ 6 is just okay that s it not great not awful just average multiple dlc s are now out and that fundamental issue still hasn t changed it s tough to get immersed many gameplay changes are more gamey than fun graphically it looks like a mobile game and the ai balance issues always present in civ games are still here the fundamental civ experience remains great and shines through the muck at times in this game and because of that this game is just average 5 10 play civ 5 with dlc for a better civilization experience it ll be cheaper too stick around and watch for new dlc s maybe they can really improve the score edit so some have said that civ vi is great and that i just don t get it yet here s a simple fact civ v has an extremely similar player count compared to civ vi sometimes civ v has more players than civ vi depending on the day civ v was released more than half a decade ago civ vi came out 2 years ago civ vi is not in a good place yet maybe it will be one day but not today
