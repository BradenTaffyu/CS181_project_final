2021 i m posting this as a precautionary review for anyone with a 300hz screen or a 2000 or 3000 series rtx card or the unlucky ones like me who have both this game ran perfectly fine on my old pc 75hz panel and a gtx980m i did have the classic bethesda not so great optimisation and bugs but nothing out of the ordinary for a bethesda game fast forward to 2021 i buy the season pass thinking of giving the dlc a whirl nope black screen with audio on launch after much research i finally find out it s an issue with the game not liking a 300hz display i have a 360hz one now so i find the fix which required modifying the ini file and also capping the framerate to 60 in the nvidia control panel i m good to go now right wrong crash to desktop during the intro sequence great let s find out why turns out you need to turn off weapon debris in the launcher s advanced settings apparently the game doesn t like weapon debris if you have an rtx card seriously bethesda what is this trash the game is 5yrs old not 10 not 15 not 20 i can run stuff that was originally on floppy disk that can properly detect my gpu and run anyway get it at your own peril if you don t mind troubleshooting a game just be aware that if you have current gen pc hardware it s likely not going to let you just play it without tweaking and or installing mods to fix bethesda s glaring incompetence
