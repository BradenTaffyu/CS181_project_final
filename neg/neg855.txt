2017 sorry about my english comment if something is unclear or i missed overlooked intro now i loved fallout 3 it was good rough around the edges but good for its time then we had fallout nv better than 3 because it addressed numerous problems like iron sights factions side quests and karma sigh then there s fallout 4 it s good for the first 30 hours until you realize that there s no depth to it and so many unaddressed problems followers characters let s start with characters none of the characters say anything that makes you care about them in any way preston only ever talks about the towns cait is a drugged up fighter that can t fight to save her life currie is some robot that just follows you cause knowledge paladin dans is basically a racist bigot it s literally the exact same but ugly kill it piper everything you say makes me hate you at this point i was just like lone wanderer perk please without dog meat cause survival mode settlers are literally interchangeable to a point of it almost being a joke want to kill a whole town and have no one care sure go ahead more people will just move in settlements come back to preston and his stupid towns why is it that you have to build literally every town like did no one live in the cw after the war other than in the great green jewel don t get me started on the quest for these f ing towns oh some ghouls have moved in nearby and might start attacking if you the general don t do something said the settler oh ok sure where is it i ll put it on your pip boy which i have never used before then it s literally on the other side of the map additionally how is it you re magically a carpenter welder farm electrical engineer even though if you play a female you were a defense attorney and if you play a male you were a rifleman lastly on the topic of towns what made bethesda think it s ok to charge 15 dollars for the ability to use already in game assets as settlement blocks when free mods do a better job of using already in game assets for settlement blocks weapons how many base guns do you think are in the game just make a guess ok there are legendarily unique and dlc are not included 2 pistols 6 rifles 2 shotguns 3 pipe guns 5 heavy weapons 3 energy 1 plasma 1 gamma 1 smg 3 other 22 melees 14 throwables 26 coming to a total of 62 weapons to use for your whole 285 level play through now this may sound like a decent amount but about 80 of these weapons become unusable like all of the heavy weapons fat man especially if using the merv weapon mod now don t get me wrong i liked the mod system while leveling to 20 then it becomes stupid cause you have one op gun that killed everything at level 26 i fought my way up a tower and got a fully upgraded assault rifle then 30 mins later i found a double shot legendary mod clearly i used it the rest of the game the system is cool and all but it makes most guns feel pathetic and not even worth carrying like pipe rifles mini guns lasers pistols and shotguns it ends up feeling like a chore more than anything upgrading guns but what about legendary guns you ask slaps they are not legendary at all the legendary guns are pathetic in this game if its night time on the 3rd full moon of the year while being shot damage will be reduced by 10 such wow much good frick off you re telling me i killed an ancient legendary cloaking albino glowing blood soaked death mutant raider queen leader for this piece of no joke i killed an enraged fog crawler and got a legendary pipe revolver that had extra accuracy when using vats map make your own towns said bethesda so we tried to with what seems like a mod stapled on there badly to say the least so much of the map just feels empty like the sentinel site when i first got there i thought it was some amazing thing that would have all kinds of cool loot no it just has ghouls i will give points to the glowing sea it was pretty cool the first time i went there was worried that i might have to take some rad away but no which is pretty silly honestly i think they should have spent less time building stuff underwater which you can t see more than 2 metres in and more time on building an interesting story or like side quests or maybe even a second major town i don t want to spend 80 hours building 30 settlements making them look attractive that was why i paid you to do it armour hello sir did you like how in skyrim you wore separate armor pieces yes well boy do i have a deal for you in fallout 4 you can wear even more we don t just have gloves boots chest and helm you can wear 2 different arms or two different legs that sounds cool well it s gonna make modding harder in every way cause you can t hide it it also looks like you just stabbed pipes into your armor wait what too late now bye boom enjoy having slabs of metal or skin attached to your body what about power armor what about it it s op in everyway imaginable but power cores what about them i have 99 in my back pack cause they weigh nothing but parts take damage soo repair it with a stapler spoon vibrator and some cigarettes oh and the underarmor useless unless you join the rail road then your underarmor will becomes powerarmor under your armor wait does xzibit run the rail road quests yo dog i heard you like dem quests how about fetch quests or go murder nameless bad guys maybe even the occasional quest with story involving you talking to some random named character you don t care about wait so basically all the misc quests in skyrim yeah basically all the quests in this game feel like side quests go get shaun why he is most likely dead says any realistic person that s been out in the cw for more than a day factions all jokes aside i ll give you a summary minutemen go help these people cause you the general without squads or other minutemen to help bos go kill these just whatever you without fire support of course squads and strategyrailroad help synthetics they are people too no i did none of their quests institute you in charge now dad mum cause you know how to run this place also enslave synthetics at least you get some coursers to help you perks leveling learning difficulty curve the perk system sucks who wants to pick a perk that just boosts damage ooh so cool why can t i get a perk that makes me part cyborg after getting better science or give up my ability to wear power armor and use ranged weapons for like super mutant strength to punch moos to death leveling is a joke because the game is pretty hard early and perks are just damage buffs when you break it down it s still fun though cause modding weapons feels good early so you do the fetch quests because you re a noob nobody knows and you are happy you got those 4 10mm rounds the curve in this game is like a cliff i personally play in survival because i like hard games and the game becomes easy if you either wear power armor or you pick stealth at the start you have to worry about food water stimpacks and ammo but by level 30ish you will have so many you just store them at your house for later use how i fought the bos in my first play through was i got every mirelurk steak i could find in my town which was about 500 then went to the fight ate them all at the start and never ran out of health i was just literally unkillable like how does that even work i basically fought the boss of the game without a care in the world i was just punching other people in power armor to death for god sake bugs sorry i ve been pulling out my knife to stab you for 30 minutes now to try to write about bugs summary the game feels like a fleshed out tech demo with bugs all over it bad story telling no depth mods try to fix it but they cant 3 10
