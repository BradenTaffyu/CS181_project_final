2017 the game is a breath of fresh air for the total war series magic and a massive variation in units brings a lot of difference in gameplay to the table and makes other total war games seem like clones of each other in comparison to warhammer however the game does feel a little empty for the newest total war release some may call it simplified but it seems to lack a lot of what the old games had to offer also the rts battles seem to move at too fast a pace there isn t much time for large strategies flanking moves etc because engagements end so quickly and the battlefields are very small thus adding to the feeling of lacking content compared to older total war games of course the other negative point is the cost it s spoken about a lot but the overall price when you include dlc is bloody ridiculous yes add some extra content with dlc but don t make half the game cost extra
