i ve liked playing cities skylines 2 so far it s definitely an enjoyable game with a lot of promise that being said the game does not get any points for being enjoyable and having promise the bar was much much higher for this gamewhile it s not fair to expect cs2 to be as feature rich and polished as cs1 is so close to launch it is fair to expect it to be fully functional to the extend we were promised from marketing i can forgive the lack of assets i can forgive the bugs i can forgive that we were told that the game would initially launch without mod support and that mods would no longer be run through the steam workshop but more than 3 months after release colossal order has not been able to deliver timely updates to fix numerous bugs let alone deliver features that they promised mod support and console release keeps getting delayed performance has been getting better but it is still an incredibly demanding game for what it is in 2023 and now 2024 the sad reality which i ve come to accept is that games will be released with bugs lots of bugs what is completely inexcusable is that they are no longer pushing updates for bug fixes patches independently from dlc launches major patches will now be released alongside paid content in 2 years i m sure this game will be better but co deserves a negative review until then this game should be marked as early access and its price should reflect that do not buy this game until then you ll have a better experience buying cs1 dlc and modding it to your liking
