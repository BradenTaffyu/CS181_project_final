fantastic first 2 chapters chapter 3 gets tedious with a few annoying bugs but still not bad chapter 4 is unplayable utterly broken mess your side quests are broken companion quests are broken fights are a joke ship combat is insanely hard and the main quest is nearly unfinishable due to being littered with game breaking bugs this isn t a lack of talent as the first chapters are amazing it is either a rush job or the devs just decided to stop caring and release an unfinished mess unless owlcat fixes this game by enriching chapter 3 and actually finishing chapter 4 it will be the last game i ever purchase from owlcat i ve had enough of unfinished broken games at any price
