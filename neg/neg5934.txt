i dislike the business model of paradox so much that i will never buy another game from this company while i enjoyed eu4 for more than 400 hours several years ago the practice of releasing a game which is intentionally defeatured so that players need to continually buy all of the dlc to stay up to date is morally bankrupt look at the arrogance and greed to provide a discount on the content during the steam sale so that a game which is 11 years old cost only 156 somehow other studios can make a complete game and sell it at a reasonable price providing updates for free and still be profitable dlc should be for adding to or extending a game not for completing features which were intentionally left out of the initial release if i could give this two thumbs down i would just a terrible business practice
