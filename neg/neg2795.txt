2018 after 2 0 patch it ruined for me i have 706 hours into this game its was good but now i dont feel a thing yes its because of the improvements with 2 0 now you are forced to make bottle necks and only get stuff throught research sorry but before there was freedom to choose what weaponary or space flight all races was unique because of this but now everyone is equal thats actual boring in a space game i say it was a good run and now its hollow i wouldnt recommend in current state
