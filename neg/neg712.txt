2017 i ve been following the fallout series ever since i touched down on fallout 3 in late 2009 at the time of writing i have played every single fallout game including one two tactics bos three new vegas and eventually four however i ll get around to that in a minute at first i rejected the series for at a rather young age to be playing fallout 3 being too difficult and hard to get your head round i picked up fallout 3 again following the buzz of a new fallout game and i immediately fell in love with it playing a good four hundred hours on the xbox 360 trying to find every single quest and location i vividly remember grinding to level 20 so that i could unlock the explorer perk so that i could find the location where the g e c k was activated and there were trees everywhere then there was the time i was exploring the wasteland and bumped into the deathclaw sanctuary thinking to myself what the heck is a deathclaw only to come running out a minute later with tears streaming down my face from the horrors inside then i managed to pick up fallout new vegas which buyers beware is made by a different company obsidian entertainment i remember the first time i played the game my hands were shaking as i left doc mitchell s house and it was there where my love for fallout was cemented the faction system the beautiful blend of humour and seriousness and a whole new armada of weapons i absolutely adore fallout new vegas and i can honestly say it is my favourite game of all time with no current competitor to that title upon hearing of this new upcoming bethesda title after playing the living hell out of new vegas i died of excitement when that announcement was made i counted down the days until november 2015 and what did i recieve as i bore the pain of waiting for that final release i entered the game and what did such a loyal fan recieve after waiting years for a new release to his favourite series a first person shooter with a dialogue system which is as deep as the game is excitinglet s get this out of the way fallout 4 is not a roleplaying game many people jumped into this game expecting a deep story with heavy roleplaying elements and a faction system similar to fallout new vegas the extent of the roleplaying in this game is a yes no maybe dialogue system which appears to be voiced by someone who was taught acting by that old english teacher from your school who would drone for hours on end about nothing calling this game a roleplaying game is like calling the stanley parable an action game settlement building which bethesda advertised so much leading up to the game is a repetitive minigame which requires mods to even be remotely amusing or entertaining good luck trying to build your house as the game follows a lego like placement system which 8 times out of 10 will declare a clear spot as an invalid place for something as simple as a painting the commonwealth is also so bland and boring new vegas had an excuse for being empty and that s the fact it s set in a desert but guess what new vegas made every single location work and every building served a purpose no matter how meaningless it first seemed half the buildings in this game are passable and even the buildings which should seem interesting such as the customs house is practically empty with no depth i ll wrap this review up on a positive note talking about the combat system in the game which is fantastic and fluid well done bethesda we can clearly see where the money for the game went the customisation is great and the amount of unique weapons which are admitedly standard weapons with additional stats makes everything seem different and no gun fight plays out the same oh and don t even get me started on the abomination that is the power armour system which is as controversial as the game itself overall score 3 10this game has been in development since 2012 obsidian had just over a year to develop fallout new vegas and that is an infinitely better game i trusted bethesda to give me another 1000 hours of content and fun instead i got 50 hours of dissapointment over dissapointment to the point where sadly i can t say i ll be looking forward to any bethesda game studios game until they give me a reason to look forward to one edit hi guys so it s been a few months since i posted my original review and my god has this post blown up thank you for both your support and criticisms i will not be addressing said comments in this edit because i have a much bigger to talk about creation club oh yeah look at me jumping on the bandwagon of hate but seriously under the current payment system which is slimy at best and the overpriced crap that s being sold on there due to the disastrous choices made by bethesda i m lowering my review score to a two in order to highlight my complete anger at this piece of forcefed microtransaction garbage although i ll give cc one credit it did make me want to install a mod the mod which removes it from my main menu
