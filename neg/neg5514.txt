2013 to start i ve played every total war since shogun 1 i ve been there day one and i was for rome 2 never again there is some good the province system introduced here its a step up there s been some effort to fix the constant castle battles experienced in shogun 2 i think that s all the rest is poor beyond belief it s well documented everywhere in the community where the issues lay far to many for me to rewrite here basically you re here reading this review to help determine if you should buy this game short answer no do not buy this game in fact do not buy the next total war unless you can fully demo it through whatever means ca are not the studio they once were move along this game is not worth your time and its certainly not worth your money
