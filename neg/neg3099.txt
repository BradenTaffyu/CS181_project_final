2019 even though i have almost 80 hours of this game on record i can t recommend this game especially at full prize kunos imposed a launch date on itself so the final release feels rushed the single player experience is ridiculous the lack of features like the possibility to let the ai drive after a driver swap or even pit stop animations is a killer for me as the development took a lot longer than expected and the final product feels a lot rushed many players are leaving the game that means the multiplayer servers are getting less and less populated in the end this game still feels like an early access it pains me not to recommend it but i d say you will have better value for money by subscribing iracing for three months if asseto corsa competizione becomes more polished by then then you should buy it
