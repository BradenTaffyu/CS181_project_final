2017 early access review very fun and somewhat challenging game took me just over 20 runs to beat the current amount of content on the easier of the two current characters available there are a variety of tactics and ways to defeat the more challenging encounters downsides are that the game is extremely luck dependant there are ways to cull cards from your deck and alter your draw options for battles but their appearance is largely dependant upon nothing but your luck you can remove cards at shops which are visible on the map ahead of time but only at significant expense similarly the valuable cards and relics that are virtually required to beat the game can only be acquired as random drops from either battles chests or shops you can frequently tell that you have no chance of a successful run before it is halfway complete all in all it is very fun and i hope that additional content will improve these issues and expand the content beyond the current 1 2 sessions worth of fun the price is probably not justified by the current content but i am hopeful that it will be significantly expanded i can t recommend the game at its price point in its current state edit game is now a masterpiece still luck heavy but truly excellent now
