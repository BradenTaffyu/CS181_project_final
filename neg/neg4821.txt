2018 let me say firstly this game is a lot of fun the reason i downvote the game is because unkown to me at the time i got it more than half of the content is locked behind this donald trump type wall that says hey look so i know you paid for the game and expected all the content to be available sorry to give you that impression actually you only get 30 of the game when you buy it if you want the other 70 then you ve gotta buy warhammer i warhammer i by the way still cost 60 dollars despite its sequel having been released there are even dlc s available for warhammer ii that you can get download install activate and then launch the game to find a nice little text box that says hey sorry bud i see you ve got that dlc installed but because you don t own warhammer i you re not able to use that content these practices are not ok in the gaming community and it outrages me that they ve been done here even more so that nobody seems to care about it these are two seperate games that each cost 60 dollars there is absolutely no reason none whatsoever that content in one should be locked due to not owning the other it s completely outrageous and unacceptable and you might be thinking about skins or cosmetics or something no no see there are 4 different races available in the base game if you own the first there are 5 new races a new map and the ability to actually use the cross game dlc s all tucked neatly behind the go buy our other game tag do not buy this game not only will you be buying less than half the actual game but you ll be showing game producers and developers that practices like these are perfectly fine and acceptable they re not i am disgusted with both creative assembly and sega for doing something so debasing you wouldn t expect to go to a restaurant and have half your meal taken away because you haven t visited and bought dinner at their other establishment edit a lot of people here are bringing up the reason for the cross game dlc s that creative assembly has released that the dlc is a free bonus for people who own the other game which combines the features so you can enjoy the past game in the most recent one it s a fair enough reason for many games i for one would love to see for example oblivion re made within the skyrim engine the difference here is that the warhammer games are all created in the same engine with the same game rules mechanics and formats they are in essence the same game with different content that is why dlc s exist they are extensions to the content of a game which is already established creative assembly instead is releasing what is essentially a large dlc as a standalone game and charging full price for it then they offer a free dlc that merges them to draw the most accurate comparison i can imagine fallout 4 and its dlc far harbour far harbour is a full map with new npc s new quests and new enemies but the same core game and mechanics it s still fallout 4 though and so was released as a dlc and not a standalone game at full price imagine if it had been marketed as fallout 5 far harbour and if you own fallout 4 then there is a free patch you can install that will link the worlds together with a quest and even let you transfer characters across while you take a boat between the old new lands the merger dlc is just there to disguise the fact that the second should never have been released as a new game anyway
