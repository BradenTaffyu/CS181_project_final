2018 stellaris was always kind of a rough gem for me but i really used to enjoy playing it before the 2 0 update from building up in the early game while you balanced resources and pull together a decent military to harnessing the power of a vast empire to field huge fleets and wage big epic wars between weird aliens i actually counted it among one of my favorite games back then however in its current state i can t possibly recommend it and that s a really depressing thing to type the update aimed to fix issues but it did so at the expense of the game actually being fun for me i m not bashing those who like the changes but i really hate some of them i ll list a few of the issues i have to give an idea the game is soooo much slower now from movement to research to like everything fleets can take months to cross even a small empire i think fleet sizes are also restricted way down i guess to prevent giant fleets i liked my giant decisive battles with empire sized fleets it gave battles a sense of gravitas that the physical manifestation of two space faring empires were smashing against one another now it feels like a handful of ships spitting at each other then flying to the next battle which is a year away even the new super ships aren t any fun given how sloooow they are pirates now pop out of nowhere on your borders like civ 5 but somehow worse given your fleet is so slow to move and react as far as i can tell it s not in any way linked to unruly factions or happiness they just appear i don t get why this was added they never attack the extended fringes of my empires i assume the intended choice they just pop up around the homeworld and smash stuff it s not an effect of poor management or happiness it just happens and it s very annoying exploration and expansion is much more tedious you need to pre visit every system with science ships in order to move other ships there you need to have an outpost in a system to exploit the resources colonise or have influence spreading out slows your research and unity gain to a crawl so either stay tiny or make the game even slooower you need to fiddle with the layout of your outposts and their defence platforms it s all very dull and pretty much destroys the fun of turning the galaxy one colour you just sit in your little foxhole and research slowly when ships fight they just fly towards each other maybe getting off one or two long range weapons until they reach spitting distance then spin around each other seriously they spin i guess they heard spinning was a good trick there s no tactics or depth it s just a free for all at short range even the ships you put on artillery run into melee as well they just stand still in the middle and turn on a dime to shoot it s all quite silly to watch there are mods that used to fix this behavior like zbeautiful battles but none of them work anymore with the new update i had hoped they would use 2 0 as a chance to fix the shallow but pretty combat but i think it might be even worse now i could go on but the point is that the game is no longer fun for me and it used to be one of my favourites to play i might recommend playing the 1 9 version if you need your sci fi fix it was really fun but 2 0 really spoiled it for me i m still open to changing my opinion in the future but i don t think the devs will roll back any changes i ll stick to the old game thanks tldr was fun now it isn t big and epic is now slow and tedious
