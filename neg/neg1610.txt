2021 early access review i just closed the game probably for the 20th time and said i dont know why i keep playing this game the great thing about this game is it s concept its a lot of fun if you don t care about the crashes absolutely ai broken sieges and lazy quests these guys have had years to improve upon a great concept and at every turn they come short i find myself playing every few months hoping they ve corrected some very basic problems like siege and combat ai but no nothing ever changes wait for a dev team that has a clue on what they re doing to make something similar the market is there unfortunately taleworlds just doesnt have the ability to deliver edit for those saying this is a early access okay i get it however this game is a literal copy paste of mount blade 1 with some great new feature and additions my complaint is that the basics the foundations of this game are buggy as all hell and they have been and still are in mount blade 1 which was released in 2008 if thats not enough its been almost a year and a half for this early access release and the core mechanics are a mess like i said love the concept its just the delivery is really really unpolished
