even with the template feature most of the time i m just spamming posters all over the place every time i create a new room or change its size this is exhausting me plus you can only use two of the same type of poster for efficiency so i have to constantly check and put up different posters which is even more annoying and to top it all off i can t even tell how many of each poster i ve already used in a room which drives me crazy don t tell me to just decorate naturally without overthinking it why do you think people play simulation games in the first place
