2021 i really tried to like this game i did this game has the economy simulator down well the problem is it s incredible boring looking at numbers and modifiers the whole game i get the feeling it s as fun as doing your taxes stellaris gives you the sense that something will happen that you will be engaged in this new wondrous universe reading what s to come etc after exploring the vast galaxy of different exciting number you ll find yourself wondering if you missed something again because you re bored to tears yes there are events in the game great how often is it that you find yourself just closing pop up windows as if you have a trojan virus with insert boring stats here you know what if i wanna read about sci fi that has little to zero impact on the gameplay besides meaningless buffs or nerfs i ll pick up a book i can t understand why they couldn t make it more about the species other worldly organic effects that might have on your planets fleets or population yes they do have all the animations that give you the impression you are encountering new life forms but they all operate under a similar platform which is our economy it s bloody space would it kill them to be a little more creative honestly i know why because this isn t a space game it s a banking simulator in a guise of a sci fi exploration game look fun is subjective and for the people that enjoy the economy part of it that s great it s enjoyable to a degree but the next time you start a game imagine all the stories icons policies and replace them with trucks banks mobsters and investors see if you have the feelings you had for it before i don t have all the answers but hell have the tech be about what you discovered in the universe and be given the option to combine it with other tech that you found or researched maybe you can produce different outcomes good or bad you can try to make a new weapon but it turns into some kind of infecting symbiote i know but anything then a stat icon slog maybe that will make you care about what happens in the sterallas universe i always imagined this game being more rogue like never knowing what you re going to get it would be more exciting in my opinion paradox combat system has never been it s strong point i ve played ck2 3 stellasis eu4 whhhhy was blob 8 fleet afraid of 7 fleet because 7 ate 9 is it really that hard to make combat in a video game more enjoyable somehow they ve made me want to avoid it entirely oh wait that s right they have more micro managing for you to do in fleet design which is equivalent of playing tic tac toe with paradox asking in the foreground we having fun yet most games i ve played in stellaris consists mostly of expanding as large as i could min max turtle hope the game either ends or my computer explodes unless some super powered fleet comes along and becomes an annoying game of cat mouse the game is basically over only you still about 10 or more hours of gameplay at that point my mouse is already hovering over the exit game and into another lovely game of league of legends and its teammates i m sure some of you know what i m talking about in conclusion inside stellaris hies what could be one of the greatest sci fi game to date instead we have a very monotonous uninspired number balancing simulator while you re balancing decibels in the game they are taking them from your bank account with all the dlc and other attempts to fix which is fundamentally flawed
