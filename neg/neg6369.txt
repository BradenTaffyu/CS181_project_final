2018 note this critique is more than a year out of datemany features may have changed spoilers ahead for the lab no story spoilersthe game has huge aspirations but there isn t really an endgame worth any of the time you spend on it addicting early game entertaining mid game poorly balanced and hollow endgame once you get it you get it the fun of the game is understood probably within the first 8 10 hours and until that point it is a very fun game unforunately just like many other incremental games it s very unbalanced after a point without a satisfying ending minor or pointless expansion options and the highway robbery that is the lab it s reduced to feel worse than cookie clicker from hour 8 onwards the game does a ton of things well the world building is superb the premise feels and plays a lot like viva pinata and you ll love the discovery phase of the game unfortunately because that feeling can t last you look back at half the time you spent and wonder if you should have been doing something else just like cookie clicker edit the following are my full thoughts on the lab and contain spoilers for its contentsthe lab is very expensive and the rewards are not terribly important by the end of the game the lab creates a situation in which it is the problem and the solution you don t need any of the science utilities unless you want to build the science utilities it s a self contained loop of investment and reward you can safely ignore the lab and finish the game much faster the utilities piece by piece teleporters seem silly as the world is relatively small by the time you build all 11 11 teleporters the game will have ended probably 20 hours ago there s never a reason to have more than around 3 teleporters in the endgame if you don t invest in science you definitely won t need them warp depots are equally silly they are a solution to a limited inventory but that problem exists only when you want to use the lab so if you don t invest into the science you won t need the warp depots they are the solution to their own problem another dead end the refinery link is silly as well considering warp depots already exist you can just have a teleporter to the refinery instead or a warp depot there the critique of the market link is identical to the refinery link med station you re never wanting for health if you ve unlocked the lab pointless gadget hydro turrets good management of your corrals is much easier to achieve than making a bunch of hydro turrets you should never make a hydro turret and if you have to you re doing something very wrong the problem of tarr slimes is much more easily solved by managing the ranch properly taming bell there s a ton of other cheaper options for making slimes relax spring pad teleporters exist the jetpack exists you re not in need of more movement options especially not a static one potted tactus i can t even think of a reason you would ever really want this other than decor gordo snares it s much easier to just feed slimes and largos to get plorts than to go through the trouble of trapping and feeding another gordoat the end of the day the lab presents solutions to problems that shouldn t exist you should already have your slimes managed properly if you can cobble together all the resources for the extractors and teleporters none of these things are cheap and there s no truly fast way to get them the entire purpose of the lab then seems to be decorations and curios and there are a ton if that s your thing and you want to spend 20 hours to get a monocle for your slimes then the lab is for you some people do want to do that just relax and decorate a slime ranch i get it but that s not me if the lab were required to progress then i would be more than happy to use it unfortunately almost everything in it is pointless towards the core gameplay the game is fun but the core gameplay is hollow by the endgame i can t recommend it but that s me this could be your type of game in which case you should definitely get it few games do it better edit 2 seeing as the game is still beeing expanded for free i believe the problems may very well be addressed in the future until that point this review will sit unaltered
