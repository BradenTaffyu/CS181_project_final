2017 divinity 2 is definitely a game that can hold your attention for a while and you would probably really like it if you haven t played the first original sin the problem for me though is that this game feels like a downgrade in nearly every respect from the first the story isn t as interesting the locations feel really bland comparatively combat is slower and worst of all the party interaction is simplistic at best one of the best things about original sin was that you and your partner built a relationship and history together as the game went on you had arguments about what to do in a quest and could discuss the outcomes afterwards over time you began to develop your own tropes it wasn t perfect by any means but it was far better than what you get with original sin 2 this game allows for 4 player co op which is awesome i was really excited when i heard the announcement about that the problem is however that they really had to sacrifice a lot for characterization to accomidate that all the pre made characters have their own quest lines and stories sure but you have essentially no influence on the character your dialogues feel meaningless and what you do in a quest is entirely your own decision there are no group decisions it s every man for himself which leads me to the biggest problem as i said before original sin had you both discuss quest paths and if there was a disagreement you would do a paper rock scissors minigame to decide who won nothing ground breaking but it worked your two characters were partners and worked together for a common goal it was kind of campy at times but it made for a really fun and light hearted setting enter original sin 2 not only does it not encourage working together it in fact encourages the opposite there are options that will only benefit one person there are plot points that flat out tell you only one person can win it sets you against one another from the beginning it might be interesting for some people but i personally hated it coming from original sin where i loved the cooperative element i hated that the game actively encouraged people to put themselves first it might sound interesting at first but i guarantee it really sucks to have to play a rpg where people start ignoring the story so that they can loot everything in sight before others get there first the tone of original sin 2 is much different from original sin in fact the exact opposite original sin had a pretty light hearted campy feel to it pretty much every option felt like it had a good enough outcome if you put in the effort to get it original sin 2 however is a bleak and depressing setting the people in the world are generally terrible and there are very few happy moments ever available there are many quest lines that actually just turn a sad situation worse even if you go through all the effort to finish everything the story feels completely hopeless and it eventually had me choosing to do as little as possible for questing as for the combat they made magic a bit more accessible to people there are more schools of magic and more abilities for you to choose from it s interesting enough but once again they made it worse i think from original sin they basically halved your action points ap in this game so you have less moves available in a turn then they added two types of defense physical and magic in order to do health damage you have to bring one defense down to 0 and then hit with an attack of that damage type so if you want to kill somebody with a sword you have to get their physical armor to 0 and then hit them or if you want to kill somebody with a fireball you have to get their magical armor to 0 and then hit them all of this is done so that certain status ailments cannot be applied while certain armors are up for instance burning will first reduce magic armor before it takes health away same with stunning and knockdown all this does is make combat feel like a chore before you can do anything to hurt anybody you have to get their defenses down but your moves are severely limited so you can maybe attack twice if you stand completely still and have max ap it s slow and much less fun most of this review was comparing original sin 2 to original sin and saying the first one was better and i think it was if you haven t played original sin then you will probably really enjoy original sin 2 but for me original sin 2 was a huge letdown compared to the first this is a good game but it s a big step back i love this studio and i really really hope to see an original sin 3 or some other crpg from them in the future with the success of original sin 2 i m sure we will i just hope they manage to bring back all the good they did with the first divinity original sin
