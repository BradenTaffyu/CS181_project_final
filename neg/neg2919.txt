2017 after playing this game for 60 hours i have to warn you off as with many off the negative reviews i agree that the ealy game is fun but it becomes problematic later on i ve played many paradox games and while they make the politics look similar to eu4 the options for negotiating peace aren t as workable what s more i ve entered into wars where a bunch of races will jump on you depite you having a better relationship with them than the defender does and the federation associtaion does lilttle to no good since they won t help you out in a war you join to help them don t waste your time or money
