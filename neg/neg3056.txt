2023 look i love this game i love the brutality of it the story telling aspect i love to build my colony into a vast organ stealing empire and raid and plunder my neighbors to my hearts content i bought rimworld originally on console started a decent colony had all nine colonists eaten alive by bunnies and was immediately hooked however when i saw the difference between console and pc i was disappointed i felt like i was limited severely with the no access to the newest dlcs and mods i bought the full package on pc and got started with biotech ideology royalty mods and started crazy playthroughs however after starting many new colonies and downloading hundreds of mods with new flaura and fauna game mechanics etc i started to notice that the quality of mods was equivalent to or better than the quality of content in the dlcs then i learned that a majority of the animals in rimworld were originally made in a player submitted mod that was integrated into the full game by the devs after coming into agreement with the mod creator s at that point i started thinking about other mods in comparison to dlcs particularly with biotech and child development and i realized that a lot of the content in this game comes from the dev team looking to the modding community babies and children have been modded into this game for years but biotech was only released fairly recently at a price of 30 im not saying that the devs adding content from mods to the main game is a bad thing i think its a great tool to keep the game healthy and fresh and introduce new ideas however i also think the problem here is that it feels like the community cares more about the quality of content in the game than the dev team the devs let the community come up with cool new stuff and then they use that as inspiration to add new features in a paid 30 dlc i think this game is great i love creating colonies of sadistic organ harvesting nudist cannibals but i dont like spending money on content that has been in the modding community for years i dont like the idea that in a year or two from now there might be a dlc that adds vehicle creation because that is one of the most popular mods available today i think that this inspires a lack of effort from the devs to create new content or quality of life features which affects all platforms i love this game but i wont spend another dime on it
