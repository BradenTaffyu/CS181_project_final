2013 i wrote this on 7 sep 13the long anticipated and waited for total war rome ii did the new total wars series deliver or is the game as treacherous and underhanded as the roman empire read the following brief first impression review from my 25 hours of game play and see what is in store for you if you decide to buy the game first of all if you do not know what type of game rome ii is it is basically a turned based battle map game similar to the board game risk which i will stereotypically assume if you are an 80s kid you played at least once except for the battles are not just dice roles you have the opportunity to raise armies control real time offensive and defensive battle formations hire spies dignitaries and companions to subjugate assassinate and cause all other forms of havoc to your enemy neighbors several key elements exist within any game that very import to a lot of gamers such as immersion re playability user friendly interfaces uniqueness and the list can keep going and going depending upon the player and their personal interests i will review several facets of the game as they are important to me and stood out fairly immediately the empire i decided to start playing first was sparta cheese i know but 300 is an awesome movie and i just had to choose them first the badstabilityfor my system the game is not stable at all rome ii is default set to high graphics and causes immediate issues i have also found these same issues freezing graphical glitches black screen of death ect were discovered with several different standard computer systems several known bugs have already populated the technical support forums with issues from integrated intel chip sets and graphics cards my aging gaming laptop was barely able to keep up and setting the graphics down to low helped out tremendously at the obvious sacrifice of visual stimulation the game ended up looking like medieval total war from 2001 even with the game set to low the performance was still very sluggish however playable after starting the game up for the first time and loading the tutorial i didn t make it very far past that after annihilating my enemy in a very fashionable noob manner the screen turned black instead of populating a victory window needless to say i ended up closing the program and failing my first mission after doing a little bit of homework this is also a known error with game as of day one immersionimmersion within room ii is non existent comparatively speaking there is not any avatar character customizations renaming history background story nothing the generals and statesmen are empty husks of simple skills with predefined names in order to keep track of your armies when they died in battle or of old age it doesn t mean anything to the player because there is literally no connection when you are required to replace the generals you eventually don t even look at the names on the newly populated list you just randomly click and go because there isn t any difference where did these people come from who knows who cares they just in charge of my entire army now they are also identified as royal versus non royal families what does that mean to you nothing not that i have discovered thus far anyway another calamity within rome ii that erodes any element of immersion for the game is waiting for your turn i am not opposed to turn based strategy games honestly i love them however i do have a significant problem with the amount of time rome ii takes to get back to your empire by the time my empire had scouted or obtain city states from one part of europe to the middle east i had to watch and wait for all of the empires to take their turn this may not sound that bad but it is because you will wait on average 10 minutes for all of the other empires to move their armies and all other units i was able to get up and do some chores make my kids lunch watch some tv for a moment and come back to my computer and it still was not my turn by this time i was ready to just turn the game off because i was losing interest not to mention during some stages of your empire s development you may only have a minute or two worth of improvements and or movements to make thus most of your game play hours are spent watching little computer army symbols skip around a map artificial intelligencedumb i could leave the review at that because there really isn t any other way of describing the ai but i ll try to elaborate i have slaughtered over 1 000s of enemy hoards outnumbered 3 to 1 just by using simple military strategies at the loss of only a few hundred of my forces these same battles were originally calculated as being a defeat or victory with severe losses at times predicting over 60 my forces will die i am not an epic military strategist and i only had the difficulty set to normal however i find it hard to believe i was able to turn the tables of battle by approximately 50 in my favor you ll always have some battle losses regardless of what you do the goodentertainment valueregardless of all the problems annotated above the game is still highly addictive and fun to play i am honestly surprised at the fact i have played 25 hours of this game within first 5 days of release but the game is honestly hard to put down there is nothing better than scaling the walls of my enemy and slaughtering the archers as they try to flee or running the enemy down with my cavalry as they retreat from the battlefield out flanked and tasting my spartan spears potentialthere is a lot of room for improvement which can be added in order to make it more timely and enjoyable for the average player such as adding a save option on the battle maps for starters would be nice considering you have an hour to finish the battle sometimes the enemy just doesn t want to walk into your trap and these things take time the fast forward time function only feels like x1 5 brief closing comment good game with a lot of enjoyable features and addicting battles however covered in bugs and empty handed immersion not worth 60 but if you really want to try the game out wait for steam to put it on sale because it is going to happen
