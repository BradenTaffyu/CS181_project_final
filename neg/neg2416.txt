2022 great because it s yu gi oh bad because it s yu gi oh master duel since most other reviews cover the gameplay aspect and i was forced to cut most things due to hitting the character limit i ll just talk about other aspects of the game that i find problematic amount of content reward and potential play duration i honestly think this is the biggest topic to tackle here i ve read plenty of reviews praising the generosity of konami and all but unfortunately i ll have to warn you that all they ve done is give the bare minimum to hook you in and extend the already short honeymoon phase you ll have with this game why at first you ll be greeted by tons of free in game currency then you ll also meet the duel pass a typical battle pass you see in many mobile and even pc games nowadays that are usually paid for with real money however in yugioh what s praiseworthy is that there is no separate currency gold coins anything and it s all just from their gems so what does this mean yep the duel pass can be purchased with the free gems you get by playing the game and doing missions which is almost unheard of in most games so that s awesome solo missions yeah you get to sink in quite a bit of time playing a form of campaign mission mode and the mission rewards are very very generous now you may be wondering then what do you mean by short honeymoon phase and bare minimum to hook you in after a couple days of fun grinding solo missions and ranked for rewards you ll quickly start noticing how the rewards you get decrease exponentially over time and the things you can do in the game also equally run out within a matter of just a few days or maybe a week or two at best if you don t no life it almost all of my friends have started the game with me on release and everybody exhausted their resources as well as their options for meaningful rewards almost entirely and the duel battle pass you reach the max level of it also within a few days yet the reward period lasts for more than a couple months what seems incredibly backwards to me is how their rewards decrease exponentially each passing day the login rewards for example start out at gems enough to buy 10 packs then just a bit later instead of increasing it actually gets reduced to half then decreases again this is also limited to 7 days so it s an incredibly finite source of income and the same applies to solo mission rewards here is where it started reminding me of genshin impact a game that was similarly released prematurely without enough content for players whatsoever that resembles something that s in alpha stage of development with an incredibly forced level of limited resources and only a short burst of rewards at the start to hook you in with not enough incentive to continue playing once you ve reached the end point oh did i mention the daily missions in this game give you so little that it makes you consider taking a minimum wage part time job instead and spend money for more gems in that time the solo missions can be finished within a day platinum in ranked can also be achieved within a day or two if you grind a bit then suddenly you re left there with nothing to do but you may argue then just create different decks and have fun in ladder or with friends oh oh i wish i could i personally bought the entire set of gem bundles available and well it s now time to transition to the next topic deck creation dealing with the finite resources and its disassembly system the game got even more hype because it was confirmed that you can craft cards you want disassembling cards you don t need and use their fragments as material to craft specific cards for your deck this is on paper an amazing system since you don t rely so heavily on card packs and pure rng to somehow give you the cards you need especially when the standard pack currently has 6750 packs and you get cards randomly from this massive pool however this system exists in the card game shadowverse and they ve done a great job at it by making it easy for players to craft various decks they like so i ll be comparing it directly to the system in that game in shadowverse vials cp crafting points are one single currency to craft any rarity card you want but in master duel each rarity has a separate cp meaning that you need to disassemble ur cards to create ur cards at the rate of 3 disassembled urs for one single ur yeah and the chance of dropping a ur is 2 5 actually not bad at all for a gacha especially since single packs contain multiple cards but with this cp system there are obviously some problems besides the split up currencies what adds salt to the wounds is the fact that yugioh revolves largely around combos and therefore negations meaning that you ll need a lot of base cards that are similarly used across most decks such as maxx c consequently ash blossom etc all of which are yep you guessed it ultimate rare if you tried creating a deck you may have noticed an interesting pattern cards that are obvious to be popular to craft are very very likely to be made ur i sure wonder why konami consequently the cost of making a single deck is so ridiculously high compared to other card games that you d almost need to all in your resources on maximum one or two decks before you re completely sucked dry unless you re like me and bought all the premium gem bundles yeah i barely managed to make 3 whole decks with those expensive bundles and the free gems obtained combined meanwhile my f2p friends are all hovering around 1 2 usable decks with the free rewards there is no normal matchmaking mode either just a ranked matchmaking slapped on which completely ignores the casual crowd that just wants to play some yugioh for nostalgia sake with their favorite decks instead of being forced to play meta against tryhards in ranked which is another quite backwards thing they did but i have this sneaking suspicion that they did this because of how valve s card game artifact went down due to a lack of proper ranked matchmaking although i believe neither is correct as both games failed to cater to both audiences in the end conclusion ultimately i ll have to loop back to the header of this whole review yu gi oh is great this game is not if it wasn t for the deep love i have for yugioh i wouldn t have touched this game or at least dropped it by now however you can argue that this is still way too early to judge which i do agree with so we ll have to wait and see the greyed out event match button besides the rank match button and other obviously soon to come features are something i ll keep an eye out for as of now i cannot recommend the game in its current state and would say that you should wait until we get more news on how they ll do things from here on out to judge whether they want to get on the right track or have this game become another stain on konami s reputation also after all this doomscrolling you went through i m terribly sorry but there is a frightening detail i need to point out if you go to the submenu record of gems obtained you ll see two split up numbers for the gems free gems owned and paid gems owned what do you guys think it means i hope i m wrong i really do but from my experience this opens up potential for this generous konami to really put the nail in the coffin by locking certain shop items explicitly behind the said paid gems currency have a good night s sleep and that s where my review ends thank you for reading and i truly hope the game makes it long run
