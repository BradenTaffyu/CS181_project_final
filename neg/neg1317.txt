i don t think that bannerlord is intrinsically a bad game i m just disappointed with the direction that the development format seems to be headed one of the most common forms of critical feedback is how the game is lacking features and end game presence which were in warband and after grinding several saves out to the end game i feel that those criticisms are 100 justified diplomacy isn t even worth discussing as a feature because it isn t one it s a binary state of we murder each other now or we murder each other later relations do very little and make very little sense i can execute someone s entire family and as long as my relation is above a certain value with them they still love me the end game encourages save scumming to ether override evade war declarations and related proposals from major factions and your own clan members but this isn t a be all end all solution as the same declarations will still occur albeit 30 seconds later lending to a gameplay loop of besiege quicksave do meaningful action quicksave wait to start siege battle have war declared on you by three major factions at the same time quickload repeat until the next instance of everyone declaring war on you simultaneously this is present in conjunction to the ai having zero preservation awareness if they have a military strength of 1 5k they will happily declare war on you even if you have 25 30k strength their armies will chase small stacks that they will never hope to catch or attack a settlement across the continent leaving their own territory defenseless whilst those are just a couple of the pressing issues that mar the game past a certain stage of a save the early game is still enjoyable it s a crying shame that once that point has been reached it is likely that you will have a better time starting a new character than dealing with the unoptimised grind fest that bannerlord offers as a late game meanwhile the developers release micropatches filled with 95 crash fixes and when meaningful content does get released it s a poorly implemented feature such as the coordinated attack order or aesthetic additions such as more armour skins or battle maps with no campaign map sense heads up as to what kind of scenery you ll be getting if you take a pitched battle outside of save scumming to enter the fight scout the terrain and either commit or nope out i m on a bridge cool i ll get a bridge map except there won t be a bridge in sight whilst the battle maps are a cool addition and i hope they continue to polish it it feels like is taking far too much of their time that they should be investing on building the base game out and adding much needed flesh to the bare bone that the current state of their product offers right now i can t recommend this game as anything other than a basis for modders as they continue to add fix features that should have been in the game a long time ago and that the developers have had four years to implement yet seemingly refuse to do so to summarise please add flesh to your skeleton of a game before trying to dress it in fancy clothes
