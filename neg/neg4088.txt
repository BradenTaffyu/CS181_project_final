2018 great game until take 2 got there grubby mits on it one of the few gems to come out of early access on steam fantastic development and great community and wealth of mods and options making it a fantastic sandbox game the steep learning curve may daunt some but quick research on the web youtube helps a ton squad was a great developer and if any of there talent is still involved then the game from a playability perspective will only improved that said once take two became involved the worst practices of the for profit software came to the front the new eula is a would make a facist goverment blush in short you only have the rights they forget to take away and that changes when they realise the oversite and any old agreements are null and void when they want love the game and hate the current publishertill the eula changes its only going to get more negative reviews
