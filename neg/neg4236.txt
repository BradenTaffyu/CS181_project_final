2019 early access review i ve played this game for far more than the 260 hours steam has recorded as offline play isn t tracked and this is probably the most difficult non recommend i ve had to give a game why because overall the game is very very good let s start with what they ve done right the goodthis game has an immense amount of depth and it s not shy about it there are lots of systems capable of managing everything from temperature to power generation which come complete with 14 overlays to keep track of everything it also has a wealth of interaction between the different systems to provide endless variations and complexity of design nothing can be ignored and almost anything you do will require careful consideration of its effect on other systems for example heating water to kill germs is fine but plants won t grow if the water is the wrong temperature which can bring a quick end to your colony s food supply digging out an ice biome for its resources or simply to make room will deprive you of naturally growing sleet wheat a valuable commodity in mid late game food production players can work around this and careful planning is not only rewarding but often mandatory designing complex systems to perform various tasks efficiently and quickly draws me back into the game repeatedly providing a massive amount of replay value the controls are another plus side gone is the god style typically found in rts games like anno nor does it have the player controlled perspective of factorio instead you place down the blueprints which your duplicants or simply dupes think of them like the ants in an ant colony must construct for you it s analogous to prison architect or using blueprints with construction robots in factorio if you re familiar with either of those the same holds true for almost every operation in the game from digging out terrain to adjusting the flow rate on a valve visually the game looks great as well with an aesthetic that is consistent and appropriate dupes have a plethora of animations some of which make them hopelessly endearing such as hugging an incubator while it s warming eggs little touches like them being happy to see one another provide a pathos for their well being that few if any games in the genre evoke if a dupe accidentally gets trapped i ll have the entire colony work to free them as quickly as possible even though i could just print more at periodic intervals should i lose one the badit does have its flaws although most of them are minor or become a non issue eventually the first thing that will strike most players is the learning curve with so much depth it s very steep and it doesn t let up for a long time you can approach this in multiple ways such as studying up beforehand by watching let s play videos or just going in blind realizing that you ll probably fail relatively early on in the game as long as you have the perseverance this can be overcome just don t expect it to happen in your first day or even week of play you need to be willing to fail discover what caused that and change your next approach to mitigate this it would be nice if the game featured a tutorial mode for new players it does have tips that appear to guide new players but they aren t comprehensive and likely won t suffice even if your goals are as basic as sustainability fortunately users on the forums are patient and by now there are more than enough searchable posts to cover most of the challenges that face those picking up the game today a wiki is available as well but the built in encyclopedia provides almost everything about the game one could need to know if you have the patience to sit down and read it more often i find myself using it as a reference what temperature does polluted water boil at again even with all the resources it sometimes obvious to miss important things for instance i didn t realize for a long time that wheezeworts a plant that cools the gas around it could be moved by planting them in a flower pot only after i saw it in a gameplay video did i realize what i was missing out on other useful properties such as the sour gas cycle boiling crude oil into petroleum boiling petroleum into sour gas condensing the sour gas into methane sulfur boiling the methane into natural gas and then pumping that to a natural gas generator may be so obscure that even veteran players are unaware of their utility additionally while the simulation isn t bad many things violate the laws of thermodynamics or physics as we know them mass is not always conserved some things output less than they take in heat can mysteriously disappear or appear out of nothing natural gas is denser than oxygen you need to unlearn a lot of what you learned in science class which is a bit of a hindrance to learning the game while the learning curve will ultimately be conquered by anyone with the patience to learn the game this can also present another downside to experienced players maps are randomly generated and it s easy to get one with undesirable properties such as geysers an endless source of resources of undesirable types or absence of those that supply extremely useful materials unless you go into debug or sandbox mode you won t find out till you re a ways into the game what you have you can also explore space but it s also random and you might not get many good planets asteroids or they might be farther away than you d like even figuring out how much fuel you need to put in your rocket and how many tanks you need to get where you want is basically trial and error from within the game fortunately the community has addressed many of these complaints with third party tools such as the seed browser and the rocket calculator but i d have preferred if they were integrated into the game in a similar manner to the encyclopedia however if you re experienced enough to be picking your seeds and using the rocket calculator you may find yourself in a similar situation to me that is early game becomes a bit of a repetitious chore where you are essentially doing the same thing every game you play this far from unique to oni as every similar game i ve played e g anno factorio suffers from it as well perhaps a quick start option could be provided for players that reach certain milestones within the game and it could start you with the basic research tiers already complete and duplicants with a few skill points at the ready the rest of this review is continued in the comments as it s too long to fit within steam s review length limit
