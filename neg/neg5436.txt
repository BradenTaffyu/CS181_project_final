for a game you pay a lot of money for you get massive bugs lag tech issues and somehow a massive lack of customizable content i thought a huge part of this game would be the skins for your army to bad this game has been out for a while and they fail to make any progress on new skins they will charge you an arm and a leg of the few that they do have no skins to unlock through hard work no rewards really at all sadly it is a unfinished game rushed to us the players in hopes of draining our pockets i have had so many matchs just freeze up on me or just randomly kick me back to the home screen i will probably just go back to playing coh2
