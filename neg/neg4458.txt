2021 after playing 3 different civilization games it feels as if the series is constantly in a downward trend towards removing game systems from previous iterations dumbing them down to allow their brain dead ai which sucks even with real strategy mod because the modders don t have access to the dll files and above all else kills the scope of the game entirely devolving it into a get more score than the other players rather than expanding a civilization and reaping the benefits and consequences of your actions consequences from external as well as internal threats and the diplomacy they tried with gathering storm to make it a bit better but it is so shallow no thank you i will not purchase civilization 7 or any other firaxis or 2k games including ksp2 they seem to not allow any sort of experimenting of features or evolution of their genre
