2023 edit i m redoing my entire review because when i wrote it i was tired and not thinking the best greed strikes another company this game should have been delayed until a more finished state could have been released i feel like i am playing an early access title right now i know people hate when games get delayed but the developers and publishers need to become more aware of what happens when you rush things you have people stating that people are just review bombing this title no the negative reviews are 100 justified this game is not ready and it s quite obvious that it s not finished here is why note my review is strictly based on in game features lack of designs animations etc not about in game performance i ve had very little issue in this department the game is heavily focused on your people and their lives so it s a very simulation driven with any decent polished simulation driven game animations are important it gives the world more life and makes the people feel more realistic cities skylines 2 lacks many of the base game animations that cs1 had from the start such as firefighters actually fighting fires ambulance crews going into buildings with stretchers and coming out with patients on the stretchers in cs2 there is none of these small but quite impactful animations ambulances just stop and you can just hear water noises when it comes to fighting fires we all know cs1 base game was bad and it needed mods to make it enjoyable such as more road tools more types of roads and the ability to control how traffic reacts on roads such as turning lanes adding removing traffic lights adding stop signs controlling speed limits controlling what types of vehicles can drive on said areas etc on top of it you had network extensions which allowed you to make more realistic roads with or without street lights changing the types of trees next to the roads etc so when they announced that many of the core mods would become base game in cs2 i got super excited no more waiting months after every little dlc is released because it breaks all your mods and you need to wait for players to update them what is released is literally bare bones the modders literally gave the developers everything they needed to do in cs2 in these aspects and people who most likely went to college for video design programming couldn t even replicate what players modders did in cs1 you cannot remove street lights from sides of the roads so if you re building a farming community you either have to use dirt roads or have unrealistic street lights out in the middle of nowhere not traffic lights you cannot add single or double stop signs it s either all or nothing have a t intersection where you only need 1 stop sign well sorry you can t it becomes a 3 way stop you cannot change speed limits you cannot prohibit vehicle types for certain roads adding trees to roads removes parking spaces you can t change the style of street lights or trees etc there is no reason for the developers to release such lackluster version of mods lastly there are no mods there is no map editor asset editor vehicle editor etc it s all to be released later down the road again this game should have been delayed until these features were finished greed destroyed simcity lets not see history repeat itself i don t want the devs to give up on this game there is so much potential it s just i feel like they released an early access title instead of a fully released one
