2019 the game itself is amazing but sadly needs way too much processing power in the late game the first 300 years of gameplay are really fun and exciting but after that you basically just sit around and wait forever for things to happen because the game slows down to an extreme as an example 1 day in the early game on the fastest speed setting 0 3 secs1 day in the late game after about 300 years on the same setting 2 3 seconds cpu used for reference intel i5 6500 which has about the same processing power as the recommended i5 3570k until this performance problem is fixed i sadly cannot reccomend the game in its current state unless you want to play on a much smaller scale way fewer habitable planets and a much smaller systemcount but even then the performance still is not that great
