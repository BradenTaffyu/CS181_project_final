2022 stellaris has major issues each update is said to fix things and improve yet provide the reverse result i invite people to try earlier versions and then come back to newer ones completely different game a lot of the time i prefer older stellaris more options despite missing out content of today because there is more content actually more content that is able to be enjoyed currently you gloss over a lot of things because its meaningless if its not more land ressources or research its ignored completely that also leads to some unstuck options being available too late to help someone you have more ressources so you can produce more therefore science is produced at absurd rates and some things are only available after specific time so people that are behind are even more behind the only catch up mechanic is salvaging defeated enemy fleets and that s only for military things but that imply you could defeat some of their ships which with a scientific advance its highly unlikely you d need a huge economy to get enough fleet to punch through which uh oh they have said economy themselves there s also stealing tech but espionage is dlc restricted and can be locked off by technology and perk to prevent people from ever catching up recently they tried to return a old playstyle to life after being gutted a few times actually worsened their state and that s the sad trend very early on the game was rather basic visible most ressources were gained from your pops working in slots on planets planets were the essential way to get things you were limited in how many you could control had to give excess to sectors which were sort of ai controlled space some ressources could also be obtained with mining stations but little and had a maintenance cost making it very light completely changed to be a lot more complicated and more ressource intensive both in terms of ingame and performance they increased how many pops are on each planet by about 5 to 10 times then tried to reduce how fast pop grew which turned a planet that filled previously in 20 years in 120 but any later planets would fill in even longer so much so that usually 5th or 6th colonies and beyond are never populated enough busy with basics to produce meaningful amounts ressource in space were increased by about 3 to 5 times making them extremely worthwhile and cheap so even if you do get more territory there s not just 2 minerals or one loosy energy which sadly empowers having a lot of territory a lot two ressources were completely moved over to be produced in space only for a lot of people because it allows them to focus more on rushing tech or fleets you can move over your entire food production to starbases and mineral gathering to mining stations which again empower those who have territory over those that dont one ressource used to be passively gained unity for most people it was passive some mandatory jobs produced it and that s fine but now they reduced or removed ways to gain it passively like that by pushing some upkeep and costs to it how do you gain more by having people work on it of course you have the territory and workforce for it of course especially since they made influence the conquest money not be used in anything but conquest so you need more pops working jobs to gain a ressource that give not technologies some of which are drastic in their effects so influence now used to have general costs to it from diplomatic stuff no more or so little it does not matter so most if not all of it is spent on expansion and claims problem is since there s no sink and they added one more way to gain it uh you have too much and the only way to spend it is to claim other people s territory that you can then take from them however system claims are sort of cheap because of that i ve been through multiple wars were it started at 4 claims okay that s not a lot to 14 to 20 during said war i need to insist that it costs even more during a war to place claims oh and the new way to gain influence they added the more fleet you have the more you gain its a ratio over another number however here s what it actually does in gameplay the attacker keeps gaining more influence because they keep winning so they can keep claiming more and more it all goes back to the problem where the only way to play is to ceaselessy expand any alternative does not work for various reasons on a game that thrives on its roleplay potential there is no diplomacy no real way to pester someone diplomatically the ai however has random events towards you that feels like it but player and player only through espionage and you don t have any feedback or involvement about it which i need to remind techs and other things make espionage harder to happen
