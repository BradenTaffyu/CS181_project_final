2018 early access review i can t recommend this game anymore i along with the entire userbase has been waiting for a year on a major release the developers don t really keep us in the loop and appear to get tunnelvision focusing on shiny objects meanwhile players potential and long term don t know what s happening and think development has crashed of course i will have response comments that say alpha game hur dur my response to that is software development is a business you need to be open to your customer needs or you won t have a business for long that original reply was written in august 2018 i tried 7dtd when it hit a19 because people were being optimistic about the improvements the fps compared to the last few revisions has improved the game is clunky for lack of a better word yet ugly at the same time and it hits your gpu harder than something that looks like an xbox 360 game should hope these guys come around because i loved a14 this sucks atm
