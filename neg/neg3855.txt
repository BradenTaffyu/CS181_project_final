2015 early access review i m not one to talk poorly of game developers but i feel this needs to be said so i ll give a fair review of alpha 13 as i go visually this latest update did very well most everything looks noticeably better alpha 13 essentially made the game copy more aspects of ark survival s interface so if you like that interface you ll likely enjoy this factor a bit more the costs for items is a little crazy now it seems almost randomly chosen with no real rhyme or reason some items are changed to the point they are useless now example for the same amount of materials in alpha 12 instead of making 25 arrows you make one yes a single arrow while this is more realistic without increasing the power of the arrows to actually make them useful at one arrow per craft you basically just made them useless as it took multiple arrows in the head to kill zombies at higher difficulties anyway so you ll spend just as much time gathering supplies for arrows in the early game as you would trying to customize your base all of this is understandable and fine here s the big problem they completely broke the spawns for zombies even at low spawns on the second to lowest difficulty on the first night yes the first night you can literally fight an endless amount of zombies if you re spotted even once a single screamer zombie banshee will call a horde if it spots you normally a single horde isn t too bad but the problem comes with the additional screamers which spawn close to the end of nearly every horde before it s actually finished nearby zombies can alert them to your presence and if they see you they scream and summon another horde this is nearly impossible to avoid at all times in the early game as you don t have any feasible way to destroy screamers at a distance or avoid screamers if they happen to catch you in your house at the wrong time so if you get spotted once most of the time it s game over after a long grueling fight which makes you just not want to play anymore up until alpha 13 i would have gladly recommended this game but until this is fixed i would recommend steering clear of 7 days to die
