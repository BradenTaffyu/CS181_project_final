2019 i am a huge civilization fan i may not have played every game like others but i ve spent a large amount of time playing civ 4 5 and even beyond earth when i saw the trailer for civ 6 i couldn t have been more exited i even decided to pay extra for the digital deluxe edition which at the time said it would come with the expansions that would eventually be released the game is solid not as amazing as previous entries but it s fun the new mechanics like religious wars and the new ways builders work is a lot of fun i was really enjoying the game unfortunately i can t recommend this game because of how 2k has handled it this game s eula basically tells you that it will steal all of your information i m sure you ve seen this in other reviews but that s not my only issue on top of the disgusting invasion of privacy that is their eula they make it so the additional civs you can play as that you can pay for have a huge edge so players have to buy them so stand a chance against others who have already purchased it all that is enough for me to tell you not to buy this game but i have personally been burned be 2k with how they handled this game as i said i purchased the digital deluxe edition and at the time i was told by 2k that it would include the expansion packs when the expansion packs came out i noticed i didn t have them in my steam library so i reached out ro 2k they had apparently removed the promised expansions from the digital deluxe edition which i understand but i paid for the expansions and i didn t receive them they had no intention of giving me the expansions i was promised and for that i urge you to not buy this product i wish words could express the huge disappointment and resent i have in 2k for how they handled this title
