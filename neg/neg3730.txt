seems version 1 0 needed to be pushed out fast skills are no longer gained via using them thinks which made morrowind oblivion and skyrim so fantastic you need to go loot and find books to gain skill levels the clothes are no longer there you have outfits and 4 slots for all assassine outfit lumberjack etc you no longer need to find clay to form and smelt a bottle get murky water cook it into water and make tee out of it and after drinking you had an empty bottle no now you throw away your bottle and the rain collector is making bottles out of nowhere the complexity is gone completely also even when bought the console version which promised full access to 1 0 they need to buy the game again and only get a small bonus everything done right in the past is gone that s not how to make games better
