2023 the story is extremely shallow you are dropped in the game and you are immediately a super hero i should also add you have absolutely no back story at least when rowling introduces us to the boy who lived it starts from the beginning and develops harry prior to hogwarts not only are you the immediate super hero you start off as a 5th year student likely to do with the larger demographic of hp fans are in their 30s now and the studios thought it might not be appealing to play as an 11 year old but you still could come up with something such as starting off the game as a first year at 11 and that be the tutorial and as the tutorial is going along you re quickly going through the years where you learn who it is that you are playing as and at the end of the tutorial is when you are beginning your 5th year instead they decided to just throw you in as an underdeveloped character beginning his first year as a 5th year as this already amazing wizard that the player did nothing to achieve that in game admittedly my suggestion is shallow at best too but it is still far more developing than what we got then to make it worse when you re going through your classes you re constantly showered with wow thats amazing it took me years to figure that out alas the immediate super hero your character is also aware of who the main antagonist is and who his right hand man is yet you the actual player has no idea i mean who ranrok is as a character you personally have nothing to go off of lets talk about risk vs reward there isn t any early on during a quest you get a notification saying that you cannot wander the castle at night without risk of getting in trouble yet i do it every single night and literally no one stops you there are several times where i have broken the rules and there is 0 tangible punishment you help steal ingredients from the potions profs office then you get caught but thank god you made such a good potion and the professor just says well i like people who take responsibility for their actions you made a great potion today that was no easy task going back to showering the player with wow youre amazing also i should add that you don t actually do anything to make the potion it is all done in what is essentially a cutscene another example of there being no punishment when you learn how to fly you have the option to veer off course with a classmate and take the scenic route thus breaking the rules you get caught the prof says both of us will be penalized by taking a hefty amount of points away from your house and that should deter you from doing it again there is no house cup therefore there was no punishment therefore no reason for me to taper my behavior also why the hell is there no house cup wasn t this game supposed to give you a feel for being a hogwarts student and also why the hell is there no quidditch you get sorted very early on and the headmaster who is kind of a villian but you never interact with says due to an injury on the quidditch pitch there will be no quidditch season this year what injury the school year just started the students just arrived so how could there have been an injury why is there no quidditch flying is in the game so is the quidditch pitch outside the quidditch pitch there are students in their quidditch house robes volleying bludgers around you also find the snitch flying around in the room of requirement quidditch isnt even a complicated game the assets are there put it in the game mark my words quidditch already exists within the game at launch and they will soon release quidditch dlc and that dlc will just allow you to play it rather than adding it to the game similar to what ea did with mass effect did years ago also in the main menu screen the snitch sometimes flies around your head basically mocking you side objectives are mediocre at best its just mostly go collect this stuff or go kill these goblins and bring me my loot back on the topic of quests in general the game just points you exactly where to go which is odd in a game that is supposed to be immersive and open world rather it just holds your hand there is one side mission that has you look for these objects that are usually high above you and even if it is not your specified objective if you enter a room and one is in there your character will tell you to look up in a very indirect but direct way then there is gearing why in an hp universe game is there gearing even then it also lacks depth it honestly feels like an exploration device cause they could not come up with anything clever to entice you to explore more the only real cool thing about the game is adventuring the school however as a whole due to the fact of extremely shallow story narrative and very forced plot devices and no house cup and quidditch i would strongly strongly advise that you do not purchase this game until they come out add features to it to make the game worth playing or it is on a massive sale
