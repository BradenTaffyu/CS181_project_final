2014 if you re playing on windows then go for it the game is great if however like me you d like to play on linux then forget it the port is buggy i played a couple of hours and got a number of visual artifacts slowdowns and one time after loading a battle the display was completely black with only the unit indicators and interface overlay visible not recommended edit so maybe morons stop commenting on this yes i have 150 hours of play no that s not with the linux version
