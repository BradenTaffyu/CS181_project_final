2018 my humble review about the game i loved i have more than 300 hours at my ps account and have been playing this game for a couple of years now i was always happy while playing this game awesome visuals sounds balanced and some minor bugs it was an adictive and easy to grind game that you would t lose interest at now you are propably wondering why i gave this game a bad review well here why last few updates policies and a craazy amount of grindingfirst of all the developers are doing a great job updating adding new planes and tanks fixings bugs etc the problem is that the game itself is becoming more and more paytowin and gaijin is trying hard to push new players into buying a premium account especially now that grinding to get a tier 4 or 5 tank is a pain in the a what s even more sad is that gaijin is not listening to its playerbase base especially the ones that have been playing for years mixed with the bad policies and new paytowin system the game is becoming more and more unbalanced and people lose interest in the first couple of games each day it has simply become a boring and not so fun game to play at the momentto sum up the game has lost it s own roots and these were what made this game popular and fun to play i love this game but the current state of it is just sad
