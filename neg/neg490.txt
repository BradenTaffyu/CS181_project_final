2022 biggest pile of i ever had the displeasure of playing i have a rig about twice as powerful as the recommended specs very fast internet and this piece of garbage literally freezes for 25 seconds every time i go even close to watoga poseidon powerplant or any place where energy wielding enemies might be even worse my whole pc gets a seizure it looks no better than fo4 yet runs a million times worse if you have some spare money and you want to buy this game my advise is to go to the toilet and flush the money you will get more satisfaction from doing that than playing this poor excuse of a aaa game
