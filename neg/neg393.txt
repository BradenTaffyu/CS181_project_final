2020 before writing this review i have had about 60 hours already on the bethesda launcher so as im writing this review im at the 110 hours mark i wanted to first finish the wastelanders story before writing a review but since a game breaking bug occured decided this game was not worth my time anymore maybe ill take a break up to that point i was on board and quite enjoyed it you just cant have essential immortal npc s turn hostile during a main mission its unacceptable you cant even knock them out like you can in fallout 4 which sometimes resets them to get back on that point it would have been hours of grinding ammo and repair junk the good stuff the dialogue and reputation system is better than fallout 4 voice acting is on point throughout crafting is better than previous entries world space has more interesting locations and its exploration is more rewarding than previous entries better enemy variety although schorchbeasts are basicly skyrim dragons good lighting and the game can look picturesque sometimes wastelanders update brought improved game stability with not a single crash in 51 hours and only 2 game breaking bugs happened to me during that time some good new weapons armors and other unique items the bethesda charm that is carrying all their games the bad stuff missions are grindy and become a chore when you think you can finally move the plot forward they give you more fetch objectives to complete it started getting irritating i know mmo games are supposed to be like that but it is done to a fault here games keep automaticly adding quests and events on your pip boy you need to tweak settings to make it stop but you can only stop it from showing up on your screen the human npc characters can become annoying after sometime because they keep repeating the same lines way too often you outlevel items too fast witcher 3 also has this problem level scaling is broken you go into a low level quest area and because some guy with level 50 pass through there now the area is populated with level 50 mobs visual glitches still not fixed i dont care why this company has made millions they should be throwing money at it so it looks decent at least at this point i think they are unable to fix those issues horendous reflections when it rains everything has that weird glossy look textures look horrible unless your rig can do 4k then you can bump up the texture quality and it will look at least like the best a ps3 game can do and not lag for the most part the inventory management is bad and a detriment to the experience you need the subscription in order to have access to the unlimited scrap box and actually enjoy the game if you think pay 2 win doesnt apply i would say it is pay 2 enjoy mod support is mia private worlds are not private servers they are just recycled empty public sessions think of them like friends invite only sessions in gta online but the loot doesnt refresh not fallout bethesda seems to think that what fallout is its 50s retro futurism and tongue and cheek happy go lucky attitude fallout was and can be a lot more than that the game doesnt even look like a post apocalyptic world it looks more like a tsunami hit the area instead of the whole planet being nuked only buy this game if it costs less than 20eu or or you just cant get enough of a fallout fix out of the 5 previous entries its not worth anymore unless they magicly fix it and get rid of the subscription model and macrotransactions yes theres nothing micro about a 18 eu power armor skin update i finished the wastelanders storyline nothing changed of my opinion
