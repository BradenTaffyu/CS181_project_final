sadly a huge disappointmenta big fan of the bronze age and long time fan of ca but this title is disappointing on so many levels the game is set at the end of the 13th century bce at a time when historically the 18th egyptian dynasty came to an end and bronze age civilisation began to collapse it s a time when the world witnessed re emergent and nascent powers neo assyrians israel edom moab ammon etc the period is a prime setting for all the grandeur glory grit gore and gruesome politics and diplomacy of this interesting part of human history rameses iii held off a massive invasion of sea peoples only to be murdered by an ambitious second wife alas you won t find any of that here what ca have offered is an over simplistic over saturated cartoonish depiction with so many developmental shortcuts generic lifeless depictions and frustrating features that render the game quickly repetitive and dull there s negligible trade or diplomacy but the memory leak associated with both ui screens persists don t get me started on how long the ai turn cycles take add to this the developer s apathy in historical fidelity needless artistic license when historical reality was sexier chariots not depicted historically accurate etc and fixated political priorities and the title soon looses it s lustre even for the most die hard historical fan one of the most notable examples is the decision to remove israel as an extant faction within the game this decision was taken despite the game s starting pharaoh merneptah having made a big deal about fighting them in the period and the yaweh worshipping hebrews having come to dominate canaan from the 12th century bce professor eric cline after 1177 bc these and these alone have been white washed from the historic setting not only did the developer see the need to remove the faction but they rendered the territory that was then held by that faction as impassable blobs in the middle of the map what the developer has offered is a plethora of generic cultural factions some of which are quasi mythical or anachronistic 400 500 years before their time factions who often have little differentiation or dept and an endless sea of generic lacking geo cultural nuance settlements to conquer the developer has offered the dynasty edition with some extra free content but in reality it s just more of the same lipstick on a pig i desperately wanted to love this title but after 200 hours of gameplay i ve refunded the product is it worth it if you re a total war fan or history nerd you ll soon find the game lacking in any substance devoid of ambience or immersion and full of copy paste adversaries if a casual gamer new to the franchise you may be entertained for a period but your hard earned dollar may find better service elsewhere imho
