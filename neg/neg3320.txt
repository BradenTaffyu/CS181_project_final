2016 too expensive and simplified the ai commanders are pretty and cant really manage your units so you have to micromanage which is what they wanted you to stop doing because nobody had the patience to micromanage in hoi 3 the way they balance divisions is pretty much high attack low organization organization value means how long your men can fight so if you have a lot of it you can fight for much longer than the enemy this feels like a bad idea since it forces you to make divisions with less stuff like artillery or tanks since you wont be able to fight for a long time with them you take a province with them then the enemy pushes you back because your tanks dont know what to do after one battle the game feels like a eu iv mod with modern units really you keep all your men on the frontline or you keep them miles away not like in hoi 3 where you kept divisions right behind the fronline in case the enemy pushed you back the ai commander refuse to let you micromanage it will take back control of your men all the time and move them away to other provinces even if it causes a cap in the line the game is pretty looks neat but weather and terrain view isnt in the game theres terrain and weather though you can see what terrain and weather there is on the map but its not easy with the colours on the map that show your borders navies are a bit better than in hoi 3 but naval battles dosent show what each ship is doing like it did in hoi3 it shows how close they are to each others and if you hover on them with the mouse you see how damaged they are thats it the sound they always make when a naval battle start even if its just a convoy being raided is annoying and will make you want to commit a nuclear bombing on your own capital theres also no way to affect supply convoys if you want to have a short convoy with supplies going over the english channel to england as germany with france conquered you re fresh out of luck theres a much bigger chance your convoys will do the dumb thing and go from germany and travel trough two sea regions which the game divides the oceans into which makes them ripe picking for enemies ships if you dont have a lot of ships to send on convoy protection and have a few to clear the entire sea region out you ll lose most of your supplies and re enforcements at sea instead of letting you send ships from around france in a short distane this is not guaranteed to happend but it most likely will specially if you want to take out england quickly and dont want them to become a unbeatable island fort which they will become rather fast unless their ai decides to send all their toops to some colony somewhere colonies they did the europa universalis thing and decided to let any big colony be a separate state who is puppeted by main nations so dutch east indies arent a part of the netherlands directly but are a puppet on their own reducing your direct industrial and supply gain since the colony will be trying to create its own troops and supply them before sending you supplies i m rather sure they do send you supplies though this is a dumb feature in my opinion i can understand doing this to india but the dutch east indies shouldn not count as a puppeted state but more of a branch of the dutch why well i ve never heard of the dutch east indies having any form of plan or ability to break out of the dutch nation and do its own united thing just doesnt feel plausable while i do feel like india should be a puppeted state as it s actually a state which could have broken off from the english empire if it had the proper channels and power the game is too expensive with too many bugs right now if it didnt have mods it would be unplayable its really made to be mass market and feels like a game you find for free on your phone its not a hearts of iron game its more like a hybrid europe universalis and more manpower if you loved hearts of iron 3 this game wont be like it much the combat is too lacking to be apealing and the only real fun part is the industry mechanic too many features need work and a lot of changes will be needed to make it anywhere as deep and immensive as hoi 3 was they mixed too much europe universalis into the game to make it a hearts of iron game the game is hollow to the point a 10 year old can play this and win it just dosent feel serious anymore sometimes something will happend that makes you laugh i guess but in the end its just too dumbed down to make you happy with the waste of 40 euro or whatever price it is where you live an issue with hoi 3 was that people didnt understand it right of the bat and didnt really spend any time in the forum or thinking about it this game fixed that by having a very simple and easy interface which tells you all you need to know mostly exept when a battle is lost or won the map itself cant show you if you lost ground in the war unless you knew the pre war borders and such people choose to hate hoi 3 because they didnt understand it after their first try and since you understand this game at the first try they love it and shame any other opinion its a shame you cant really discuss this game with someone who likes it they just tell you that you cant understand the game and that its gods own gift to mankind while hoi 3 was the devil itself the community really shows itself in gold in that manner which is a shame i really just hope they will fix the balance high attack shouldnt mean forced short battles the game was made to be mass market as hell unlike hearts of iron 3 which had a learning curve that took a while to learn this game got a 5 minute trip to learn everything really a shame that they took the series to this level just for the money also the tech tree ends in 1946 where in hoi 3 it ends in 1962 for many things its dumbed down into oblivion the ai is bad for an example the japanese cant ever win in china it seems sometimes they do good untill they decide to base all their men in finland if they are in the same faction or declare war on the soviet union without having any men on those borders after that japan just turns into a island nation that never does anything ever again i know this will be downvoted into hell but its honestly the way of the game i wouldnt buy it unless you are rich or unless its on a 50 sale it just feels so hollow if you are new to the series its good the game isnt deep and got a very tiny to unexisting learning curve its quick and fun unless the ai commanders it up for you you can take over the world and do so pretty much without doing more than drawing some lines on the map its not a stressing game unless you try to micromanage but its not worth the 40 euro if it was 20 euro or your respective local money in that price it would have been a great game for the money but sadly its just overpriced its not worth it at this point edit 2017 summer sale ai commanders still crap nothing new is added exept 20 euro dlc s commanders have been improved a little but this may just be my mods but it is nowhere near enough ai might be getting military power points to improve their divisions without having to fight or do massive military drills but i can not confirm this i think this is the case because i ve met the soviet union in 1941 with different division designs from game to game which is weird because the soviet union rarely has any major comflicts in my games usually and divisions still cost a lot to change mods can change this costs but either the ai wont work with the mods which means they do nothing and keep the same divisions or the ai overuses these and will empty their manpower to make every division in the field invinsible untill you kill enough men so they cant replace them of course only improvement has been the air force interface looks better but mechanics are still odd
