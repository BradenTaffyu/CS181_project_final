2015 personally i would not recommend starting to play this game in the current state it is in and you must be willing to buy premium if you want to stay sane when you get to late tiers oh and dont bother getting to late tiers in tanks or planes because its just not fun tank matchmaking sucks lets match a low tier 4 against top tier 5 s because thats a good idea i feel sorry for anyone who is currently trying to research tier 4 tanks as soon as you get their you will just be matched against tier 5 where you can literally do nothing but run and pray you dont get rekt by one of the many t54 s i was researching the maus but gave up in the end and just boosted my way there because of the endless slaughter of being matched against stuff i can even pen you want to have fun in tanks play in tier 3 and lower planes are similar i mean we ve all had that moment when we just want to kill ourselfs when we get rekt by that 3 7 fw which is placed in tier 2 because logic which will ruin anything in its path i mainly play britian planes and i never seem to actually be killed by anything but a yak lag fw or bf i think you stand more of a chance in planes being match against high tier planes because theyre all made out of paper yes they can out run you but atleast you still stand a chance unlike tanks i just wish planes actually had some more good maps they re all so repetitive boring and all so open taking away the 2x for your first battle at first seemed like a good idea with it being replaced with the daily rewards you would be wrong in thinking the more days you play the better stuff you would get in fact you re actually better off just playing it every other day for example im on the 148th day now and ive just got a 10 silver lions boost im so glad i ve been loyal to the game for this long so i can get rewarded like this they should start adding big golden eagle drops when you get past 100 days i mean there is literally nothing that makes me want to continue this streak apart from my head telling me that there might yet be something good this game is also now turning p2w with all these rocket tanks they are bringing out as premium tanks and then placing them in tier 2 so no overall i don t think people should start playing this game unless you want to make yourself go insane or until the devs actually listen and fix this up game edit just hit my 149th day and got 4 silver lion boosts of and a silver lion wager 10 10 would waste life away again
