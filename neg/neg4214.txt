2015 pros most wide maps of any shooting game that i have played mods really make arma modding community is really good powerful map editor and scripting languagecons really badly implemented multi threading resulting in horrible performance inconsistent and buggy scripting language with many flaws netcode is still not very stable game and mods require approximately 100gb hard disk space modding community is scattered so compability is a issue arma with many mods is generally hugely instable that there is saying arma happened when you crash or die for unknown reason game is only 32 bit so it will use your pagefile as ram extension game can only use 25 of cpu or gpu because the mainthread is full of bottlenecs crippeling the performancethis game makes me feel very controversial as i love the game and the concept of the game but the game engine is based on technology from 19th century thus making the game unplayable
