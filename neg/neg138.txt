2019 early access review project incomplete review was done on october 5th 2019 and will be going off of the game s current status project zomboid is a fairly deep survival game where you play as some loser who attempts to scavenge supplies and survive for as long as possible there s no campaign yet but there are some special scenarios that add special mechanics like a constant winter or a horde survival mode there s a lot of customization before you play the game where you can make homes stocked with stuff or make the entire city barren with hordes and hordes of zombies that run fast and kill you in one hit the amount of resources scattered throughout the game i think is enjoyable as it really feels like the world was lived in instead of just finding one or two types of food items the combat is simplistic enough where you just click to hit or shoot until the target dies but going against a large amount of zombies is always a bad idea you aren t an invincible hero you are vulnerable and one bite can lead to an eventual game over as you in real time succumb to infection this can lead to some very intense moments as you hide in a room and hope the zombies forget about you or try to escape through the window risking your legs breaking then you have to find a splint and can t run for a while you ll find yourself role playing as you watch the days go by and attempt to keep those juicy survival meters up they re fair enough and you can adjust them if you feel them going down too slowly or too quickly there s no real punishment for some going down which brings us to the ultimate critique this game is unfinished and it shows i bought this game on desura which if you don t know was kind of like a steam clone for indie games which was about 7 or so years ago at this point i can point out the differences since then on my hands this is not a good thing the developers constantly push out their news letters the devs actually changed them to monthly because people were complaining so much and make promises but instead of updating what people want they barely make any progress on anything there s no other survivors no real depression mechanics farming is painful building is pointless and the animations are bad the female model still clips through the pants when she walks how is this not fixed after so many years therefore it s left to the modders to fix the game and honestly they do a pretty damn decent job they added new locations decent survivor mechanics items and plenty of other actual gameplay mechanics this should be embarrassing for the developers as a modder added mechanics they promised for years quicker than the actual game developer what s baffling to me is that npcs were in the game twice once when the game launched and then years later and there was even a nice little tutorial the developer 6 years later added the map back in as a challenge map but no story or tutorial with it why why take away features i cannot recommend this game because you shouldn t support the developers but the gameplay itself with mods is actually really fun just look at my play time this game is a prime culprit of the never going to be finished indie game pros incredibly immersive survival mechanics that are going to have you want to role playthere is a multiplayer that may help you fill the void of no npcsmodding community is phenomenal the environment and world feels really lived in and the game dynamically changes the longer you surviveyou ll find yourself experiencing really tense moments of survival as you face impossible odds and dying from infection for the first time was one of my favorite video game experiences cons developer constantly promises updates that never come to fruition and when they do come out after years they aren t what the players wantevery game is going to turn out the same and if you don t download a map mod you re going to get boredfiring a gun is a death sentence and with no silencers it s pointless make sure you check on silent cars otherwise they face the same issueyou are weak extremely weak and with no way to add to any defenses even protection against the cold is minimal protection was added years after cold mechanics were introduced water graphics are awful verdict 4 5 10
