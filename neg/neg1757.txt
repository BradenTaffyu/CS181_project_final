2023 i ve played this game for years sunk hundreds of hours into it watched it go from just a plane game to nearly every form of combat all rolled into one and i cannot recommend this game for years the in game economy has been getting nerfed by the devs so much so that it s practically harmful to play without paying this game has slowly changed and its getting to the point where you can barely classify this as free to play anymore if you aren t paying for the premium bonuses and using the premium vehicles sold for the price of entire aaa games you just wont make money you wont compete on an even field you wont unlock the cool stuff and you definitely wont enjoy the game if you want to play cool ww2 vehicles don t bother the devs couldn t care less about balancing the tiers that fight each otherif you want to play modern vehicles don t bother the devs won t let you get to them without paying for boosted research gain or out right buying them for absurd pricesif you want to play for warships don t bother the devs can t take the time to make the gamemode good or stop bots from filling the lobbiesif you re looking for a fun and engaging vehicle combat game don t bother with this one for every good thing in this game there are countless other bad things that will start ruining your enjoyment after a very short amount of time
