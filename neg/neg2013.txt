2023 terrible company in their latest post on 19 may 2023 they feel the need to go in depth and explain what f2p games are as if we are a bunch of toddlers they claim many players are f2p yet battles are constantly filled with premium vehicles they claim that vehicles should not be statistically stronger in battles yet some vehicles are overpowered because that nation has many players statistically reducing win rates in contrast other nations are underpowered because they have a small dedicated player base well above the average skill level raising win rates and getting nerfs they try antagonising the players by telling them to stop review bombing and post constructive criticism on their forums yet those forums are often ignored and their moderators even mock people for complaining see reddit for screenshots this company is so high in the clouds that they think they did absolutely nothing wrong and are just trying to antagonise us the players because they are unwilling to take feedback from their own channels we have to result to platforms such as steam to get them to do something and guess what it s working because they are directly responding to all the events that are happening just imagine if no one took part they would continue as is and ignore the community but because their revenue stream is being affected that s when they remember to do something about it since they re antagonising us for trying to shut the game down then by all means i ll keep telling people to look for other games take your money elsewhere i ll put my money where my mouth is and i ll take my money elsewhere too
