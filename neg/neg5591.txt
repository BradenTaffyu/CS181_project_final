2013 are you into sequels with dumbed down uis braindead ai bugs no challenge missing series features and a bad case of developers milking customers with dlc then this is the perfect game for you see those amazing screenshots on the store page you won t be seeing that stuff ingame the actual graphics are something you would ve seen several generations ago even on maxed settings the alpha gameplay footage looks better than the final version creative assembly knew that rome 2 owners wanted to be called retro gamers and gave us the graphics we wanted so we could claim the title thought the user interface was too intrusive in previous total war games good news creative assembly went with a bare minimal approach this time around unit cards have been replaced with ancient greek pottery looking designs good luck telling some of your units apart when the difference on the card is a tiny squiggle on it s shield previous total war games too hard for you you don t have to worry about that they hired julian mckinlay the developer behind battlefield s ai to come in and strip out any and all ounces of strategy the old ai had and hype up the brand new intelligent ai can t defend you cities no worries the ai never builds siege and when they do they just send 1 unit up a ladder then procede to run through the gate remember how tedious it was to have the ai in previous total war games create advanced units and kill yours no need to worry about that in this sequel the ai will only build it s most basic units and never upgrade them with armor or weapons also mckinlay was kind enough to make the world map ai destroy all its military buildings and build temples and only temples if the cities happiness gets too low easily beat the game on legendary difficulty which would ve been classified as very easy in previous total war games speaking of happiness loved having your cities revolt in previous games well the new public order system makes sure that all your cities are revolting every 4 turns good news though julian mckinlay made sure that the revolted armies never attack and instead die from attrition don t have to worry about facing annoying rebels with the new public order system remember how tedious features like family trees seasons generals stats and complex building systems were in previous total war games good news those are gone just hire a general and he s part of the family 1 turn 1 summer year build a set number of select buildings mostly temples due to public order general doesn t need his loyal or temperamental traits anymore those just make the game too complex thought the previous total war games were too balanced well good news you can be overpowered all you want have 1 elephant general wipe out 1000 troops research boiling oil and go make a sandwich during a city defense while a near endless stream pours out and slaughters your enemy don t recruit a navy cause land units are stronger than naval units when you send them on water too few bugs in previous games there s plenty of those this time around watch the world map disappear watch the game crash again and again and again hope you don t have certain hardware that makes the game unstartable enjoy low fps battles normal speed more like 3x slower than real life speed 3x speed more like normal speed game not working or fun don t go to the steam forums to voice your opinion you re not allowed to complain that the game is bad unless you have no less than 400 hours spent ingame you ll only find buyers remorse this strong on the aliens colonial marines steam forum by the way don t bother complaining that superman 64 is a bad game unless you have 400 hours put into that either don t have 400 hours put ingame yet to complain buy some dlc the creative director of creative assembly said that rome 2 s launch issues were totally unacceptable and what better way to forget about those issues which still persist to this day then buying some paid dlc to forget about the problems get amazing factions which are the same as current factions why play rome and attack gaul when you can buy caesar in gaul and play rome and attack gaul with paid dlc want blood and gore well that basic feature in every other game has been stripped out and is being sold as glorious dlc like the choices that regularly came up in the crusader kings series well good news there s a system in rome 2 that s just like it called political intrigue the political intrigue is so well developed with so much thought put into it that even 3 months after launch not a single person knows how it works or what it does tribal leader blackmailing you well you can retaliate and get 3 chiefs supporting you or ignore it and lose 3 what the chief support does who knows don t have to worry about that pesky senate breathing down your neck like in rome 1 since to this day no one knows what the benefits or downsides to the chief support system are you ll only have to open the interface when you need to promote someone maybe once every 10 hours once again creative assembly knew that we didn t want to navigate through those pesky menus and interfaces to use the political intrigue system tired of the terrible diplomacy in previous titles and the ai ganging up on you and declaring war well good news that diplomacy system has been improved and simplified you ll only need the diplomacy system now to declare war creative assembly knew how annoying it was having to open that screen and form alliances and trade routes you ll no longer have to worry about getting too big and having everyone attack you and end your 100 hour game cause the improvements have made sure that the ai barely ever makes alliances with one another and barely ever declares war on you you ll have no obstacles beating the game on legendary difficulty in this total war game sun tzu probably said something along the lines of something something something something military formations are important to stay in to win or something well historically he was correct but historical is booooooorrrrrrriiiinnggg that always bugged me in previous total war games all your units would stay in tight formations and fight enemies in tight formations well creative assembly decided that it was boring too so instead of fighting in formation all troops now fight in awesome mosh pits yyyaaaaaaa party woooo hated how sssssssslllllllllooooooooowwwwwwwww previous total wars battles were well they ve been sped up those 20 minute battles now last 4 minutes creative assembly knew that we wanted shorter battles and longer load screens and they delivered nothing like waiting 5 minutes after clicking end turn to take your turn great way to work out and get buff if you love strategy games where you have to use zero strategy and can just afk and win 99 of the time and the other 1 you just charge all your units straight toward the enemy then rome 2 is not only for you but game of the year material if aliens colonial marines didn t give you enough buyer s remorse then rome 2 is perfect for you and you ll soon be raiding those steam forums to make sure your money was well spent incase you couldn t tell this is sarcasm and no one should ever buy this game
