2020 war never changes or does it i ll be reviewing the vanilla game with no mods or dlcs and will focus on the main elements and stories of the game the dlcs and mods will not be discussed in this review super mutants mutated animals and insects devious humans ghouls and robots are all part of what makes exploring the wasteland a fun thing to do fallout 4 continues the tradition of the fallout franchise by creating a cool looking world to explore for life resources and deadly ways to exterminate the numerous threats that inhabit the world of commonwealth during your time you may find yourself marveling over the harsh beauty of the world while blasting through enemies or collecting hidden treasures within the many places of commonwealth there is everything that makes exploring the world great but something feels like it is missing from the overall experience there is just something that doesn t make fallout 4 a proper fallout sequel fallout 4 s greatest strengths are what keeps the game fun though the quests while repetitive in nature give you plenty of stuff to do and always nudge you in the right direction towards secrets like bobbleheads and rare magazines or just give you something to do to award you experience to level up your character the gameplay loop is addicting and gives you reasons to revisit places you ve already been in the places that you will be visiting are for the most part detailed and pleasing to the eyes if there is one thing that i can safely praise about fallout 4 is the world and level design i don t think fallout has never looked this good there are small details all over the world and makes scavenging for ammo and supplies as well as junk just a little more fun to do the gunplay has been improved a lot compared to previous releases as well shooting the guns finally feels like well shooting a gun and not just clicking on the enemy and hoping your shot lands the melee combat is pretty much the same though just mash the attack button and watch the enemies die fallout 4 also features a base building mini game which mostly isn t mandatory for story progression it is still a fun addition albeit flawed it does add more content and life to the game though however fallout 4 s strengths stop there while the gameplay has been honed and the world exploration feels good there are a lot of things that are just missing from fallout 4 the main story is dumb and full of plot holes that are just barely passable the story is non logical at times and the main incentive for the main character to explore the world feels just weak in many ways the motive for the main character to explore the world feels weirdly sentimental and hedonistic it is hard to feel anything towards the main character s actions as they don t really make too much sense in short the main story is bad with a few good moments the bad writing doesn t stop in the main quests either the side quests and the four main factions brotherhood of steel the institute the minutemen and the railroad just feel the same they all have slightly different motives but the same goal the factions try to better the world of commonwealth by doing what they think is the right thing to do all factions have unique endings but the payout isn t nearly good enough just to do bunch of errands for any faction you choose to side with and the theme just continues the main story having bad writing as well as a bad motive fills the game feeling dull and nonsensical while the main character s actions are hedonistic you are only allowed to do one thing with pretty much anyone in the game help them this creates a weird parallel between the side quests and the main quests your main goal is something personal yet you are forced to give your everything to others the trade off feels forced and feels like it is trying to tell me something along the lines good things happen to good people yet i never feel like that the loop of helping others creates another and probably the biggest problem in fallout 4 fallout 4 with it s story and quests doesn t feel like a rpg game all roleplaying has been stripped away in favor of a more linear story and world progression i don t know if the game was made that way from the get go considering the game has base building which to be fair must ve taken some time to implement to the game but that doesn t remove the fact that you have no control over your actions in the land of commonwealth you have two options to choose from be a walking who doesn t do any of the side quests or be a living saint and help everyone morale was stripped from the game by making it hard to do bad there are only bad and good guys nothing from in between you can only play as someone who is considered good and you don t have options to anyone over it really feels dumbed down even bethesda s earlier fallout title fallout 3 had options to kill innocent people which made for great roleplaying material don t get me wrong not all games need to be gritty and dark but fallout games have always been filled with grey moralities over the years but not fallout 4 fallout 4 strips all the options to do something the way you the player want to and just present one goal fallout 4 is a flawed game that doesn t treat it s player as something that could think for themselves the story is something not all people like and appreciate and feels so useless it s a shame as fallout 4 is filled with great characters and locations to discover and the base building can be really fun but with all the negatives surrounding fallout 4 it is hard to get to the good stuff and genuinely enjoy it fallout 4 has it s moments and has an addicting gameplay loop that is fun to play however i never felt like i accomplished anything while playing fallout 4
