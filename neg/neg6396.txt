never ever buy the complete or ultimate version of any forza game more so than ever this one tl dr good gameplay and tuning ultimate version and garbage servers ui elements bought that version only to be met with the base game the expansions first four car packs these four dropped with the game then ever couple of months they drop dlc new car packs of which some have cars from previous forza and motorsport titles and have the nerve to ask me to buy those why did you not give it to me since i dropped 100 on this garbage you really expect people who paid 100 to also buy these car packs that potentially have the most broken and fun cars even tho they bought the ultimate edition they don t even give you an option of unlocking those cars through grinding or otherwise even the hardest challenges or accolades seem to only give cosmetics at best forza 5 also has some of the most shortsighted and over all garbage server solution i ve seen thus far and didn t have them up and stable until multiple months after game launch and even now for a game all about driving and interacting with people you won t see anyone unless you sit in a spot for a 2 mins that is because they have split the map into chunks that connect and disconnect players depending on position so if you are fast enough and or happen to not have a perfect connection you can wave goodbye to any social side of this game i love the gameplay the handling is wonderful and the tuning is fulfilling so is it such a shame that the community pages for both livery and tuning are still messed up 3 years after launch lol the levels don t show up i e everyone is lvl 1 and there is no exacting filters liveries are fine because you can use your eyes haha even three years after release people with great tunes will be put next to little timmy who accidentally shared his tune leading to a horrible i hope this tune is good loop unless you know the tuner and trust them overall i seriously hope turn10 make forza 6 a good game and they have to figure out the ui situation seriously people a couple of squares are fine once in a while but if that s all you have makes it terrible to look at and use but for friends that ask me i ll always tell them to not buy this game and buy the hopefully better forza 6 once it comes out but if either forza 4 or forza 5 are on a large sale sure go ahead and buy the base versions the ultimate version is ultimately just not worth it
