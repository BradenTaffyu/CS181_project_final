2016 i own and actively play most of paradox s other 4x strategy games ie vicky 2 europa universalis 4 crusader kings 2 etc i have to say that this game was a dissapointment for me compared to those i found that it was a lot less in depth and it quickly beagn to bore me after a meager 10 hours or so of gameplay now that being said if you are big into the space exploration and expansion genre then you may like it otherwise if you simply enjoy the other paradox games and want to try this one don t that is unless it is on a very good sale thank you for reading this and keep in mind this is simply my own opinion and you may have different views on the game after you play it
