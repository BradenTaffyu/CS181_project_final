2022 i love mount and blade i also like mount and blade 2 i would rather have more updates personally with new content to benefit the actual game i m not sure how the digital companion release makes the actual game play better this brings to m b2 uhm outside lore which you can only experience outside of the game something i love to enjoy while being immersed in my game ah oh wait what did i just say i must be crazy i shoulda just read the wiki i m such a complainer about wanting more stuff within the actual game series i love this is supposed to be a new game with improvements and additional content outside of graphics caravans black smithing the army system tactics and a few new quests the devs haven t brought anything new to the table and i know what you re thinking hey ingredients that seems like alot of new stuff new quests can be added by mods and for warband they were as were tactics the army system and black smithing though rudimentary there are also dozens of other mods for warband i m not gonna mention which change up systems or create whole new ones that are never even touched here in this game in fact 75 of the still interesting content even now is being brought to the table by the precious few lovable modders who work their butts off to help us all enjoy this baseline of a game we love black smithing is cool i suppose but i mean i can just go make gold and buy the best armor caravans are cool i suppose except every time they get canned on the over world i have to manually track them down and restart them it s easier and less time consuming to just take one more castle more fun too that isn t bad but why aren t all of or at least the most balanced these awesome cool useful mods being incorporated into this new improved game the community showed you what they wanted and we got the bare minimum of upgrades for the game to date want to really mess with your garrisons improved garrisons mod the devs don t need to worry about that people are updating our game for freeeeee it s lame when the community needs to pick up literally all of the slack of the developer especially on their second go around do the devs ever need to add more armor nah it s perfect let open source armory handle all that want more companions pick one of the dozens of companion packs this is the example i m using in this instance to show what stagnation ignorance an unwillingness to broaden their own horizons i m not saying the devs aren t doing their best to pump out eh well what exactly have they been pumping out minor changes to troop stats a new map once and a while fixing the problems which were initially created by their own ai or programming i want to believe in this game but i am already regretting throwing down my money for this game so early on in coughs the game i feel like i should ve waited around 5 years from this moment like i had done for the first one and once everything was settled more or less to be free to enjoy the plethora of mods for what ever the last most significant release was and then to enjoy that plus i woulda only paid 5 bucks for it plus i coulda still been playing warband i suppose i still should be want more where should we look why should we look what truly makes this game different gameplay wise from warband i would argue basically nothing it s m b v1 5
