2018 early access review the game is fun and peaceful but right now there is just nothing to do in five hours or so you can build everything there is to build probably doable in 2 or 3 if you tried there just isn t any content right now there is one enemy in the whole game the shark he eats holes in the raft other than that he s not a threat his ai is terrible at hitting the player and with a decent spear you can kill him with very little effort not that it matters he comes back in about two minutes and he s really just there to annoy you way to many items don t do anything stone is for arrows which you don t need and the starter anchor after you get the metal anchor stone is useless copper is only for electronic stuff once you make the antenna and the radio it s useless too glass is for two recipes only clay is only for making bricks way too many things are only for one item when the game already has very few crafting recipes to begin with all you ever really need is plastic rope planks and scrap i wish there was a meh option here the game is ok but right now for 15 it s just way too bare bones to justify it s price
