2016 this is the first review i have ever written for a game and i ve had steam since half life 2 i felt the need to put this review on here to say 2 key things 1 this is a great game in terms of graphics gameplay battles music sound effects etc etc a great total war addition however 2 the greed that ca sega are showing is outrageous the cost for the dlc especially dlc that feels like it should be part of the base game blood and gore is huge 13 quid for beastmen so are you telling me its going to cost me 250 to have your finished game i would recommend anyone who enjoys total war warhammer or strategy in general gets this game but i suggest you wait 2 years till the whole package is on sale for 30 50 quid stop charging your customers hundreds to play games
