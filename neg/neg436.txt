2022 don t let the positive reviews fool you even on sale this game is not the bargain you may think it is i thought hey reviews are mostly positive now must have greatly improved and stability wise yes it does seem they fixed most of the stability bugs i saw others talking about however this is still very poorly managed 26 hours in and already paywalled stash box full in normal survival games you craft a new storage chest and problem solved fallout 76 however has the brilliant idea of making all your storage containers share inventory the only solution to this is to pay for the monthly sub for a scrapbox that they will then deny you access to if you stop paying the monthly sub this is a paid subscription game with a paid demo at it s core this game has promise basically fallout 4 mechanics you can play with friends the management of the game however ruins it if ever they give players full creative freedom and give players the ability to host dedicated servers entirely themselves and do away with the mtx greed this game could be great till then save your money can you play this without signing up for the monthly subscription fee yes but your play experience will be greatly diminished
