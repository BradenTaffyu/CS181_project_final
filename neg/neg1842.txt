2023 call me schizophrenic but i strongly believe that gaijin is purposely downgrading all non russian vehicles to entice players into leaking nato documents as a way of proving to gaijin that the equipment needs a buff russian bias in the top tier is very real in this game and the longer russia flounders their 3 day special operation in ukraine 650 days now lol the more gaijin copes and beefs up russian equipment i can literally find dozens of videos of t 80 and t 90 variants getting blown the out by 80 s expired us equipment but gaijin will still model the t 80bvm and t 90m to be stupidly tanky also the t 90m is the only tank that has a modeled spall liner for some reason despite every other modern tank having one tldr russian bias is atrocious and gaijin keeps doubling down on terrible top tier game balancing
