2023 while this is arguably the best game in the series it s the one where the publisher s terrible dlc policies become most apparent 1 if you don t own warhammer 1 you only get access to the vortex campaign which is story event based there is no free play sandbox campaign in warhammer 2 by default if you ve played other total war games or even most other strategy games you realize how ridiculous this is it s the mode that people spend most of their time in and yet it s locked behind a whole other game to get the most out of wh2 you need to literally buy wh1 and not even play it just let it sit in your library 2 warhammer 1 is a 7 year old game that is still priced at a full 60 and has never to my knowledge been bundled with its dlc obviously it goes on sale but even on sale you re looking at 60 for the game dlcs compare that to say the witcher 3 which was going on sale with all its dlc for 10 when it had been out for less time than wh1 or even paradox games most of which have been bundled with their dlc for 20 in the past again when they were less than 7 years old 3 personally i don t have a huge problem with dlc that adds new races or lords and units that are extra however if we look at the high elves for instance since it s a race i ve played a lot the base game gives you tier 0 and tier 5 spearmen the mid tier spearmen are locked behind a dlc the game gives you tier 0 through tier 2 archers all of the higher tier archers are locked behind dlc including the only archers with armor piercing note i m not counting the sea guard with shields since they are not actually better archers in fact the sea guard in general have less range and less damage than the tier 0 archers i m also not counting alith anar s shadow walkers since they re restricted to his faction but spearmen and archers are the high elves bread and butter this is especially true on higher difficulties where the player s infantry receives significant debuffs by the time you reach the mid game with this incomplete roster your tier 0 spearmen are getting melted and your archers are just tickling your heavily armored opponents even the handmaiden hero and arch mage lord are locked behind dlc while not providing anything that other heroes lords for other factions don t already provide again i don t have a problem with extra units being added to dlc and that was largely what the warhammer 1 dlc did for instance the dwarfs didn t have any major holes in their unit roster in the base game the dlcs just added a little more flavor and variety most of the wh1 dlcs actually added entirely new factions whereas it s the complete opposite in wh2 almost everything here is lords and units with only a few new races and even the lords which i don t have a problem with in theory create basic holes in the gameplay since you can t confederate the lords that you don t own the dlc for you see that would let you play with them in your army without paying and we can t have that how about you just let me confederate their faction so i can actually play the game and don t add the lords to my roster no no that doesn t give enough incentive for people to pay up there have to be holes in the basic game and roster that can only be filled with money and we can see where this increasingly annoying dlc policy has led to warhammer 3 being in a very bad state at launch and still lacking behind ii in key features like campaign ai but that hasn t stopped them from releasing their most expensive dlc to date with the chaos dwarfs now with all that being said is warhammer 2 fun yes and i say that as a long time total war fan but i would not recommend it at full price almost 6 years after release nor would i recommend supporting these absurd dlc policies i bought wh1 and wh2 on deep sale after playing and enjoying the free copy of wh1 i got on epic and will only buy a couple dlcs here and there also on deep sale despite ca s best attempts in wh2 you don t need the dlc to enjoy yourself and you won t have time to experience it all at once anyways
