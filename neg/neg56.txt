2017 early access review first let me start off by saying i absolutely love this game however i can not recommend it this game is by far one of my favorite zombie survival games its innovative its fun its immersing but it seems to be stuck in the forever early access cycle that almost all of these types of games get caught in i ve waited literally years the devs to fulfill their promises regarding npc s animations and cars they always say the release is right around the corner but it s taken 3 years to get around that corner i have very high expectations for this game and i sincerely hope that the game will soon be complete but as it looks now we re still a long ways off whenever the promises the devs have made are fulfilled there will be no problem in changing this review to a positive one but until then i simply can not recommend anyone purchase this game at its current state unless they don t mind living on so far empty promises
