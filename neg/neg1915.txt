2014 i ll start listing the issues in a moment when a developer deliberately lengthens in game progression with the intent of encouraging people to buy their way through the roadblocks i think twice about whether or not i should support their product i think thrice when the game is still in beta and the micro transactions store allowing character progression premium features and premium aircraft is fully implemented war thunder is not alone in this practise and does not go to the lengths that other games do but this is not a valid excuse now because the developer is doing all of this whilst the rest of the game is unfinished no criticism should be reigned because it is still in beta following that logic i ll give a summary list of my gripes discovered through the 200 hours i ve had in the beta the replay system is horribly unfinished the ui for it is almost entirely missing along with the entire in game chat bomber turrets do not animate and sounds are frequently absent the in game ui is poor is often hard to see against the terrain or background and does not do enough to convey information to the player useful details such as the fuel timer are inexplicably disabled by default the game menus are an improvement but once again certain pieces of information are hard to see at first glance or obscured in another menu for example you cannot view the historical data on your selected plane unless you enter the customisation hangar the matchmaking system is incredibly frustrating badly designed and made even worse than before due to recent changes matchmaking will never be perfect in any game but in war thunder i have nothing positive to say about this atrocious system games should never punish players for doing well being skilled or playing with their friends yet that is exactly what this system does the spread of planes across nations is strange with firepower and battlefield roles varying greatly not every nation has access to a fighter bomber or bomber early on particularly germany some nations have a wider variety of fighters russia for example and some fighters are too well armed and too manoeuvrable for their level again a game balance issue some planes such as the swordfish a british torpedo bi plane are rendered useless due to a complete absence of naval targets for their level some planes are the opposite the i 153 soviet bi plane has unique access to rockets and bombs which all other bi planes do not have most plane names are given as easy to confuse number letter designations despite the fact that all planes had names even after 200 hours i could not remember that the ju 87 is a stuka i can remember blenheim swordfish spitfire etc but the others i had to correct this review because i got the ki 53 mixed up with the i 153 so in most matches i had no idea what i was fighting the currency system is completely and utterly irrelevant to the game ammunition and repair purchasing is trivial the currency system exists as a lever through which the developer can push their micro transactions and progression purchasing the progression system as mentioned is deliberately slow to encourage purchasing this is compounded by experience for each plane crew for each nation being different this actively discourages players from trying other nations and does nothing beneficial for the experience worthy of note is the ace qualification this is a plane crew upgrade which cannot be earned through the in game currency and normal play it is an upgrade which can only be purchased with real money and adds a significant amount of power to your plane and stacks with the other crew qualifications here more than anywhere else in war thunder is the definition of pay to win and there should be no argument this is a purchase of power with real money which has a direct impact on game balance and cannot be earned through in game progression the patching system through the launcher is atrocious cpu intensive and has twice prevented me from playing for over a week the launcher uses their own custom torrenting system which is vastly inferior to any freely available torrent software because it refused to function correctly i was unable to play war thunder for two months since the last big patch i had to get a copy of the game files all in russian through bittorrent in order to get it working the fact that this system remains unchanged is beyond ridiculous there are added problems in historic and full real battles or whatever they re called now i have encountered issues with the in game instructor fighting me for control of the plane this was particularly evident during the first few attempts of historic mode when i would crash uncontrollably on the runway or slowly drop out of the sky even when disabled the game instructor regularly fights the player for control of the plane during a sharp but controllable turn this causes the plane to wobble alarmingly during a turn forcing it to turn even slower than usual the above problem does not exist in arcade mode because the problem comes as part of the realism package that makes the plane handling sluggish there are also issues with fuel tank sizes being too small for some lower level planes and maps being too big the two problems are linked by the way to briefly mention the meta problems i have noticed an alarming attitude with regards to the three game modes particularly from moderators the opinion of the invested is to snub arcade mode and those who play it as being sub par with the prevailing defence for complaints being you do not have a right to complain about game balance if you play arcade mode frankly this is a rather disgusting attitude to have which i suppose could be akin to some sort of elitism i have played many hours on historic mode and if you put the choice to me i would choose arcade in a heartbeat if historic full real are the way it s meant to be played then it should actually be fun to fly the bally planes and finally gaijin entertainment is also notable for the trademark abuse and legal bullying of brandon harris which started in may 2013 and is still ongoing i can t link here but i recommend you search for that couple this with allegations of censorship of criticism on forums they control and you have further relevant information for anyone considering a purchase of war thunder so how can i conclude this the sad part is that there is a terrific warplane simulator here which feels great to fly has a reliable physics engine and has realistic damage models that put rival titles to shame but all of this is buried under bad design decisions micro transactions and a company of dubious integrity which i do not trust to fix war thunder s problems before launch
