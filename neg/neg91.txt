2023 early access review for the price it s a great game and it s fun for a little while the main problem project zomboid faces is the complete lack of any end game content so once you ve killed 1 000 zombies cleared out the mall and built a little base for yourself you re going to immediately get bored i ve played several open world survival craft style games and this one is missing things to do and it s a big miss we can only hope that future updates remedy this but as for right now it s going to get old super fast
