2023 i d prefer it if these reviews allowed a more nuanced response rather than simply would you recommend yes or no with so little choice it would have to be no and shame on steam for not providing better feedback options the game is interesting and the graphics good i did find some annoying bugs like having half the storage cabinets in my cyclops erased along with their contents but at least it did not auto save so only cost me a few hours it may be that i am not the target audience and at 59 perhaps that is at the root here for me the game was far too stressful and once in it there was no way to dial down the terror levels which nod to spinal tap were set at 11 i don t like being constantly and unremittingly scared but in this game that is the agenda once you are used to one level of fear your next challenge will up the anti such that there is never any respite beasts like the ghost leviathan and the sea dragon were way past my tolerance levels and i spent hours trying to wait them out while they knocked the cyclops about but would not leave me be power off lights off no movements inside the sub but still for hours they swim around the sub and do not go away as soon as you power up even with silent running and slow speed they attack the choice is to either exit the game without saving try and flee with them in pursuit or stand and fight finally to my shame i did the latter for the ghost and beat it with the stasis rifle and the knife but i know that is not how the game is meant to be played when the sea dragon did the same i just quit without saving having wasted hours of my life watching it swim around and being buffeted about by its actions when i decided not to continue blood pressure getting too high my son rescued me taking over and playing for me to get past the sea dragon but even after that point it still harassed me and prevented me getting back into the sub when it was supposedly sonically deterred and i cannot understand how when he played using my saved game files on his pc he did not even see the sea dragon all said and done perhaps a younger me would have been more inured to the stress inducing elements and enjoyed it more but i will not be playing it again and i will not be buying any sequel if you enjoy being scared and if you like horror then perhaps this game is for you if being scared and hunted is not your cup of tea then i would recommend you give it a miss
