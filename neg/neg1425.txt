2022 early access review i absolutely love this game but it s still too buggy and as much as i wanted to give the game a thunbs up it has just too many flaws at the moment perks are usually too weak to even be relevant 2 increased creativity was the perk picked by the game dev that designed those and the combination of perks is in most cases just frustrating locking you or your npcs out of something that would go better with the other one smithing is op and annoying at the same time while the weapons produced sell for an insane amount due to good gear being insanely expensive you have to spend ingame years doing nothing but watching the day night cycle pass by just to get your stamina back even worse you can t make it automatically stop once it s full and unlocking parts is feels like something right stripped from an asian mmo cause the grind is so bad also having to click 200 times just to melt everything why just why talking to prisoners not possible as to why who knows but apparently they don t have the permission to talk to you after you captured them even when they re the king queen of a kingdom staging a prison break for an enemy noble so that he d be in your debt no sorry you re at war maybe kill them instead cause it s almost the same spoilers its not getting an actual advantage by capturing every noble from a kingdom nah they just hire mercenaries from god knows what money also i guess they got hired by the nobles currently imprisoned max amount of 4 parties so you have 10 companions and another 8 family members that you could for defending your fiefs nah 3 of them can do this the rest either has to do governour work or get captured as caravans the max amount of parties that you can have should scale with the amount of thiefs you own caravans become useless the moment you re part of a kingdom at least the amount of caravan guards should grow over time clan tier or some other metric and mods there are some amazing mods out there that don t work anymore handing off the project to modders is just giving up on it destroying their compatibility is trying to kill it off combat a i let s just say there s a mod that fixes it somewhat otherwise it s a giant blob walzing in a direction performance what amazes me the most is the fact that i can play battles with 1000 guys running around without having any big performance issues aside from some hickups but as soon as i try to do a prison break or an arena the game bricks itself into unplayability it s hard to understand what is happening there bad code checking line of sight in prison breaks spectators using too much performance in arenas unit armor balancing is just off when i walk around in a full plated armor i don t think i should be taking damage from a stone thrown at me even arrows did not really pierce those armors i will rewrite this review as soon as there are improvements on those points and i hope there will be because i m fed up seing devs throwing away games that have the potential to become something absolutely great
