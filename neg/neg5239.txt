2016 overall its good but there is no way i can recommend it fully at the current price the game is pretty good but has a lot of little issues that prevent me from recommending it to others the combat feels slow compared to other titles in the franchise even when at the fastest speed why cant i play as the same faction in co op with my friend why cant we both be orks why cant we both be vampires or why cant we both be chaos why do we need to select unique races when each race has at least 2 factions why cant we just be the same one but with the other leader i understand you can recruit the other leaders of the same faction but it seems like an oversight on the developers part the siege system is weird having to click little icons that have no description unless i hover over it it requires you to select the unit that intiated the siege then right click the city on top of this the unit selection system is problematic when you have 6 units on top of a city trying to click one of the overlapping flags is a pain why cant i just select any of the units taking part in the siege why do i have to select a specific unit you have to rotate the camera around to find an angle to click on the flag for the unit you need to build said equipment its tedious the good things about it is that the factions are quite unique with different playstyles i like the rpg elements but they are not in depth like other games i have played in the same 4x genre these might seem like minor gripes but when you encounter them a hundred times an hour it tends to become annoying very quickly these are things that should have been changed during in house play testing sorry but i cannot recommend this until they fix these things there are simply better games in the same genre
