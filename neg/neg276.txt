product refunded i brought the game back ignore the refunded on this review i did refund it then buy it back sorry for the confusion i shouldn t of removed the point talking about it in this review so here hopefully this helps review after the refund it s not boring it was actually alright and fun but seeing how much is missing even from what base payday 2 had at launch is quite a lot i didn t want to refund the game as i did enjoy it but the problem i have come across which is the norm with games is you spend a lot of money on a game to then wait 50 years hoping it will be decent not good just hoping it s at the state it should of been at launch i had way to many games that i got with the intention of oh it will be better down the line crap and as much as i hated it people will buy this stuff on day 1 and so these games will keep doing this people will buy them with the it will get better later mentality which leads to the game already having your money and so now they don t really need to do anything from what i played it was alright just felt like a more fast pace payday 2 with less content then base and less features what i didn t like in payday 3 stealth is your only optiion unlike payday 2 you can go loud in 3 you still can but the game doesn t want you to armour doesn t re gen and a lot of people say payday 3 is death by thousand cuts which is correct as you just get no matter what also overkill in 2 you could go loud or save a stealth heist at the end if it went to saving your hours of progress in the mission payday 3 tells you to go yourself payday 3 needs to really improve going loud as my weapons haven t levelled up much anymore and i m broad to constantly stealthing the same pattern telling people to get down you can t tell people to get down like you could in 2 now you use the ping button which is annoying instead of what payday 2 has the online offline mode it s stupid there needs to be a beta for a simple common mode that i would say every game has but more and more games push away from single player offline modes and demand you play with others and stay online i played this mode and i forgot i couldn t pause as it s online despite offline and the ai team do not die they are invincible and will stand there never taking damage this clearly shows they never intended for single player and expected people to always play with others also this always online crap causes bugs where your unlocks won t unlock because your needs to sync to the servers to register your level instead of saving this information to the users pc like payday 2 and 1 they instead demand online if it sent the data to the the users pc this way the game can sync 100 to the player and when it can send that data to the servers it will instead of having to wait hours for what you earned to register to unlock short heist s now this one i can t be 100 sure on this as i only did 3 or so heist missions i did look up a video for one to check but in payday 2 there is a week scheduled that is there in every mission because some heist s can play out thorough those days day 1 is you rob the place day 2 could be you deliver the goods in return for something day 3 is you use that something to access something else and so on some would also have that if you extract during a high police raid you can run the risk of your van crashing and needing to hold off and take the cash to a new get away it was fun and made players think should they hold out till the police back off can they afford to do that this heist is a 4 day heist meaning a lot to do so do they have all the equipment for all 4 days from what i ve seen in payday 3 it s just do a mission and get out done no escape ups or extra days for the heist no crime net payday 2 has a map that loads in random missions with different stats and difficulty payday 3 has a awful menu where you scroll sideways through whatever heist you want to select and for some reason the heist videos are in the list next to them cluttering the menu instead of having just the missions then when you click on it it shows the mission video it just feels bland and barren like payday 3 s menu no map to plan heist s payday 2 has a map you can draw on you can use this to visually plan the heist most people drew on it but the fact you could was nice it s nice to be able to draw what to do for the team as some people might struggle explaining what to do in game and can draw on the map the plan it just goes a long way lack of rng in payday 2 heist s can have rng elements like door ways blocked off or the security room is changed places or so on from what i ve seen in payday 2 it seems the same with no change so you never need to adjust and change plans based on the change in situation and can just lazily repeat the same thing over and over again what i did like in payday 3 the movement the movement was faster and nicer the problem with payday 2 for me is how it feels a bit stiff to me as time got on the characters felt a little bland in movement was fine for the time but now basic stuff like climbing a ledge or vaulting it feels needed it s like playing a game with no jumping it doesn t ruin the game but as time gets on and jumping becomes a main mechanic it feels like it s just a common thing in games of course it depends on the game and stuff don t expect a tank to jump in a tank game but a game like payday feels like it should have climbing ledges which 3 has and 2 would of done good with it s a nice improvement along with the movement feeling smoother the gun play the gun play feels a lot smoother and better like most modern fps games the melee on the other hand is doesn t seem to have any melee weapons anymore and your shoving does all now making it pointless but using weapons is just nicer to control isn t much but it s nicer escorting off the premises i really like that in payday 3 you don t instantly get shot at for entering restricted area and the guards will actually escort you off the grounds which is nice and ads for more creative ways to handle the heist body shield using someone as a body shield isn t something i expected in a payday game but it fits being able to take a hostage and use them as a shield is fun specially when it gets to hot and you don t have cover i think it was an actual good addition to the game and surprisingly needed for a game like payday player models in payday 2 there was a thing with the player models who ever made them back then must of not known anatomy correctly as once i seen it i could never un see it and the h3h3 character shows it the most because of his fat body but the characters in payday 2 have short arm s their hands meet their hips and human hands don t meet the hips but instead above the thigh groin level this is how we can touch our own junk and ass payday 2 characters can t with out bending down a bit or back payday 3 on the other hand they can reach to wipe their asses and heist with clean cheeks where payday 2 the gang will be doing heist s with a dirty ass it s nice seeing them finally make the models look normal overall thoughts on the game it s not boring i enjoyed playing it i would of kept it i still think about just keeping it so i can play it as i hope it gets better but that s not healthy as i am writing this review i am debating if i should buy it back again well it s on sale right now it has been refunded and as the sale is still going on i got some time to think it over i will probably weigh the pros and cons to see if i get it or not and see then but until then my nitpicks is in the comments since the review won t fit it
