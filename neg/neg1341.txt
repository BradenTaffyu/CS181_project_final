2021 bannerlord was estimated to be in early access for 1 year we re now approaching the 2nd year mark of early access bannerlord is not bad game or one that i wouldn t recommend the devs on the other hand have entirely lost sight of the project the devs think they are some kind of super mega company super stars that can just ignore their fans the siege ai has been broken for ages and the devs haven t even bothered to acknowledge the problem exists instead they put out much more meaningful updates such being able to raise your fist in mp now i m sure all 2 people that are still active in mp liked that update since the start of the game the devs have been adding new towns cities and castles which do look very good but what is the point if the game is so shallow there is literally no point in going to these places hey look guys the devs have added 2 new taverns for dickburg and pisstadia along with bug fixes in a 9 gb update how many times will you actually go to these taverns never there is no point in exploring anywhere in this game npcs just repeat the exact same 3 lines your dialogue choices don t matter it s actually laughable if you order a drink from a waitress through dialogue nothing even happens she just walks away but oooo you can play the exact same boardgame in every tavern such an immersive experience indeed the devs think they can turn this game into an e sport well to that i need to remind them that e sports needs not only an audience but also players which bannerlord multiplayer has neither the drive of mount and blade has always been the singleplayer and its sandbox do whatever you want experience not multiplayer which the devs pile more and more resources into while singleplayer sits there a shallow repetitive broken bore now back when i mentioned the length of this game being in early access it wouldn t be a big deal that the game stayed in early access longer than intended delays happen and with covid keeping that efficiency would no doubt be hard the problem that i have with the devs keeping the game in early access is because the updates they put out are so empty at the rate of progression maybe if you revisit this game in 3 years it may just about be ready to leave early access they don t even have banners in the game called bannerlord yet taleworlds you don t need to put out a new update every single time you add 1 tiny thing save those features and cobble them together with massive game changing updates to make it actually exciting no one is going to get back into the game because i can now upgrade my party members to lords nobody gives a about that on its own or any of the other minor feature you add devs really need to get their finger out their ass and actually work on their game and allocate their resources back into singleplayer i love the game but my patience with the devs since release has been tested time and time again 50 for this is just a joke
