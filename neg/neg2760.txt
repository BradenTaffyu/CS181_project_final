i ve had some genuinely good times playing stellaris in the past but as of the last year or two i don t believe i can realistically recommend the game to anyone new here s primarily why about every other major update if not every recently has a habit of majorly changing at least one critical system by a fairly significant degree though often with little need or in a poor manner even for fairly adaptable players as myself frequently having to relearn some of these mechanics as frequently as it occurs has slowly worn me and my friends down from wanting to play more there are a lot of dlcs worth quite a lot yes paradox added a subscription method to allow a cheaper entry for newbies but with how much there is to try and how certain players may take a long time to find what clicks for them it s still rather expensive at the outset this is only slightly remedied by dlcs being effectively shared in multiplayer lobbies similar to above however not all the dlcs are realistically worth their price point with imo only utopia apocalypse and federations really being the only required ones for a solid enough game many are fairly flavor specific megacorp nemesis overlord and some are still good but misc distant stars synthetic dawn ancient relics but many others are awfully specific stellaris has a sizeable portion of tech debt that can really contribute to poor time speed especially in multiplayer that they and modders have not really been able to fix realistically unless paradox simply adds to the game instead of using us as experiments every update and listened to more community input i don t see myself continuing to play
