2016 tl dr it s a no for now but worth keeping an eye on to see what it becomes stellaris simply feels empty at this point i stopped playing for a few months just recently came back once leviathans released to give it another try played for a few hours with some mods and still feel the same the first few hours are fun and exciting as you go about exploring and slowly building however after your first colonies are finished and you have a small empire building up everything becomes boring everything becomes a routine diplomacy dosen t really exist war feels one sided whether for or against you depends on the situation everything feels somewhat like a grind with no real end objective the mid game especially feels lacking in anything to keep me interested this all sounds negative but the game does have potential the early game exploring colonizing and meeting the first alien civilizations other than your own is exciting and fun late game seems to have interesting events as well but i haven t personally seen any this game has potential maybe after a year or so of patches and dlc unfortunetly paradox games usually have a mountain of dlc but they also usually make them game better this can be a great game right now though there simpily is not enough in the game to keep you hooked and playing like games such as ck2 or euiv
