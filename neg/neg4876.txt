2019 i ve been playing total war games since rome total war its currently the best strategy game that i have played since medieval 2 total war the modders enhanced the game with the proper content rather than the ca that gave vampire pirates the game is something that i always wanted to play since the epic mods for medieval 2 total war such as third age total war and divide and conquer but something goes wrong not only with the ca but with many companies that view the players as money nothing else right now there isn t a single one strategy rts or a combination of those two out there to play and be happy to play it again i don t know what happened since 2010 but really good and player friendly games doesn t come out nowadays we pay foul price for a game that is unfinished and when they publish the rest of the game they want another full price and not with the proper content since the medieval 2 total war i haven t seen the armor upgrade that was so cool back then why the ca removes cool stuffs from the game i really don t want to give the game thumbs down it is a really good game but the current prices are unacceptable so i recommend to wait for the game to go on sale however i want to give a big thumbs up for the modders i really appreciate the effort to create all those cool details that they added
