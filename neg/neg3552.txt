early access review really enjoyed this game at the beginning but its now been over 3 months since any updates and has now made the game very tedious the creators have raked in our cash with promises of updates and improvements within the games but as they have got their maximum sales targets they have now abandoned the game left us high and dry with a half finshed game has put me off ever buying a game which is not finished
