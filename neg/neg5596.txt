2014 after all this time i m finally entering my thoughts on this game this will go on more like a story of my experience than a review i bought the game on pre release meaning full price only because i loved this franchise this was something i never did before but i jumped on the hype or rather i was part of the hype as many already know the game was delivered in an unplayble state it only ran well on few computers so i waited more weeks for the update disappointed but still eager to play thankfully ca worked hard to release updates which happened almost weekely in the start soon i got my rome ii to run on my computer but that only makred the beginning of my frustrating experience with this game i won t go into any details about the specific problems as for they have been extensively covered by many expert reviewers plus the cas part on over promise and under deliver i ll leave it to others it is beating the dead horse at this point however it must be noted that besides the countless bugs and flaws in the codes many aspects of the intentional game design is inferior to that of its more successful older siblings these flaws will never go away such as the civil war which appears to be getting more and more unreasonable as the patching goes on the game design cannot be changed at this point again ca worked hard to patch the game they updated weekly which soon became monthy plus they gave us free dlcs that opened up a few more factions in the game for the players to command and about 3 4 months after the release the game finally became enjoyable then the rome ii dlcs went on 50 sale at that point i was beyond certain that pre purchasing this game was a terrible mistake i could ve waited 3 months for the 50 sale since i wasn t able to play the game anyways even with the 3 free dlcs the savings from the half price discount was worth more the message impression i got from this event was that ca is really hell bent on selling more copies of this game than anything else of course any reasonable buisness would do that but while offending those who love their work and delivering inferior product i don t think they should all those little friendly guestures or at first they seemed like friendly guestures ca made went down the drain if it was something you were going to do anyways it cannot be an apology those of us who pre purchased got screwed hard there was no benefit in buying early and at full price it has been 11 months since the release and we are now at 14th patch and updates are becoming very few and far in between the game has noticably improved and i ve logged many hours in this game although it does not have the charm the old total war games had it certainly has new fun things in it however the lesson rome ii has taught me and us is to never buy the next one on pre release and to never pay full price for another total war even better never be the first one to buy ca s game in an untested state let those fools who cannot learn from experience to taste it first once it is certain that it is not poisoned then consider buying it this is what i ll do if i ever buy another total war
