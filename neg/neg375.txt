fixing game breaking bugs that have been well known since launch 6 years ago fixing a exp exploit in under a week because people were getting 0 5 more exp than they were supposed to the game itself is fun its basically just fo4 but with friends new map and some new enemies it great until its not just spent the past howsoever long grinding out a few thousand caps you get like 70 80 per mission to get myself a full suit of lvl 50 max power armor for my lvl 80 character even saved up the 5k for the jetpack blueprint armor works great for the first 3 days then suddenly i can no longer enter my power armor no biggie i got another 2 chassis that i can use neither of those ones work either i go out to find a random spawn one and can enter it perfectly but the moment i swap out the old fusion core for a fresh one and put my armor on it it refuses to let me enter it even if i take off the armor and leave the chassis bare i am simply not able to enter making my grind for power completely useless and a waste of my time i spent all that time grinding just to be soft locked out of it because of a bug that has been known since launch yet the dev team their pants if someone is advancing 12 nano seconds faster than they should and they release a patch for it within a few days also your camp has a storage limit for the stash and the only way to increase it is to pay 13 per month on an already 40 game whine all you want about just manage your inventory bro there is no other reason to limit stashes other than the fact that they want extra money by having you buy the subscription
