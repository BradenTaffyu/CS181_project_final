2023 early access review its a beautiful game but its a re skin of the old game the mods are better on ase and since nitrado doesn t really want you to run your own servers they added additional option to find player servers to force them out of que and only show nitrados and if you do run your own server they will add a game server query and a live link to your ini files without your consent on top of a trace utility being added as well under the radar just kinda gives me bad vibes and shady practices
