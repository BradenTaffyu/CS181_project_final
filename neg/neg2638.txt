2021 i ve started this game with a fresh account as every player who launches this via steam has to a funproject i thought to myself some variety to my other account on world of tanks i use on a daily basis 10k battles fought let me quickly summarize the main problems yes it is in plural not singular i feel this game has when newer player or even experienced veterans wanna play it the battles are way to fast proceeding nowadays an average battle lasts 5 minutes out of 15 minutes possible there are many strong tanks some overpowered and godlike you basically gotta pay for and there are a lot of tanks that feel forgotten and abandoned in their stats mostly the ones from the tech tree a bad matchmaker matching you as low tier tank against tanks that are two tiers higher e g tier six french heavy tank arl 44 srsly this thing is a joke with its nonexistent armor and its main weaponry against tier eight premium obj 262u defender this thing man it scares me three artilleries in every game those are the peskiest one standing waaaay back at the redline and clicking every 30 seconds dealing close to 550 damage per shot short reminder tanks on lower tiers only got apr 950 hp non balanced penetrationvalues on lower tier tanks and even higher ones yes i am looking at you ebr 105 mentioning the ebr 105 wheeled vehicles are way to strong as if it wasn t enough that they exist in this game gosh excessive amount of gold ammunition spam that defeats even the last spark of joyment supplying the user higher penetration values and in some cases even higher damage output steep learning curve it takes weeks even months to even understand the basic game mechanics besides the way you play certain tanks e g light tanks or scoutsif i was you i would not start this game unless you are willing to invest money time and an excessive amount of nerves and will to proceed after the first 100 matches on lower tier i know wargaming is a company that is in urge to generate money out of their game but the way they choose by making it a pay to progress type of game defeats the purpose being in its current state titled as free to play i d rather play counter strike global offensive there at least you can earn small amounts of cash just by plaing it cheers
