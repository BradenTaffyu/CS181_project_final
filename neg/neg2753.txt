2018 edit for 88 usd utopia synthetic dawn plantoids leviathans and some legacy 1 9 1 mods you get a full game with few bugs and fair variety for 160 191 usd you get a game still in development i ll be honest i love this game i got it months ago and played it through night until morning however with the total change of game mechanics in the short time i have owned the game i ve become disenchanted with it as it continues to develop i have a reason for this and i ll explain with two different methods i will finish for what i hoped to see out of 2 0 and why i do not recommend this game skip to bottom overall if you don t wish to read my insight space civilization version 1 9 1 for those of you that like civilization but get bored with turned base nature version 1 9 1 of stellaris is an awesome choice for you stellaris is an rts that controls 100 of your faculties from the get go after you learn the mechanics it requires your full attention to manage your planets the buildings on them your civilian ships your military fleets the opinions of other empires where to explore what to research how to expand etc the list goes for a long time plus you get to create your own empire and role play however you want how cool is that if you play civ you know you start with a city establish more as you go on and try to gain more cities and territory in a strategic manner to give your nation the best edge stellaris has a similar function except you colonize planets and use the planets natural resources to give you an edge just like in civ this allows you to cut access to resources and areas just by having a lot of population and culture around one point you can also temporarily expand borders with frontier outposts basically small artificial pockets of territory that you set up to get a rich pocket of resources or similarly block other nations access to key resources you can also use a frontier outpost s border influence to push back other empires borders which is kinda fun stellaris 1 9 1 does have a few drawbacks the primary being the doomstacks of fleets you can create in mid late games of 1 9 1 some empires just have enough resources to stack fleets comparable to 1 4 or even 1 2 the size of most solar systems this can lead to steamrolling conquering empires with little to no hopes of being stopped it is possible however to counter fleets with proper ship designs this has led me to defeat fleets twice my size due to proper ship configurations though this mechanic would ve needed some tweaking still to be completely fair i do say if you have a bigger economy to support a grander fleet then you should win unless you tactically blunder you can tactically blunder primarly when your fleets take a lot of damage from a defensive platform that pulls them out of ftl travel and into their guns however unreliable reliable you consider static defense to be space risk version 2 0 if you love risk more than any other game and want a real time feel then you may love 2 0 some may love 2 0 better than 1 9 1 and 2 0 has a lot of really cool mechanics and balancing features albeit in a way that makes it clunkier in general to play rather than having a planet influencing your reach into space you must physically claim each solar system in order to reap its rewards from a gameplay standpoint sure this makes sense fine but in reality an empire won t build a space station in every system unless it has the means to that s where space risk comes into play exploration and exploitation of systems is solely based on occupation once you have your occupational starport you can reinforce it over time this mechanic single handedly replaces the idea that defensive stations can be built elsewhere in the system and gets rid of the frontier outpost and border expansion based on population and culture you can only expand by holding what you have as opposed to having a territory or border that other countries should naturally respect theoretically a neighboring empire could own the system next to your home world and you d be powerless to say hey get off my lawn unless you went to war just to take those systems and secure your core worlds there s also a few things that from a realistic sci fi oxymoron i know but bear with me don t make sense such as only science ships are able to venture into uncharted systems so reaching other empires can take forever now as opposed to sending out scout ships to chart the stars and discover routes starports are never destroyed only taken over which if you bombarded a starport i d expect it to have a grand explosion and aren t even physically occupied by your own people just battered into submission spaceports while having the capability to produce more than just civilian ships can only produce civilian ships which don t think makes sense seeing that you wouldn t transport materials to build a ship to a starport at a star and then construct it you d only do that if it was logistically impossible to to get the materials to a spaceport easily there are some good ideas though and this is what i had expected in 2 0 had it just been a tweak to 1 9 1 individual fleets have a maximum capacity meaning no doomstacks great starports can be built to function in specific ways such as multiple shipyards purely financial purely defensive etc basically what i thought was going to happen were that these would essentially be frontier outposts with guns or improved capabilites factoring in attrition to wars is super cool idea but needs refining think of how stressful wwi and wwii were and how those didn t end even after so many atrocities were committed now think of another world like warhammer 40k where wars rage on for millennia and never stop this is what i kinda mean by sci fi realism i understand 2 0 is all about balancing the mechanics for the most people to be satisfied but i think what happened here is comparable to the fable series on xbox fable cool mechanics awesome ideas super powers quests armor full customization of your character simple and not over or under done my favorite game of all time fable 2 interesting new ideas such as new weapons gear and spell usage mechanics but ultimately steps in the wrong direction armor had no value high level spells were trash because of long charge times sure you could change your outfit s color have babies and adjust rent but ultimately took away from the core game mechanics fable 3 bad overall interesting ideas such as combining spells and weapons with personalities but otherwise limiting in that spells were confined to gauntlets and other features which were not incredible about the game overall stellaris is great but going from 1 9 1 to 2 0 like going from fable 1 to 2 and 3 is like turning vanilla icecream into tasteless icecream that is to say many people like vanilla but if something doesn t taste good or bad you can t say it tastes bad 2 0 is balanced and bland to the point i can t stand it and i ll die in my 1 9 1 hell long before i switch back to 2 0 1 9 1 plays like space civ but more in depth and more involved in my opinion i love this version more and play it exclusively despite its couple of teeny bugs and balance issues these can be overlooked 2 0 plays like space risk and can be very frustrating especially with marauder empires and mechanics that are illogical to space empires as described above since this version is getting the most love and attention i expect the bugs and issues to iron out however unless the core of the game is somehow returned or an alternative play mode is introduced with old territory mechanics ftl travel mechanics exploration mechanics etc i do not see myself playing myself past 1 9 1
