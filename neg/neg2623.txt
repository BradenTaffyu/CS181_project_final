i stupidly purchased this game based on some professional reviews that the on field gameplay in franchise mode was the best it has been in years all i can say is these reviewers are crazy and must be in eas pocket sure there are some minor improvements in the animation system the boom tech feature or whatever is a small improvement but that is not all there is to gameplay the ai players especially on defense might as well be topiaries on most plays playing like their awareness attribute is zero run the same play everybody does the exact same thing on every play like some robot running a mathmatical simulation and that s exactly how it plays out the play gets boring so fast because you quickly figure out what every player is going to do in every situation so ignore these fools saying franchise gameplay is the best in years it s terrible and i stopped playing after only 4 games adding some new commentary teams sounds like a nice idea but the implementation is so bad that i can t believe there was a product manager drawing a salary from ea that actually thought it was good enough to ship the new announcers sound like boring robot versions of themselves appear oblivious to what is actually happening on the field and repeat themselves so often that it s like a stuck recording i once had the color analyst make the same exact statement about wide receivers on three plays back to back none of it actually applying to the play at hand one of the plays was even a run one was a screen pass to the hb and nother was a crossing pattern to the te i d say ea must have assigned this task to interns but that would be insulting to interns they should at least provide an option to disable these new commentary teams during franchise play of course you can just turn them off and i usually do after a while anyway but how can the new group be so much worse than the old one the only good things i can come up with are that the game runs better than madden 24 on my pc much smoother overall and the menu navigation is also quite a bit quicker that s it that s all i ve got for 70 wish i had played the 10 hour trial first please don t be dumb like me spend the money on almost anything else it will almost certainly be more fun than this sorry excuse of a football simulation
