2020 alright so this is my first attempt at a review and i ll open by flat out saying to not buy this game buy civ 5 it will give you more fun for less frustration i say this not only because of certain mechanics but because of the inevitable paywall that you hit in civ 6 civ 6 is a game that has locked most of its content behind dlc going so far to even lock things such as map layouts and somehow has less base content than civ 5 does that alone should steer you away from a this title since the animation are and graphics are about the only thing civ 6 has going for it long story short the price to get this game to a playable state is ludicrous on to the ai it s bad civ 5 s ai was literally better in most aspects the ai is not playing against itself ever it is only playing against you no matter the teams the barbarians are merely the auxiliary forces to supplement them being ignored for a hundred turns and marching to your lands from three or four countries away just to fight you the city states will sit on tribal villages with a warrior for fifteen turns to prevent you from getting it it is insane how bad the ai design for this game is no matter your actions on the world stage or even if you have a declared friendship with everyone they will vote to you over 90 of the time en mass the ai for this game is just awful in every way possible imo then there s the matter of some of the features or lack there of in this game ho boy there are no console commands what so ever you can t make any in game changes to your match while this might make sense in the multiplayer arena it doesn t in the single player aspect this is extremely frustrating especially if you re just trying to try something out or do something specific alt f4 is disabled in this game and if it freezes while on fullscreen you will have no way to turn it off unless you dual monitors hard reset because they want you to push the quit button just so you can have a loss on your tally card that means nothing want to undo an action or a misclick you have to load a save and listen to the monologue that you cannot turn off while the game reloads the entire match instead of just hitting undo it feels like the devs on this game went really far out of their way at every turn to force you to play the game exactly how they want you to and it is a major turnoff for me in the very least overall all i can really say is do not buy this game if you re set on getting a civ game get 5 not 6
