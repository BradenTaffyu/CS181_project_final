2016 i m giving a very uncertain and conditional no there s this usual deal if you make a sequal to game it s only logical people will compare and in case of civilization the game is always exactly the same just features change so if you come with a sequal it should be better then what the players already have no obviously no it s better then vanila civ5 but only because it incorporates features added in datadiscs sadly with some of them tweaked and some removed the whole game doesn t work nearly as well as its previous incarnation warning wall of text ahread if you want a conclusion seek the last paragraph i ll start with the good active research is pretty good it keeps you active over a few playthroughs it gets rather repetitive because it s usually just build 3 something or something else but still cool idea and it works the districts are not bad at all they are a tad too complicated for the difference they mean but they are a fun decision and add dilema to the game since a city typically won t have everything it wants now placement of wonders also feels pretty good you finally won t have pyramids built in jungle and three gorges in desert nice touch so the two aspects the game was marketed with work all right still the bright side i kind of like how great persons now have slightly different abilities that change thematically with progress through eras early scientist can bring belief for example only kind of though since for most great persons the dilema known from civ5 was removed do i use great writer for one time culture boost or great work should my great prophet go on conversion tour or should he become a holy site not here the role of the character is given and while merchant scientist engineer differs at least a bit the only difference between writer artist musician is name of their works and slots they fit into thumb down the removal of dilemas is responsible for a lot of my dissapointment city states are now gained by sending envoys into them envoys being gained via quests like infulence in civ5 or via a separate influence resource which is used solely for this purpose there s no other use for it using money was definitely much better addign the decision whether they should be saved for unit upgrade used for boosting city development or invested in city state similar thing happened to tourism in civ5 late game it s an important asset because it sways other powers towards your ideology and so it matters even if you don t go for for culture victory not so here it again has sole purpose and if you intend to win via diplomacy or religion you can safely ignore its existence remember how you couldn t wait for your new civ5 cultural policy to be finished because they were all strong and super useful how every policy branch supported different playstyle ok so you can forget about it there s a policy tree similar to tech tree now so you re more or less forced to invent everything you get policy cards that go into government slots there s a lot of cards and very few slots so you ll be using maybe 5 of what you ve discovered baaaad idea actually one of the worst i ve encountered here above issues are conceptual they are part of the game i assume they will be tweaked in datadiscs and one just has to take them or leave them because it s what makes the game after all then there s technical side though ui is definitely a big step back i m constantly struggling to find information which is either hard to reach or not available at all not even in civilopedia i was used to getting a comprehensive breakdown on almost everythign by right clicking it s comfortable and it helps the learning curve because it helps me understand why do the numbers look the way they do here i struggle with finding out what s on individual tiles what the tile yield is why are my people unhappy i can t find my units they are difficult to spot the ones that already moved look the same as fresh ones and there s no unit list that would help me find that archer stationed in some backwater colony i ve already forgotten about attacking from a city is an annoying minigame where you first try to move camera so that you see the attack button hidden behind city garrison and then you wave your cursor around hoping the attack arrow will appear if you click too soon bad luck it s back to step one again the idea of chaining escort support unit to military was good but why the hell are they not melded together into one unit if you get artilery with observation baloon and great general it s two skip turn and one attack every turn that s just crazy it has also often happened to me that my ranged ship sailed right towards the enemy melee because i had escorted admiral selected instead of main ship and didn t notice graphic is personal opinion but units are less detailed and their attack animation much less interesting for me the same goes with ai leaders who are rather unimpressive looking and bland but really this is the first thing i m willing to forgive if everything else works ai leaders and ai in general it really really need a patch i can more or less put up with fact my tanks are meeting club armed warriors someone forgot to upgrade but then there s england boldly declaring war on me driving 18 heavy chariots to surround my city defended with a musketeer ok england is a bit backwards and then it probably realizes attacking would be futile and just stands around driving back and forth doing nothing i suspect that with such high number of units it might even be able to break through the defenses eventually losing 17 of them and maybe getting a city but no it just watches how fire from the city massacres them and that s the point where i m considering just dropping the game till a few patches because there s no challange in it and no fun to give a final point it s a good game which is hardly a praise for a sequel of a marvelous game it urgently needs ai patches it would benefit from redesign of ui features are okeyish there s the feeling of novelty and there s the promise of datadiscs making it grand again but so far it s merely good
