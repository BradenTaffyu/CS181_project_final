2014 hi all who read this it is now over a year and i still wasted my money on this game this game came out with high expectations and none of them where actually implemented in the original game but what about the game my opinion graphics epic really awesome even on medium graphic it looks good unit variation a lot far to many choices if you ask me because of those unit cards you miss the feel of the different units in your army length of the game in mp and sp you have a lot of gameplay ahead of you so you dont have to be bored for the next up coming month specific sp in my opinion it takes to long the map is just to big i am forgeting in late game half of my armies even the turns take longer then 20 min in late game without even a battle mp dont even bother to click on it it is the worst total war multiplayer you will ever see recommendations dont buy it buy a good solid tw game like napoleon empit r e or shogun 3
