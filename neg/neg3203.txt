2017 i ve spent a lot of time and money on wg products over the years but what i ve received in return was one bad decision after another after another then i decided to stop playing wg products all together only to find out a couple of months later that wows was released for steam i have premium time left on my account and a number of really expensive ships so i decided to give it a try after all why not get some of those sweet achievements and now i m forced to make a new account and devs tell us that it s the only it could be done and we know that it s not so they re lying to their customers to prevent them using the stuff they ve already paid for just stay away
