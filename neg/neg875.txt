2017 terrible story massive dumbing down of classic fallout rpg features horrid voiced companion and muh shaun removes any ability to create your own backstory performance is god awful even by bethesda standards the only upsides is the graphics are okay by bethesda standards and the gun fights are improved that s literally it would not recommend buying at full price until they fix the performance only buy it discounted and only to play with mods if you want a good story go play new vegas instead
