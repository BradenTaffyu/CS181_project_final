2017 first of all i would like to say that i am great fan of paradox games i own several games like ck2 eu iv and even hoi iii i spent so many hours with my friend playing against the ai in hoi iii that i expected in hoi iv another challenging yet fun game with infinite playability but this is what i got at this point the single player experience with hoi iii being a very complex game with a very strong ai in my opinion i was expecting in hoi iv a simplification of some of the game mechanics in the new hoi iv but still keeping the challenging ai what i got instead is a simplification of some mechanics like research and war theatre managing which was great as it made the game more playable towards the late game but an insanely simplistic ai so simplistic i can even describe the ai as plain dumb the ai will leave huge gaps in the frontline for you to basically walk through them sometimes they will strategically redoply to one adjacent region with no reason and lose organisation and therefore losing in combat it reached a point that you are able to drive to moscow with a motorised division without entering combat for that reason i think the single player experience has no type of challenge u no matter the difficulty u the multiplayer experience back in the day when i was plaing hoi iii it was very difficult to host games as there no supported servers with hoi iv you are finally able to host your servers and finally play online while the games can turn to be fun sometimes they usually end up by you smashing your head on the keyboard because a player can t run the game faster than speed 2 leaving you and everyone else in the game stuck for hours just to see one division move to the next region if that doesn t happen and you somehow reach 1939 without someone s client crashing or without de syncs and any other performance issues people will ragequit when they lose a couple of armored divisions so all those hours you put in to prepare for war have gone to drain because when the ai takes over oh boy so that leaves you with one last chance which is setting up a game with rules that are agreed upon before the game usually you can find those in paradox s forum but then when you start playing with serious people you see them doing exploits and here are just a brief list of what me and my friends have encountered during there serious games deleting convoy troops when they are intercepted by an enemy fleet to prevent losing manpower and equipment rushing technology through focuses reaching a point that you are fighting king tigers in 1941 usa declaring war on venezuela in 1938 through a focus war and triggering war economy and basically making usa a huge monster that not even every country allied against the us can win disbanding units before getting overun to save manpower and equipment circling the capital for an indefinite amount of time leaving your whole country without supplies thanks to the wonderful programming of paradoxand the list goes on conclusion because of paradox lack of interest on patching the infinite amount of exploits nor improving the ai it leaves you the player with little room to enjoy i recommend you to sit back and wait for it to be fixed hopefully one day
