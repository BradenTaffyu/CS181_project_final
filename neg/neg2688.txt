2017 after 100 hours of playtime what can i say about stellaris i will be brief sure the game has lovely visuals and an exceptionnal soundtrack being able to genetically alter your species or fully customize every single ship of your fleet every space station of your empire was really interesting nevertheless i can t give to this game a positive review and here is why there is a cruel lack of micromanagement concerning colonies planets i ll explain every liveable planet is divided into a certain amount of squares on each square the player can chose to build a single building and allow a single unit of population to exploit said building that s it there is not much else that you can do to be honest i was expecting a bit more from a 4x revolving around galactical colonization diplomacy with the ai is extremely flawed not to say absent in the game apart from declaring a rivalry or war to another empire interactions are scarce sure you can theoretically trade ressources science or informations with the neighborhood but it is really unlikely to happen since their acceptance of any treaty is determined by how much they like you since the most trifling action from your part i e refusing an offer will seriously and often irreversibly anger them forever non aggressive diplomacy is pointless it was lacking features anyway the ai the ai is overall unspeakably broken most of the time your allies will build ships one after another and send them on by one against large ennemy fleets untill complete destruction of their own fleet and exhaustion of their ressources do not waste time building alliances you don t trust me just browse the steam workshop and look for every mod that consists in a fix for the ai combat as soon as your fleet enters combat mode your admirals developp a brain of their own indeed you can t give orders to your ships anymore everything is administered by the ai until complete anihilation of one fleet or emergency ftl for instance you can t tell your fleet to focus down a particular ennemy ship meaning that your fleet can just tickle an ennemy ship s shield a bit and then switch to another ship without dealing a single point of hull damage to the first one and repeat etc you can t order your fleet to back off a bit either meaning that if your high ranged ships get in range of low range ennemy artillery your admiral will vaillantly allbeit very recklessly refuse to get out of ennemy s range thus you cannot possibly take benefit from your fleet s high range weaponry such issues could be easily solved if paradox was actually concerned about something else than dlcs general lack of content although military aspects are quite detailed there s not much to do in the other domains my friends and i indeed felt the need to deeply mod the game as soon as we finished our second playthrough that s speaking by itself this emphasizes an other important problem repetitiveness after the first couple of hours once you are in front of your opponents regarding technology and economy every hour is pretty much the same as the last or the next one every war is pretty much the same war the endgame crisis fail to solve that problem the prethoryns often feel a bit weak and the unbidden will simply erase you if they spawn near your imperial capital yes that can happen regarding the awakened fallen empires there is nothing a player or a coalition of players can do indeed paradox offset the flaws of their ai by absurdly buffin it so even if you manage to destroy the awakened empire s fleets and that will take you some time their civilization will remain a threat solely thanks to its bonuses more or less gamebreaking bugs when and i underline the when these issues are addressed the fix is often put behind the paywall of the habitual absurdly costly paradox s dlc the list is far too big after 100 hours to be developped here but i will nevertheless take an example if you take a planet located in a system where another empire even if it is allied to tou already owns a planet the ressources of this system won t be exploitable by neither of you let s say that you want to build a mine on a random asteroid to gain the minerals ok you ll have to declare war on your ally and conquer every other planet in this solar system pretty dumb isn t it and it s far from being the worst all in all i was really hyped for stellaris and i still think that the game has great potential although it is far too flawed in my eyes to be recommended in this state and at full price it can get quite interesting once modded but mods won t solve everything and by the way they don t have to finally i firmly oppose paradox s policy many of the abovementioned issues were indeed addressed in some of the dlc i e leviathans but here is the problem it s a dlc seriously someone who already paid for the game shouldn t have to pay again for basic updates addressing the major flaws of the game
