2020 early access review well there is a kind of roguelikes around here roguelikes which are quite good or even great but with one big core problem they are absolutely painful to play as roguelikes the main problem of caves of qud is death problem is it s not enemies or environment what actually kill you actually you are killed by loss of concentration because enemies do not scale with level never and they are expectedly completely random so you can have a screen full of low level oozes which swarm you but fail to do actual damage but when you methodically eat throug their rather big hp pool bam rocket turret from the side of the screen shots and instakills you and this never seems fair never you rarely can oneshoot something as weapon damage capped at maybe 20 30 sometimes you score 40 50 but this is it enemies require 3 5 or more hits and there often is more than 10 of them you tediously chew through all this flesh you forget to track your health you die and then if you play fairly 20 or more hours of gameplay are wasted obviously i did not play this game fairly good thing than permadeath can easily be disabled in debug options so i savescummed the hell out of this game and for more than 80 hours i played i came to quiet an unexpected conclusion actually this game lacks content it s quiet weird thing to say since qud has a metric ton of content but i tell you what random generation is not a content and will never be and in this particular case random generation is another bit of annoying tediousness the best example of this are so called books made by randomly picking parts from all textual content in game it sounds way less disgusting that it really is and it completely kills any desire to follow this game s lore it s my main problem with this game it s the reason why i m giving this game a thumb down after 80 hours of gameplay it s that feeling of being deceived that all this nice and funny mechanic like being two headed four faced and six handed mutant with ability to dominate traders and make them drop their wares on the ground is just a disguise for hiding vast random generated boringness even now as i write this review i have a desire to return and play a bit more and maybe recover something really interesting and unique but i know that the only thing i actually can find is another boring painted dagger which gives me ability to cast boring heat inducing spell and that it will be a complete waste of my time and this is the main reason why caves of qud are are so painful
