2018 i ve never ever ever written a review for a game gaming just isn t a full blown hobby for me that all changed when i started playing warthunder way way back in 2013 the game was mindblowing being able to play so many different types of famous aircraft in the midsts of epic dogfights was totally engrossing to me being an avaition nut the graphics were and still are incredible for a free to play when tanks came out it was again totally mind blowing to see the tracer rounds whizzing back and forth something the other game didn t really focus on the tanks the sounds the explosions the historic battlefields few they were really struck gold but none of it was perfect yea yea i know but you just said it was mindblowing and awesome yea i did but it didn t last it became monotonous when they changed to the rp system taking literal years for me to get to my first jet i still don t have the final fighter jet in the american line you have to treat the game like a job and after awhile even a job you love get s boring and more annoying the tanks have taken up most of gaijin s focus with realistic air battles not being improved in the slightest despite major problems with the gameplay but even with the major focus on tanks gaijin still hasn t done anything with the upgrades you earn with the tank the more you play fire extinguishers and parts both vitally needed for a tank need to be earned which means ladies and gentlemen that in the beginning battles normally 5 10 of them depending on your performance if your tank is hit in a vital spot or is set on fire you have to sit there completely helpless it s on of the stupidest things about tank battles and it s the one option out of the endless that gaijin chose because it s the one that will get them the most money frankly i ve put over 1800 hours into this game more than any other game i ve ever played i m going to continue playing it but it s a game that you don t want to get involved in it s fine in small doses but you ll never get any of the vehicles you want if you play that way i simply can t recommend this game because gaijin doesn t listen to the community and the game sucks all fun away like a black hole i would just like to add that you ll notice a vast majority of negative reviews come from the players that have put many many hours into the game including me i don t know what else could be so telling as to the state of this game
