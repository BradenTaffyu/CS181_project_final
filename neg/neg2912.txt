2019 in its current form i cannot recommend stellaris 2 2 i have been playing since it was first released and having played other paradox games i knew what i was getting into prior to 2 2 it was enjoyable and just the right amount of complexity 2 2 has completely blown that out of the water whereas before you only had to pay attention to 2 resources energy and minerals you now have to juggle over a half dozen this adds absolutely nothing to gameplay and instead detracts and makes it overly and unnecessarily complicated i spend more time juggling trade to have a positive balance of each resource than i do strategizing gameplay accounting software is more fun i am not the only one confounded by the new economy the ai seems to have problems with it as well the other big change that belongs in the what were they thinking category was a total overhaul of the planetary management system before it was very straight forward you had a planet you had tiles populations would appear on tiles you d build structures on tiles that the populations would work very simple now you have districts as well as structures in addition to keeping the populations happy you now have to worry about keeping them housed and keeping them employed i have found no way to do this unemployment and overcrowding always runs rampant planetary management like trade and resources is a micromanagement nightmare that adds absolutely zero to gameplay alliances and the federation option is an absolute joke your allies do absolutely nothing to help as you find yourself battling the end game crisis faction alone it is really best to just go it alone as their are no advantages of being in an alliance or federation i wish paradox would give you the option of rolling back to the previous version if they did i d give this a hearty thumbs up recommendation i enjoyed that version much much more in the meantime i ll get my space 4x fix with sins of a solar empire
