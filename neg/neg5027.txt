2019 i have tried very hard to like this game i just can t there are a number of problems with it from my perspective the first is how hilariously and absurdly the ai cheats especially with money why yes ai you can obviously afford to have three full stacks of elites supported by a single commandery while i struggle to afford one stack full of crap tier units on three provinces easy normal hard it makes no matter the ai is going to be ludicrously overpowered to the point that you really can t do anything about it but wait for modders to roll up and fix the game for ca the diplomacy is hot garbage why yes my ally with 150 relationship please declare war on me as soon as i lose half a stack taking on this op enemy army over here all because your sworn enemy asked you to the buildings are hit or miss especially some of the unique ones for the factions some are hilariously good and over powered others are practically useless just like some of the factions a few of them are so poorly laid out that you have to do a cookie cutter routine for the first two or three turns just to have a chance so that your starting half stack doesn t get stomped by an ai full stack turn 1 i m looking at you ma teng the food mechanic is boring pointless and only seems to exist to force you to play the crappy sim city lite of province management it s still as bad as it was since attila and it doesn t have the new feeling that it did when it cropped up in shogun 2 at least the tech tree being an every 5 turns kind of thing is neat i ll give credit to that one the assignments and administrators work well i feel and i have no real complaints there though i wish characters leveled up faster from assignments considering most of them take 15 turns or so while i was originally concerned about the restricted trade deals i haven t seen it be much of a problem you unlock more through reforms and you can get them through some pretty low tech so it isn t hard to get one or two more if you really need them the combat is painfully unrewarding the units have the same problem as attila all i see is an uninteresting blob of units with green and red dots hovering over them and eventually one of the units breaks and runs away the unit types are really boring the unit cards are sinfully ugly and the game is never very clear on exactly how you re supposed to unlock certain units not that the ai cares about needing to do such things archers being low ammo but high damage feels bad like ca wants the battle to be even more arcade y than they were in the garbage of attila they feel fairly over powered to me i have grown to hate the crap that is officers all being forced into specific troop types maybe i m looking too much into it but it also feels really dumb to try and put sword infantry on a commander that hands out buffs to spear infantry i rather like the retinue system itself even if the costs of trying to ever redeploy can be quite prohibitive it s still an arms race to a full stack so meh but it has promise i have yet to win a combat duel even when using lu bu poached him with a marriage amusingly enough feels bad i m pretty sure the mechanic is just broken tl dr i m not a fan of the stylistic direction ca is going if you liked attila and everything after it you ll probably like this especially with some of the new mechanics and features same old problems are still there bigger maps than warhammer at least if you liked pre attila tw pass this up until the next sale so that the modders have the time to make the game enjoyable
