2018 i have over 670 hours in this game i own many creative assembly games and have been playing total war games since shogun 1 i haven t played rome ii in a long time now but remember the time i spent with this game fondly conquering the entire known world at the head of indomitable legions unfortunately the mental illness of cultural marxism has infected even the staff of creative assembly where once there was historial authenticity and accuracy now there is only anti white male hate and a sickness of the heart that seeks to change real history in favor of a fantasy that appeals to the feelings of people who are basically misled communists a great shame that this societal cancer has affected even such a cherished historical war simulation game as rome ii considering the fact that most of the people who buy and play games like this are white males the same people these sjw hires seek to demean for shame fire ca ella if you have any sense left creative assembly
