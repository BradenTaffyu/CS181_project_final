2019 i really miss 1 9 tbh the old planet management was much easier i feel the new system is not very clear at all and takes to much time away from the core mechanic of the game also i feel the new resources dont add much alloys and also make the game unnecisarily more complicated where it doesnt need to be i also miss the old border pushing mechanic outpost are no longer a strategic tool you only build if you really need to but instead you build them in every single system boring also colonizing planets is no longer as strategic as it used to be all in all simple interesting mechanics were traded in for complicated uninteresting ones
