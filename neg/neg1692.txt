2023 a little hypocritical of me with 600 hours on it but on the other hand i speak from experience yes it s free but it s a trap if you have no self control better to stay away you ll be obsessed in the beginning and once you ve tried everything it has to offer you ll see everything it s lacking and then you ll find that there s a dlc for that and that as well oh and that other thing also so yes it s entertaining but expensive and overpriced when you consider everything
