2022 don t i ve spent almost or about 1000 on this series i ve played it for thousands of hours i transferred my game over from origin because origin sucks my hours on steam do not reflect the hours of my life i ve given to this game every single time as of a few months ago that i want to boot up this game i stop myself i know i will be enjoying myself and run into something game breaking look i have been playing the sims religiously since sims 1 buying all the expansions been playing this series religiously since i was a teenager well into adulthood sims 1 sims 2 sims 3 and all the little expansions while the games could always get buggy and weird i had faith that the developers would work it out the sims 4 is unplayable for me at times in fact back in november of last year 2021 it became completely unplayable with sims freezing and doing nothing this happens too often too often i can t enjoy this game anymore things are not getting fixed and i m mad about it i ve spent too much money and time for it to be such a bad experience almost every time i boot this game up the sims 5 i don t want it fix this game
