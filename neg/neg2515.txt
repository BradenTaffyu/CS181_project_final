2021 by far the best hunting game you can find first off even though most maps are purchasable dlc you can play on any map in multiplayer no need to buy a map unless you want to play it single player i have over 500 hrs on ps4 in addition to my time on pc it s a game i always find myself coming back to and when it is working properly there isn t anything quite like it the thrill of the hunt whether you re taking a long range shot or putting on the stalk this game will give you what you crave it isn t a run and gun style arcade hunter animals do spook rather easily and you need to be mindful during your searches and approaches it can be fully immersive and leave you wondering where the time has gone the graphics are second to none and make for some amazing screenshots however it is quite apparent that the developers are only concerned with pushing untested dlc s with every bit of fresh content comes new bugs the vast majority of which go unfixed for months at the time of this review multiple maps are broken one africa is completely unplayable due to severe fps dropping and audio cutting out a few others are without the fast travel mechanic a render bug that makes your kills disappear seems to still be around after several months and patches i don t even want to begin on ducks they are basically fish you just shoot them on the water the duck calls and blinds are all pointless they haven t worked properly in the 2 years i have played the game these are just some of the most egregious bugs there are dozens more that just kind of leave you scratching your head and honestly at some points pulling your hair out i like this game i want to continue enjoying it i want more people to play this game i want you to buy it if you re interested in it most importantly i want you to know what your money is going towards this game is on a slippery slope it has a great community and hopefully the top content creators who are in touch with the devs actually start to use their weight this game will no doubt be around for years to come with new dlc s and maps dropping a few times each year hopefully it starts trending back in the correct direction
