2021 i m going to have to give this one a downvote after finding out about klei now being involved with tencent to briefly summarize tencent owns a majority stake in klei with claims that things will just keep going as usual for the company i m sure there s some folk out there rolling their eyes saying just to criticize the game itself separate art from the artist etc but the more you learn about how tencent operates and just how much power they hold in the electronic entertainment market already the more disconcerting it becomes china is notorious for censoring content and demanding changes to satisfy their political and cultural demands you ll have to forgive me for being skeptical when i hear things like tencent is the only company that we felt would let us retain the level of control that we demand as things are there s plenty of other games out there both indie and multi a that you can select from and have a blast with i won t lie i had fun with oxygen not included while it lasted it s definitely not a game for the impatient and should you play expect a hefty amount of trial and error and or looking up layouts and strategies online but it s not so fantastic an experience that i m willing to bend on my moral integrity for it on the plus side dropping oni has given me a lot more time to dive into the many other games in my backlog that i ve been meaning to get around to if you like sci fi and resource management base building consider checking out something like mindustry it s a much cheaper game while still providing a lot of potential as a time sink for those looking for that experience
