2015 i m biased towards this game in that i actually live in las vegas it is not bias in favor of this game if anything actually living here made me dislike this game further i think las vegas was mostly a terrible choice for setting in the first place i ll explain that later yes i have spent over a hundred hours in this game that was pretty much only because its fallout and i love fallout so even if there is a weak fallout i m going to play it and i m going to do everything the game has to offer so why do i not recommend it well overall its the weakest fallout in my opinion first and foremost let s talk technical this game has more bugs than a termite mound you think games actually made by bethesda are bad this is a hundred times worse you will need half a dozen mods just to keep it from crashing every 20 minutes and then it will still crash at random i ve only talked about all the crashing but rest assured there are plenty more bugs than just the ones that crash your game quests that are still broken as hell tons of visual glitches ai glitches really just think of a type of bug and its in this game then there are the loading screens so so many loading screens for example you get a player home on the strip if you want to fast travel there its hidden behind 3 5 loading screens three full loading screens and a baby load screen for an elevator ride if you want to talk about pc games being brought down by consoles point to this game soooo many corners were cut to make this game work on consoles you could make excuses for the game and say that this is all because of a troubled production but in the end we still get the same bug ridden disaster so how s the rest of the game well the gameplay is a straight improvement over fallout 3 the dlc ranges from better than the main game to only good actually the dlc is the best reason to play this game namely because the dlc feels more fallout than the main game what the hell do i mean by that let s go into detail i mentioned i actually live in las vegas so i can say with certainty that las vegas was a bad decision for a setting to begin with your first thoughts are but the casinos the strip what you don t realize is that between the strip and the hoover dam there isn t a whole lot more to the mojave this adds up to a boring game world the interesting part of las vegas begins and ends at the strip and true to real life the main feature of new vegas is the strip too bad that the strip is the biggest disappointment of an already disappointing game more on that later fallout 3 got me spoiled as far as getting me engrossed into the plot goes it drug on for quite a while but it did wonders for immersion to have you live out your abridged upbringing comming hot off the heels of that nv starts you off as some guy girl getting shot in the head and nursed back to health who are you the courier what s your involvement in the main plot you wanna find the guy who shot you in the face some enjoy the blank slate i prefer when you get to fill in some of that slate yourself this would be more tolerable if they stuck with it but in one of the dlcs you have a character just start telling you what your backstory is and why you did those actions at the time you have no choice but to sit there and nod as your previous blank slate has someone fill it in for you that s one of this game s major sins railroading for a sandbox rpg the first six hours or so have you on a pretty firm path sure you are free to leave those rails if you don t mind dying you start out at the southwest corner of the map and are told you must go to new vegas to the north if you go north enemies that are far too strong for you will kill you to encourage you to get back on those rails the devs laid for you so instead of taking the obvious path or any other path you take the long way so the devs can make sure you re seeing the story in the right order along this six hour path you will have plenty of convenient mountains to make sure you don t stray too far from your rails as well as a healthy dose of invisible walls there are so many invisible walls in this game its just not funny it becomes painfully obvious that they re there to keep you from going places in the wrong order the game does eventually open up but until that point you re playing a sandbox game in name only i hear a lot of people praising the writing of this game but i m just not seeing it its good but its not great i didn t care for it too much a matter of taste but it wasn t bad mostly the tone is very similar to a borderlands game your reactions to those games and their writing will probably be similar here i will say that the writing is severely overrated my main problem is that almost every single quest is related to the main plot why is this bad it makes the world seem smaller and indeed this is still the smallest fallout to date if you re like me and don t really care for the main plot that much you re in serious trouble there s no ignore the main plot and just go explore and do sidequests you re going to get involved in the main plot and you will like it i d say the main problem with new vegas is that it is not post apocalyptic enough a bunch of small towns scattered around a radioactive desert is what nevada is actually like the entire point of fallout is wandering a post apocalyptic wasteland the times you are not doing that should be noteable i e large settlements factions that have been hiding out since before the war alien ships etc new vegas is less post apocalyptic and more just a desert with fallout wallpaper but there was a chance to have one such area that really set itself appart from the rest of the world a near mythical city where it almost seems like the bombs never fell a city where a tiny glimpse of the old world can be had one grand city in the middle of a baren world with people flocking to it to try and make their fortun or just experience the glory of the old world new vegas sadly that is nowhere close to what you find you find 3 run down casinos plus a fourth that s non functional huddled together on a torn up street with like 6 npcs wandering about you get railroaded to the strip for upwards of six hours and after having it hyped up along the way its impossible to be so underwhelmed its actually heartbreaking fallout 2 made reno a thousand times better than las vegas was in this game as someone who lives in nevada the idea that reno could ever be better than vegas is sickening get used to dissapointment in this game its a running theme there are a lot of instances of events or locations being hyped into legend only for you to see it and wonder why all the npcs are so easily impressed the other major moment in massive underwhelm ment is the second battle of hoover dam its built up over the whole game as something that will live in legends for all time an epic battle between two massive armies and then there s like 7 npcs on each side fighting at any given time when i got to the final battle the epic climax the first thing i did was pause my game to make sure i wasn t getting some bug that caused each side s army to consist of 7 dudes that are no more powerful that the ones you ve fought a hundred times already it was then that i realize this game had peaked in the dlc you see like non broken steel fallout 3 this game has an end after which it is over and your only option for playing more is reloading a save it was unacceptable then it is unacceptable now any sandbox rpg with hard end is worse for it the game isn t horrible its good even it is by far the worst fallout even among the old school ones if you have to buy it buy it on sale but do know that it is massively overhyped
