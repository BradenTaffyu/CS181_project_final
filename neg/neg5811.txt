2016 not worth it for fans of history and or fans of grand strategy games unless you are willing to get multiple mods or one of the total overhaul mods for it look for vae victis radious mod or divide et impera and perhaps some others i prefer vae victis because it centers on historical accuracy and includes the ability to play every faction creative assembly used to be fairly diligent when it came to historical accuracy but now they can t even be bothered to correct the misspelling of an important celtic tribe of the period the atrebates as atrebartes even after many patches and updates and multiple dlc ca is only in it for the money now and the days when the devs loved the history enough to care about such things is long gone it takes modders now to make ca games good when before in the days of med 1 2 and rome 1 and shogun 2 the mods merely improved upon already good games
