2022 don t drop together it s a good game at first and time is spent learning what to do but at some point it gets frustrating it takes time to find resources to survive and when you re ready to build a camp or survive the winter everyone just leaves the server graphics and animations are good and there is no game breaking bugs in sight however without a half or full server the experience is mediocre at best dst doesn t feel rewarding enough to keep playing which is the reason for player drops and a lot of empty servers you need more than one friend to play this game or it gets dull really fast thanks for reading my review agree or disagree this is how i experience dst
