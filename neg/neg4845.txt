2018 if you re a fairly casual gamer and just want some fun then this game will meet those requirements it also will last you a very long time if you ve already bought the previous game which is the start of the biggest problem with the warhammer total war series of games pretty much from the design stage of the first warhammer total war game it was clearly a cash grab and it s atrocious that so much content is behind paywalls it s completely amoral and absolutely in line with the unfriendly consumer treatment that has become the norm for creative assembly beyond that the actual meat of the game the battles themselves are pretty much as deep as a puddle if you were expecting anything other than a statcheck system of combat before buying then you ll only be disappointed for years features like formations or even just having your units take a wide spread to reduce projectile damage have been part of the total war franchise yet for some reason implementing those same features that have been done time and time again because they were good was overlooked the real time tactics genre is in dire need of competition because ca is just on the consumer s plate and calling it a feast don t worry though for the small price of 250 you can unlock all the content that should have been in the games edit late 2019 and with the game having had a lot of updates some of the campaigns feel a lot more fleshed out in other places the ai as usual for tw has become somehow worse that said there are mods to rectify the problem the game now offers a large amount of content without paying for dlc far moreso than upon release and despite the campaign battles still being pretty bad and the siege battles infinitely worse multiplayer battles are very interesting i still can t really recommend the game but it s a huge improvement from what it was and i m excited to see more
