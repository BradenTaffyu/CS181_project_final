2023 the game is not what it is advertised at all i would equate it to a scam i am only sad that it took me this many hours to find out this has nothing to do with performance or optimization check out city doesn t generate a demand for goods when you build a cargo terminal the assigned ships or trains will deliver all resources in the game to it even garbage they deliver an amount equal to terminal storage 70 of one of the resources at a time a cargo port has 15 500 storage capacity so you will see ships carrying 222 metal ore 222 food and so on these deliveries occur even if your city has no commercial and or industrial zones this means that even though i have spent millions on incinerators garbage processing lots in a small city the games fake economy actually imports endless amounts of garbage which causes my cities to forever to have overflowing garbage shops in commercial zones and industrial facilities will never use these resources this was tested by placing a cargo port cutting all highway connections in the city deleting all industrial zones and creating new commercial zones near the port commercial buildings spawn with a certain amount of goods to operate with according to their type you can see this by clicking on a delivery truck and checking its owner there s an invisible warehouse inside every commercial or industrial building you can wait until their storages depleted without any interaction from customers btw and the port s storage filled with goods 222 food 222 plastics etc so you have commercial zones with no goods no highway connections and a port full of goods do the shops send their trucks to pick up goods from the port no they just stand without goods to sell but still generate income and pay taxes they won t go bankrupt this is not as advertised the game advertises itself as an economy simulation game on the steam page it saysw deep simulation and a living economy this is a lie the most realistic and detailed city builder ever yet it is worse than its predecessor in the actual gameplay mechanics it claims to push your creativity and problem solving to another level however there are no problems as it is all fake without a real simulation and the only creativity is endlessly coloring plots exports are broken it has been to tested i placed a train cargo hub near a forestry industry and cut all highway connections i had over 700 tons of surplus wood and no industry to process it why don t they deliver wood to the terminal because they can deliver wood only to logs storage which can randomly appear in an industrial zone if there are no storages the trucks will simply disappear even if they could export wood logs so if you have no logs storage in your city all your timber factories will buy logs from the outside but maybe they export logs by teleporting them nope i forced one of the invisible forestry storages to have 65 9 out of 60 tons of logs and they remained at 65 9 i have also personally noticed indefinite crashes accident scenes even though i have invested tons in road management offices etc sometimes the pedestrians cars glitch on cross walks and collide and then just sit there stuck for hours to summarize shops and factories don t need goods resources to generate income you can t import goods by trains or ships to be used by shops or factories they will stay in the terminal storage indefinitely you can t export anything this game is a scam and is not at all what was advertised
