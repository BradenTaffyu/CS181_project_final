2023 the more i play the game the more i notice how much has been cut a lot of little things that are essential either the release was rushed or it was just supposed to be a very simple game for casual console players there is currently no chat in the lobby the matchmaking system is just annoying and confusing once you have pressed ready you are no longer allowed to make it unready which means you are no longer allowed to change the build profile if you accidentally do so chose incorrectly you can no longer rename profiles either the outfits are not saved separately in the profile if you change your outfit this applies to all profiles no precise information when choosing missions you don t know how many times you have played it there are no multi day missions the mission menu is not well thought out it is not divided into categories you have to scroll for a long time if more missions are added in the future you will have to scroll for a very long time then you have to turn off the mission videos beforehand so that you have a better overview every time and also watch the intro every time even if you just restart the mission you can t skip it rng is hardly available so you can skip a lot of objectives next time you can no longer give orders to bots they are useless sometimes they even get in the way of stealth when they suddenly put on the mask and start shooting around during loud missions they sometimes stop somewhere and then go down unnecessarily but i like the new stealth system it s different than payday 2 and the only positive thing about the game but everything around it seems cut and very very simple the mission leader s voice is monotonous and annoying her information is also not helpful she says the bags are all at the destination while we are still carrying bags there is no information about how many bags are left so it will be a bit difficult with achievements you often just want a perfect run with all the loot and be rewarded for it but you won t be rewarded it doesn t seem to be important because now you level with random challenges so you don t concentrate on the missions but have to make sure you do your personal challenges so you slide around pointlessly because it s a challenge or use weapons that you don t even want to play on the one hand such challenges can be quite good as they progress it shows how much knowledge a player has of the game weapons and mechanics gone are the days when players even with high infamy level had no idea about the game because they just played the same missions for xp over and over again on the other hand the missions in pd3 just seem like an excuse and but it feels forced and isn t fun there should also be a lot of xp for side tasks optional things that you can include during the missions but if you don t complete any challenges you hardly get any xp and there is no sense of success which is not a good thing in the long term the skill system is also unnecessarily complicated you unlock everything one after the other so at the beginning you play with certain skills so that you can unlock them first only then can you create your desired build it artificially extends the playing time there are no more meele attacks in the game you can only use them to stun cops or force civilians to the ground you can no longer dominate enemies unless the guards give up beforehand there is hardly any interaction with them the enemies generally seem kind of boring the cloaker that you see running around sometimes looking confused but then very determined to blow you away you often don t have a chance the bulldozer looks like a stupid gorilla that charges and then runs into a wall that seems ridiculous i like the shields though i also like the effect when you get too close to them you can no longer turn them off as easily by dancing around what i like are the little mini games at the locks finally no stupid pressing of f until it is open but so many details are missing paintings have e g the same bags as other loot and no longer curled up throwing bags also feels strange no dual weapons no lasers payday never had a crosshair it came as an update for pd2 but very very late i always thought that was good and unique everything seems as wannabe modern as all the other shooters the music is also no longer as exciting as in the previous games in one mission it sounds like in cyberpunk it lacks the feeling of thrill when the assault is about to begin and the excitement when there is a break you don t headbang anymore because the songs just play along and you don t pay attention too bad one wonders whether there was even a gamedesigner who had an overview of everything and had small but important things added i can only shake my head as to what they were thinking releasing it in this state as if they haven t learned anything in the last 10 years i tried to like the game but i m not really having fun yet and i can see so many mistakes it s not a bad game the graphics are pretty there are a lot of first missions but everything seems like a generic shooter without anything of its own everything that payday is all about with all the attention to detail and charm because there is no neutral thumb on steam i ll give it a thumbs down let s see what happens in the future
