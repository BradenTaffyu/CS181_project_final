2017 updated for waking the tiger original review so when i was first checking out hearts of iron iv i heard about the bad ai and such but thought its on sale why not having played hoi2 and hoi3 plus many of their other games i figured the ai can t be that bad surely there s a playable game somewhere so i start with italy doing some italy 36 scenarios restarting a bunch as i learn the system tech is fine i like the new resource management less fidly than hoi3 and even the army management is good for less important fronts no the computer doesn t really know anything about tactics other than forwards or back but that s been true for earlier releases annoying but not game stopping on one of the playthroughs where i got to wars start in septemeber of 39 i did a verticle envelopment of french troops in the alps dropping paratroopers behind the enemy to cut supplies and retreats it was messy but successful germany wins in the north and then the vichy event triggers preventing me from aquireing almost all of my gains okay i can see the hard script to handle a fairly peculiar feature of wwii next time i just won t declare till after france falls i start it up go the italy first route and take greece then yugoslavia intentionally waiting on yugoslavia for sept of 39 so that the allies will think twice aboout starting war with a different faction they don t protect and i steamroll yugoslavia only france is still up they have a single division on our border germany hasn t taken anything it s declared on benelux denmark and norway and taken nothing with denmark i don t mean that it gets stuck taking copenhagen i mean it doesn t even get the peninsula the german reich can t take down belgium or netherlands it might have taken luxemburg okay so maybe the game is flawed and meant really just to be played 1 player as germany clearly you can t trust the ai to be remotely competent as the main aggressor so just be the main aggressor i do a couple of warm up germany 36 starts then start my real one my goal is to build up the germany navy and attempt a legitimate sea lion no cheesy suprise landings massive paradrops or other win control of the high seas in a fair way but first i need to defeat france and take their navy out of the way poland gets taken quickly but instead of the immediate switch of fronts i decide to get the extra research slot first i ll try to invade france in december i set up a fairly standard assualt through benelux with fast armor units paradrops and so forth france has been severly testing my western wall which has 24 divisions of standard 36 infantry defending it they almost get through a couple times so i m keeping an eye on it while i wait for the focuses to finally let me into benelux italy had joined the war day 1 i hate when they do that as their fleet will get butchered by england and france together but i was to afraid a refusing them might mean i coudn t invite them later the italian ai is actually giving the french a run for their money in the south at which point i notice france has stopped attacking the western wall so i look a little closer and i don t see the french units thinking this might be a display thing i order some units to take the maginot line which they do uncontested france pulled out all units from the maginot line with 24 german divisions sitting across from it and no war going on in benelux they let me walk in not even a single division to keep up appearances sure the french ai probably registered the italian thrust as needing some reinforcements great but the maginot was no where close to being flanked and cut off the italians had marseiles i don t think they had even crossed the river there the french gave me the maginot line that s how bad this ai is update for 1 5 1 with expansions i really want to like this game which makes it all the more frustrating i haven t been playing germany so no update on whether or not the maginot line issue has been fixed but the ai still launches pointless charges into your lines and pursues them to the bitter end even when they have zero chance of winning and it hurts their long term interest as well and i don t mean 40 60 fights i mean 5 95 fights a waste of digital lives but that s not all it could be overlooked if in the composite things balanced out but it doesn t germany often stalls in barbarossa without getting past poland out of material and low on manpower it also means that if the italians don t get into the fight vs the french the germans often don t even take france but that s not enough to make a horrible game instead once multiple countries on different sides get involved peace treaties end up a total mess not just for vichy but for pretty much any multisided engagement there is not respect for forces on the ground territories can be taken from an occupying army without consent due to internal oddities in how the war got put together civil wars are particularly bad in this regard and thats when the system is working as designed multiple bugs are still rampant i won as national china vs japan but during the fight japan declared war on communist china even though they were no where nearby i was not in alliance with cc so they join the commitern and pull the ussr into it this colosally bad move on the part of the japanese isn t the problem i had cut the japanese forces off at beijing and trapped a large portion of their troops i raced the soviets and beat them to the best parts of manchuria and korea as the soviets progressed some territory was shown under their control other parts under communist china control whe i latter attaced and quickly beat communist china their manchurian territory was given to me on the map but the soviets still controlled and profitted from the industry there they were listed as controller i was going to have to go to war with the soviets to win territory i already controlled other bugs include weird colors popping up at different times and the need to restart the program when different visuals decide to go wonky but then some other this is still workable until you dig a little deeper the air war has bad modelling with air superiority the naval modelling is extremely bad the ai will never research new ships or naval doctrines making the solo naval game super easy once the player researches just a few tech in addition submarine warfare seems to make no sense at all the ui is neither intuitive nor truly useful naval battles can last an extremely long time once engaged they seem to include 100 knowledge of opponents force location with no fog of war they are all simulated anyway with no imput from the player at all except for attempting to retreat your forces out these super battles seem to draw in all forces in the area even those it makes no sense to subs seem to be incredibly underpowered partially because the ai knows their location once found i hvent done multiplayer but the people testing optimal flee configurations report that pure battleship or pure carrier fleets no screens at all are the optimal configuration even apparently vs subs so the modeling is bad and the composite result is bad so the game is mediocre to poor if you play a mostly land fight in europe asia or africa and utterly attrocious once peace deals and naval are factored in i really wsnt to like this game but its just soo bad
