2023 early access review it s interesting to mess around with but not a game that i feel any urge to come back to after seeing the end game it s more of a sandbox than an actual roguelike in the sense that it s poorly balanced and meant to be so there s a lot of cool builds and items to play around with but the game lacks a coherent challenge difficulty curve to keep things compelling and meaningful in the long run if it was more tightly balanced i could see this being a lot more engaging and interesting and worth coming back to
