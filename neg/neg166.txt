2017 here s the thing nier automata is an absolutely fantastic game the combat is nice fluid and diverse thanks to a neat management system and a diverse amount of weapons you can pick up so you can change up your fighting style the story is slow but becomes incredibly engaging the more you play i don t think i need to even mention how great the soundtrack is many other people have said that before but here s the thing i played the game back around when it launched when i wanted to play the game really bad and didn t care about the performance issues at the time there s a mod that fixes some of the issues that came out and it got updated frequently but people were still waiting patiently for a patch to come out to fix these issues such as basic fullscreen support and optimization just so you know the game runs really bad unless you have a decent range pc with a mid range gpu such as a gtx 1060 970 you ll still get stuttering fyi square enix promised a patch months ago to aide these issues but there has been absolutely no patch released i ve seen multiple people still unable to play the game due to the issues that still remain in this port not just with poor optimization but with people unable to launch the game at all or have unplayable performance despite the game having relatively poor graphics is staggering months ago i would have recommended this but it s been half a year now and people are still waiting for something that still might not ever come so please send messages to square in any way possible to patch automata for it to be an acceptable port to have them put out the patch they promised if they were able to release a dlc they can release a simple patch fixing the game 11 22 2017 the patch has still not been released where is it square 6 11 2018 still not released you put more resources into the xbox port than you do for the pc version come on square
