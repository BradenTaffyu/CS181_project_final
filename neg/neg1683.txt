2022 sims 4 has the advantage of being more stable than sims 3 technology improve the less animation we got since both games are produced by ea they both share the same dlc issues but 3 is still the better game and that remains a fact review about description art graphic gotta say it looks cartoony but that doesn t really bother me it has its own style and at least it isn t using the shell shading graphics used in indie games like genshin the style of the game brings the sims more to life maybe color wasn t really a big deal even though some maps that look better are hidden behind a paywall dlc so far i ve had no problems gameplay we re going to make a lot of comparisons to the previous successful game the sims 3 the base gameplay remains the same but many things from sims 3 have been removed and moved to dlc and many other things appear to have been removed by ea when it comes to the sims 4 s base game it stinks it s not open world the sims are going to work using uber and we have no car we can t even buy one no interesting part time job no grocery store and the best thing where you can beg for money just by playing guitar on the street is gone along with the last no sh t given by ea the good thing is its more modern good animation using mods improvement stuff from sims 3 is using mods and also woohoo is better using mods the best thing about the game without mods you ve got to pay for it see sims 4 is better than sims 3 because the community has more and better mods than the entire game multiplayer you can download other people s creations from the library or upload your own pre built structure to the internet not like the sims mobile or freeplay there is no online visit control i do need some time to get used to the new camera control though we are able to use sims 3 controls but i prefer to move on so while there is no issue with the keyboard and mouse there is an accessibility issue keep reading music or sound although the sims 3 gameplay is fantastic the sims 2 has superior audio and music than any other the sims game playtime it may take around 10 hours for just the base game and around 924 hours according to many users using dlc or community mods will extend the length of your sims game story ah the sims game where you could create your own narrative and pass away after woohooing in beds with the grim reaper or even in straw piles what the heck are you doing ea did the dev engage in sexual activity in the straw pile how tough is the meat there oh my god pc port tested oswindows 10 pro 64 bit version 22h2 hardwareamd ryzen

dumb they become ea alonethe game version used to create this review was 1 93 129 1030 dlc in app purchases well i only have season that s not even worth it for its price get in on sale above 50 i use mods to make the game more entertaining than the entire private life of the ea employee community health region price community full of bug report and laucher problem typical ea price were ass get it on sale the biggest clown you ll ever see is ea itself my oppinion the sims 5 gets leaked i had no interested with that builder stuff seem like the game will removed much better stuff than before
