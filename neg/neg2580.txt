2018 there is a problem within the game and that is disappearing blood trails i ll get 2 good hits to the chest on moose with a higher caliber rifle and the blood trail will say that it is only a flesh wound problem 1 registered good hits even which have had to increasingly been gut shots to get a good trail have the magically vanishing blood trail problem 2 even walking ever widening circles for nearly half a mile will reveal no blood trails this code glitch needs to be seriously looked into yeah its beautiful and sounds good so what if the frustration level is so high why play i ll have the game running just to listen to the sounds but this blood trail problem doesnt make it worth playing and getting frustrated to the point of shutting the maching down until its corrected i ll give a 50 50 yes or no
