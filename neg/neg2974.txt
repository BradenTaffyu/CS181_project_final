2018 this game had it s problems from the start which is pretty standard for a paradox title but it had a good concept and fun mechanics it slogged down a lot mid late game and had the horribly anti fun sector system but that s been improving bit by bit then 2 0 came the powers that be decided to remove the glorious sword of the stars style of drive systems it started with and slow down the combat system which made warring in general an incredibly dull slog every update seems to be designed to take choices away from the player see originally you could select a style of drive tech how you travel faster than light with upsides and downsides between each choice that made certain vocal players really sad because they demanded everyone play with the drive tech they like cuz it s more hardcore grr so paradox helpfully removed every other option there was already a setting when making a game to enable disable specific drive styles that wasn t good enough so paradox actually removed the more popular options and left the least popular one as the only choice but wait there s more oh you guys like each other and want to ally sorry you don t meet the magic space rules for allying you can t even try ooh you want to vassalize this tiny annoying neighbor to fortify your flank sorry he s not strong enough compared to you so you can t vassalize him because space law says so you want to attack the flesh eating monstrosity that s squatting on the good planets just across your border sorry you didn t prepare the correct paperwork in time for the mystic space war review board so you are not allowed to do anything at all hey we ll throw you a bone though we ll give you a quest that requires you to go into the territory of the monsters that hate you that you can t attack oops you can t do that either see you might be a warmongering dictator with the strongest military in the galaxy but crossing over a border without permission is just rude so we can t have that if you fill out the right forms for review and wait ten years though well maybe we ll let you attack briefly only for as long as the review board says though then your war is over and you lose even if you had your fleet orbiting the planet with the enemies last troop on it bombing it into oblivion oh and we ll force you to sign a ten year treaty with them afterwords i mean you were going to anyway right so we ll just helpfully take that out of your hands don t worry your pretty little head about it i ve tried four games since 2 0 and i haven t enjoyed any of them with the most recent patch 2 1 the game will barely even run due to a broken feature implemented that can t be turned off without disabling an entire dlc it seems like a lot of concepts are being ported over from the crusader kings and europa games those are great games but turn of the century political and military concepts don t make a lick of sense in the context of stellaris i do not recommend this title in it s current state there are 5 dlcs ranging from 10 20 for this title and the base game itself is just broken right now that s 110 for the full game not counting cosmetic packs and such that s been out for two years and it doesn t even work right absolutely not worth it
