2018 hello all thank you for taking the time to read this review it s not meant to be anything special just my two cents on a few categories with what i m seeing i remember buying shogun the original back in 2000 and literally every game in the franchise since then though in varying forms of media cds downloads steam etc i have to say that i really like the total war franchise and i was not really put off by the move to a fantasy based theme that being said i am fairly disappointed in this title new mechanicsi find nothing substantially innovative or awe inspiring within the game i get that there are dragons and sorcery however it just feels lackluster it s as if the new fantasy elements were implemented in such a manner that was driven by a desire to simply check it off on a list rather than be immersive there are other titles out there that do a better job with the fantasy elements tactical gameplay battles the battles feel brutish and tactics have little importance you can hide troops and maneuver them into positions like any other tw title there are sorcery aspects to consider and it should be noted that they can play a major role in the battle however that s pretty much it flanking an enemy unit or using the terrain to your advantage just doesn t feel like it carries much weight as the previous titles in the series strategy gameplay strategy map i feel that the strategy aspect has also taken a hit the political and economic dynamics within the series has steadily become less of a factor sure you can engage in diplomacy however it is limited or at the very least contains no meaningful progress they seem to have taken the provincial feature from rome ii which i actually like and fused it with the warhammer series i will say that i like the map and the vortex plot though i won t get more into it just in case one of you wants to play the game and not get spoiled business modeli find their approach to selling their product downright appalling the base warhammer ii game comes with only a select few playable races in order to play the many other races you have to purchase warhammer i both games are priced at 60 so in order to get the full range of playability you are looking at 120 that s just the playable races there are additional dlc items that cost more i m starting to see the developer fall into the money grab category i get that it s a business and i m ok with paying full price just so long as i get a complete game and not one that has been chopped up to be sold piece meal overallthey introduced a new dynamic to the tw series i liked their motivation for something new unfortunately the developers did not meet the standards established by their older titles if you feel compelled to buy it ok just wait for a sale if you want a tw game that really hits the spot try shogun ii i shouldn t have paid full price for warhammer ii and steam won t accept a refund as i have played more than the alloted time allowed to accept the refund i hope that they develop a game that at the very least meets their historical standards and perhaps surpasses it i would love to be excited over a tw again
