devs you have something dope here please please listen to what the community has to say the game is really good under piles and piles of unnecessary headache for the average player i know people can be rude and truthfully over aggressive with reviews maybe even mine but its so worth it to fix the blaring issues in the game 48 hour edit the game is addicting but horrible from a casual fun standpoint working your way up from a clapped honda to a 500 hp widebody bmw m4 feels awesome even though the economy is absolutely terrible it all does get better xp and money but is should not take me 20 hours to feel better the game should leave a good first impression and it most definitely does not you have to really upgrade your car to make it competitive and that costs so much money dont even get me started on body kits for the more expensive cars to get a widebody on my m4 was 200k all the tuning was probably around another 300k plus the stupid streetbucks which are alarmingly scarce i had to sell cars that i dumped money into just to get into the next class and upgrade my car the grind is good but way too tedious and punishing remove or rework the turbo whine when im full throttling i do not want a high pitch frequency just blaring in my ears i dont know if its my headset or what on earth is going on but its absolutely horrible why on earth can you not repeat races what happens when i am done doing all the clubs do the devs expect everyone to be content with content with doing single race time trials and the elite races that are 2 hours cooldowns with the requirement of having the car in the club i had high hopes for carx that wasn t solely focused on drifting but it just seems off played for about an hour and decided it wasn t for me i repurchased because i felt like i didnt give it enough of a chance and maybe i was missing something i was not the game is 20 and feels like it its not a good deal and you barely get what you pay for edit tldr cars dont turn ai cant even make turns in some races ai will slam into you constantly upgrading is tedious world feels lifeless systems could be cool but suck tire wear and refilling gas ai art and voices are cringe most races i dont feel like ive won because i was a good driver but more so that the ai slammed into something or didnt slam into me for taking correct lines hopefully will be fixed in the future double edit the ai being ten billion metric tons compared your your car made of tampons and toothpicks while they are hellbent on slamming into you needs to be the absolute next thing changed in the game if you want the ai to be aggressive they cant literally just throw your car around with zero repercussions this is completely unacceptable currently 48 hour edit the game is

why on earth can you not repeat races what happens when i am done doing all the clubs do the devs expect everyone to be content with content with doing single race time trials and the elite races that are 2 hours cooldowns with the requirement of having the car in the club driving feels extremely ok maybe even too stiff but also can be too loose like you either have traction and cant make a turn or you feel like you hit some vaseline on the road like i said it just feels weird the city feels really lifeless and the all the drivers ai is whack including the normal traffic and racers ai will act like you aren t even next to them to avoid things and slam into you every car on the road feels like they are on rails its really strange not sure why every single racing game absolutely needs horrible dialog constantly to make it worse its ai generated schlop voice acting luckily you can turn the dialog sound all the way off cars and customization is fine not a huge improvement from their previous game infact they reuse a bunch of the assets specifically the wheels i noticed i was hoping for a raw street racing game but it really doesn t hit the screenshots are misleading and the environment can look kinda gormless for 20 im sure you can get some fun out of it but it really wasn t what i was expecting i would of paid a full 60 if the game had some life put into it to be honest the fact that they didn t put any gameplay trailers out there or anything except one trailer a day or two before release is weird it just seems like they had a great idea and slapped it together and made it playable i thought upgrades would make handling it more tolerable they make it slightly less horrible so far having to play six hours from my car to feel like dogwater to then upgrade it to feel like lukewarm dogwater isnt a great introduction brother in christ if your ai in the game that you are racing cannot make some of the turns either there is something drastically wrong with the handling physics in general many races have the ai racers slamming into walls or even understeering off the track if you have driven a car you know that you can still turn going at moderate speed not in this game i understand rev limiters and having bone stock cars do not preform like a tuned car but brother a normal car does not act the way they do in this game the rev limiter in will literally stop throttle completely and reengage within the rev limit most games have the revs throttle out and you hear it go rtrtrtrtrt when you redline this game the engine goes rtrt then it feels and sounds like the car shuts off for a second this feels horrendous regardless of how realistic it may or may not be i would imagine this is only an issue while driving manual gas should not make me go broke every 30 minutes it is immersive and cool just make it cheap tires should not wear out as fast or at all having tire wear adds nothing but a nuisance to the game nitpick don t force me to have the lettering on the tires please i like just black tires the upgrading workshop is a mess for example unless i haven t seen it which i looked for but did not find you must change the front then back wheels size not both together almost all upgrades are gated which is fine but like if you want to lower your car level up xp is pretty slow it does ramp up but it still fells like im leveling up just so i can lower my car lmao
