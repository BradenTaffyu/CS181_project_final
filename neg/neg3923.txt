2020 don t be fooled by my long playtime most of it came from early access prior to the 1 0 release this is one of those rare games that actually got worse than it was in early access the devs have spent too much time balancing weapons and enemies which has basically always come at the detriment to the player to make the combat more grindy why the devs felt this was necessary for a single player roguelike is simply beyond me the metaprogression that is present here is something that s present in all roguelikes unfortunately the metaprogression here takes far more time than any other roguelike i have ever played on the order of hundreds of hours to fully upgrade everything the devs have also seemed vastly confused on what genre they want this game to fall under they ve juggled around with having it be a speedrun roguelike a crisp combat roguelike and eventually settling on a grinding roguelike rather than take all of the unique amazing elements that the devs had in their early access game they instead focused on everything else and minimized everything that made this game stand out instead they seemed to have focus on predatory gameplay mechanics to make the player suffer and artificially add more gameplay time
