2020 i really enjoyed bloons for it s simple fun graphics it s easy and laid back gameplay and it s interesting maps and units on the other hand i didn t like the existence of metal moabs that microtransactions and lack of modes lets talk about the good things first naturally bloons td 6 is the 6th game in the series and the first that i ve played it starts you out with a very small tutorial which explains the simple game fairly well and sets you on your journey your goal is to play levels gain experience and use that experience to unlock new units you can then use these units and play the game again the graphics in the game are good if a bit childish which is understandable for the audience this game caters to there are beaches with detailed sand and all the models look shoot and upgrade fantastic in my opinion you can t really expect rtx from the sort of game that sells more on mobile than it does on steam moving on to the gameplay it s pretty simple there is a laid out track along which balloons or bloons if your 5 travel along and try to reach the end every balloon that reaches the end takes a life point away from you different difficulties have different amounts of life point there are waves of of balloons and each wave is more difficult than the last with some extreme jumps in difficulty at 40 and 80 which i ll get to later so how do you stop these balloons well i m glad i asked at the end of each round you gain money as well as for each balloon you pop which can be spent to put up more defenses or bolster the ones already there to counter the endless hordes of rubber you can place down monkeys and also they have darts yeah basically you put down monkeys with different weapons ranging from toy crossbows to icbm s each monkey has 3 skill tree branches which each have 5 levels you can have two branches active with one going up to five and the other staying at three it being up to you which ones you want there are a lot of monkeys and so you can really change up the game with different strategies depending on what you like to do do you want to go back to the blitzkrieg and have a fleet of b52 s dropping bombs to the point that you get shell shock if you don t turn off you sound go for it maybe you want to just want to run a massive shipping empire that makes millions around that s fine as well the game gives choice to do almost everything and there is so much variety i still haven t tried every branch but this is where the first problem comes in at round 40 something called a moab spawns right at the end of the rounds it looks like the hindenburg and it drops a bunch of balloons when it dies it doesn t sound that bad and it isn t if you ve played the game more than 5 minutes but it s a big difficulty jump and that s a big problem the game has at round 80 a really big moab spawns which drops more moabs which it dies and this has the same issues as last time big difficulty jump what this jump in difficulty means is that if you want to play a specific way you are almost entirely restricted because if you don t have the necessary monkeys to survive the jump it s over this sucks because unless you play baby mode with hacks you can t really play creatively and playing baby mode then isn t as satisfying but even this isn t the big one see at round 80 you have now beaten the difficult mode and the game gives you the option to go freemode and just see how long you survive hint not long at all if you choose to continue things go pretty well for a while i mean you had an army strong enough to take out the mega blimp but at one of the rounds in 90 there will be armoured super fast camouflaged blimps that drop more balloons which go through just about anything only 20 of balloons can hit camouflaged balloons and those that can need to always go the same route which enables them on top of this you need them entirely or you won t make it because the round is so stupidly difficult as you can tell it pisses me off and i don t want to dwell on it much longer so lets continue the monkeys are creative unique and funny and they re all brilliantly done there are air monkeys that can go anywhere water monkeys and also land monkeys my favorite were the water monkeys just because of their epic designs with one of the tier five ships being a nuclear powered aircraft carrier and another being a nuclear submarine pretty epic as i said some of the other best ones are supermonkey and batmonkey which should need no explanation nuclear bomb dropping monkey and yeti monkey there are lots of different effects each of the monkeys can have like acid which slowly degrades balloons gold which gives you extra money when you destroy the gold balloons tacks which are set down and pop balloons that go over them and many more this is great and i couldn t ask for more but where the game succeeds in one area it absolutely fails in others one of the other big issues is what you can really do in the game there is practically just one gamemode and though i understand this works in other games there is a lot of diversity in those games but this is just always the same and it always ends the same which sucks and is boring the developers try to fix this by implementing adventures but they re basically just the same thing and don t really add anything to the gameplay just more rewards let me get to that i m just coming back to this review after a short break and i m playing dos2 in the background sorry not sorry so where was i as yes the rewards as i talked about earlier there is a massive difficulty jump which keeps you from getting past round 90 something and now i m going to explain why this is implemented now i as said i haven t played previous games so i couldn t tell you if this is a one of but there are two large pay to win systems in the game the first being the currency of the game this is pretty simple and just lets you access the real offender insta monkeys so these are exactly what they sound like insta monkeys are pree upgraded monkeys you can place down just like the normal ones except they you only get them through mission rewards or paying the big bugs now i myself didn t realise ea was ties with the makers of bloons but clearly i was mistaken this is virtually the only way to get through some of the higher levels no skill no strategy just paywall and that s really dissapointing for a game that does so many things right to conclude this game does a lot of things right and has a lot of creative and clever ideas which are well implemented it s just a crying shame that this perfect run is dirtied with the inclusion of ea mechanics
