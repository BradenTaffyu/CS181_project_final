2023 at first it seems like the game is offering some representation of the laws of the universe so that you can reason your way to how to solve problems but by mid game you realise that most behaviours of the environment are completely detached from sense and reason and to move forward you have to essentially read into the source code of the game to understand how the world has been modelled just to name a few examples 1 a sole tiny light bulb can overload an electric cable if you have a larger consumer on the other side of the generator this makes no sense as the wire will never see more current than the total consumption of connected devices after the last node this is apparently done to force you to build transformers 2 gas pumps are regularly idling due to outlet overpressure even when pumping into large well ventilated areas connected to even larger areas due to some weird gas flow mechanic which causes local overpressurisation near gas outlet vents due to really slow diffusion across space 3 apparently the way to best preserve food is by building the fridge immersed in a tub of chlorine you have to read that somewhere online 4 water and polluted water are apparently immiscible fluids so you can have a container with both and still the clean water will remain clean sitting directly next to a tile of polluted water as a completely orthogonal property each of those waters can be contaminated with various germs5 both liquid and gas pipes turn out to be unidirectional i e the contents can only flow in one direction which the game decides for you in really obscure ways and you need to pull absurd gimmicks to predict and control this is apparently implemented like so to avoid the concept of pressure 6 there s a whole bunch of buglike gimmicks exploits which people use all over the place which seem unsolvable by the producer like f ex really annoying waterlocks to prevent gas escape from pressurised rooms and somewhat less popular infinite storage solutions 7 etc etc the game also doesn t seem to narrate you too much along the way essentialy from day 1 your objective is to build a monster end game wonder monument which is a 200 hrs type of an objective and so you need to look for your own motivation edit to revert on the comments about this being only a game and hence why these playability and fun oriented mechanics should be forgiven i would generally agree that a game can and should follow it s own rules but in 2023 i expect these rules to be accessible and preferably in a gamified way inside the game itself i e i m here to play and yet for 50 hours of game game time i must have spent at least another 50 browsing and watching videos about how you re meant to approach different problems this reminds me more of replacing a carbourator on my grass mower except one is a choir and the other is supposed to be entertainment edit2 originally wrote this review about 50 hrs into the game but by then was a bit to anxious to see whether i will soon get to something more entertaining and so i kept going having completed the base game s main objectives at the cost of some 100 more hours i m definitely calling quits now because the early frustrations stay on for the whole ride and some even keep growing i e power distribution liquid and gas flows as well annoying building design decisions just to force you build annoying contraptions f ex buildings spilling their waste onto the floor instead of a pipe outlet
