2022 well i d really enjoy this game if people weren t using smurf account and i mean its abundant which really kills this game for me starting out why people need to make family share account to play against new players instead of their own elo bracket is beyond me i m trying to learn the game but its very hard to do that when smurfs idea of fun is to steam roll you every game i have a smurf in my game about 8 10 times which is crazy to me i can get good but its hard when you dont even get a chance to try stuff out so idk if i can recommend this or not
