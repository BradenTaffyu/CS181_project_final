i have been playing mtg since it came out in the 90 s so i am speaking from literally decades of experience when i say this game absolutely destroyed any joy i had playing magic hasbro has ruined the experience this game is just pure mana deck manipulation by the algorithm nothing is rng based there are tons of videos from reputable gamers that have already confirmed this but all you have to do is play it enough to see it on full display it is a pay to win system where everyone buys whatever the meta is and there is zero creativity in the decks you face you will face the same 3 4 decks constantly mtgo the previous online versions from wotc was never this bad back when i played in 2013 and being creative wasn t a handicap if you want to spend 200 300 bucks on meta decks that everyone uses from online sources have at it it is a disgusting environment and was not what magic was ever about i would not recommend this game to anyone
