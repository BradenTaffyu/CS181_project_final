2023 finally tried this game after buying it and avoiding it for quite a few years in fear of being disappointed after civ v elevated series near perfection unfortunately my fears were true please note this review is written from a point of view of long term fan of the series but i belive most annoying parts of the game do not require experience of previous games to still be quite painful to play around i ll start with positives tech trees and new cards system seems to avoid the major problem of civ v where community quickly realized there really are only 2 effective playstyles with minor variations in late game depending on the victory you are going for ability to boost tech tree and culture forces player to play around their spawn location and while it relies heavy on random factors i still see it as good change because you need to play with the cards you ve been dealt in short you don t like games with strick meta you will like this one more redesign of combat promotions and support units eliminates previous unbalaned strategies that relied on leveling ranged units to get massive advantage on sieges now range for example can be boosted by support units and some naval units have increased range by default making combat more balanced religion is now a real mechanic that affects a game way more than some extra builings or great people currency including new victory method if you have dlcs climate change in gathering storm is great addon to play with putting massive pressure in islands focused maps and lat game there are some questionable decisions like confusing resources system balance of civilizations way too many policy cards to comfortably juggle in late game but i see these more as very confusing at first and kind of neutral if you play few games and learn by doing now the biggest crime of this game that does not let me give that title positive review city districs system which are extensions of your city that occupy a map tile like you city does unlocking for that city building of its category for example workshop is now in industrial district shrine in religious etc these tiles are more or less effective depending on the tiles adjacent to it there are also special districts that can t be placed only on compatible tiles like aqueduct or canal this makes min maxing your districts not always possible depending on your city placements depending on free tiles rivers etc that little rng element is not bad in itself it just forces player to spend a little too much time planning perfect placement for all the districts they want to build before settling in new location confusing at first but becomes easier when you memorize all the tiles and bonuses there is one thing that makes this new mechanic go from aditional chore to infuriating rng hell you can t build on strategic and luxurious resources you have perfect spawn for your first city but there is one tile of chocolate ina way you need to give up at least one district or wonder or both is it blocking you from build a canal too bad you need to move or give up naval play i want to say it decides who possibly wins a game at turn 1 but it is even worse strategic resources like iron still are visible only after researching it in tech tree that means even if you have the perfect spot that can fit all the buildings you want to fit in the city you still can be screwed over by the game when strategic resource shows up on random tile 10 30 or 50 turns later and there is nothing you can do to play around it or prevent it awful game design that makes multiplayer games massively unbalanced and if you want to beat the game on divine enjoy wasting your time reseting because now spawning next to a resource is a bad thing inb4 i know there are mods to let you erase all resources but it is not official if i want to beat a game with mods i can just install wim button devs team decided to ruin player experience by one simple mechanic and i respect their decision to make your game unwinnable if the stars do not allign
