2022 the game has lost any sense progression it had which it a large motivation for a lot of people most people enjoy racing games because of fast cars and most people want to set goals on cars they want to acquire but they ve made it all too easy with this game free cars for doing nothingfree money for doing nothingit makes the game so boring so quickly you know there s an issue when you realize that races literally don t need to give you money anymore it s irrelevant 10k for completing a race who cares just roll that free super wheel spin you got given and get 300k instantly it completely undermines the experience i have 100 hours on the game and i ve spent 75 of it sat in the garage and randomly driving around and i just don t seem to run out of money because of all the free lmao why bother racing this game has lost a really big part of it in my opinion i remember being on fh3 and i wanted the veyron supersport and i spent 6 damn hours grinding races to get it and it felt good to get it and it was 6 hours well spent now i logged in and got given a free buggati divo nice one really motivating
