seems like a good idea at first but then you realized most people that play are meta slaves playing tier 0 decks it s just a contest to see who either goes first or can unload the most negates almost every match ends in the first 2 turns and even then it takes forever to get that far because it turns into a game of solitaire for whoever is going first its really not worth the time or financial investment barely 1 out of 10 matches comes close to being enjoyable its almost like people have more fun winning than playing the actual game seriously don t waste your time if you re trying to chase the nostalgia high it s not new player friendly either i highly recommend just skipping out on it completely at this point until they make some serious changes to the format your turn no no our turn
