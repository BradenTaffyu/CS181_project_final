this review is from someone who beta tested the game and absolutely fell in love with it regretfully act 4 broke all the enjoyment i had gotten from it act 4 and by extension act 5 is a unplayable empty mess of an act you have 2 quests that is it one of which is a loading screen simulator while the other one i was not able to get a proper conclusion to because by the game s poorly distributed conviction point system i was not able to reach the required threshold this is despite me taking all the iconoclast points from previous chapters apart from those those 2 very annoying broken main quests you have some companion scenes and companion quests half of which weren t triggered in my game due to bugs while the other half that did turned out to be severely underwritten or downright frustrating here s some examples that left me absolutely dumbfounded ulfar s quest map does not fit him i repeat ulfar s companion quest map does not have enough space for this character to move around how the hell do you create an area intended for a character and not take into account this chonky fella takes 4 squares jae s companion quest requires stealth you do not have any stealth mechanics why in the world did you made this companion quest require stealth mechanics when you do not have any do not even get me started with marazhai the buggiest companion i have had the displeasure of recruiting mechanically nothing works as intended with this character s bricked up coding his scenes either don t get triggered don t close in your journal his coding flags get registered wrongly jesus christ i swear it s as if the game never intended for this guy to get recruited by you and is now actively punishing you if he did get recruited act 4 for me was also the point in which the overall writing drops in quality the writing of the story becomes terribly inconsistent and watered down because the game realized it s about to reach its abrupt rushed end we have quest narrative resolutions that don t make sense quests that are still draft and unfinished characters lacking content or scenes that advances their character arcs and a lot of wtf moments of dumbness from your own character your companions become silent dummies with head scratching conclusions in their epilogues characters who i loved in act 1 2 and the ones i liked and picked up in act 3 suddenly become cliches with little to no depth when otherwise was suggested previously and it makes sense since there is simply not enough time content left for them to continue their character arcs and reach a reasonable conclusion in a natural way let me remind you that act 5 is just one boss fight in an otherwise equally empty act nothing can be added in here as you ve reached the end of the game and to top it all off rogue trader suffers from one of the worst cases of unsatisfying epilogues i have seen full of nonsensical crap to reminds us how nothing good ever comes from a wh40k setting this is despite the devs themselves baiting us with logical good conclusions the game ignores all of this in favour of grimderp flavour next time owlcat consider never including a conviction that is all about persuasion and alliance making if you don t want to follow this up until the very end the iconoclast path from act 4 as it is is a complete disgrace you are better off playing the default conviction as dogmatic if you want story cohesion narrative rewards and satisfying epilogues that actually make sense for dogmatics still that doesn t mean i have to fool myself into being satisfied with what owlcat gave me i paid money for the full game and for the full promised branching narrative journey not for some unfinished lousy inadequate narrative cut short until i see fixes to all of these issues the negative review is here to stay
