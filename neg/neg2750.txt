2020 even years and years after release paradox is completely unable or unwilling to fix the core issue with the game you can t actually play it past mid game it will slow to a crawl you will love it at first marveling at how fresh and intriguing the story mixed with rts vibe is your empire will grow as you come to love your planets and its fleets and just when things start to get interesting when your foes begin gearing up for big wars suddenly a day will start to take a second then two seconds then it takes an hour for a month to go by i have a purpose built gaming pc doesn t matter it is horrendously optimized and paradox still can t even be more than half honest about that i would add that sadly paradox is not a company that deserves your money right now their ipo is the only thing they care about imperator was a disaster and ck3 will be as well they design empty games
