2016 great half of a game i d rather ca just charge us 100 dollars of the bat instead of sneaking in 18 dlc for a single race oh but there is a new campaign after the beastmen don t give me that i beat that crap and wasn t impressed i saw this coming when i pre ordered the game knew the classic 7 mb blood dlc was coming even though it honestly should just be a setting in the base game mark my words scaven dlc lizardmen dlc and maybe elves too there are wood elves dark elves high elves not to mention there are probabbly going to be some campaign dlc shoved in there for extra cream honestly i love playing the game i just how they market their game and keep squeezing us for more money but it s how it is today i suggest you buy the base game if it comes on sale since even if you buy it for 50 off you ll still be paying way over 60 for all the dlc afterwards if you get into it
