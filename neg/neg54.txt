2017 early access review three years ago i was a big fan of this game it looked promising and unique i played the game regularly and partook in the community until i got bored eventually now when i look at the game 3 years later almost nothing has changed from what i have seen of the new builds they added almost nothing except some new sounds nutrition rebalances tweaks bugfixes and just mostly small unnoticable stuff the only slightly impressive new things they have added is a new injury system and a small new map area but seriously that stuff shouldn t take you three years the developers are nice people and good at keeping people s hopes up but in the end almost nothing gets done i have seen dev teams just as small as this one who can actually develop and progress their game i really have no clue what is going on with the indie stone i don t understand why it it takes this long to just at least progress your early acces game maybe they are busy irl maybe developing a game like this is just way harder than i imagine it to be or maybe they are just lazy as people say they are at this state project zomboid is just another piece of the unfinished early acces junk that litters steam and i am sad to see it go like that
