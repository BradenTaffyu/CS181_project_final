the world is not alive mid late game is a chore and very repetitive good luck if you get caught lacking in the middle of enemy territory because unlike warband you dont get a speed boost for escaping your captors or battles basic features from warband such as deserters and manhunters missing every faction is a copy paste of each other except for their lore empires are literally the same they even have the same troop tree ai is worse than it was in warband especially cavalry which becomes very obvious in khuzait tournaments multiplayer doesnt get any better you are stuck with same 4 5 maps for every game mode despite being one of the top pages on nexusmods modding scene is dead due to every update breaking mods do not expect a perisno or warsword conquest if you are coming from warbandmost of my hours were spent in modded multiplayer and singleplayer not worth buying in its current state which is laughably almost 4 years after early access release
