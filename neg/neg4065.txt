2018 this game was one of my favorites pushing a mandatory eula change down the throats of it s loyal fans has ended my love for ksp since we only have a voice here in the review section of the game i feel it s my duty to to voice this negative opinion about recent developments a little sidenote to steam as many will know a recent change in your algorithms filter out massive negative reviews to protect your assets and to give players a helpful review mix but do you think it s fair to filter out the opinions of passionate gamers who are being illegally forced to agree to terms they never wanted currently it tells me recent reviews very positiveand we all know this is simply not true negative reviewing based on being screwed by the owner of the game is very much about the game itself not about political opinions or childish bashing of a game in this case dear valve the voices of the community deserve to be heard
