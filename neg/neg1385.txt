2022 early access review after two years of development i can safely say that this game will never be able to hold a candle to the original warband it looks good sure but the gameplay feels inferior and the game mechanics feel awful daily wages weird perk system useless traits infinite enemy reinforcements and a storymode pulls the game from a subpar sequel into the territory of a total conversion mod made by people who don t understand what makes mount and blade an engaging experience the entire game just feels like one quality of life update after the other but without actually making the game fun or engaging i m sad that even after two years this is all they have to show for it an unfinished mid late game an ineffective mutiplayer anticheat massive ultimately pointless environments a lifeless storymode and facial animations to rival mass effect andromeda i ll be patiently awaiting the day where the add the workshop feature just so i can make this game into a visually better warbands which is what it should always have been wait for a massive sale or watch a lot of lets plays before you buy to make sure it is for you
