2023 always online is always anti consumer and regardless of this game s content it will always be a no from me while it exists beyond that though payday 3 fails to improve upon the foundations left by 2 don t get me wrong it gets a lot of things right but it feels like there are some design cues that they somehow forgot to carry forward bots for example in payday 2 came with passive skills that would boost the player so as to offset the penalty of not having another full person on your team it would only be natural that payday 3 launch with a similar system incorporated and yet there isn t one not only that but bots are generally so much worse than they were in 2 they literally don t know how to play around specials and on too many occasions i have watched them let themselves be sniped because they just aren t smart enough to be able to shoot at an enemy that far away and they lack any sense of self preservation if a cloaker is coming your way they won t even bother to shoot at it until it has you incapacitated they willingly stand in toxic gas they stand in front of dozers sometimes they even seem to wander off on their own and go down on the other side of the map progression is another problem for starters it s pretty ambiguous you have two different types of progression your infamy level which is what unlocks weapons as well as gadgets and is gained via a challenge system and your skill tree xp which is what unlocks your perks and is gained just by completing heists infamy forces you to either grind a heist tens of times or to play in a way you might not enjoy just so that you can unlock everything i don t really know why they thought segregating your progression was necessary especially since 2 was as straightforward as can be as a result you will inevitably reach a point where no matter how much you play you are barely gaining any infamy progression this really started to be a problem for me around the level 50 mark as it seemed levels 0 40 were gained as readily as i could complete heists now it seems like i could do another 10 heists and still not break 60 payday 3 is ambiguous in other ways as well weapon stats are relegated to the dreaded bar graph system instead of a set of hard numbers telling you things like range falloff per shot damage reload speed in seconds etc you are given a approximation via a filled bar that lumps several attributes together this can result in things like the game s 1911 equivalent appearing to have a higher damage than the game s revolvers even though this is likely not the case on a per shot basis armor has changed dramatically from payday 2 and the game makes no effort to explain how the new system works no longer is it functionally an over shield instead it is now a permanently depletable resource that requires an armor bag to replenish this isn t such a big deal until you look through the skill trees and notice that some of them refer to regenerating armor you might then think it would be possible to regenerate armor like you would in 2 but you d be wrong regen is instead limited to some portion of damage you ve recently taken indicated by red on your armor bar not taking damage for a few seconds will replenish this that wouldn t have been hard to explain to the player and yet 3 lacks any kind of breakdown for how armor works i m not the type of person to do a top to bottom breakdown nor do i really possess the reviewing skills to do so in a satisfactory manner these are just some of the easier things that i could point out i hope they can serve as good examples of the ways payday 3 misses the mark i wouldn t recommend it in its current state not while so many of its core issues boil down to a lack of effort in conclusion no buy game always online very bad game fall short wait for sale
