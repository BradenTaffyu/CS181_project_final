2018 with take2 s aquisition of squad and kerbal space program they ve begun to make changes that are starting to get under the community s skin there is one that you absolutely should be aware of before you buy this game red shell is presentif you don t know what that means then i ll give a brief explanation it s a tool that scrapes your computer for information that allows it to track you for advertising that s something i and many others feel is an unreasonable change to a game i ve enjoyed for a long time at the moment it is still possible to play on version 1 3 1 that didn t have red shell however i don t know if they could change that if they decide to or not so my recommendation is to either buy it now get version 1 3 1 double check it for red shell and never update it or just stay the heck away edit they have officially removed red shell from the game however i m keep the review the same for the time being i ll come back and reevaluate it after i ve given some more thought to how much this damaged my trust in the company for the moment take this as a neutral vote for the game that just gives a bit of history of something that happened in its life and use that for weighing on your purchase decision
