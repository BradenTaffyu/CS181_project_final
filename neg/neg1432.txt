2021 early access review cool game and all it have cool graphics and combat but contentwise it is very empty game had almost nothing added to it since the release it exists for almost 2 years now for me this is pretty depressing since i loved warband they need to do one of those things to save this game add full mod support lot of modders working on amazing stuff for the game just check moddb or add actual content to the game
