2021 increasing the hp bar does not increase the difficulty of the game it just makes every encounter a monotonous in most fallout games you can just do whatever character build you want and it still functioned in this game if you don t min max and in some cases even if you do you ll be wasting your time chipping down each enemy because the health has been increased to a ridiculous scale for example the most common enemy you ll run into a scorched when you start off the game it ll die in a few shots from a gun of your level max level you can take a max level shotgun point blank and shoot a full mag into a scorch s face and they ll shrug it off and you just sit there tanking damage reloading then repeating the combat just became extremely dull and honestly a slog and waste of time and don t misunderstand the point of the review this game isn t hard its just annoying story is a whole different beast it was meh inventory management was made so that people couldn t carry a truckload of stuff at once but ends up adding another layer of annoyance remember how i said one scorched would eat a full mag well guess what all that ammo has weight and you best be carrying a lot of it otherwise you aren t killing much it may have sounded reasonable for a mmo game but for fallout this just seemed like a goof using missile launchers is basically a waste of time since a single scorched can eat 2 missiles and be just peachy missiles weigh 3 pounds each tldr combat is a monotonous slog reinforced by another slog that is inventory management story is alright not worth playing
