2023 it s a good game but i have to say i actually don t like it very much and therefore can t actually recommend it i d give it 3 5 stars if i could i m a happy casual rimworld player in many ways oni is like rimworld but there is one serious difference oxygen not included is really difficult to make sustainable once you figure out how to manage oxygen you can run out of food once you figure out food you can run out of electricity once you figure out sustainable electricity your base starts to inexorably overheat it was at the overheating phase that the game lost my investment there are supposedly ways to cool the base sustainably but to give an idea of their complexity the youtube how tos are at least half an hour each i spent dozens of hours working and even yes studying to figure out how to have a sustainable base before i realized it s too complicated for me and gave up if you re a hardcore engineer or want serious difficult and complex management this game is for you it s not a bad game for the right type of people and i can see why it s so highly rated however as an overall casual gamer who likes making a sustainable base then being able to focus on exploring and upgrading my base into a snazzy lap of power and luxury i actually am disappointed i wish i could get my 61 hours back
