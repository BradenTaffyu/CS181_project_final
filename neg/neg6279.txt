i ve loved how fast the gameplay is along with the cards that we can collect but the game s meta has been boring for the past few months and there are a lot of bugs in the last few months but the in game store works really well so i guess you know where the priority for the devs are at also the game tries to capitalize on the player s fomo series drops where the rare cards become more accessible to f2p players haven t been a consistent thing the last one we had was in january 2024 and the one before that was in april 2023 a whole 9 months before april 2023 we had a series drop every month starting in jan 2023 edit on may 4th 2024 to add a few more points after the last update they ve also added custom borders on top of custom cards where you would have to pay with gold to buy custom borders for each card you don t get to apply a custom border for venom if you bought a custom border for spider man sure you wouldn t have to buy the custom borders if you re not interested in it but that means more money for them from people who are willing to customize the 273 cards in the game as of writing for a game that has earned so much in the year and a half since it launched they could have priced them at a higher gold amount to apply to all cards not only that conquest mode is the only other game mode that is available in the game with ladder every month has been a slog to play through with no new variety to the game the new cards are fun to play with but you don t get to acquire all of them when you re only guaranteed to get one a month after hoarding resources from the previous month it takes 4 weeks to guarantee your chance of getting a new card that was released in a certain week the spotlight cache system allows you to gamble for the new card if you get the new card from a 1 4 chance great but it s a feelsbad moment when you don t get it from the 1 4 chance all in all i would not recommend the game unless you ve got lots of money and time to spare
