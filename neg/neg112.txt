2021 early access review just became aware of what happened and how things were dealt with by the devs as i tried to record a new episode of my series i ve started this series in mar 18th 2021 and published one episode every single day since then my following isn t big by any means but it is growing it has become clear that this game does not provide the environment for this sort of things in the beginning of my series i tried to run a promo for a pz cd key giveaway on the subreddit and was promptly shutdown by enigmagrey because he did not agree with the methods that i was using to perform the random draw i was called a liar and a scammer behind the scenes trying to obtain people s emails to spam them later the giveaway went ahead on other channels and someone got that ck key i still have the screenshots of how i was harassed around 2 3 am of a saturday by a clearly pissed off and distressed perhaps drunk or high moderator all my attempts to contact the actual devs fell on deaf ears i was simply ignored written off as a nobody on youtube i decided to let that go and continue to focus on providing the content for people show game mechanics how to survive in harsh conditions anything that could help new players but it did not mean that i did not do my background research on indiestone and the people that run it i ve met several other players and former players that were harassed in similar fashion some left some still play but do not get involved in the community i ve maintained a backseat because there were still options to salvage something from this and i know there will be backlash from the devs and moderators for what i m saying but people need to know the truth about who s taking their money who s making them promises and how things are actually working in the background want to believe me or not up to you these folks hide very hard behind monikers but if you re interested enough you can find out what they ve been up to since i m thoroughly convinced that they don t really care about their community and this can be evidenced by their player peaks and valleys people need to know that indiestone has been bleeding money for the past 5 years they have public fillings in the uk and anyone can go read their yearly reports you should know this information if you re deciding to invest your money in this game because as a business it is shrinking at least financially the year of 2020 was the year when all games saw a sharp increase in their revenue do to the lockdowns indiestone lost money during that same period so don t keep your hopes up that marvelous and great things will be done to improve this game because the budget simply is not there on that matter also i am now joining the horde of people that purchased this game saw it go nowhere received half answers from the staff had to be patient with their mistakes and screw ups the list goes on those people are likely never coming back to this game multiplayer has been a promise since i bought the game a little over a year ago after talking to other people i learned that it had been a promise for much longer than that you want to play multiplayer get ready to likely wait much longer the choices in game design that were made for pz are quite poor to support this kinda of gameplay this was brought to the attention of the devs several times in the past that a change in engine was needed but they don t care or don t have the funds to do it so they ve been patching holes on the hull and investing precious time in essential things like flattening the mohawk when you put a hat on and needing gel to fix it after i don t know how old most of you are but origin systems osi solved that multiplayer issue in 1997 with their famous mmo ultima online in 1998 you could be playing a sandbox medieval fantasy mmo with 5000 other players in the same server everyone running a dial up connection of 56kmbps that s it k not m so make out of that what you will i think that s it for me i won t be commenting any further on this issue had another series planned for this game but i ve lost my confidence in the team i wish everyone the best of luck there s only so much toxicity that can be tolerated and i ve never seen a dev team this toxic actually succeed in the long run i m confident there will be several excuses about the things mentioned and an exemplary demonstration of their ability to deflect but those that stay should wait for the soon to come monthly subscription for the multiplayer version of the game if it ever gets released this model is not impossible it s inevitable in the quite words of enigmagrey you will never get 1000 followers this community isn t that big cheers
