2021 early access review has potential to be a unique game at the top of its genre but it s incomplete right now needs lots of work before it s going to be a good game it can feel frustrating to work your way up and realize that you don t have much more content made open to you still fun enough to keep you busy for a while but you ll have a better first time experience if you just wait to buy it for a year or two missing end game or higher level fief management unable to ferment discontent against your king no good way to rebel at once with friendly clans and characters tedious process to create a kingdom even with money and power few interaction options with lords unable to deploy my troops before battle can t convert cultures in fiefs siege ai is non immersive and stupid economics and prosperity are still based on abstract stats and not actually dependent on how many looters and bandits are roaming around a region very limited control over clan members and partiesi love this game but the rate of progress seems disproportionately slow when compared to the big financial success of the game i understand covid might have slowed things down somewhat but i think it s time to hire some more staff perhaps temporarily
