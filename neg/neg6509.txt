2021 an amazing game everyone should play at least once but play offline i d rather eat broken glass than play the awful pvp system again the starter areas are filled with individuals that use high end gear to farm new players usually putting them off the game permanently it sucks oh and don t forget the hackers i ve had some good experiences with the community and i ve also done what i can to add to that group invading and giving people embers etc for free however good experiences online here are few and far between avoid it like the plague and weep because we re definitely not getting any kind of private co op mode for you to show your friends how great this game is without xx newbpwnage42069 insertedgyclanname xx or shreklolxdxd invading with a dark hand and caestus edit you suck and casul is not a valid argument especially when it takes no skill to stack buffs equipment and stats for low sl invasion easy mode time i think you re a sad basement dweller if you feel the little endorphin high you get from winning an invasion matters in life but the thing is if you exploit new players for covenant items you suck not me edit edit i believe in criticism quite wholeheartedly but i m also not very good with being spammed dumb insults in the comments section although more depressing to read than good as insults i thought i d be able to handle that better but it s just not something i am decent at it seems which is sad because i really didn t want to disable the comments considered deleting the review but i think it s important to keep up as a little message on how idiots are ruining the online experience of a game that is otherwise what i d consider the most immersive and fascinating fantasy universe ever written haven t received any constructive criticism to warrant keeping comments enabled so i m sorry i have anxiety and not self diagnosed i gotta disable them so i m not worrying about what s being said here 24 7 and tempted to reply to every git gud or casul comment
