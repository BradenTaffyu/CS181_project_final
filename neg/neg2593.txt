2019 i purchased this game before any dlc was released the reason i went with this game instead of the older hunter game was due to the fact the dev team promised to make dlc for cotw free i love hunting and this game really is a good simulator for that the game is fun however shady practice from the dev team in making all the decent dlc paid really has taken a toll on my ability to enjoy the game its not our fault as consumers to be responsible for paying for dlc when it was promised for free due to that fact the game has truly left a bad taste in my mouth and i will not be supporting these devs i do like the base game i do think the graphics are outstanding i do not want to pay for something when it was promised for free shady tactics lying cash grabbing the devs business ethics are immoral to say the least i am very disappointed i cant recommend the game until the devs do whats right
