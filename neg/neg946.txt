2016 i have to say that i am having fun with this game so it may sound strange that i don t recommend it the issue i have with it is that it just isn t what a fallout game is supposed to be every quest feels like the last one go to place kill everyone in place your character build is nearly irrelevant as you can level up indefinitely and there are no special options for particularly smart dumb or charismatic characters it s just really bland and story wise quite ridiculous and i don t particularly care for the representation of the factions e g the bos also building the settlements and then maintaining them wears out really fast other than that exploring the wasteland still has its charm although a lot less since all the quests basically boil down to shooting things and the combat is really fun so it can definitely be the game for you but if you were expecting a rpg in line with what new vegas was well then this isn t it
