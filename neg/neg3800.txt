early access review 11yrs we stood by you crafting this passion project instead of moving it forward with better survival crafting elements you decide to go backwards and dumb the game down for release and just hand us garbage wow thats great did you lose passion focus or vision seems like all the above on top of that you do a streamer release before your customers most which have been around since the beginning ya thats what i wanna do watch some twit play this game you ruined that doesn t know how to play the game but is gonna kiss your rear no matter what because they have access brilliant
