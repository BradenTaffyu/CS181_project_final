2022 i have enjoyed this game but for the love of god please stop shoving hot wheels down our throats i don t want to start on a hot wheels track i don t care about hot wheels this game is complete garbage if you have to start on a hot wheels track then transfer to mexico then realize that the game will never load the mexico map then force quit the f king game then restart the game then end up in the hot wheels map again then transfer to mexico so you can do the races you actually want this is insanity please make it stop
