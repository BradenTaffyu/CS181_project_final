2017 well wish i were writing a positive review right now because if i were i would have finally found a good hunting simulator now right off the bat i m not saying this game is bad gameplay wise unfortunately it is probably the best hunting game out there but thats only because there are basically no other good hunting games what i hoped from this game was a non subscription payment method version of thehunter classic the reason why i say unfortunately is this already there are a few things i m seeing that i m disappointed in keep in mind i have very little hours in this game now let me get this straight i enjoy playing the game the reason why my review is negative is because of these main reasons 1 already they are creating the same type of buy every single item with real money feel from thehunter classic which is the biggest reason why i stopped playing thehunter classic these tiny little new dlcs already several of them for a game that hasn t even been out for a year want atvs well there goes 4 want tents theres another 4 new map there goes 8 this is just the beginning i hope the devs see this if you are going to make dlcs for a one time purchase game make them large instead of making all these tiny useless annoying dlcs just put them in the base game and focus on making larger dlcs that people might actually consider a good buy like a whole new series of maps and animals we can buy psst we want bird hunting now that would actually be a smart choice for a dlc 2 the variety of equipment is very underwhelming why not just bring all of the weapons equipment blinds treestands etc from thehunter classic into this game like i said earlier the main reason i bought this game is because i wanted a non subscription based payment method for a good hunting game and where we dont have to buy literally everything with real money i mean jeez if i m gonna pay like 100 on equipment i can just go hunting irl that was the big problem with thehunter classic i like the feeling of having the possibility of being able to unlock everything in a game a sense of completeness in thehunter classic the only way that was possible was with your wallet not with your game progression i wanted this game to change that and while it does offer us in game currency that can be earned through playing theres not a good variety very few weapons very few equipment items very few structures we can place 3 while this one is not much of a concern to me i m used to early access games it is still there this game is very buggy and instead of the devs putting their time into optimization and bug squashing they put it into these useless dlcs that just annoy the players when we have to buy them to unlock the full game content focus on new game content bug fixes and optimization not on these little dlcs please if they were to just give us a better variety of equipment stop these stupid little dlcs and make some real ones and focus on bug fixes i d definately give this game a thumbs up overall the game is beautiful and has great potential but potential must be captured and executed properly by the developers before that potential is converted into a good game
