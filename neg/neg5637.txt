2013 obviously a step back in total war series the campaign it s true it has a huge map and a wide range of units but only playing in legendary you will feel that the game is a little hard in any other mode is too easy after playing some hours in campaign you are bored because always it is the same you can t feel inmersed in any way what will you do for rome carthage nothing just wait until the civil war arrives and after that there is nothing more big battles it s true however you can t see anything unlike shogun 2 where you can watch how men are dying here men die cause they are suffering epilepsy in middle of the battle they promised you won t fight in cities always like shogun 2 because the armies stay inside the truth armies don t stay inside but you are always fighting in cities with militia armies an excellent ai who makes armies with two thousands of slinges or javelin man multiplayer i can just say no comment conclusions after 8 patches we re still waiting the game that they had promised i m not going to tell the bugs there are and there were in the game you can watch it in their forum and patch x solved following bugs maybe in two or three months more the game will be good mp you can forget it they had planned battle arena and this game is empty in that aspect
