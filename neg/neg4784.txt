2018 an enjoyable game to a point but is full of serious flaws i don t recommend it but i also think it could be really great with a bit more work pros unique idea for a game and for the first few houses is quite satisfying to clean paint move walls install a few things decorate and furnish cons far too many of the houses are identical in layout which becomes tedious very quickly simple things to streamline gameplay have been overlooked for example the internal menu for house d cor and objects is not alphabetical just seems randomly written with no orderly sense to it if getting to 1 million is a goal the game should allow you to choose the currency that will be in as it is you can only achieve that goal in euros which is never made clear within the game itself so many bugs and so much poor coding if you are playing in order to sell to particular buyers you re in for a very frustrating time regardless of how closely you pay attention to preferences two or three buyers will stay at the top of your list no matter what you do you can only sell to the buyer at the very top of the list for example simple things like having a kitchen or a floor rug or two puts the same two or three buyers at the top of that list and they tend to stay there even removing those things and catering to every preference of a particular buyer will not change this extremely frustrating and makes the gameplay considerably less enjoyable a lot of important elements are very very badly implemented it s ridiculous that you can t move all wall outlets and switches it s ridiculous that sofas are immediately classified as beds it s ridiculous that having modern furniture is very important to several buyers yet the game itself doesn t specify which is which it s ridiculous that you can t rotate tubs showers or sinks before installing them very limited choices with furniture and fixtures as well you should be able to choose all available wood paint fabric types or patterns for all furniture curtains and carpets considering how little there is available it s very annoying how limited your options are and how difficult it is to make things match well very limited color palette in general for everything which becomes boring and repetitious particularly when it comes to choosing floor types and wall paints only one type of shower is available and that one is poorly designed with two doors that open outward you can install a washing machine but not a drier it s a small irritation but it is irritating they re offering landscaping and outdoor fixing as a separate dlc release still tbd as houseflipping is very much about curb appeal they should have waited to do their roll out until that function was included with the base game as it is how will that work will you have to start at the beginning and repurchase every available home just to clean up the yards there is no limit on how many homes each buyer can will purchase as so many of them have almost identical preferences this is a major flaw in gameplay the biggest flaw of all is that this game doesn t offer mod support if the creators are were so limited in their scope they should at least allow others to be able to make the numerous vast improvements that are so badly needed update february 2019 months after the official release this game still has every single problem previously mentioned hundreds of reviewers have posted about the exact same issues yet the developers haven t addressed or fixed any of them rather than improve their many flaws all they have to offer in their infrequent updates are seasonal promotions no major fixes not one upgrade with improved content which makes it clear that this will continue to be a poorly made cash grab of a game made by devs who don t care about quality
