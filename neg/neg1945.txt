2013 prior to patch 1 37 i had fun with the game it was fun easy to learn and though it took a while to find a match in anything other than arcade mode the matchmaking was actually balanced they recently dropped the ball however and released a patch that the vast majority of the community agree was a mistake the research system is pointless and only serves to lock you out of planes if you do manage to get a plane good luck affording it if you ve been buying modifications for your existing planes since you have to buy it after unlocking it the game balance has been screwed over too bombers are pointless now despite the objectives in most game mades being to destroy ground targets if you re not in a plane with a 30mm cannon well sucks to be you new to the game lucky you you get to fly against spitfires and laggs they ll one hit you good luck for now i strongly caution anyone against spending money on this game hopefully the devs will sort this out because i can t reccomend it in its current state it s sad because i really loved this game just a few days ago
