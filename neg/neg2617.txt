2023 great game built an amazing tower to throw me offneeds more soundtracks genuinely there are like three and it s all peaceful and calming matches the game for the most part the controls and mechanics are fine with minimal jank puzzles felt doable and interesting sometimes the world and lore was fascinating then the ending comes and you feel like the whole game was a slow inhale before someone threw a match in your mouth straight for your lungs i swear the last two islands don t fit the game almost like they were tests mechanics that only apply to those islands and leaves the rest of the game for dead raft is a nice survival game that literally decides to do a cool edgy stunt to show the other kids they aren t a nerd i can t express how heartbreaking the game becomes i have been a long time advocate to all of my friends about this game i have many peaceful memories of relaxing and letting out the stress just focusing building and exploring the ending of the game is so far removed from the game i can only hope the entire dev team either rushed it found this game in a long lost computer and decided to finish it or they just wanted to make a lasting impression on the audience you did you left a very heart breaking impression on me i can t remember the last time i hate finished a game to this degree i can t recommend the game i can t express how out of touch this game s landing is it s more then enough for me to uninstall and never touch again gameplay loop is fun optimizing is great end game is so bad i recommend people to never finish this game and just never go to the final island there is no benefit there is no driving narrative for it just leave it alone and enjoy what this game is
