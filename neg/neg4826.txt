2018 if the question is do i recommend this game at it s current price point and pricing structure then my answer is no i have been a total war fan ever since i was a kid with the release of rome total war in fact total war is one of my favorite video game series and love rtw m2tw etw shogun 2 and even enjoyed rome 2 let s remember rome for a sec in that game unlocking every faction was as simple as editing a text file otherwise you could win the grand campaign and unlock most of the factions including 1 or more from each culture which is a rough equivalent to warhammer races in short when you got the game you got to experience it fully and not just from a specific lense culture aesthetic playstyle now with warhammer and warhammer ii and each of their several expansions and dlcs we have a game that is essentially chopped up into many expensive pieces it s literally hundreds of dollars to experience the full thing because many of the main races cultures of the world are not available unless you buy them i can t imagine buying rome and discovering i can choose between 4 different factions it would be like being able to play as julii but not scipii or brutii selecuids but none of the other successor kingdoms gaul but none of the other barbarian kingdoms and maybe greek city states carthage parthia pontus scythia and a few others come in seperate 20 dlcs it s just not right it s not selling you a full package it s only a piece you can do the same thing with medieval 2 empire and shogun 2 in each of those games you are sold a complete package with access to each of the world s cultures and playstyles you don t have to pay extra each time you want to try playing the game a different way obviously it s a business i get it it s about money it is a product and as a business you engineer and design a product that s able to extract just as much money as possible i just dislike that
