2019 fallout 4 isn t a fallout game alright now that i got that overused out of the way in all seriousness there is fun to be had with fallout 4 plenty and although the rpg elements such as the skills system have been completely wiped from the game you can still absolutely role play and do anything you want it s just the way bethesda castrated this series so fast is beyond stupid go back and watch bethesda s first e3 conference and you ll see people themselves over this game the settlement system is fun although extremely out of place micromanaging in the base vanilla game is a chore at best but there are plenty of mods to remedy this issue and make it an actual positive gameplay mechanic such as sim settlements the story is absolutely generic and even more so than fallout 3 s where s my dad angle thankfully alternate start mods exist so you can completely get rid of the boring monotonous story as well everything that happens in the games story is seen a mile away and it happens far too fast if the pre war segment was longer maybe the story would have had more impact considering you literally get nuked not even 5 mins after signing up for vault service at the start of the game gunplay has been upgraded but enemy reactions to weapons are still extremely disjointed weapons handle and snap extremely smooth in 4 compared to the rough around the edges stiff shooting of 3 and new vegas even though enemies also barely reacted to attacks in those games the explosive gibbing mad it still feel slightly more impactful fallout 4 s weapons feel great to point and shoot but the power is still stiff and enemies once again react like cardboard targets since there is no level cap enemies never feel different no matter what level you are a deathclaw at level 15 will still fight the same as a deathclaw you encounter when you are level 100 you ll just have a weapon that ll do slightly more plink damage against it companions i feel are a little bit more fleshed out but even then most of them are also boring and theres a distinct overabundance of robot companions so much so an entire dlc focuses on them stand outs like hancock strong and maccready are enjoyable but most of the new ones are tropes played straight nothing s really wrong with them or anything just some boring character archetypes the worst thing about fallout 4 is that it just turns into a resource hogging simulator even before you finish the main quest littering settlements with containers just to house things you find because even if you find weapons or armors around the world you can always bring them back to scrap later for more resources even though there will always be radiant quests to complete they ll never change from go here and pick up item or go here and help settlement or go here and kill x far harbor and nuka world are fun distractions and add decent content but really the only thing left to do endgame is just endlessly build settlements with mods this isn t an issue but in the base game and the extremely limited building system there s not much point however even with the glaring flaws it s still an enjoyable game and on sale it s still worth a poke around my review is going to be a no recommendation if only because we can t rate titles by a grading system on steam but i still enjoy messing around with mods and playing fallout 4 just like i do with new vegas and 3 as an rpg fallout 4 is a severely disconnected game there are barely any rpg elements in the game anymore dialogue options don t even exist anymore you have yes sarcastic yes no and question for information that s it every conversation you have and the choices you pick aren t even what your character is going to say unless you get a mod that fixes that you still have the special system but these are just attributes you start the game with skills don t exist anymore and all that s left is perks in that regard fallout 4 is a step down from new vegas in all aspects other than gun play i d give this game a 4 out of 10 if we are comparing it to prior entries in the series but by itself i d give it a 5 just because the shooting is fun and improved enough that playing it as its own game is probably the best experience i hope bethesda returns to at least the philosophy they had for 3 for the next main installment because we really don t need another dumbing down of the rpg elements everyone enjoys fallout for the role playing elements not the linear story and voiced player character at the end of the day everyone can agree fallout 4 isn t fallout 76 and by god even 4 remains a better fallout experience than 76
