2020 the single thing that ruins it for me is that fact that you are not able to play a single game without someone randomly dropping it also happens to me you are an hour in your game freezes and you are not able to reconnect if this game had a reconnect feature i would actually enjoy it random dropping no reconnect is a recipe for disaster no matter how fun the game is
