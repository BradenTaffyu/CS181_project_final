2020 the game is awesome i just bought it 2 days ago with the most recent patch they changed the monkey knowledge the talent tree which increases your monkey towers damage reduces cost etc so now you have to spend monkey dollars if you play coop like i do you barely get 40 80 each match which takes about 30 60 mins if you beat it if don t you don t get anything meaning you can level up your towers however you can t progress because you have to farm the money out to make your towers better moreover you need your monkey dollars to get yourself new more usefull heroes better powerups like the farmer so your banana farms can be auto harvested it costs 50 or 100 monkey money in game which if you fail the map won t even pay for itself also if you are fancy you can buy skins for 2500 monkey moneys for your heroes which looks good but forget it since you won t be able to afford it but fear not there are daily sales on monkey money for real money so you can progress i hate this part of the update also those who already had the knowledge spent they don t get to pay for it only the newbies like myself
