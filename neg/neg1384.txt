2020 early access review been a week now so quick update singleplayer gets changed alot daily relevent patches tw doing a good job with that multiplayer is still the same mess no gameplay changes just some crash fixes atleast the qeue and server issues are gone for now apparently they re working on a new gamemode which won t do much currently unless it comes with a working matchmaking mmr system so new players don t have to face veterans all the time i d really like to reccomend this game to other people but i just can t currently i ve been playing warband since 2012 competetively and won a bunch of tournaments i ve also been playing the alpha and beta version of the game while the game does indeed have improved graphics everything else is a huge let down they told us ea is expected to last for about 1 year which is quite disappointing after 8 years of developement there s a ton of performance problems and it seems to be impossible for windows7 users to play multiplayer fixed in e 1 0 2 the singleplayer has lots of bugs in it i fully understand that this is just early access and bugs are to be expected singleplayer was not playable during alpha and beta but the amount of bugs is not acceptable from random objects in cities to ais that all stack up on one place just to do nothing the fact that you can only use 6 colours while creating your own banner is a straight up joke this is not 2010 there s still no proper tutorial to the singleplayer showing and explaining you stuff the ai is very weird some boss npcs can put up a pretty decent fight but most looter and regular units make the same mistakes as in warband which makes it extremly boring for me i m more of a pvp guy anyway but i d atleast expect some ai improvement you can still run away on a horseback and stab behind you and all of the dismounted units will follow you and run into your hits overall the singeplayer now has more features which is nice but nothing that justifies 8 years of developement in addition there s also a bunch of quests that are not doable and some bugs that will make your game crash reaching a certain year day in the campaign the multiplayer is a complete mess warbands easy to learn hard to master skillrewarding combat was completly thrown out of the window the entire combat got slowed down and leaves a player with barely any ways to kill an opponent between decent players most 1v1 fights therefore consist of boring hit block hit block combat all of the maps from skirmish have massive bugs that let you just walk out of the map etc which got reported but not fixed bannerlord multiplayer has no proper tutorial for any gamemode all there s for new players is a brief description of the mode the new class system isn t explained either the old economy system which gave a player so much freedom was removed the balancing is awful shields last forever if you use directional blocking archers can shoot below almost every shield in the game easily spears have a hard time stopping cav due to it s hitbox couchlancing is permanent and has no cooldown most perks in the game are quite useless the list doesn t end the last few updates before ea have not addressed anything balance or combat related the current matchfinder makes it hard for newer players to enjoy multiplayer as most matches are straight up not balanced and result in a stomp especially with beta players playing the qeue still appears to be buggy not letting you find a game altough there s over 200 people searching leaving an active match has no punishment so lot s of the matches you play skirmish end up not finishing 6v6 i reckon alot of people will not bother with skirmish unless this gets improved soon all of these things were pointed out during the beta but tw barely responded to feedback threads hope this gets improved alot and very soon otherwise i don t see the mp developing a proper scene will try to update this review during ea
