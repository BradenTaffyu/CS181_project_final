2018 not historically accurate or historically articulate and thanks ca for disparraging your customer base for calling you out on that with this recent patch it is neither historically accurate or articulate for there to be women generals in that time the closest thing you had to such was boudica for one brief instance of history who wouldn t have been in such a position in the first place if her husband hadn t died and rome hadn t renegged on negotiations with the iceni upon nero s induction aside from that the closest thing you had to women generals were rulers like cleopatra and the queen of the very brief palmayrian empire who had no place on the battlefield except when retreating from octavian as cleopatra had done and the closest thing you have to women combatants aside from the minimal numbers in the kush region who were never leaders of the bands were women who travelled with the men in their migrating camps and who only fought because of the barbarian notion of if the men die in battle we all die those women were not counted on as primary combatants but still what s historical accuracy in the the grand scheme of historically based games after all i wish this had been warhammer because at least then i know i d be playing a fantasy game rather than one that bluffed as historically based and now with the clear disrespect ca has shown to their customers as of late i do believe i ll take their don t like it don t buy it mentality into consideration and not buy anything else from their developing band lest it show this same level of inaccuracy and lest they show their same level of disrespect to their customers
