2015 early access review tl dr don t yet this might be less of a review and more of a message to the fun pimps can t put it on the forums because it will get deleted i rarely have such conflicting emotions about a game especially since alpha 13 i didn t follow the whole kickstarter thing but bought the game a year ago on a boring night without any prior research and quickly dismissed it for its mediocre performance despite the very crusty graphics after several attempts of playing it the vast options of a sandbox finally hooked me and allowed me to half heartedly overlook the at times very annoying bugs i usually play alone or semi alone with an emphasis on exploration large scale underground building and don t really bother with coop play or pvp while i was racking up hours and hours of gameplay my occupation as a software engineer got in the way of my passion for gaming the first time in my life i really wanted to like the game and grinded through it 8 hours at a time just out of spite but jesus tap dancing christ this thing is riddled with bugs and game breaking inconsistencies i could make a huge list of all the bugs and weird things happening but it pretty much all boils down to two things a severe lack of experience and no mentionable quality control now don t give me that but it s an alpha crap if you build something anything you start with a good foundation and then gradually add stuff with 7dtd it seems like there s a very messy but somehow working foundation that noone really wants to or has the ability to fix and instead of hiring someone to do it every patch appears to be a string of quick wins and cosmetic changes that are hit or miss at best and completely pointless at worst at times it seems like the fun pimps are done doing actual progress and alternate between doing most flashy thing for the least amount of work pre patch and we need to put out fires left and right post patch i mean just look at some of the improvements of a13 ui was completely broken and a massive exploit fest now it s completely broken and a massive exploit fest with a new flat look the game couldn t handle decent amount of zombies the animations spawning mechanisms and attack patterns were totally off nothing changed about that but now we have new motion captured zombies that have weirdly skewed models depending on the viewing angles have non existing keyframes and move like an epileptic michael jackson dance movie in anything above 60 fps oh and zombie dogs are broken again a lot of the harvestable resources are suddenly gone no more sticks branches different meats all the stuff that brought some variety was taken out why just so you can inflate the patch notes the grunting screaming and huffing and puffing of the alter ego is now voiced by professional voice actors i can now hear myself moaning of hunger in crystal clear quality while trying to use the broken camp fire that mysteriously eats fuel and never finishes crafting my damn meat that s right meat a bear now has the exact same kind of meat as a rabbit performance is abysmal but it s an un optimized alpha you know the first rule of optimization don t you can t build a complete dog turd and then flip a switch on release date and suddenly it runs like hell it s not gonna happen start with a good foundation and then add stuff yes i m repeating myself multiplayer is another huge disappointment don t even get me started with multiplayer it s an integral part of the game despite the pimps backing off again cause they are not able to fix the related code yet it s the most broken one the netcode is horrible and the dedicated server is a hot mess that will bring your hardware to its knees memory leaks gallore 32 64 bit linux versions randomly don t work depending on the patch level and administration is xml with a bunch of strings and a telnet interface i mean props for providing a linux server and client but if it s going to randomly break because noone is testing it why even ship it oh if you want to have a laugh check out the website a small dedicated group of highly experienced game and software developers and the average 7 days to die team member has over 14 years of experience in game and software development working with or for many top companies yeah right i bet that s the reason why you re using unity and can t update a label without a bunch of null pointer exceptions and out of range indices the communication is very professional too if you have to introduce forum policies that explicitely forbid talking about release dates or criticizing anything about the game it s high time to think about how you re communicating with customers if you can t be arsed to do it yourself and i can highly sympathize with that hire someone to do it and i m not talking about giving some fanboy moderator rights on the forums and letting him wreak havoc now don t get me wrong despite the massive bashing i kinda sorta like this game i d never pile up 300 hours of gameplay and write a long review about a game that i hate sometimes the only thing that ll help is some good old tough love i fear that if nothing changes the game has already reached its zenith and will crash and burn so please use the money we gave you hire some real software developers make the software as good and enjoyable as the gameplay you have created i d revise my review in a heartbeat if there was any positive change please make it happen
