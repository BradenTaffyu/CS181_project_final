2016 internet racing is a fun easy and inexpensive way for race fans simracers and gamers alike to enjoy the thrill of the racetrack this is iracings description of their game i m going to break it down fun yes the level of courtesy and professionalism of drivers in this community is unparalelled it makes for very fun competitive and thrilling racing even in the rookie leagues the number of drivers that care about the safety rating system is absolutely untouchable by any internet racing community ac is good but not this good inexpensive absolutely not talk about a money pit it s not only a monthly yearly subscription it s also a literal f ckton of dlc once you have ascended from the rookie ranks in this game the cost increases dramatically as of yesterday the total for all content in rookie class and class d is 580 61 including a 193 54 multi purchase discount class a b and c continue to add to the dlc money pit but i m going to skip the calculation granted there are a few cars and a few tracks that come with the subscription however the price of each track or car is between 12 and 15 for instance the 2007 version of daytona intl speedway is included with subscription but the 2011 version is not nurbergring nordschleife and the grand prix strecke are separate 15 purchases but remember it s only 99 99 yr which is more than some racing sims without subscription fees and all dlc combined for that amount of money they better have something better than the terribly clunky and slow web ui they currently implement read it launches sessions from a website and it s terrible sometimes the fact it s based on a game from 2003 which has been continuously modified doesn t justify the cost of building models and the level of physics particles also if you want to race against your friends for fun you need to rent server time from them or just hope you get matched in the same race absolutely no fun for those who want to race with friends easy no just no winning is not easy driving is not easy proper car setup not done in rookie class is not easy the tracks and drivers are challenging very challenging with that challenge comes reward if you do well race fan sim racer and gamer alike i don t recommend playing this game with anything but a proper racing wheel not for the gamer who just wants to create spectacular crashes this game is for the serious racers and the community reflects that if you re into just watching they have a youtube channel that broadcasts the races and they could really use some of those sale profits to increase production quality there it sounds like 12 15 y o kids trying to sound like overly professional and dry race announcers except one is in the studio and the other is voice chatting over skype you watch the races from the same cameras and jerkyness that comes from the instant replay cameras that you get in game like a single person is just operating it to watch the race they desparately need someone who has worked in broadcast to help ramp up the production value words cannot describe how terribly boring and unprofessional these really are overall 2 5 the community and safety rating system are the only things holding this game together imho besides them just now march 2016 updating to dx11 the cost of dlc terrible web interface sever load being based on a game from 2003 bad broadcast production quality inablity to race with friends and subscription costs are enough for me to hate the game i got a yearly subscription on sale for 30 something will not buy any dlc due to cost and own a racing wheel the only reason i ever come back is to race with people who aren t starting wrecks like bored children edit added costs emphasized sh tty server load webui added comments on not playing with friends lowered overall score i also recently purchased an htc vive it seems that iracing has completely removed their vr support even oculus so that is yet another deal breaker for me technically no racing sim supports the vive but that s not to say i don t have some of them working edit 2 they ve finally re enabled vr support for oculus there are many trying to get it work on the vive with revive injector to no avail for those wondering assetto corsa with revive live for speed native and project cars native are all working with the vive at this point all are much cheaper ways to race edit 3 late now with vive support looks great is very optimized and is even fun still after forgetting to cancel my subscription i m currently trying to justify the 99 i just spent i just can t the two year later edit i don t own it anymore i have a friend who does i use his account the addition of the grc made this game awesome again the dirt ovals are boring to me but at least they added new ways to get more dlc out of you and to all of those cheaper than real racing arguments it s not real racing sim racing can t give you a trackday experience speedvegas can for about 300 even after spending 2k on a simcube wheel accessories cockpit and playing in vr you re still missing out on things like g forces an extremely heightend sense of danger putting on safety equipment and having to actually pay for your mistakes i haven t updated pricing on this in a while but i m sure you can do 24 hours of lemons no not lemans for less than the cost of 1 year of iracing with all dlc
