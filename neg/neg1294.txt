2022 early access review this game has some major issues i list them here 1 there is no reason the play a melee character reason 1 if you melee some enemies they can randomly decapitate you ending your play through or sap your stats note the game does not make it clear that this is happening ranged characters are just as strong as melee characters without you needing to worry if your play through will be randomly ended reason 2 you need to excel at three stats to be an effective melee character strength toughness and agility whereas with ranged you only need two toughness and agility 2 there s nothing else to the game besides combat the only other significant content is the main quest which has little replay value everything else revolves around getting stronger so that you can kill stronger things maybe that s just the genre but it feels like a waste in this epic world the devs have created 3 combat is unrewarding and repetitive 4 the game constantly breaks immersion every room in the game is an instant warzone when you enter it with dozens of animals beast men ripping each other apart and dying by the droves if every room was allowed to run its course for a few turns there would probably be nothing left it feels contrived 5 true kin have very little content to explore 6 world is static your actions have no real impact
