2017 so i have messed around with the game for a bit played some training wheel empires played some minor regions took florence to world domination just to see if i could i can say i understand why the fanbase to this game is so dedicated and inquisitive and why there are millions of hours of youtube videos about this game as a rabid 4x player since the civ2 days i understand i have spent 2 3 of my life loving these types of games but one thing angered me so much that i m just going to come down on saying i don t recommend this to an average gamer it s that the base game has trouble standing on its own merits a cursory google search will show how many rules have altered which is fine but the problem is the backwards implementation into the base game for example playing native nations will get a mission to migrate except native nations cannot migrate in the base game the game doesn t tell you this you need to hunt for this information this is poor design so i m not up to recommend somone drop 100 or 200 dollars just to find out if they want to play the game thats a tcg strategy you re better off finding a different complete 4x game for 1 4 the price
