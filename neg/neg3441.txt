i spent hours and i mean hours on a city nd detailed as much as i wanted just for when i saved it it completely froze my whole computer and when i refreshed my pc the save file for my world just disappeared like it never existed i dont think i spent so much time and effort onto a city before just to lose it all i would recommend this game but dont take it serious as any bs could happen i might not be able to get the motivation to play again after this
