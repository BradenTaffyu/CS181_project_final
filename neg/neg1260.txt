2015 tl dr fun stable expansive game it s worth the purchase price to be sure but it s not quite what i was expecting or hoping for in a fallout title if you like gta or farcry you ll probably like this if you re into real rpgs and making choices and seeing the results of those choices or building nuanced different interesting characters skip it so i started playing the fallout series with 3 someone bought the game for me and i loaded it up and i was astonished that i got to live out a video game childhood and then i got set loose on an entire living world full of people that i could either help or hinder or even ignore it was great but after that initial rush was over and after the first play through i never went back because it suffered from the blandness that bethesda is now kind of notorious for along comes new vegas and after the technical stuff was fixed it became my favorite rpg of all time that world was alive the things you did for and to people mattered the world gave you feedback based upon what you did it felt very real particularly on the first play through it was a deep and complex game that i really cared about every character was different and you could really play nuanced individuals and the whole world would feel just a little different to you every time you did that it felt like an rpg with fairly good shooter mechanics layered on so out comes fallout 4 i was initially so excited because my most recent memories of the series were of new vegas i wanted to feel invested in a game world again unfortunately it feels more like a dumbed down first person shooter version of fallout 3 it s a shooter with some very meager rpg elements layered on it honestly feels more like gta v than a fallout game you walk around and look at things and you get spoon fed a little backstory and atmosphere from the world but it s such a light touch and it feels like you re riding a ride that every other person who bought the game is on don t get me wrong the world is massive and somewhat dynamic the art direction is beautiful the voice acting is actually pretty good most of the time i was afraid it would be terrible given bethesda s history but it wasn t i haven t had a lot of technical problems this is probably the most stable bethesda release ever the game makes a fantastic first impression and without giving any spoilers you do make an emotional connection with your character and his or her family in the beginning in the first few hours you really feel like it s going to be the best game you ve ever played that fades really fast though as you realize that this gigantic meticulously created world is basically just a big place full of things to shoot and people who want you to shoot things i found this note on a super mutant it said something like kill loot return that pretty much sums the game experience up fairly well i stock on on supplies i go out into the city i find places on the map read a terminal or two pick a lock and then kill the things that are there there are a few decent character based quests that i ve come across but nothing like what i experienced in new vegas this is the standard new fallout formula which is fine but in this game it s like they spent all their time recording dialogue and very little effort went into actually creating stories and more importantly tying those stories together into some kind of cohesive whole that gives feedback based upon the player s actions the settlements feature is cool but it feels mechanically useless most of the time and its features are kind of poorly fleshed out honestly i d rather have well realized towns with interesting people to meet and choices to make that actually matter i think providing one or two settlement spaces tied extensively to the story would have been a better way to handle this feature instead of many locations that are just bland tickboxes they built a really neat beautiful world they provided the terminals and the scenery and the setting for post nuclear boston the stage was set masterfully then it kind of feels like they created one adventure on rails and everyone experiences that you can be either good good sarcastic or evil which is just terrible for an rpg there seems to be no grey area even the way the leveling works kind of funnels you to certain locations before others so no more deciding where you re going to go because it feels like your character would go there you get on the mass effect like ride complete with dialogue wheel sigh it s as terrible and predictable as it sounds and you do basically the same thing every other player is doing it s a solid good and even fun game i don t think i ve felt more conflicted about a game in a long time and this is after eagerly waiting for years for news about it i m not recommending it though because pretty much everyone playing a fallout game nowadays expects a fallout game and this just feels kind of like gta v without cars or some bioware title where you are on rails most of the time after the masterpiece work of art splendid rpg that was new vegas this just feels very bland on rails and poorly fleshed out after all the waiting and the hype and the expectation that they would evolve more than just the technical aspects of the engine and actually provide a deeper rpg expereince alongside the better shooting mechanics it kind of feels like a bit of a disappointment i won t be buying anymore of their rpgs until i read a lot of player reviews because they seem to be heading in the dumbing down mass market pretty colors big explosions be the hero design direction if you re into that kind of game that s fine enjoy them fallout 4 just doesn t give me the same feeling i got in vault 101 or even more so as the courier though i always feel too constrained or like if they had simply tried a little harder a good quest npc location or decision could have been better and felt more real to me as the player it feels like a gigantic dense pretty world filled with those animatronic people you see on amusement park rides most of whom you just shoot at it s just flat on rails melodrama most of the time after like 50 hours i really don t care where my son went or whether mama murphy takes drugs or not i didn t want to play as a guy with a son i don t want to wander the wasteland looking for a son even if i did the game pacing is just wrong for this kind of story is this an rpg or a network made for tv movie it started out fine but the forced emotional on rails trope gets old fast it starts out feeling amazing and the longer you play the more you really start to see its shortcomings that being said there is a lot of content and it s great for killing some time the shooting mechanics are alright although the enemies are bullet sponges on anything above normal so it feels very arcade y and a bit dumb i regret buying the strategy guide i think i ve used it once to figure something out with power conduits in the settlements i ll probably give it to someone for christmas and that right there pretty much tells me how i feel about this entry in the series wow i m depressed now sad vault boy is sad and i m wearing a vault boy t shirt right now which should give you a hint how much i have loved the series in the past i feel like bethesda let the rpg portion of its fan base down with this title i feel like they dumbed the game down substantially i feel like they want sales over substance i don t like how they treated the gaming press with that embargo of an embargo thing i think it s bad when game developers become icon rock star archetypes because this kind of thing seems to inevitably happen to the product over time so yeah end wall of text
