2015 rome 2 ahhhhh rome 2 so much hype so many expectations so many promises here is the thing overall now is a solid game on single player only at least for me and my buddy almost 2 years after release how does the game fare well the thing is this game fails because of what sorrounded and still surrounds it from a design and gameplay perspective allow me to elaborate if you will this game was hyped to no end several live action videos and developer diaries all of it to deliver an inevitably weak game from a design perspective many strange decisions unit cards ui retainers generals agents faction bonuses turns per year are just some features that seem like a downgrade from previous total war games namely the previous title shogun 2 gameplay wise the battles suffer a lot and is in this aspect that most critics arise from unit collision is still an issue cavalry still has absolute no way to it kill moves are quite franckly a poor way to make units interact with each other even tough recently they appropriated the animation of projectile hit to kill other soldiers without using the kill move mechanic which is just lazy faction wise there is almost no variety between them amazing that even though shogun 2 has the exact same unit models and soldiers for every clan they still manage to give more variety and personallity than rome 2 s many factions seriously aside from character skins and faction banners there is no difference in gameplay between rome and carthage that is not to say that the game is a disaster it is not it has some good ideas like province happiness and graphics wise it is impressive it is wonderful to see the ancient world more vivid than ever what ultimately makes this game a thumbs down for me is the preposterous practices on the part of the publisher and the developer sorry no ammount of justification will ever make up for a broken game at launch don t believe me watch a certain angry youtuber review of this game day one dlc also is unnaceptable under any circunstance for it means it is content that was created along with the main game and cut and sold later to boost their profits i m looking at you greek states dlc bought it later for 1 buck during sale also currently at the time of this review we are at patch 17 this is absolutely outrageous i ask you fellow gamer how can a game need 17 patches to be in a working state simple an uttlerly broken game even if the state has improved sfter almost 2 years yay the point is this should never be acceptable the thing is the moment they released this game is when they decided it was good enough for sale and this clearly wasn t the case so a shameful display in the end it is painfull because this could easily have been the greatest total war game ever made a comeback to the glory days of rome 1 now it is a reminder on how not to launch a total war game p s the most amazing thing recently i played with my friend fellow total war fanatic a fall of the samurai coop campaign over 60 hours of campaign and not a single issue no desyncs and smooth framerate we tried to play a rome 2 grand campaign recently and it crashed on turn 2
