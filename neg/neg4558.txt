2018 yeah like everyone else the spyware they sneak into this absolutely deserves a negative review and the fact you can t remove redshell without preventing the game from working is absolute bs one thing you can do to criple redshell is to open your host file c windows system32 drivers etc and put the following into it and save it 127 0 0 1 redshell io127 0 0 1 api redshell io127 0 0 1 treasuredata com127 0 0 1 api treasuredata comentering those into your host file will render redshell s connections as unavailable and therefore they won t be able to recieve your information they ve taken edit 7 21 18 with the news that the devs have removed redshell from their product i can now actually recommend this game however there are a few issues i have that don t make it worth the full price tag get it when on sale there are a severely limited number of maps and with very little customizability lack of an in game world editor ie like in civ 4 the gameplay is very cluttered and requires a large amount of miltitasking game mechanics tend to be confusing and overwhelming at points in the end it still gets a no because of the pricetag for what feels like a rushed game
