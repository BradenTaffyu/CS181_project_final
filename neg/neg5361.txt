2023 this game is unfinished i loved the franchise so much and seeing it in such an unpolished state just breaks my heart just to mention some the ui design is horrible the menu is unintuitive and the quality of buttons and icons uuugh everything feels like a placeholder for the final and more polished version but no these are the final versions the gameplay is no better 70 of the functions we had in the previous games are missing now no in game leaderboards no heavy crushing no names for team mates no forfeit or surrender button old bugs which have been fixed in coh2 are back again you can lock your units with barbed wire or cannot tell garrisoned units to face in a certain direction or leave the building on a certain side pathfinding issues as always and of course there are new problems too like built units came without weapons or a single member of the infantry squad running brainless on the other side of the map trying to find a way home this game is unfinished and unpolished 3 weeks after release relic should have already address majority of these issues with hotfixes compared to coh1 or coh2 this game feels like a low cost mobile game version built by a 3rd party indie developer team
