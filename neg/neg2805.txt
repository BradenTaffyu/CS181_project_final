2016 you should not purchase this game in its current state it is an early access open beta title in all but name developers have made two save game breaking patches in two months for the release version of the game it begs the question of whether or not they performed any internal testing at all rolling back to the previous patch is not a real solution as i as the consumer should not have to do that and cannot think of any other studio that is that sloppy developers do not seem to have a clear vision of how they want their game to work major mechanics changes including the removal of embassies nerfing buffing of empire ethics traits etc warfare is pretty broken apparently planetary occupation used to be required to capture planets from an empire at the end of a war however this was removed because the ai apparently could not handle it the developer s solution was to remove this requirement the effect was to render ground forces essentially useless as with space superiority you can win by just wrecking random space stations and blockading planets without ever setting foot on them the actual solution should have been to fix their broken ai defence stations are less than useless and actually serve as free warscore basicly victory points towards winning a war for all but the weakest enemy fleets bounus points for allowing the idiotic sector governors to auto build them in the latest patch consider this the strongest station is about the equivalent of a battleship and the same upkeep the sole difference it can t move with the removal of embassies all ai factions essentially distrust hate you from the opening gate diplomacy now consists of making massive bribes not to say that embassies were a perfect solution but this really isn t any better the ui is clunky at best and during major wars you ll receive so many attack notifications your head might explode this all said the game is rather promising and has a lot of appeal including the ability really rp your empie as anything from a diverse multi species democracy to a slave taking planet exterminating dictatorship the random events are pretty interesting and tend to make each of your worlds and playthroughs unique however until paradox can finally settle on how they want the internal mechanics of the game to actually work i cannot in honestly recommend buying this game unless you want to become frustrated with each new update
