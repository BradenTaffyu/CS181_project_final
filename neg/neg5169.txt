2016 first impressions are underwhelming there s one city layout in the whole game and it only has one direction of approach but you already knew this because angry joe told you so the undead faction s nominally live units crumble just like their dead ones do and it s still using rome ii s province system heroes are powerful and weirdly big like the rest of the world is in 28mm and they re in 30 and i m not sure i like how they re balanced some heroes have half as many hit points as a regiment of soldiers alone which is okay for a vampire or chaos lord but even wizards seem to be eight feet tall and able to throw people around with impunity i d like to see them rebalanced to be deadlier but less resiliant at least if like me you re a fan of warhammer fantasy battle which isn t dead and shut your mouth for even thinking about saying it you might get some enjoymeny out of this but then you might also be frustrated by how little thought was put into making the game actually engaging on any level but an audio visual one the game isn t going to be balanced or bug free for a while because it s a ca game without copy paste factions so complaining about that would be pointless i gambled on rome ii s preorder and swore i d never preorder anything from ca again like many people who were burned by that game but i decided one lonely night in front of the steam store browser that it was worth the risk for the indulgence of two nostalgic but abused ip s at once i m not going to stop playing the damn thing because now i ve slapped down forty of my precious buckeroos i feel some masochistic obligation to try and wring some enjoyment out of it but i can t help but feel disappointed as a long time fan of both ca and games workshop to see them phoning it in on what should have been the swan song of the iconic fantasy roleplaying game of the 1980 s and 1990 s buy it if you really have to i sort of wish i d saved my money buy shogun 2 if you like total war and if you want a quality whfb rts go back and play mark of chaos or dark omen or hell even shadow of the horned rat they might all be old as balls by now but when you re dealing with a post mortem ip you have to look back to find the golden age material
