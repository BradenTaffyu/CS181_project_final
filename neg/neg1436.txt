2021 early access review buy it eventuallybannerlord at its core is a good game with a lot of promise everything is in place for the game to be amazing but it just needs that extra polish the reason i wouldn t recommend buying the game now is that in truth you would be setting yourself up for frustration the start of the game is strong its like warband but everything just feels a lot better and cleaner you ll start by doing some quests for villages and competing in tournaments and you ll really start to get a feel for the game however the issues start rising once you ve levelled up your clan so that you can become a mercenary the issue with this being that absolutely nothing changes sure you can now enlist with a faction of your choice but don t expect to be winning much as your troops level painfully slow equally you won t have time to fight as you ll forever be preoccupied with your endless quest for gold seriously you will never have enough gold in all honesty my issue with bannerlord is that you constantly feel like you re chasing some progression but you can never achieve it you can sit there for hours and hardly do anything just tournament after tournament looters after looters the pacing of the game feels wrong and deliberately slow by all means nothing should just be handed to the player in fact some of the beauty of mount and blade is that you have to work for it all however bannerlord feels like it wants to hold you back as i mentioned before the troop levelling is painful you re constantly chasing money and worst of all is that once you finally gain yourself some fiefs they start draining your pockets too and that is only some of the issues nonetheless i feel obligated to say that despite the whiney rant this is an early access title and it is not a bad game there is still time for the devs to listen to the criticisms and make changes to the game i am 100 confident that when finished bannerlord will be amazing it just needs time
