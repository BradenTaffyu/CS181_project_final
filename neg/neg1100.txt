why did you give a thumbs down if you played the game for almost 300 hours the most popular question under every review opinion on something not only a game the short version for those who don t want to read my magnum opus story 4 10 gameplay okay 6 10 it could be 7 with mods for inventory and other qol maybe 1 for people who love building things and sims in general graphics mediocre 6 10 with mods can be atmospheric and i can put 7 roleplay part 4 10 almost absent sometimes you can save some faceless npcs soundtrack radio 6 10 it s hard to destroy the classic of the 60s but the radio is repetitive boring with no energy in it three dog night knew better ui ux 3 10 with mods 6 10 overall 5 without mods for not a fallout fan 6 for big fun especially fans of 3d fallout 6 with mods 7 for fans story 4 10 garbage i installed a mod for full text in the dialogues almost in the very beginning cause this 4 arrow system i don t know to whom it was added i don t want to insult anyone but that decision insulted me as a person who is capable of thinking writing on the level i ve learned english in high school and this is my script for an aaa game based on a well known franchise the text itself is so poor and that even for a non native speaker like me reading hearing that is pain sometimes almost literally the game has some mediocre writing here and there some atmospheric bits on the radio or beautiful accent voice but man the overall story quests text and notes on the level lower than fallout 3 and it s a pretty low level generally it s so bad that when you stumble upon some funny joke or at least a bit interesting piece of the story you just wow it actually drives me to follow the story and what goes next but it s seldom and even that piece sucks in comparison with any descent rpg game 7 10 for far harbor it s a half decent story with a classic for 3d fallouts choose one of the faction s situations the best part of the game is from the narrative perspective roleplay part 4 10 almost absent in some cases the character even just can t refuse to be part of the quest you must accept the quest invitation to a fraction or you can t go forward in a questline or miss a big chunk of content yes you can choose fractions and in some cases be good or bad but it changes nothing and i had 0 compassion for anyone in the game except on very rare small occasions soundtrack radio 6 10 it s hard to destroy the classic of the 60s but the radio is repetitive boring with no energy in it three dog night knew better i don t know whose idea was to make dj a mumbling kid even the fact that the character improves his level of speaking doesn t make it interesting dj in the nuka wold is a joke from every radio on the whole territory you would hear stupid gameplay 6 10 shooting is somewhat better than in previous 3d fallout games wondering around killing enemies and finding loot is pretty satisfying but even on the highest difficulty the character becomes too strong and with power armor the game becomes one way fighting it s too easy to earn an infinite amount of money acquire a strong weapon and be an ultimate killing machine however in the first 20 30 hours of the game the growing power of your character is satisfying that s the reason that i ve started using power armor only in the last 2 dlcs nuka wold and far harbor in the endgame loot and rewards become ridiculous and there is no urge to loot complete quests colored versions of power armor i do not consider valuable rewards graphics 6 10 sometimes a light scene and design could create a good atmosphere but without mods for textures weather or lightning in the vanilla game it would be a rare occasion maybe only far harbor in the vanilla has its foggy mysterious atmosphere and when i played in the vanilla version on the release i couldn t stand the washed screen blurry effect so just one of two mods that i installed even for the vanilla version of the game it made the picture more sharp and increased contrast ui ux 3 10 i believe starting oblivion bethesda games keeps adding list like inventory in every freaking game it may be convenient for the console to scroll down a huge list but it does not find that attractive at all google any mods that improve inventory and map and then compare them with a vanilla version it s like day and night with mods 6 10 mods can add categories for everything global search and search inside category more detailed maps and search on it filtration by everything and many more why big companies keep doing ui ux is a mystery to me in the end let s answer the original question why i ve played so long in the game that i don t even like so much 1 i love fallout universe especially f1 f2 which i replayed 2 years ago i did that god knows how many times already and fallout new vegas that i ve played 3 times 2 i love retrofuturism dystopia pin up classic america of the 30 60s the whole aesthetic of this period 3 i love jazz and blues also i like rhythm and blues and rock n roll a bit 4 i love 3d rpg exploring dungeon crawling basically shooting and looting so i don t have a choice it was the last time when i played fallout 4 i have this nostalgic feeling because in some moments when the good song is on the radio and the weather lighting matches the mood and the scenery is calling you think yes it s a true fallout game but in the moment later it all fades away and you realize that todd howard with his crew failed one more time
