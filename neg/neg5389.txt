2023 i never leave review but i like to believe relic actually listen to the community unlike most developers at least i thought they did i ve been a huge fan of the coh franchise since the first ever coh when i got it in hard copy with a graphics card i bought since then i have logged over 3000 hours into the various coh games and expansions and every single one has been absolutely fantastic except coh3 this is at best an alpha and should not have been released yet i think i speak for the majority of the true longstanding coh community when i say we would have rather waited longer and had a polished finished product on lunch and not whatever you would call this the home screen looks like something an ios app creator could make the camera is shoddy and jolts on movement and the graphics don t even seem to have seen an upgrade from coh2 yes we have 4 factions and 2 campaigns but that doesn t matter if the core game play mechanics are somewhat that of an alpha game truly disappointed in this release and i hope relic make some changes quick this is currently not worth 49 never mind the 69 i paid for the bonus edition i hope in due course relic will fix this and i will still be playing this game in 8 10 years time like i did with coh2 regards a truly disappointed coh fanboy
