2023 i probably have around 9 000 hours collectively on warthunder and here are my thoughts on the game when i first started playing in 2015 i thought this game couldn t get any better then they started to add more modern vehicles slowly but surely the realism was on point debatable the rewards were good after a match in my tiger 2 with 6 or 7 kills i d be a majority of the way to finishing research on the next vehicle unfortunately that is no longer the case due to developer caps on rp and sl ingame research points and ingame currency i can hardly go positive on sl and its rough to grind it i ve been in and out of competitive gameplay with srb and for a majority of the time i only played srb because it was the only good mode to play i have spent over 5 000 on this game between 2 accounts possibly more the recent uproar in the community has made me decide to make this review basically dont play this game
