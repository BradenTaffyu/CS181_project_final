2021 from the pov of a kid who grew up playing zoo tycoon 2 and jpog a dinosaur nerd and a now adult who was quite disappointed with their jwe preorder jwe2 is better but not quite there yet pros more diversity both dino and everything else wise beautiful scenery map variety chaos theory quite engaging imo contracts make more sense in 2 alerts choose a or b multiple stations for one tour tours can go over paths more dinosaur interaction more dino in general there are quite a few added things in jwe2 in comparison to jwecons there were so many nice things in jwe that they just didnt carry over can t have multiple expeditions monorail stations can t bypass connecting to entryway etc why did i waste all my money on the jwe expansions bugs galore you think they would ve learned from releasing an incomplete jwe once again there are different skins which are really all the same but just different colors the campaign is actually a tutorial micromanagement and poor design why do i have to click 5 things to heal one dinosaur as far as i can tell dinosaur fights are all copy and paste again no variety there s more but not a lot there could be soooo much more design deco etc options as well as more dinosaurs but the former i find more surprising how lacking it is jwe 1 2 are like the zoo tycoon 2017 of zoo tycoons i could go on and oni will say i have hope that the game will get better jwe did but it is extremely disappointing how poor the quality of this game is on release that s ultimately why i am down voting this it could be a lot better i m also again let down by the lack of options jwe has in comparison to other tycoons i also want to note that i received jwe2 as a gift i would not support this game these devs until the quality of this game is improved and i would also recommend never buying anything at full price but i am a huge dinosaur lover so i will continue to play this game to stare at pretty dinosaurs also i have ocd and have already begun the quest to get all the achievements so i can t stop now i know i m insane
