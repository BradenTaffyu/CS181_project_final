2021 early access review so you re wondering whether you should buy mount and blade ii first things first i bought this game on launch and have consecutively been eager to return hoping to see more and more improvements now reality bannerlord even a year later is not even close to being where i had hoped every time i try to return to the game i have a crystal clear view of a functioning performance and opt game where i can build my own kingdom and rule short story the crystal view is shattered every time i load bannerlord and realize that the performance update actually never fixed the super stutter menus and the fps drop still exists as i simply move my men crossed the map now you may be asking well what about system specs and i shall deliver cpu ryzen 9 3900x kraken aio for cooling gpu gigabyte geforce 307064gb of trident z royal ram 2 tb hd 1 tb ssd and the case 4000x corsair aka the ac unit within my bedroom for the past year i had thought i was satisfied with the progression of bannerlord consecutively telling myself its not even a year yet give it some time however after reading through some steam discussions it dawned upon me that i had just been conditioned by taleworlds slow efficiency on outputting development updates for example a year later of release we are just now receiving the update for a sandbox mode and the ability to change our characters build which btw i opted for the beta and it is near unplayable as the fps drop is every second of moving on the map hear me out bannerlord has a lot to offer and has made a lot of progress unless my smooth brain has just adapted to the slow progression of taleworlds and it appears there is more to come as i question that statement within my head i really want to love bannerlords i do but every time i try to enjoy raising the fyrds i am met with slow menus slow load times stuttering map gameplay however now that my computer is pretty beefy the sieges and battles aren t majorly a problem however this wasn t until i made a massive pc upgrade before hand i played on a 1650 geforce gpu and a ryzen 5 3600 yet it was impossible for sieges without massively lowering settings and dropping mass frames throughout battles to work also had to lower the amount of troops to 500 on the battlefield at once conclusion i want to love this game i do love this game i think i try to love this game the community is trying to love this game taleworlds falls short of the stick almost every time almost taleworlds is outputting updates but it s usually per month that a cool new feature is added and the remaining time goes into six more updates just to make the feature even playable and not emphasizing smooth performance now before i get absolutely gas lit by the taleworlds fanboys i love this game but it needs improvement yes it is in early access but it is undeniable that more content and performance could and should be focused on for a 50 game i could go much deeper and which other reviews have but this is more targeted to performance and optimization that has failed in numerous updates as one update will literally fix and smoothly increase fps yet the next update will just completely reverse previous progress and destroy my frame count and smooth brain sanity as always enjoy polski
