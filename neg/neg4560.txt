2019 as a player with 600 hours in this game i will start off the cons because thats what people want to know the biggest problem in this game is the balance of the military it plays too much role in the game that makes any other way of victory pointless both in single player and in multiplayer mode there need to be a way sever punishment for warmongering currently the only punishment you get is your diplomacy which in worst case end up turning every ai nation against you which you can basically ignore it by having a powerful military deterrent in multi player mode that punishment does no impact on you at all if you have a strong military power you ignore everyone else including the united nations just like in real world yes like murica a lot of players in the community include me enjoy the diversity of the game we enjoy building wonders spread cultures explore space and spread religions but in reality multiplayer game none of them exist whenever i play with my bf and his friends the game was always ruined by someone who abuses military which forces everyone else do nothing but building military and the game always ended up becoming a turn based age of empire to win the game you only need to spam massive army navy and build a relative decent economy to support them nothing else really matter some says you still need to advanced science to stay in strong military no you just use that double pillage card and plunder other s science buildings that s all you need culture religion diplomacy environment no they don t exist there is no place and no point to attempt any other type of victory because people are going to attack you by force and the only way to defend yourself is to do the same thing i really love this game and i hope this issue gets addressed make some meaningful punishment for warmongers or the game
