2017 updated review after 52 hours in and 4 updates tl dr this game should be marked as an early access gamewhile i can understand the dev s motivation to urge users to report bugs i cannot fathom how they can release this game as a finished product but treat their customers as early access testers bugs i ve encountered animals get stuck and stand still they cant run away you can pet them sometimes you get stuck in a bush and then die of falling damage trashiest clunkiest and buggiest ui ever even after the patch you have to at least click twice on stuff and pray for it to work apparently not only the wildlife but also the ui buttons require a hunter s precision if you don t click on a specific area within the option you want to navigate through the game won t recognize your click ui is absolutely buggy and has hidden hitboxes map doesn t center around you when you open it first few moments upon openning the map have to be spent on zooming in out and finding where you are there seems to be no consistency regarding the loudness of the sounds you create crawling through bush x in this area is silent crawling through bush the same bush in another area is suddenly loud also wind and rain seem to not have an effect on your displayed sound level after playing some time with your phone ingame item that helps you tracking out your fps start to drop from 50 to 13 only happens when the phone is out then the next bug kicks in suddenly all tracks vanish and don t ever appear again renders tracking impossible you have to restart the game going into the menu and back ingame is not possible since there is no button to return to the menu the scope on the rifle bugs out as soon as you start using a bow use a bow and your rilfe s scope will be rendered useless don t use a bow not receiving skill points all though i get notified i got one not receiving perk points all though i get notified i got one many more bugs others discoveredtechnically not a bug but simply bad design you can t walk through some bushes which is fine in itself but in some areas they are placed en masse which turns said area into a maze you have to navigate your way through hip tall bushes that in rl you wouldn t even need to bend but here they are walls try to jump over them and you die of falling damage that is a bug though
