2020 game is expensive but full of content i hate the dlc policy i would rather see the subscription policy for game like this but i know that most of the players hate subscriptions so it is not main point of this review main point is that they released new patch with dlc that is ruining game and making it unplayable it is known from 2 months and they did nothing to fix it they only told that they can do nothing because developers are on holidays good choice to release big patch that can break everything while you don t have people to fix the bugs so for now 2 months ago they took money broke the game and see nothing bad about it for interested people there is bug that causes ai contolled players to go into debt and bankrupt all the time so everyone around you is in massive debt and cannot do anything useful
