2022 update for 1 0 taleworlds needs to leave this game alone and let modders fix what they are incapable or unwilling to do these little micro updates ruin mods and playthroughs and tw would be better off starting mountain blade iii since we all know it will take them 15 years anyway here are more observations since its full release considerably more stable than beta i have about 40 mods and i only get ctds if i wantonly add a new one or if the game has been running for 4 5 hours the ai is horrible both on the campaign map and in battles on the map ai parties will siege down and an assault a fief all while the enemy has a massive army sitting 200 feet away which will then attack and stack wipe the siegers in battle they will always send their archers up to point blank range as skirmishers to get slaughtered then proceed to lose regardless of the odds because they have no range support also the ai always has small groups of cavalry on either side of their formations and will send those up as skirmishers as well if you for example have a glorious line of infantry or a nice cavalry charge lined up with 200 guys and send them forward using either charge or advance your line will always chase those half dozen skirmishers and split up some guys will continue to the enemy and get massacred and you ll lose also of note friendly and enemy cavalry will constantly get bogged down inside shield walls for no reason this is way worse with cav archers as they generally focus on the center of the enemy line then circle at close range and get stuck on the wings of the enemy therefore being erased cav archers will get stuck in melee as well again for no reason contrary to reality it s much easier to treat your cav archers as mobile artillery and manually babysit them as a group stupid enemy lords are still cheating sacks of i can camp outside a fief kill the lord s stack then wait a couple days they ll respawn in the city and come out with another 100 strong party etc etc forever raiding is terrible ai raids with impunity you ll be treated as satan by everyone in the game if you raid once the formation system is absolutely awful especially if you run with a lot of companions they ll constantly be added to the wrong one and die out of position eg cavalry companions added to a shield wall infantry group shields are still magical vacuums arrows two feet or more on any side of the shield will still be sucked up like a cheating black hole of go yourself tl drunreasonably rough taleworlds needs to go away and allow the community to build this into the game it should be because they can t and yet it s still going to be my favorite game of all time with more and more detailed mods released every day original beta review below can t remember which version unstable buggy broken generally a gigantic pain in the to play also extremely addicting and in most ways a step up over warband t 1000 hours player just on my legit steam copy just like warband however the longer you play one game the more crashes you ll get and eventually they ll start happening even in battles for example the one that prompted me to write this was about to be an overwhelming victory for me 200 vs 1600 but it ctd right at the end compared to warband visuals way better though definitely not cutting edge or anything vanilla battle size at 1 000 and it runs like a dream in terms of performance multiple mods supported at the same time sandbox mode with all the gameplay and none of the stupid story can execute lords who repeatedly piss you off which is legendarily satisfying the game is so absurdly unstable and coded even worse than warband so more than a handful of mods and enjoy the endless ctd with nonsense error logging even with the better logging mods the ai is stupid probably moreso than warband frequently they ll be in such a hurry to get into formation that they ll just walk right up to around and behind your line without fighting all while getting massacred horse archer spam is instant win with barely any losses vs infinite number of enemies it s worse than warband in this regard as even with all difficulty options totally maxed once you have about 100 horse archers you ll never lose another battle smithing is a great concept but like the rest of the game is cancerously implemented you can easily abuse it by going to the celts buying up the wood turning it into charcoal sell it and get rich buy a ton of weapons off the market smelt them learn new designs craft smelt craft smelt bingo bongo now you can make a sword they ll buy off you for 30k a pop and you haven t left the city once once again raiding makes everyone hate you even your own companions but the ai does it all the time with zero consequences the ai on the campaign map are cheating sacks of for example i took all but two cities off the northern empire but a few months later they declared war on my kingdom the mongols i thought to myself they couldn t be serious they only have two cities right yeah but when i checked the diplomacy screen they had 7500 troops vs 4500 of ours lolwut also they get troops magically all the time from villages that have no recruits to offer the developers delusionally think more than a tiny minority of players care about multiplayer and put a ton of effort into that meanwhile the game has been in development for a decade and another two years of early access after that but they can t fix things that have been reported since the beta eg caravans not giving trade xp despite the game telling you they will fixed by mods of course like warband modders are fixing and improving most of what the lazy incompetent devs mess up but every update breaks the mods and every thread on the nexus devolves into update pls x400tl drthis should be a free closed or open beta selling it for fifty shekels is a joke it s worse because of how long it s been in development like if it was a human being it would be in junior high already get the out of here all that said i have two hundred hours in and after dropping it for now again i ll check back in six or seven years and see how the early access is proceeding probably poorly
