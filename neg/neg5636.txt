2018 i have been playing the total war series since mediaeval 1 and am genuinely upset by the direction the franchise is headed in not only have recent releases been increasingly shallow and lacking in content but the dlc policy has become outrageous to add insult to injury it has become clear that ca does not care about its fanbase and is happy to pander to loud interest groups who have no real interest in gaming or historical accuracy
