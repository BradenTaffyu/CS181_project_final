2023 early access review i had high hopes for this game devs said they would be fixing bugs and glitch s and there are far more bugs and glitch s then the old game they even left many console commands in the game like r nanite viewmeshlodbias offset 1000r nanite viewmeshlodbias offset 1 you can see right through bases on pvp servers no point in playing this game if enemy s can just turn off trees and bushes and walls and see where every turret is in your base think its time to salt the snail and stop giving these greedy devs money for there broken games dont get me started on how the game runs also still seems to be using the same slow servers with over 100 ping like the last game
