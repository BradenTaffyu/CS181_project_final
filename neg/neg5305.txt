2023 i normally don t write reviews but i gotta be honest i wouldn t recommend this game to new players at all while mtg as a whole has gotten bad over the years i ll talk exclusively about arena itself where to begin this game is brutal to new players unless you fork over a lot of money wotc has made it clear they want to milk you as much as they can and if you don t comply you ll be stuck trying to slowly piece together a good deck this isn t as bad if you play historic but if you like standard you ll be caught in a bind the in game economy is laughably bad especially when compared to another game yugioh master duel if you get a crappy mythic or rare card you re stuck with it and it just takes up space the formats themselves are pretty meh standard is standard historic is the extended format but it s been sullied by alchemy existing and keeping card changes permanent crashes happen a lot and i ve lost games because of said crashes putting me behind my opponent overall mtg arena is just a bad pay to win mess that should be overhauled to make the player experience better honestly the only reason i still play this game is because i ve been playing since it was first released and i have developed stockholm syndrome
