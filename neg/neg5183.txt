2016 the base game is quite good sadly they are applying the dlc policy so when i personally paid 60 euros for only 5 races they now bring a dlc which costs 17 euros for a single race this is a ripoff they do not deserve any money 60 euros is the price of a full game with all the civs comparing this game to rome 1 the dlcs actually brought new maps and new stories barbarian invasion bringing an entire new set of civs obviously ca has to stop taking a big dump on the comunity
