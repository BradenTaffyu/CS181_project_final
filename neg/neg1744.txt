2019 the game itself is great but the business model it uses is utter garbage the game has beautiful graphics is very well optimized gameplay is great the damage system is the most realistic ever made but then the devs business model steps in they want you to spend money on it of course that s natural nobody works for free but you can t purchase the game you may purchase only a handful of special vehicles in a regular microtransation game business model you are forced to grind to have items that you could have by paying extra money if this is included in a game you already paid many consider this itself a bad business model that does not respect the player s time and is bad game design if it s included in a f2p game and the amount of money required to purchase all times by far exceeds the quality of the game and the market s average price then it s considered pay to win and what gaijin entertainment does they double it down they make you pay so you can have the privilege of grinding less but you still have to grind in one way or other and it s no small amount of grind either see the slug on their company s logo that s an excellent allegory to the slugish progress you make in this game after some point of the game you are not allowed to have bad luck if you kill less than two or three enemies in a match you will lose money if you kill 5 or 6 enemies and your team wins the game you may gain about 2 or 3 of the money you need to purchase the next vehicle here is my current situation for example i have a tiger i tank every time my tiger gets destroyed i lose nearly 2500 to 3000 silver lions to repair it killing an enemy gives me around 1000 to 1200 silver lions and you get about 3000 lions bonus if your brain dead teammates can actually help you to win the match so i am forced to have a k d ratio of 3 0 on every game so i can dream about buying my desired 170 000 panther tank someday after spending about 20 hours this weekend playing this game keeping a positive k d on most games i made about 80k lions in two days of heavily grinding i got barely half of what i need to get one tank and i am not even in the middle of the game while endgame tanks costs over one million lions so i can only expect things to get worse unless i start paying hundreds of dollars to get premium currency that will still not grant me access to these vehicles in any way and will just make things maybe slightly easier even if killing moer advanced tanks will give me more money repairing my more advanced tanks will also cost more moneys which makes the game s pace not change so if i ever dream of unlocking all tanks so someday i can play with the leopard ii i still need to sink 400 hours into this game or pay the devs about 100 dollars of premium currency to reduce my grind to just 200 and that s just one tank segment of one faction to get access to all tanks in the game it would cost thousands of dollars plus thousands of grind hours or if i wanted to remain not paying anything maybe 20k hours yeah imagine thinking it s okay to spend more time grinding in a game than you need to get a college degree losing is part of every game but this game punishes you by wasting your time and potentially taking away your money if you were iressponsible enough to spend it on this crap everytime i get a lucky kill by accidentaly flanking somebody i feel bad because i probably made somebody s day worse by pushing their progress back and i didn t even feel accomplished the entire game is designed around mining your earnings and make you spend money you need to buy vehicles you don t want to advance to the next tier you need to purchase vehicle modifications you don t need to have access to the ones you want for every new vehicle you buy you need to spend money so you can invent fire stinguishers again everything everytime everywhere you need to spend your money you are not even entitled to choose the maps you want to play you can choose one map out of the map rotation if you accept to pay for their subscription service and there you go playing on a map you hate a map deliberately poorly designed you take a wrong turn your tank falls into a ditch and guess what guess what you must spend money to repair it like you have a panzer iv ausf g then you want to go to the panzer iv ausf h like even if you don t want you have no choice you are forced to researcha and purchase every useless vehicle in the tecthree to unlock new ones ausf g you must research everything again despite the ausf h being literally just the ausf g with some useless armor plate skirts added ah and you must pay for the ammo you use that s serious i wonder how long it will take until they decide to charge us for the fuel of the tanks or to pay wages to the tank crews like they can use the excuse that they are trying to make the game more realistic and make you need to pay wages for the crews pay for their dental plan for their children s colleges wellcome back your crewmember hans has suffered a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital 40k lions have been taken from your account to pay for his medical expenses i would gladly pay 60 to play this game with at least all ww2 tanks but all their offers are laughable they are right now charging 30 dollars for a t 34 tank and people are buying it yes you heard right a single vehicle that is just a slight upgrade of an existing free version and yes there is also the famous russian bias the devs are russians and they are shamessly nationalistic and not afraid of trying to make their nation look the best and how they do this in a game which takes pride of it s extremely realistic vehicle stats if they lie about the vehicle specs people will just check them in wikipedia to call them out what they do simple match them in anachronic fights the is 2 only saw action in 1944 mostly fighting against tiger ii tanks and jagdpanzers so you make it show up early to fight 1942 tiger i panzer ivs and shermans instead the pt 76 was one of the most useless tanks of the cold war a light tank that could barely hold itself against infantry well then just make it show up ten years earlier to fight early ww2 tanks but yet it all backfired in this poor attempt to overcompensate their insecurity and irrational patriotism the devs just accidentaly showed how bad soviet armor was by proving that is completely possible for a sherman to kill cold war soviet tanks hilarious i don t know about the air battles mode i refuse to touch that mode with a ten foot pole i m h ere only for the tanks but i heard from friends that soviet planes are capable of ridiculously unrealistic feats on this state i would refuse to spend 10 cents on this game i just want to get a nice mug of black cofee in a rainy day sit back and relax drive my tiger across the green hills while i listen to some classical music and calmly try to spot enemies with my bynoculars and this is currently not possible with all the grinding pressure the game currently has i will come back again in a few years maybe people will start to get tired of this game now there are no more new tanks to add i don t think they will be adding more modern aircraft because i doubt a game that prides itself of it s realism would want to make f 15s and mig 31s dogfight a f 4 vs mig 21 is the most modern dogfight you can get more modern aerial warfare than that is basically just dots beeping in the radar and getting shot across the continent hopefully this game s development cycle will end soon people will start to leave due the lack of new content and the devs may reduce these ridiculous grinding requirements to attract people back until then i would not recommend anybody to waste their time with this grindfest go play games that respect your time
