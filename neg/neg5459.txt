2018 i have been a loyal fan of total war since rome i first came out i thought i was going to continue to be so until i read ella mcconnel s response to a matter i originally found as an inconvenience an issue that i tried to find mods to fix the slight annoyance however her response was insulting due to the condecending and dismissive tone of it my issue with female generals recently i have found myself playing as rome and having every barbarian faction having a significant and unrealistic amount of female generals specially gaul never did caesar encounter a female general in his campaigns in gaul this could have been just poor luck but it was not either historically acurate nor authentic i play this game to submerge myself into this period and i would have loved to encounter boutica in britain or cleopatra in egypt however when every major barbarian faction i encounter had a female general it feels like an agenda is being pushed it absolutely does not bother me in warhammer total war since female characters are big part of the lore not having them would diminish the experience just as having them in rome ii in disproportionate amounts dimishes the experience for the player this issue would not have been enough to turn me off as a loyal customer until i read ca s response my issue with the response total war fans tend to be a niche and loyal community which buys every new iteration of the same game simply because the only actual difference is that you get to experience the same game but in a different time period let s be honest total war games are all the same when it comes to play and mechanics the only reason we happily have paid 60 for each new game is because we are history nerds and appreciate the effort ca puts into making each game an immersive experience of that time period however by ca dismissing the criticism of their fan based in such a condecending way they are showing that they are more concerned with virtue signaling than of showing appreciation to their loyal fans ca could have dug their heels in a way that it did not disrespect the fans but giving an ultimatum of if you dont like it dont play it is a middle finger to each and everyone of us i have played about 2000 hours in total war games in steam and god knows i probably played twice that amount when i bought rome i and empire back in cd rom when i was a teen if thinks that we can either shut up or go away i will gladly go play age of empires naval action or civilization i was hoping to see what new games ca had in store specially with the upcoming versions of thrones of britannia however now i refuse to buy another total war game don t bite the hand that feeds you ps i took a break from rome ii 3 weeks ago because i got annoyed with the frequency of civil wars
