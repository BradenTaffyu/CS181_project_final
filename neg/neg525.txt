disclaimer by all means i do suggest playing this game as the story is fantastic however as this is a game review the gameplay has to be the biggest factor in the review and unfortunately the actual gameplay of limbus company is terrible still i would recommend trying it as the story is great pros despite being a gacha game at it s core limbus company gives out enough free currency that you can play through the entire story and excel in repeatable content without spending any money this extends in particular to new players as it gives them 20 pulls at a reduced cost to let them get some good identities to start aforementioned fantastic story backed with some great art and amazing music if you like intricate plot and fantastically written characters you will love the story has an resource based mission entry system essentially meaning that the game dissuades you from playing too much in one sitting and lets you just play a bit every so often without making you feel like you are missing out on rewards and pulls by not grinding constantly cons the gameplay limbus relies heavily on rng for combat the power of your attacks and damage is based on rng the speed of your characters and enemies is based on rng the skills you are offered on battle start are based on rng who enemies target are based on rng etc this isn t too bad at the start of the game in particular the first 3 cantos as the game s difficulty is fairly low and if you mess up an attack it isn t really an issue however later on the game starts punishing you heavily for essentially just having bad luck an attack that should ve been near impossible to mess up just barely fails and now one of your characters is staggered an enemy with a 50 chance to hit heads gets heads on every single one of their coin tosses just barely letting them beat the attack and perform an utterly devastating attack that pretty much ends the attempt at the mission an attack that had a high chance of victory loses and now your character has a debuff that makes them useless for the next turn this is made worse by the most recent canto 6 which has many enemies gaining sanity much quicker than your characters can through passives while constantly debuffing your own and applying paralysis in non game terms constantly increasing their chances of getting maximum attack power while lowering your chances of doing so and outright removing your ability to get bonus attack power coin power this ends up making some missions in particular boss scenarios a situation of if i don t get a good first two turns it is better to just alt f4 for a reset to increase difficulty project moon has just been relying on putting rng more in the enemy s favour rather than actually designing the fights with any serious strategy there are outliers some of the later boss fights are still very enjoyable and show that pm is plenty capable of making enjoyable bosses it just seems that the further you go on the more they rely on letting rng dictate the flow of fights and it ends up making a lot of the game frustrating instead of fun tl dr using rng to dictate a lot of the game is a bad idea mission resources become a problem i know that i put the system as a pro but once you get to the overly frustrating rng sections of the game the resource system becomes heavily detrimental as you are likely to experience extreme spikes in difficulty during missions for nothing other than bad luck and for certain missions you will lose large amounts of this resource due to this in comparison to the primary gameplay issues this is minor but is still incredibly problematic for a game based on rng while friendly to new players for the first 60 or so hours once you get to the point of actively doing higher level mirror dungeons and the latest bits of story you begin to encounter issues the base ids that the game gives you at the start are pretty terrible later on and you will pretty much only use ids gained through the gacha mechanics which becomes problematic as the ids are usually specialised for a certain status effect type or to serve a particular role support high damage high clash etc while fine in the early game later on you will need full team synergy or very high damage ids to get past certain roadblocks or to complete a mission fast enough to get it s ex reward in the case of the canto missions which if you don t have means you will pretty much be stuck either doing the mission over and over again until rng falls far enough in your favour or constant grinding to either get the specific ids you want from the dispensary or make more gacha pulls and hope you get what you need while the combat rng is frustrating on it s own having a team with great synergy only for them to be unable to finish a mission fast enough to get the ex reward or having a group you want to use for mirror dungeons but greatly underperforming due to the group not having enough overlap for the dungeon gifts to help much is far more frustrating this issue can be partially mitigated through the friend system which lets you borrow a single id that one of your friends has listed on their company profile but more often than not this isn t enough to solve the underlying issue of the game simply making it too difficult to get the ids you need the tutorial is absurdly terrible i won t go on for too long as more experienced people than me have already gone over the inherent issues in the tutorial and this can be mitigated by simply searching up limbus company tutorial on youtube which will give you all the information you could want from a better designed tutorial but it still needs to be pointed out that the game gives you almost no information on how it actually works and you pretty much need to just work out everything on your own or through youtube overall i still must stress that for anyone who plays games for their stories and worldbuilding you should give this game a try as it s story is fantastically written and honestly got me to look up and buy several of the books that limbus draws inspiration from something i was not expecting since i mostly looked into it due to some of the game s music coming from one of my favourite artists mili however if you are considering playing it because the gameplay itself looks interesting do not if you seriously like the look of the gameplay or just want to support the developers get library of ruina the gameplay mechanics are far better in that game and the story is at least on par in my opinion
