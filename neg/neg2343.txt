2022 i started playing raft in 2020 right before the taronga chapter came out and adored it the aesthetic the world building and the fact that the story being hinted at was generally a really interesting one i cannot tell you how disappointed i am with the final chapter both of the new story islands felt smaller than everything that had come before them with less exploration and less world building not to mention the changes they made to what story they had everything just felt so rushed like they were trying to get me to the end of the game as soon as possible not to mention the sudden addition of platforming and boss fights both of which were done rather poorly especially given how clunky combat is which is a lot easier to overlook for most of the game because he enemies aren t as big of a deal the addition of the trading posts makes no sense and only one of the blueprints they sell actually has any benefit other than aesthetic also what am i supposed to do once i beat the game does it basically become a sand box to run around in does utopia still need anything the finale just felt so lacklusterall in all it really suck to watch a game i really enjoyed be basically ruined by a shoehorned ending
