2023 so for the time being this will be a downvote i do not like doing this because overall age of empires iv is a decent game however how it is currently being handled as far as updates goes is extremely disappointing this is a massive tldr but ill write it here before you need to read anything else base game good future development possibly bad the positives mostly focusing on the base game and initial concept of the game when it came out and where i hope it will go onward though this continues to be dashed thus far this year the base game factions are great they are very well done in terms of design and authenticity for the most part being fun to play and unique with mechanics that fit well it was refreshing to see this direction being taken with the different civilizations even though there weren t many when the game first came out the campaigns were very high quality with emphasis on teaching history to the player with excellent cinematics and some interesting missions i detected slight historical bias in one or two missions but overall for a game made in the current decade it wasnt too heavy handed with this and overall was a pleasant experience making me reminisce in my days playing age of empires ii as a kid and being inspired to do further research on the events presented in game this was one of the games strongest aspects on launch excellent soundtrack with each civilization getting a unique mix that matched the cultural flavor of each and dynamically changed through the ages also a nice touch some negatives of the base game skirmish multiplayer lacked and still lacks to some extent variety of gamemodes maps and conditions rules of play overall its pretty rigid and not very modular previous age of empires games often had a variety of modes and customization for matches that was integral to the experience not everyone wants to play ranked matches every game some of us just like to boot up a silly game mode with crazy resources against lots of hard ai was not really possible on launch and is still hard to do now without mods lack of civilizations we will dive into this in a second lack of meaningful updates will also get to this questionable art style while the gameplay is solid and fun something about the overall art style seems off the things you are looking at on screen at times looks more like a mobile game than a proper strategy game maybe that s just me i will digress on this point only because its extremely subjective and people are more than free to disagree on this continued in comments because long as hell
