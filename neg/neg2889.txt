2018 for as little as my opinion is worth here is what i have to say about the grand 2 0 update it s a mixed bag it s to be expected that there would be some outrage over a major update especially one that decided to completely redefine core gameplay mechanics let alone after almost two years since the game launched however the anger and problems extend deeper then that upon release of 2 0 we were given some expectations of how this would fix many of the problems relating to the actual strategic gameplay along with the relative dull periods of the game itself the first of these ftl rework it s goal create more strategic gameplay with intelligent choices result the ftl rework has for the most part simply recreated the previous rhetoric only at a far slower pace assaults still largely revolve around a head on confrontation and with ftl inhibitors being available early in the game raiding can be shut down while ordinairly you would simply go the long way around the time required for this has been extended such that you could risk coming under assault before you make it around a choke point pairing up with the poor movement of fleets means you ll feel right at home with the imperium of man a vast empire constantly being pecked at overall exchange of options you gain the ability to choke point and direct fights but you lost the ability to avoid fleetgrinders or even traverse your own territory in meaningful time the second of these starbases it s goal to make defenses meaningfulresult yes i m just going to say this from the start it works the problem is that it can also become tedious to manage if your having to upgrade stations as you can t queue upgrades that pre req one your currently building this paired with the heavy cost of operating a large starbase does mean you can only fortify a few systems overall this honestly feels like it s something that should of been done as an addition to defenses rather than a replacementthe third of these borders it s goal to give a rigid and intuitive borderresult awkwardness in some ways you have reliably controlled and easy to maintain borders but you also now have the tedious task of building an outpost for every system you wish to control which as i ll get to leaving unclaimed systems inside your borders is a very poor idea which is compounded by the influence cost of the outposts their inability to survive just about anything means you ll be rebuilding them as soon as something manages to reach the system overall it accomplishes it s goal at the cost of punishing the player in being little more then an expansion tax you have to keep dishing out the fourth of these penalty rework it s goal to put more emphesis on stellar domination over population managementresult it works again albeit at some cost what has been done is now you don t suffer a penalty for every single unit of population your empire has instead you suffer for based on how expansive your empire is this in the sense of both planets and claimed systems yes claimed systems so as with the 3rd you have an expansion tax for every system you take and the penalty per system is enough to build up rapidly even for a relatively small empire overall again acomplishes goal at the cost of again punishing the player with little more then an expansion penalty that is completely unavoidable that is unless you wish to be more akin to stellar citystates the fifth of these pirates it s goal provide more gameplay in both early and mid game result i ll tell you as soon as these reavers leave in seriousness it is actually fairly nice if not troublesome the problem is the pirates while they do provide some combat oriented gameplay to spice things up they re also rather rigid in that they will follow the same pattern over and over spawning in the nearest uninhabitated system rushing into your territory and just smashing things until you wipe them out the first few times this is fun by the 6th it s tedious and boring and by the 12th you ll be wondering if there s some sort of pirate cloning machine out there overall mixed bag it almost but not quite acomplishes it s goal what it s really lacking is variety instead we have what could very easilly just be a von neuman probe that went haywire the sixth of these i ll make this the last doomstacksi ll have to prelude a little here a doomstack is little more then when you have taken the entirety of your available navy and clumped it into a single terrifying force this is normally done because combat mechanics strongly favor larger fleets for minimizing harm to yourself while maximizing sealclubbing result no just no what they tried was to re arrange the mechancis to simply make a large navy almost impossible to afford let alone field this paired with drasticly smaller fleets getting a combat bonus which caps rather quickly all things considered it overall does little more then take all the numbers we had before and divide by 10 we don t have more strategic multi fleet gameplay due to fleet caps instead you have a stack of fleets assuming your fleet cap isn t your entire navy to begin with overall it fails it fails horribly instead of removing doomstacks we actually have more incentive to use them from the other changes this is especially apparent in how defenses and ftl was changed note there is actually quite a few other major changes done in this patch some arguably more important than those listed however this is already beginning to drag on while as said before the patch is a mixed bag i do have to recommend against it for now there is issues with core gameplay that should have been seen and dealt with well before the patch was released and overall it feels as if many of these changes were developed in isolation of each other the issues of several bugs are enough that i ve also had to take to using the console to debug the game myself which to me feels like very poor review of the changes were done in closing the patch removed old problems by creating entirely new ones it strived for so much and has fallen short in several regards while it has technicly acomplished it s goal it has done so in a rather wreckless manner while i hope my opinion will be changed with hotfixes it seems more likely they ll be paved over by another set of revisions tip as said in other reviews you can revert to version 1 9 1 via the beta tab accessable by rightclicking the game in your library and selecting properties
