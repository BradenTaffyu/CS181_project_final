2020 bought on sale to see what the hype was about played 55 hrs to get all endings fight the secret boss desperately searching for what the hype was about utterly baffled as to its popularity gameplaythe gameplay is polished for what it is which is simple pretty basic action game affair with surprisingly well integrated bullet hell twin stick shooter aspects however there is a fair bit of grinding in this game and it simply gets boring rather quickly moreover there are several gameplay segments that just really make you go what on earth were they thinking you ll be going through the game just fine then you ll get a sidequest where the enemies are 20 levels above you and get squashed or feature enemies that are such insane damage sponges you really have to wonder what sadistic madmen designed such an encounter the game loves to create artificial challenges by forcing awkward camera angles on you one boss fight in particular has a wonderful section where the camera glues itself to the outer edge of the arena while the boss is doing ranged attacks so you can t see the boss at all and can only see the projectiles when they re already right next to you if you re like me and are anal about not missing sidequests you will absolutely hate this game the sidequests in nier are such a tangled web of nonsense that it is virtually impossible to even get them all when they are available let alone complete them many are very clearly not meant to be done on your first playthrough as they are of almost impossible difficulty when you get them but utterly trivial once you re a higher level or have the abilities of another character not that the game ever tells you that you can and should just put them off for later some quests will seem to just stop or effectively end as they depend on another sidequest to continue but if you advance the plot too much before doing the secondary sidequest to technically finish the first one the first one will fail and you ll have to redo the whole thing on another playthrough even if you can still do the secondary sidequest one sidequest late in the game is needed for another sidequest to finish even though all you need to do is go to an area to watch a short scene that is completely unrelated to either quest this secondary sidequest only becomes available immediately before a main mission that causes it to auto fail you don t even have to do the main mission just accepting it removes your ability to interact with the necessary object in the same zone as the main quest after beating the game once you can go back and complete any unfinished quests and the game saves all your progress so you don t have to redo any that are fully completely finished but if you don t have advance knowledge of how all this works my god is it frustrating storynow here is where the game truly deeply fails nier automata is one of the worst cases of pretentious nonsense masquerading as high art i have ever seen in my life all i see across the whole internet is people fawning over what a masterpiece the story of this game is and it baffles me i imagine its all the same people who fawn over the nonsense that is the metal gear series and i actually like metal gear having player nier however i now fully understand where people who hate metal gear are coming from metal gear just happens to be the right flavor of stupid for me but for people who just don t like that flavor i imagine metal gear looks to them very much how nier automata looks to me offensively pretentious and insulting to my intelligence this game does not have plot holes it has a few tiny blots of plot amidst a great bottomless plot chasm there is barely any continuity from one event to the next things just happen apropos of nothing and if you want an explanation you ll have to wait to the absolute end of the game where you ll get a text dump to the in game codex that kind of sort of not really explains a few things the entire plot is utterly meaningless when it is all said and done which some fools have taken to arguing is a positive saying that it s supposed to be meaningless it s all about existentialism and nihilism and what it means to be alive and blah blah blah if i punch you in the face it s supposed to hurt are you gonna shower me with praise for showing you all about the pain and suffering of life the will to fight back the complex reality of trying to be peaceful in a hostile world and blah blah blah blah probably not intending to waste my time does not excuse wasting my time the only deep profound question i find myself asking after finishing this game is why on earth did this get so much praise the mere existence of a theme says absolutely nothing about the quality of its execution which in nier is childish and poor there is nothing you ll learn about the nature of existence in the 20 ish hours it takes to complete the main game that you wouldn t learn just as well by spending those 20 ish hours lying in bed and letting you mind wander wherever it wants the first half of the game you ll be pitted against adam and eve how these guys even came to exist at all is a little corner of the plot chasm all by itself but let s ignore that one of them basically intentionally defeats himself out of boredom and in doing so reveals the reason why the other should basically be immortal but for no good reason he isn t the other gets mad that he s dead and that s his whole character nothing about either of these two is ever explained and i don t think they are even mentioned again outside of some text at the end the whole first half of the game could honestly just be skipped though that would be implying that the second half has some plot to develop and it does have more going on than the first half but only barely and like pretty much everything else in this game ultimately amounts to nothing the second half starts off relatively strong but immediately peters out into a meandering slog where the main characters have even less reason to be doing the things they do than before you aren t given any kind of antagonist at all until the very end and boy is it underwhelming once again he just defeats himself the gameplay section literally has the game tell you to stop fighting and just run around for a few minutes while the big bad talks himself into failure the way it all plays out the characters could ve all just stayed home and the same thing would ve happened it s always great when the actions of the main characters in a story are utterly pointless am i right summarythis game was made with the intention of wasting your time insane people claim this is some artistic achievement but for normal people who don t like wasting their time don t get this game edit and now having played soma also available on steam i now have an example of how to do what nier intended with its story in a way that isn t awful soma hits all the same themes of nier in a remarkably similar setting a hostile isolating world populated entirely by oddly human machines except it is infinitely superior in its execution as a story and as an in depth exploration of heady existentialist concepts and ideas anyone thinking of getting nier for the story content just get soma instead
