2017 fallout 4 is damn what is fallout 4 has an obsession with features undermined the series todd howard is a forward thinker there s no doubt about that always looking to drive the games he helms to be bigger and better than the last unfortunately like all good things taken too far in the one direction this urge to be better can yield some unpleasant results howard s eye for innovation has led to a number of improvements over f4 s predecessor namely in the smoother controls and gunplay and streamlined inventory management in its favour fallout 4 is far more user friendly than its predecessors and this is a great thing if you can travel back in your mind and remember how clunky each previous bethesda game is fallout 4 also boasts an overarching narrative that is one of the most resonant of any game in the series so far balancing existential themes with a deeply personal story that holds some truly powerful emotional moments and yet somehow in saying that fallout 4 feels like the most soulless fallout game so far how did this happen i for one believe that in the pursuit of topping the aesthetic and superficial achievements of previous bethesda games like skyrim and fallout 3 bethesda have unfortunately focused on the wrong elements to innovate and have left the things that make fallout fallout by the wayside whilst f4 is indeed eminently more playable than f3 new vegas or even skyrim the streamlining of the combat mechanics and subsequently overwhelming focus on gunplay has robbed the game of its flexibility nine times out of ten the solution to any problem will be shoot a thing and while the option is still available to talk your way out of some situations there s a distinct lack of nuance that only became glaring to me in retrospect sure you can tread through the game easily enough and maybe you ll have fun you might even be impressed at times but you might also like me find yourself at a point feeling a little bored you might not know why you might not even explicitly know that you re bored but for some reason you don t feel the compulsion to play that you used to the excitement and i believe that this is down to the fact that f4 is far less an rpg than any of the other fallout game rather it is more than anything else a base building fps in an open world and you can get a base building open world fps game elsewhere the uniqueness of fallout is in its one of a kind atmosphere the tongue in cheek humour the secrets and surprises that lay hiding around the world waiting to be stumbled upon and the feeling that in making choices you re never making things perfect you re making friends and enemies and changing the world before you i don t play fallout in order to check off all the settlements i ve liberated or the areas i ve wiped clean of enemies i play it for the things i miss the first time and discover on a later play through in my second play through of f4 i realised that i d found almost everything there was to see i d been to almost all of the locations killed the inhabitants looted the chests and left and in the places i hadn t found killing something and looting a chest was about all there was to do i knew what the alternate endings to the path i trod before were because the two options had been lain out before me the last time i went through and in finishing the story there were no unexpected surprises things didn t change much following my choice and certainly not in an unpredictable way so gone are the days of a unique and interesting ethical greyness of the post apocalypse gone are ambiguous moral choices in which you have to make a personal judgement without knowing what the explicit outcome of your actions will be fallout 4 is a shoot em up you simply can t finish the game without killing and even when attempting a positive moral play through in which you treat the characters benevolently and help out as many people as you can you will leave a swath of hundreds if not thousands of humans mutants and animals dead in your wake most of the beings you stumble upon will be hostile and regardless of which pathway you choose in the end you re a destroyer first and foremost and thus f4 betrays the ethos of the fallout series it s a long way from the living breathing wastelands of f1 2 and nv from a world that is bigger than you yes you can build a base and outfit it with a bunch of sweet attractions and weapons yes the movement and shooting is more fun yes it looks better than the last gen games but where s the heart where s the sense of immersion between all the systems and gimmicks and repeating quests that pop up again and again into infinity where s the feeling that you re in a world in which the people have complex problems where s the compromise where are the solutions that in and of themselves can cause unseen problems of their own there s a side mission that involves a cowardly shrinking violet who needs some confidence and i kid you not this scenario is resolved by dragging him along to a shootout after which he finds the strength within himself to live life to the fullest legitimately you give a sad loner confidence by taking the guy to kill some people this is perfectly indicative of the perspective the game takes all your problems are solved by bloodshed that s not the way a believable world works that s not what makes a fallout game interesting perhaps this seems unfair because i ve given worse games a better rating but i can t really be okay with giving my recommendation to a game that loses sight of the things so core to the unique successes of the franchise fallout 4 isn t a bad game but it fails at being a good fallout game
