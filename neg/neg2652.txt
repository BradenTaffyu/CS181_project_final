2021 this game has the worst new player experience of any game i ve played no skill matchmaking means that as a new player your vs veterans who have tens of thousands of games under their belt not only that they have better crews better equipment as well as spare silver for better ammo some of the map design is truly awful huge area s of the map are just dead man zones with camp and corridor gameplay most games you will be vs tanks of a higher tier which makes it difficult to do any damage
