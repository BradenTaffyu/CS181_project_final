2016 well after sinking quite a few hours into this i finally came into conclusion warthunder is free to play as in it is free to roam around the map and be cannon fodder for overpowered russian biased players even more if they re paying for premium or premium vehicles you can drive around in a nice model of tiger 1 which was no match for any other tank for a good few years and used to anninhilate every russian t32 in this game this won t be it you will get upranked and will have to fight ridiculously overpowered cannon wise shell wise movement wise soviet vehicles tbh even high explosive charges feel to do a lot more damage once you fight for the russians i m no expert but afaik gaijin is a russian company hence the bias don t get me wrong i m far from being bad at this game i camp around play the tiger tactically get my several kills most of the time but it is a struggle gaining wins in ralistic battle yeah right 1 20 is a win in sim battles it s better but there aren t that many battles for tiger1 in sim and don t even get me started on planes did i mention scores of russian speaking players not having anything against but most of the communication is done in russian without asking what elsee ooh lots of spawn camping you spawn in bam right into the back it seems fair to gaijin cause you know russian tanks are fast and nimble by the time tigers get to objective theyre already at our spawn raping everyone as soon as you spawn in so if you think you enjoy being shot in ridiculous op affected ways most of the time this game is for you then again this isn t far away from sadomasohism
