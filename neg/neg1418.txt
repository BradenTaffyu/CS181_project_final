2023 i want to like this game so badly but it is an excruciatingly poor experience there is a small sliver of gameplay in which it is actually somewhat fun but unfortunately the game mostly consists of fumbling from one underdeveloped system to the next the absolute lack of any kind of diplomacy at all means that unless you literally only want to get into skirmishes the entirety of your playtime you will just end up frustrated like me you start off cripplingly weak with the only way to improve your skills being either wasting five minutes trying to chase a group of bandits looters that are always slightly faster than you so you can try and beat them down or go to a nearby city and hope to god they decide to give you the weapon you want to train with for the practice fights but why would they when instead it could be rng so you can get some javelins instead of literally anything you want to use lets say you make it past that you become a mercenary clan this is where that sliver of fun is when you can get a decent enough group of units that aren t too expensive to maintain as you hire yourself out to the various warring states just make sure you pay attention because you can very easily throw off your whole budgeting system by trying to have a few more guys if you want to play this game and not be forced into a world conquest slog stay at this level i thought it d be fun to become a landed vassal and boy was i f cking mistaken at first you think its great a city some villages to provide passive income you can then focus on the villagers of your little fiefs solving their problems developing the infrastructure except no actually you can t because the game constantly forces you to be at war with at least one other empire if not four there is no time to help out the local notables anymore and in fact they become entirely irrelevant because you need to always be chasing down the enemy armies that are relentlessly raiding your villages or trying to lay siege to your castles and god f cking forbid you execute one of these asswipes who have razed the same meager hamlet five times in the last in game month if you do so for some reason every other noble in the game gets massive relations penalties to you both fortunately unfortunately it seems like nobles opinions of you actually don t matter at all they re all gonna go to war against you anyway so what do you care if they hate you for executing the leader of a minor bandit faction mercenary group literal cult this is not a complete game far from it it is barebones a scant few systems just barely good enough to entice you throughout the agony of trying to do literally anything buy it on sale if you have to buy it at all but i cannot in good faith recommend anyone play this if they want anything more than to just throw themselves into random medieval battles for a few minutes at a time and i definitely cannot recommend paying fifty full dollars for it edit after nearly doubling my playtime my thoughts on the game as is have not changed i started a new run where i just focused on tournaments and being a merc and there is a satisfying if repetitive loop there but i ve also spent some time trying out mods both from steam nexus and after getting some to work at least 10 of my new hours are just having it open in the background as i read help threads and figure out conflicts i will say that the mods people have made to enhance combat introduce an actual diplomacy system others do help the experience hell i saw some that change the map to be europe and you play in historical times which is awesome but while they did help and i found them interesting i don t think it should be up to the modding community to save this game and the devs especially given how long they ve had to introduce these basic concepts themselves to bannerlord i will continue to play keep an eye on updates as there is a nugget of a good game here but overall my opinion remains unchanged i would simply be remiss if i didn t comment on what does work and the work the modders have put into improving the experience
