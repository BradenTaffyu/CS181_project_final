2022 yes this is a negative review on a game i have played for over 300 hours and will continue to play after writing this this game is addictive af and i will keep playing it but i have never seen a game managed worse than this one konami forthe love of god listen to your community there a problem cards that the community have been begging to be banned since the game launched cards banned to other formats but not here because your players am i right rhongo vfd maxx c they all have to go your loaner decks in solo mode are garbage give us a selection of loaner cards to chose from and let us build our own decks in place of the current loaners why can t we dismantle cards from legacy packs if i have more than three of the same cards let me dismantle it ffs i could probably go on but these are my top issues but of course none of them will be fixed because konami doesn t give a rat s ass about there community these are things players have been begging to change since release and my voice will drown in the sea of everyone else who has been ignored so far
