2020 i can t get my head around why they go through so much trouble to make certain aspects of this game historically accurate but then other aspects so ridiculously arcade the weapons historical accuracy is mixed at best ship gun reload times are pretty true to life battleships main batteries taking 30 40 seconds to reload cruisers and destroyers able to reload in 4 10 seconds again true to life but then full torpedo spreads of 6 10 tubes can reload in around 60 seconds maps and distances are scaled down but ship size and speeds aren t so a destroyer that is firing torpedoes from 8km away is actually more like 800m away you don t see them until about 200m away but your ship still takes 45mins to complete a turnnow you might think that s ok battleships have lots of armour and big guns to counter this well guess again4 torpedoes will pretty much wipe out a battleship but a full broadside of a battleships main batteries into the side of a destroyer and it will just laugh at you as upturned hull slowly disappears under the waves like leonardo de caprio at the end of titanic or it will pepper the crap out of you with he shells start more fires than mount vesuvius and leave your burning heap looking like london in 1666yes this game genuinely makes destroyers more powerful than battleships jutland would have been a very different battle if these morons had created itin case you haven t worked it out by now the game is nothing but a spam fest for torpedoes and ships without them are pretty much useless i don t even know why they bother having battleships in the game since they become nothing but target practice but its ok because the geniuses at wargaming have now added submarines into the mix because that will surely fix everything all of this is assuming you can actually make it into a game which via this steam version is like trying to navigate a minefield on a space hopperat least once a week the game will fail to let you even log in or you ll login in but then when loading a battle you ll be disconnected and unable to sign back in for at least a few hours you ll then be rewarded for this inconvenience with a strike on your account for exiting a battle early and wargaming support in this situation will be as useful as a paraplegic at river dance with their default responses only ever being try resetting your internet or when that fails uninstall re download and reinstall the game which only takes a few hours to complete
