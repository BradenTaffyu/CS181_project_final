2023 early access review they promised users the ability to host their own clusters on their own private hardware like ark se this was revealed by nitrado to be false was misleading information players purchased the game to bring their ark se experience with friends over to the remastered version of ark sa this wouldn t be so bad if nitrado was actually a decent hosting provider who provided quality services and uptime they are not in fact they are monopolistic scum who exploit vulnerable players who want nothing more than to play a stupid dinosaur game that they live with their friends you would thing the liberal learning devs would oppose this but lets be honest everyone loves to hate capitalism except when it benefits you wildcard snail games are just as responsible for this atrocious business scheme money grab because they programmed allowed these barriers to be included in their beloved game it would one thing if nitrado was actually good hosting servers but the lack the ability to do so continue to prove it with all of these connection errors crashes of my 10 hours only about half are actually in game and even those are inflated by having to play in single player while the server crashed for the 20th time if you haven t bought asa highly recommend waiting it out live through the experiences of those who were unfortunate enough to do so
