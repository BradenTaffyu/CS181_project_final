2023 game s new features elevation advantage auto vaulting over fences auto reinforce button at hq towing of weapons tho really poor pathing and setup time better just to actually move the atg regularly game s missing features changing mouse edge panning speed ability to veto a map many hotkeys and settings are in the interface but do not work legacy classic hotkeys currently no way to go back to classic hotkeys in coh2 so all that hardwiring people had learned for coh previously is gone and for the worse in game replay system in game rank system in game spectate system post game statistics with any sort of accuracy cant keep track of how many squads you built surrender button there is still a hole near the minimap where it supposed to be crushing infantry with vehicles ability to zoom out camera locationsfeatures that have been changed from previous titles tac map worse in every way red cover removed replaced with elevation advantage infantry engagements are slower and less lethal unique colors are confusing and you can end up being red cannot distinguish who controls a unit by simply clicking on the unit because all the information is missing on the bottom hud everything is hidden and requires you to scroll over them to see how many kills for example vet system is there but seems less impactful than previous games shift number feature in coh2 does not exist control clicking feature in coh2 does not exist you can accidentally select retreating infantry and be unable to issue command selected tanks and infantry have different command priority than previous title thus requiring many more actions to do the same task unit focus fire while moving and auto attack priority is different all weapon team ai have been significantly nerfed to where you have to baby sit them to make sure they are doing what you want them to and even then they still will resetup in the exact same place to target something already in their arc arc of weapon teams are a lot less detailed and there are less dots showing where the end of a weapon s arc is engine damage from at grenade and satchels require a lot more damage you cannot repair your hq units that you expect to have abilities or win at certain distances because of their weapons are all different and you have to relearn what wins where additional things that i believe are weak the sound in general is worse than poor weapons do not sound like you would expect them too and many sound like they have some awful echo to them the announcer cannot be turned off and is really annoying to me he will constantly tell you to do things that you may not necessarily want to do at that moment they make you sound like you are losing stuff when you arent the squads all sound really annoying like they are constantly shouting the exact same line over and over in your ears with the announcer telling you to spend your cp it becomes really annoying shift clicking barely even works pathing is horrible in this game breaching is a pathetic feature and once you initiate it you cannot stop towing does this too allowing the players to see what the enemy s commander is by clicking a button skill plane 1 clicking is back in a big way and its even bugged to where it doesnt disappear sometimesgame s balance is like if you took all the bad things coh2 had and brought them back on purpose but made them even worse all together this game is not something i would recommend for someone else that i know i feel it is not a completed product and should not have been released in the state that it is in
