2018 early access review i m a fan of don t starve so this one was an easy sell for me the art style is lovely and the base engine is very solid problem is there s no challenge whatsoever this is the most benign and accommodating asteroid in deep space environment you ll ever encounter at this point in development every playthrough of the game is exactly the same and at some point you just realize the pointlessness of it and quit because the game certainly won t kill you and neither is there any final goal to work towards this is of course an early access title but i can t help but notice worrying trends in the new content patches that come out every once in a while when any new threats are included at all they re trivial and a simple matter of building the new buildings that have been designed to hard counter them done deal you re good i hope i am wrong and will be pleasantly surprised at the final game but at this point in time if you re looking for a similar experience to don t starve avoid oxygen not included if on the other hand you don t care about challenge and just want a relaxed city builder despite the taunting name then this game is probably right up your alley
