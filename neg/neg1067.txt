2018 far harbour dlc is the only wothwhile thing about this game the base game is overhyped rubbish the devs seemed to have put more effort into promoting the game then some aspects of the game itself the good fights are a stepup from f3 and fnv damage is rather consistant and when you shoot a enemy they take damage most enemys are not sponges some of the enviorments are very good the glowing sea is a personal fav of mine weapon visual design is a huge step up from f3 power armour is cool to move around in the bad storyline is incredibly bad for several reasons 1 the main character is given a backstory a huge no no in rpg s even the community s alternative to this backstory which is thankfully supported by ingame evidence means little as the mc is forced to follow a predetemined route based purely on this backstory this alternative backstory is touched upon in far harbour but otherwise has no in game presence 2 limited dialog options each bit of mc dialog is limited to four options as the devs designed the game for player immersion via the character speaking everyline they sorta forgot that nobody really cares for the mc speaking over the mc having options ironically breaking immersion 3 you don t have to play fo4 by building bases but you sorta do and they don t actually do much at all it was a pointless gimmick that you re sort of forced into there are other reasons but that s the main three followers are incredibly bland and boring with only a few having any sort of substance nicky and paladin danse are likely the only ones you will want to have any sort of interaction with others you may have to either choose to interact with or force yourself to if you do so at all weapon upgrades although needed for progression because of added damage and stuff make no sense as described above weapon visual design looks good and this will also carry over to the upgrades themselves but an armour pieceing upgrade outside of a caliber change upgrade on a gun no do you seriously think changing the barrel of a gun slightly will allow you to punch through armour easily no no it won t nv did this very well with a thing called ammo types which you can change on the fly it s not difficult to understand how they work season pass is a ripoff the only thing worth the money in that is far harbour nuka world some people might like but i never got around to finishing it everything else is extra cool new stuff for your settlements that you would rather ignore paid mods
