2023 game was fun dlcs make the game very expensive and most of them don t add something very interesting to the game but now the current patch and the dlc just ruin the game instead of having more possibilities it feels like having more restrictions 0 10 wouldn t buy another dlc again i hope the lead game play designer get s fired and rehired in a soul crushing mobile app games company
