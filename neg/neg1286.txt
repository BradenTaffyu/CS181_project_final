2022 early access review the game s a convolluted ankle deep mess and i m saying this as someone who appreciates such a thing gameplay and balance wise the combat is centered about gimmicks and is simply put one of those games that reward you for breaking it which is the kind of game i find appealing ultimately you need to understand the game and its somewhat arcane systems to make progress as said gimmicks are what s going to be killing you most of the time until you decide to savescum either legitimately by choice of difficulty or by terminating the game to properly familiarize yourself with what s killing you and learning exactly at which point you irredeemably yourself ultimately the games systems are more wide than deep and have way too many extremes that either let you faceroll or completely break a given character making it a game you can t play without respecting it and understanding it the difficulty ultimately stems from the game being convolluted so it s really only for people who consider this a good thing i ve seen a whole lot of praise about coqs randomly generated stuff like histories and i assure you that 99 of the time it s going to be gibberish and 1 of the time it s going to be funny gibberish these history snippets books secrets and so on are ultimately just forms of currency and the contents will most likely be overlooked ultimately it s less of an interesting game to beat and more of an interesing lump of systems to toy with the main selling point here is that the game s a cluster of systems someone could ideally build something on then there s also the fact that the community is suffering from some developer endorsed gatekeeping which makes the game even less approachable edit having seen their onboarding guide it s a self proclaimed idological echo chamber though this has little bearing on the game s content as for the story generators it s pretty much as interesting as a random name or description generator in that as sophisticated as the algorithm is the system is ultimately inconsequential and noninteractive it takes a good while to get into it and i can t promise that you ll find what you want once you re in there
