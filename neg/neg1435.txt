2023 this is a very conflicting game to write a review about there are so many decisive improvements over the mechanics of warband the new battle performance is stellar visuals look great new battles and sieges are grand and awesome the enemy ai is significantly improved compared to native warband and it actually tries to use different tactics in which looks and feels fun and engaging the new town scenes and siege scenes look amazing new siege engine mechanics are fun but these are all surface level improvements once you re past the initial honeymoon period you can t help but notice that the game suffers from a massive number of confusing issues that make it feel like it s still in the beta some of these issues are doubly confusing because they were solved back in warband but are present in bannerlord all these gorgeous new towns and castles that were implemented you will never see them more than once or twice because there is no content inside them you can explore them marvel at the sights but can t meaningfully interact with any peasants guards npc merchants or notables aside from doing an occasional randomly generated fetch quest all the ai lords and ladies and notables have the same generic and bland personalities their dialogue is all copy pasted and outside of the first couple stages of the main quest nobody in calradia has any meaningful agenda or long over arching goal every ai lord speaks and acts exactly the same regardless of their culture or clan there are hundreds of unique clans and nobles at the start of the game but they re all copy pasted clones of one another with minor variation in stats and gear you can t establish any meaningful rapport or friendship with them and they all act like random thugs with slightly bigger armies it s quantity over quality all the way companions that you can hire in taverns around the world are the same they re all randomly generated with a number of premade identical backstories it doesn t matter who you hire because past the initial conversation they just become mindless goons in your squad no different from regular soldiers except you can customize their skills and equipment the strategy part of the game is shallow and bland you can t set meaningful war goals can t enforce your demands on an enemy or force them into a peace agreement even if you conquer every town and castle the enemy faction owns and destroy all their armies they will forever remain an annoying presence on the map and keep attacking your villages unless you agree to pay them tribute which makes no sense the only way around it is to execute them all or keep them in jail forever the global map campaign ai is incredibly bad all the decisions it makes are seemingly completely random factions will declare wars on multiple neighbors at the same time willingly thrusting themselves into battles on multiple fronts everyone is constantly at war with everyone else for no rhyme or reason fiefs constantly rebel and ai lords end up fielding giant armies of poorly armed peasants because they have no concept of tactics or strategy it s honestly pathetic and laughable how a game in 2022 has ai this bad kingdom policies and policy votes are a great strategic idea but the ai just picks random policies with zero regard for whether it s a good or bad one and the votes for them are also completely random it seems existing just to simulate an illusion of something happening the economy is a mess it just doesn t work and makes no sense the passive income from towns villages and castles is barely enough to pay for a small sized garrison you can buy caravans and workshops but they take literal years to pay for themselves before you can start making a profit and you can make 100x as much money selling trash loot you vacuum up from defeated enemy parties after every battle pricing and upgrading costs make no sense endgame units wear equipment that can cost around 100 000 500 000 gold but you only spend 500 gold to promote them to that tier there s no reason to invest in your towns and castles when you can forge a bunch of swords and sell them for millions of gold until you re rich enough to not care that you lose 10k gold per day because you have millions in the bank the new noble recruits that can upgrade into the top tier units for each faction are a great idea but they make a lot of other faction troops obsolete because the player can easily pick and choose the best units for every troop type the enemy lords will run to the ends of the earth and gather huge armies of peasant recruits from every faction regardless of their culture then march their worthless peasants into war again and again ad infinitum because faction warfare has no meaningful resolution if you reach lategame endgame and become a king you will have to deal with constant meaningless war declarations from your neighbors who will attack you despite having no hope of beating your armies and constantly burn down your villages and send thousand of people to their deaths for no reason the only way to avoid it is to keep hundreds of noble in prison forever or execute everyone
