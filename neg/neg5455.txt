2015 this review is a statement against recent total war titles marketing scheme this recommendation will stay negative unless creative assembly and sega demonstrate to total war fans that future total war games will not be plagued by abusive and overpriced downloadable content as is the viking forefathers culture pack and the longbeards culture pack in attila same with culture dlcs in this game we have to pay to unlock an excisting file sega and creative assembly show some respect to total war fans we have paid for a complete game could you do us the honor of delivering one about the game all i wanted was a new rome 1 with better grafics but i got a rome 2 which lost its soul of rome total war i am missing the micormanagement of evolving my cities getting in conflict with my neighbours and inventing new technologies to improve my armies rome ii is much more easier than rome i because some features are missing e g to get in contact with other civilizations i just have to see their borders or an unit of them in rome i you had to send diplomats the grafics are okay without impressing me very much i am able to play rome ii with extrem settings but the battles are not very immersive the new feature the unit camera in battles is nice to have but absolutly unneccessary like in any other total war the ai is not the best ca improved it but all in all the ai is not a tactical genious in battles they try to flank you with riders but if you handle them you win without mods the ai spams tons of agents that is just annoying i enjoyed the game really i like the ancient setting very much that s the reason i played this game but i do not recommend to buy this game especially outside any sale because without the expensive dlc it s unfinished you are able to double its content by buying dlc so you pay twice as much for a complete game that s not fair
