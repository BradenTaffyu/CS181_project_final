2016 was pretty decent until i got the notorious invalid data message and now i am basically doomed to a softban for having done nothing wrong great anti cheat guys so good that it even gets those pesky players who don t cheat update i have recently been cleared of this anti cheating flag and can resume playing the game however the story is not the same for everyone and i have since lost interest in the game due to being afraid to play at all if it would result in a soft ban barring me from the part of the game i enjoy most the base game is fantastic with a few balance issues and optimization issues that i would normally recommend to people however there is a lingering fear that should you continue playing this game online that you will someday be flagged or worse soft banned while playing legitimately and until that is no longer an issue i will keep this a negative review
