2023 product refunded early access review i only played a very short time however i will say i had no tech issues running the game on an rtx 3090 only played single player and the improvements to the game that i noticed over ase are all good i like the graphics the animations the lighting charactor models and so on however the reason i stopped playing was because i decided to get a refund on the game once i found out the situation with nitrado and their exclusive rights deal for hosting servers i realized me and my friends who have always played together on a private server would have to purchase a server from nitrado i knew we wouldn t be able to play so i bailed while a refund was still possible nitrado spellcheck can charge literally anything they want with no competition they can charge you one thing now then next week raise the price if they choose a lack of competing options in server hosting is a bad thing for everyone so i think i will stick to ase edit after the recent update removing the drm lockout of drdicated servers and thus allowing dedicated private servers now i decided to rebuy and give it another shot i ll play a bit more and update the review accordingly later
