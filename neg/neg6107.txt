2022 i ve seen a lot of people complain about aoe iv about all sorts of things up to this day i ve had many complaints of my own but i ve never really cared to write something about it but damn am i mad with the lack of a reconnect option i spent 40 minutes in a team game was finally winning was finally having a fun game then it simply crashed i went right back to the game less than 10 seconds after crashing for no apparent reason no option to reconnect what a joke most expensive game i ve ever purchased and it s crap f this so until they care about fixing the basics before adding dlcs do not waste your money
