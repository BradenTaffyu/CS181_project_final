2018 it is very sad but i simply cannot recommend this game with the 2 2 update despite all of the huff and puff about getting rid of the planet tile system with this update it s still actually there it s just broken up and scattered all over the interface buried in districts and building slots and with the old tile blockers now hiding in another sub menu what is completely ridiculous is that you effectively require a working memory of the previous tile system to be able to understand what the new planet interface is trying to communicate it is a clumsy and ugly compromise to shoehorn in the new resources necessary for the corporation expansion to play the way they want so what was once a fairly elegant metaphor and a nice way to encapsulate production buildings world size type climate and demographics all in one functional planet visual is now gone i m also not really terribly happy with the space capitalist route the game is taking having it as an optional way to play as a megacorp is fine in principle but now the entire game has been geared to this new corporate approach it seems that my civilisation of technologically ascendent anarcho syndicalists crave nothing more than holo entertainment complexes and hyper malls i absolutely preferred the previous high level abstraction of energy minerals and food and loved the focus on scientific advancement which i note has now all been shuffled under the heading of research in the interface many of the research options have been re written or entirely replaced to reflect the consumer capitalist approach the hard science aspects of the game seem to have been de emphasised and once evocative and easy to understand descriptions and effects have been superceded by what read like loot descriptions from a highly itemised rpg the new resource types and tedious production loops such as this building converts minerals to consumer goods which this other building then converts back to research and all other permutations thereof inspire only exasperation and mild annoyance again it seems like elegant abstraction has given way to needlessly fiddly over complication the 2 2 update mistakes complexity for depth and it does so to the utter detriment of the game whilst further hobbling it with some of the most dreadful ui design choices since lotus notes
