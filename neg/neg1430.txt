2022 early access review it greatly saddens me to not recommend the game has incredible potential i have obviously dumped many an hour into this and i have 400 hours in warband prior to bannerlord i was so excited when the game was finally released in 2020 it is now 2022 and the game is still very much early access the progression that has been made towards making it a polished finished product is paltry and insulting considering the massive influx of cash flow they received once it was released in 2020 what are you doing devs mr make money posted a review on april 24th 2022 that hit the nail on the head refer to that post for what is left out i have no hopes of this game having the content that was both advertised and expected to be present within the next additional two years as it has been such a disappointing two since release is it still really fun to play not for me anymore but obviously i dumped 600 hours into it is it worth 49 99 two years after release absolutely not if you buy it for 49 99 and play it will you be happy maybe especially if you did not play warband or track the release of this game am i disgruntled yes what do i want this post to accomplish let the devs know i m disgruntled and that i want both a finished product after two years and to return to a gruntled status will it change anything probably not stay gruntled my friends
