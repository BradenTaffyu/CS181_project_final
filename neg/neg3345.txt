2016 tl dr i ve spent 500 hours in hoi iv probably will spend more and it s second game where i got all achievements game indeed is fun and mp friendly 1 mp session usually lasts 2 6 hours depends on starting date people you play with and in most parties is fun but overall hearts of iron iv is a complete mess sp is ahistorical surreal ww2 on lsd japan fighting for every inch of vaterland while germans scrambled to africa and asia taking back lost colonies while mp public games are not far from sp in case of madness but good thing is that if you ll find good community you ll enjoy this game singleplayer not a challenge at all ai is braindead you can do whatever you want and ai will respond to this in best case by doing nothing in worst ai will do absolutly dilusional counter that s it sp is not interesting and not challenging multiplayer most fun part of the game have some big pros and cons it s enjoyement really dependable on community and house rules dlc check steamdb and you ll be surprised they ve already reserved 56 dlcs including 15 already released fifty six dlcs current game state and dlc count just don t correlate in my mind personal preferences i personally prefer plausible ww2 where people don t build spacemarines templates don t abuse game mechanics and don t do absolutely stupid things i ve found that 1939 start majors only common sense community where there s no need of book size house rules where allies are allies including soviet union yes in most game ussr players are ignoring allies or are ignored by allies and axis are axis and that s the place where i spent my 500 hours in game and probably will spend more surely it depends on communities and people you play with but most mp games are swarmed with cheesy tactics exploits meta and lack of common sense spacemarines templates fort spam build 2nd maginot anywhere in the world just in a year easy 1 submarine glitches whole fleet probably fixed by 1 2 patch dilusional minors half of world goes fascists cause focus tree bonus and etc it s most of mp games if listed above is not fun for you you still can find good community which match your taste game machanics i hope that this is first and last pdx experiment with game mechanics game is simplified to the level where it s absurdly becomes complex and not because there s lot of things to watch to do or to babysit no game lacks feedback to the player you just don t understand what s going on game gives you so little information air warfare air warfare is best example all you know is that there is some air struggle and more planes you build more likely you ll win air bonus you don t know what enemy planes you encounter you don t what s happening right now seconds before you had air supperiority and area is green then bam enemy teleported his whole air fleet to the region and are is red that s it bombing campaigns are blackboxes you re bombing something but don t have direct control on what you re bombing all you know that n number of your strategic bombers do some stuff maybe they re bombing reichstag maybe forts or maybe it s just village road somwhere 500 miles away from front line you don t know and will not know it s a mystery another good example are battlereports they re gone somwhere near el alamain was a huge battle where you managed to encirle and destroy three italian divisions no one cares you were invaded by 30 german army group cause your royal navy was bugged by german sub no one cares hamburg was captured by british paras no one cares you have constantly monitor all your territory cause one time you can suddenly find out that france was liberated and americans are marching on berlin 3d 3d is everywhere map is looking really nice and beautiful but again not informative at all it s really hard to say if there s a forest or a huge mountain or even a swamp i understand that game designers idea was to show everything on the map where there will be no need in reports or schematic map it s doubtedly ok if you control some small scale warfare here are fighters flying here tiny soldiers shooting at eachother backed up by cas but when it s about total war which ww2 was it s a mess on the map there s no schematic map if you ll turn off all 3d models and leave only nato counters you ll end up with plain map without rivers fortifications and counters which lack any info like their heading attacking direction their position on the map yes they are just floating above 3d model even you ll turn off 3d models focus trees i liked scripted system in hoi iii you was sure that everytime you ll play you ll get your ww2 with plausible shifts and if those plausible shifts happen mostly they are forced by you player here s everytime is something new and most of the time this new is absolutely surreal to keep ww2 going as intended you have to play germany otherwise be ready to see something like this worst scenario berlin is surrounded by allies but hitler is sure that things are going well and it s time declare war on denmark norway not so bad scenario germans managed to occupy europe but really scarred to attack soviet union funnies part is that soviet union has troops concentrained on romanian border and germans will be staring for ages into those wide distances looking for sneaky russkies who re definetly trying to cheat arians by not guarding their border modified not so bad scenario aka lunatic hitler germans are staring on soviet border while sneaky brits liberating france closer they are to the berlin more confident in victory hitler is by moving more and more troops to the soviet border battleplans on my opinion it s worst and not working as intended forced feature if you re like me you probably expected from battleplans something like drawing plans in hoi 3 but with ability to attach units to them and execute panzerkorps i iv from both directions attack here infantry encirles remaining troops here panzers advance further paras drop here ohoh here s retreat line in case of here s plan b this army goes here 7th army goes there marines invade on d 30 with heavy air support perfect that s my version of barbarossa no draw a line then draw an arrow on enemy s capital that s your battleplan that s how it works mannstein that s how it should be done zhukov that s how real invasions were planned eisenhower oob there is no oob you just assign your swarm blob to the tribe chief called in game as marshal with mistyrious ability to mentally command every unit in any spot on the globe without any issue or delay and that s your oob enjoy it or you can make a little harder separate your tank to the general with panzer trait oob ends here minorsminors and developers love to the them is just beyond my imagination shortly any minor including luxemburg and bhutan can be on same or few techs behind most of major s and yes there s no issue for them to develope nukes it was such an easy task those days that even bhutan can make it
