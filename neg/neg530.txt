2023 i have been long time enthusiast of project moon games my journey began when they released their first game lobotomy cooperation the combination of well developed characters brilliant storytelling and charming illustrations instantly caught my eyes i never imagined myself spending hundreds of hours playing a single video game one aspect that stood out was the depth and humanism embedded in their narratives even within the dystopian world of the city the story of this game limbus company not only met but exceeded my expectation i enjoyed playing it for thousands of hours on my phone however my enthusiasm has been dampened recently due to the termination of one of their illustrators the director s decision to dismiss her based on a retweet from a private account that no longer exists the account got deleted several years ago seems both disappointing and unjust the retweet in question was in support of peaceful feminist protests which makes the dismissal appear even more unjust this sudden termination conveyed over a late night phone call struck me as inappropriate and unprofessional considering the crucial role the illustrator played in bringing the cut scenes to life and enhancing the overall narrative the decision was surprising furthermore the fact that the announcement of the dismissal was only made in korean excluding non korean speakers adds to the sense of unfairness and lack of transparency as a devoted fan of project moon i find myself contemplating my continued support for the company the plan to replace all the cut scenes starting in the canto 5 raises concerns about potential alterations to the story and impacts my enthusiasm for the game additionally the incident has raised doubts about the company s treatment of its employees making it difficult to see why anyone would want to work for a company that seems to dismiss employees on unreasonable grounds in conclusion while my admiration for project moon s past works remains the recent events have cast a shadow of doubt over their integrity and treatment of their team members i hope the company takes these concerns seriously and considers addressing them to retain the trust and support of their devoted fans
