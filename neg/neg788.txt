2016 if you want to shoot stuff fallout 4 is great if you want diverse quests and multiple solutions to problems then skip it bethesda spread themselves too thin adding new features and mechanics rather than making diverse quests that aren t just the same linear kill everything edit for people calling me out in the comments for apparently comparing fallout 4 to the witcher i m not it wouldn t be fair witcher is a story driven rpg fallout is a supposedly open ended explore the world type rpg my short review is based on my experience of fallout 4 and that of previous installments fallout 4 is a much more linear kill everything game than previous games try and prove me otherwise it lacks the diverse quests and locales of previous games sure bethesda haven t been the best at writing and yes i am going to compare this to the witcher now because it s constructive criticism cd projekt red know how to pace a plot and write interesting quests and characters fallout 4 doesn t get a bye ball just because it s bethesda it s plot was a joke and very poorly paced i never felt a connection to my son in it compared to fallout new vegas where the plot is about revenge i felt more personally involved in it even in fallout 3 your dad is at least characterised and you get pulled into project purity because it s his and your mother s dream project and is good for the wasteland now to compare it to witcher 3 since a load of you think i did in my original post witcher 3 introduces ciri and yennefer and immediately characterises them even for people who haven t read the books the games are based on throughout the game you see flashbacks of ciri building her character and that of the game s overall plot in fallout 4 you get a child whom you have no real connection to other than being told he s your son hell most of the quests in the witcher also end up in fights but the difference is they aren t just faceless raiders each enemy is characterised bandits deserters soldiers witch hunters wild hunt warriors etc anyway what s the problem with comparing one game to another if it s constructive you can all see i have 100 hours in fallout 4 this is an honest full review of what i played and i was disappointed just because i prefer witcher 3 over it doesn t mean i m not entitled to an opinion on it different strokes for different folks i guess
