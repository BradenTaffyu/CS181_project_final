2015 if you like straightforward action shooter games then this is the game for you don t even bother reading the rest the gunplay is amazing for other poor souls like myself who enjoy a good story with multiple endings read on the first fallout game i ever played was fallout new vegas it blew my mind there were endless possibilities in the vanilla game alone should i be a nerd who talks his way out of everything a mercenary who works for the highest bidder a psycopath who enjoyed killing people for his own pleasure what i m trying to say here is that unlike new vegas fallout 4 tells you from the start who you should be you are a concerned father mother looking for their son and after finishing the game once i have no motivation to replay it the storyline is very predictable and your choice of faction in the end game hardly affects the commonwealth at all you ll just be reminded by some npc s of how great you are for leading them to victory yeah sure np mate character creation is all about aesthetics now since they removed the skill system in fallout 4 there are only a few viable builds because every mission involves violence yep there s no way of talking your way out of anything you just get some bonus xp if you choose to go the charisma path sadly there s not much replayability in fallout 4 at its current status maybe some mods later on will improve this but i am reviewing the vanilla game i downvote this with a heavy heart despite all of the hype fallout 4 has not impressed me as a game that is worthy enough to be in this series
