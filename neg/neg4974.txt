2021 upon release i would have recommended this game i did a review out there on the web and scored it an 8 10 it boasted a gorgeous campaign map the best diplomacy in any total war game and beautifully rendered characters and soldiers on the battlefield there was definitely potential for three kingdoms to become a great game despite this the game had some pretty glaring problems and was missing a metric ton of content but at the time i thought two things first that patches would fix the bugs and secondly that the missing content was obviously meant to be filled with dlc down the line a shady anti consumer business practice but the modus operandi for ca sega and most other large publishers boy was i ever wrong ca had no vision for what this game was to become or how to cohesively get to a final product dlcs were half baked consistently adding more bugs and broken features to the game than worthwhile new content patches were just a band aid as while they fixed quite a few of the bugs subsequent dlcs reintroduced the exact same bugs it was mind boggling patches came further and further apart dlcs came less and less fleshed out silence from the developer became more and more commonplace to this day there is a ton of features and mechanics that are either bugged broken or just plain don t work for example gate passes meant to be static defensive structures controlling mountain passes they have been broken since their introduction the ai can literally walk right through them as if they don t even exist on the campaign map to this day nothing has been done about it records mode the so called historical mode was always an afterthought of the developer despite their promises at both pre release and release that it would get the same attention as the fantasy romance mode unfortunately they ceased support for records mode about a year after release after of course dragging their feet in whatever support they did give it after release not to mention that records mode in just romance mode light with the only difference being bodyguards for generals and some inconsequential unit stats debuffs there is no difference in historicity between historical and fantasy modes no changes to character back stories or ambitions not even a removal of fantasy units flamethrowers attack tigers etc from the historical mode so if you re a historical total war player dislike unnecessary fantasy elements or are a fan of the actual three kingdoms history you will be sorely disappointed i could go on and on about the shortcomings of the game but i will close with this while the base game had potential it was far from finished or polished what ca did was ruin the base game through their dlcs by introducing broken features and mechanics as well as a tropical storm worth of bugs bugs i might add that have yet to be fixed and probably never will be fixed add into the fact that ca said they would give continued support to this game including a planned northern expansion only to completely cancel development to make a new three kingdoms game what a total show listen when someone shows you who they really are they aren t lying ca and sega showed us who they really are and we need to pay attention i stopped supporting this game prior to the release of furious wild dlc and i am so glad i kept my money in my wallet i would beseech you to do the same and stay away from this game
