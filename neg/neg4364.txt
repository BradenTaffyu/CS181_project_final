2018 i can honestly say that i ve given this game a real chance i just can t recomend this game in its current state the only improvements the developers really made from the last game civ v are the districts and how wonders work are placed whereas every other annoying thing was left unchanged the diplomacy between other civs is awful take my deal or i hate you have the same government or i hate you taking back a city of yours that a civ conqured major warmongering penalty etc etc barbarians still leave other civs alone to focus manily on human players the computer civs will still beat you to building a wonder even if you re down to one turn 30 of the time the computer civs will still bypass great available land to plunk a city down right next to you in a so so spot the game still auto bounces you back and forth across the map when you have a large army the culture tourism vicotry condition is overly complicated with no real explanation on how it works found in the game the way builders are implimented and the fact that you can t build your own roads it s done automaticly through merchent trade routes unitl you get pretty far down the tech tree is a horrendous mechanic the technology tree is much shorter even on king difficulties i can get a science victory by the early 1900s the way trade routes work now makes money completely irrelevant by 1 3 through any playthrough on any difficulty i m making so much money i never need to worry about it half of the civs have rng style perks i e bonus for jungle tiles bonus for costal bonus for pastures etc and if you don t start by your civs inparticular bonus you re screwed most of the civs bonuses are basically useless and don t help you reach one of the victory conditions the civs art style makes the game look like it was designed for 10 year olds and i m sure a couple more things i can t think of atm all in all do not buy this game at full price in fact i wouldn t buy this for more than 75 off if you ve read this and you re still interested i would wait until the two or three expansions that you know are coming and the dozen or so dlc packs are released and buy them all together in a large package for a sizable discount edited for spelling
