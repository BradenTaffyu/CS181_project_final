2016 i just got the game so i don t have too much time into it yet but i do want to express something important first i love the dark souls games i feel they surpass most games in sheer artistic value and atmosphere and their ability to draw you into the game and make you care for it the art design guys should all get medals and baubles and goodly things i specifically wanted to give a not recommended vote here as a gesture and demonstration because i think for an established franchise like this that makes very good money it s sheer laziness and unacceptable to refuse to make a decent pc port with 2016 frame rates and not forcing me to find a mod somewhere and use some crazy key binding so i can do some basic moves like jump attack or kick with my keyboard and mouse it s not like you haven t seen the comments everywhere since dark souls 1 come on don t be cheap don t be lazy make it right be a stand up game developer guy say hey we sell a lot of these games on steam for the pc so let s do it right yes many play games with controllers even on the pc but many don t so let s give people an actual choice if some kid somewhere can make a mod to make this work so can you or better yet pay the guy some money and buy his programming wizardry from him and put it in your game if you can t figure it out now here s what i mean by lazy the game recognizes i m playing with a keyboard because that s what i have in my settings so i m walking around through the intro where they have signs on the ground that tell you what buttons do what and it s press triangle press left bumper press o seriously it s that hard to change the message so it matches the actual device the game knows i m using so it can give me the correct keys heck i can do that for you and the only programming i took was some basic and pascal in college give me 10 hours and a box of twinkies and a connection to the net and i guarantee i can fix that for you in conclusion great game and i will love it it s successful and it deserves to be but be a standup developer guy take a bit of that money and make the game right for all the devices thank you but yes people should still buy it
