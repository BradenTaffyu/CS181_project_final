2016 i give this thumbs down because i disagree with paradox policy of releasing unfinished games content missing bugs stability problems and lack of polishing in stellaris this becomes abundantly clear when you reach latter mid game to make this clear i do like dlcs when they are done right example of a good game release a finished game that can stand on its own without months of hotfixing after this release dlc every 6 months or so with content worth 20e i really dislike the eu4 ck2 model
