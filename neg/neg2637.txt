2022 fun game only have about 3000 games played which isn t a lot compared to most who have been playing since the beginning i don t really see a pay to win issue tho like many have said why the low review the long time players are 0 help to new players and they expect you to be an expert right away with little to no patience the community is more aggressive towards new players than any other game i have ever played and i ve played online games since ultima online the game makers need to crack down on these abusive players or they wont have a game left soon
