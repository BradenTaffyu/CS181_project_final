i love the setting and the concept of being a rogue trader but the mechanics in this game need work my major gripe is the leveling this is the first game i played where i dislike leveling i do not look forward to it at all it s a bloody chore the ui needs to be better to make it easier to figure out what synergizes with what also where are the titles for each individual group of abilities there is only a border it took me a while to know what they meant but it just builds onto the bad impression of leveling in this game also filtering the abilities are unhelpful i find myself better off reading every single ability before making a choice that s like 20 minutes of gameplay just reading abilities what s with the formulas being in the ability description for some abilities i only keep up with this game because of the setting but work needs to be done on making this leveling fun as of right now i don t think i will purchase another owlcat game get it if you really want to play as a rogue trader otherwise go for a crpg with a less convoluted leveling system
