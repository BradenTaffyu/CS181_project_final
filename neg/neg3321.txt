2017 this could have been a brilliant game the politics industry resources and research are all handed really well although some of the larger minor states should really be more developed than pre first world war yes it has a steep learning curve and for some of the major countries the politics can be a little restrictive but that doesn t stop it being a bad game the problem really starts with the number of units that seem to miraculously appear when war starts and how army sizes are disproportionate in size to both the historical reality and as to whether it you as the player controlling that country or the ai as an example after the fall of france the free french army was created this initially consisted of one light division based in north africa and by 1944 had increased to four divisons spread across the west european and italian fronts in the game within days of france falling the free french have a larger army in north africa than either the british or the italians and within months are invading italy with armies totalling 30 40 divisions the same can be true of both the united states and the uk unless you are playing as one of those nationalities and then it is much harder to recruit this isn t a gripe about the strength of th allies as i played as the uk very successfully but with a much smaller but more realistically sized army than the ai gets although i had to micro manage every battle which brings me to my next gripe the ai during combat why don t the armies ever do what you ve asked them to do unless you micro manage why if you are allowed to move troops through a neighbouring country under a troop movement treaty are you then unable to attack from those countries napoleon used to do it even if he didn t have a treaty instead when you try to move your troops into enemy territory to enable a flank or encirclement they don t take the direct route but instead march back to your country and the then try and move through the front line where you are successfully pinning your enemies forces ready for the manouevre that is never going to happen by which time the enemy forces have miraculously tripled in number i have been playing wargames with miniatures and board games and then on computers for almost 50 years and i have to say that the ai and unit spawning breaks this game more than nearly every other game i have played i haven t even mentioned the disappearing armies i played as a facist holland joined the axis kept my army in reserve and only commited my airforce during the attack on belgium and france after the fall of france i was given all the territory in belgium and france but my army had disappeared so i had no troops to defend my coast from the immediate invasion by 30 divisions from the uk just one of a number of bugs i have come across disappointed to have spent so much time learning to play a game that is broken and doesn t look like being fixed
