2023 early access review well after almost 130 hours played i think i can tell my opinion about this game so don t get me wrong i absolutely love it i love ark and i wouldn t have bought it again if i didn t but i just can t recommend it in its current state it s just bad from the optimization which is absolutely garbage trust me this has to be the most unoptimized game in the history of unoptimized games even with a decent pc you still barely hit 60 70 fps and if you are in a place with a lot of vegetation or a lot of creatures around you attacking and stuff like that the game drops to 30 40 fps or in the most extreme cases you have a fps drop to 15 20 fps to all the bugs that it has old same bugs from the original game and new ones and constant crashes which i don t understand how it is not an urgent matter for the devs to fix you trying to do a cave killing tons of creatures attacking you crash you try to fly across the map on your dino crash you literally just stay in one place breathing crash it s mostly random sometimes you can go hours or not at all without a crash or you can crash 5 times in a row trying to do something i once had the game paused watching a video on yt and my game just crashed your dinos ascend to heaven or they mesh through the ground many times i found my creatures falling through the ground in my base or after i died in a cave and went back i found them outside the map in the void the game auto save option doesn t work in single player so combine that with the random crashes if you forget to manual save from time to time and your game crashes you lose your progress for whatever amount of time since you last saved at the moment of writing this the ascension seems bugged too you don t get your beta alpha implant or the achievements for defeating the boss on beta alpha difficulty
