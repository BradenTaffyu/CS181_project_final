2019 early access review i absolutely loved a16 and spent countless hours solo and with a group of friends with this fantastic survival game then a17 came along and fixed absolutely every single thing i loved about the previous iteration stealth town generation zombie drops mining xp why why why have the devs never heard of if it s not broken don t fix it so now i have rolled back to a16 with no intention of following further updates such a shame
