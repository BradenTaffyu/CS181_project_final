2017 the base game is incomplete the dlc has essential features that should have been included in the base game these features were held back and put behind paywalls so you d be more willing pay the full price over 200 dollars after having already sunk money into the game furthermore they include aspects of the expansions into the base game in free patches not out of generosity but to make it uplayable without shelling out the extra 20 dollars want to play anything outside of western europe without the common sense dlc good luck this is a fun game but nothing justifies charging as much as they do they ve decided it doesn t matter if high prices put off new players so long as they can exploit the loyalty of their devoted fanbase i don t like that the policy needs to change
