2018 early access review bottom line this is just another ea game with potential that is now in development hell i imagine it s because you just can t polish manure now this is not to say that i don t think the game is fun if quite repetitive or that the dev team doesn t care about it given how much heat their fanbase gives them about their snail slow development i m surprised they re even still keeping up appearances i do want to say though that at this point i m almost positive it s mostly for show the alternative is that they ve been banging their heads against the same wall trying to solve the same problems for years that would honestly be sadder than if they re just trying to keep up the appearance of active development to lure in new buyers it goes back to my earlier metaphor about things that can t be polished the game is run on a home built engine that is obviously ill equipped to handle the team s ambitions this is a very common problem for video games actually it s obviously not a problem this team is willing to face head on the fact that they re unwilling to make sacrifices and more importantly be transparent about their priorities and what features are and aren t in active development is why you should not buy this game tl dr their lack of progress on npcs is pretty much the sole reason for this thumbs down
