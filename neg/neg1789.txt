2017 an excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes gaijin s lust and greed for has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest after tier two it s like running into a brickwall to progress at this point spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes tanks sanely since patch 1 37 in dec 2013 gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players since then everything has increased in price and reward amounts have dropped tanks aircrafts modifications and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up while rp points silver lions and crew points are capped and less abundant balance is utter crap too a 5 0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6 3 post war jet fighter there are numerous planes under and over tiered with discrepancies in battle rating the game is in a terrible state at the moment and i don t see gaijin turning anything around anytime soon the whopping drop in playerbase over the last year or even months says a lot
