2018 here is what i think after 100 hours played first of all do not buy this game unless you have a processor that has a high clock speed it doesnt matter how many cores you have most of the processes in this game can only be done on one core meaning you get inevitable late game lag unless you have a really high clock speed sadly that late game lag makes the game pretty much incompletable i have to say i like this game but am really annoyed with paradox this game was ridiculously far away from finished on release but as always these days its an attitude of throw the game out and fix it over the next 2 years further to play the full game you have to buy the dlc and paradox games really milk there customers with this disgusting sales tactic buying the dlc available today would take you well over 100 130 unlike ck2 the diplomacy on this game is pretty bad trade is pretty pointless and to be honest although i really like the idea of the game it just isnt quite enough in my opinion all you are really doing is inceasing the number of planets buildings level of buildings space stations it becomes a bit of a grind i want to like it but to be honest i do not recommend buying this game for the above reasons about gameplay but also this game becomes unplayable unless you have a high single core clock speed what is the point of creating a game that most people and i do mean most people cannot complete sort it out paradox because this game could have been really really good
