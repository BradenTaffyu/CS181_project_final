2018 early access review they really this one up i wanted to like a17 but in its current state it sucks over a year for this update is a joke why pros they made over 125 new locations for us to die inside of the added challenge this update brings is nice for the hardcore fanscons bleeding fixed instead of using only zombies we now have annoying flying vultures inside every poi just to make you bleed with every hit fixed even stuff you would notice 1min after playing is broken for example when using any tool the character keeps hitting 1 2 times after releasing the button vehicles are so slow they are pointless game would probably crash if they were any faster zombie animations are still not smooth fixed in fact nothing is smooth 100fps and looking at ground or anything while moving makes me want to puke the new hd textures are still worse than minecraft they are only there to make the game run worse they also make me want to puke the new tool gun dyes they really went all in on this one they just changed the color of the whole item because who doesnt want to go around with a annoying bright green bow 0 effort was put into this feature destiny 2 4k maxed settings runs better than this garbage 1080p low the most fun i had with this update so far was writing this review patch notes say there is new weapons but not a single weapon was added after all the devs don t owe us anything it s their game and they can ruin it like they did if you want an early access game that makes decent progress within reasonable timeframe don t buy this i will try to keep this updated if they fix stuff
