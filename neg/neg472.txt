2020 one wasteland update means one less wastelander for me everything is a bullet sponge just one ghoul nearby the start location takes 5 headshots at point blank with an appropriate level weapon what s the point of leveling up now level scaling has ruined it for me i tend to level up a few levels above enemies in a given area then explore it to my heart s content i m truly saddened i was loving the game the atmosphere and the community was surprisingly the best i ve experienced in any game that contains a pvp element it s a shame and as of right now have cancelled my fallout 1st subscription if level scaling is removed or made optional i ll be back but as of now i can t recommend
