2018 it was an okay game back in 2013 and 2014 though attilla was a better game to be honest but charging a full 54 price plus 18 euros for expansions 5 years later is just a total ripoff with their new policy of asking high prices for their newly discovered love for rome 2 i would not recommend to get this game until they fix the prices and their attitude towards the rome 2 community if you want a better game with more love and care then go buy the total war 2 games you will get way more bang for your bucks there and alot more love towards the community
