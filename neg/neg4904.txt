2019 i purchased this game when it came out since ca finally focused their attention at upgrading the campaign and diplomacy a i their worked on the subject seemed to pay of and generally while the a i still get massive cheats and plays by different rules it seems like they did manage to improve however the game setting units variety only two player multiplayer campaign and so many other issues are left behind so ca did one step forward and a few steps back yet still took a full price on this game new aspects that ca where hyping about like the character of this world are empty and unrelatable and there isn t any word about future fixes for that issue they got screens in game with massive data that is basically useless and you can go through a campaign without opening those screens but the real reason i am bothering to post this review is because yet again i find myself disappointed by ca their community managers actions is disgusting to say the least their censorship of modder s work is unethical and their support of a game that was sold at full price but is very light on content is a disgrace and now i see people rushing to post positive reviews flaming others that have legit concerns about the game calling them by names despite of steam guidelines well i have no choice but to right an honest review to make sure those people don t get away with their nasty immoral behavior
