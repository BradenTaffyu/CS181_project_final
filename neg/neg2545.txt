2020 i ve put a lot of hours into this game it was fun for a while but the constant bugs finally got to me and i stopped playing ew has had plenty of time to address the massive amount of bugs that have plagued this game for years and they have even acknowledged that the game is broken yet they churn out dlc and introduce new bugs instead of fixing anything if you re thinking about getting this know that you ll have to spend money on plenty of dlc to make it a full game and even then you ll have plenty of bugs to deal with i would recommend waiting until hunting simulator 2 comes out this year and see how that is first
