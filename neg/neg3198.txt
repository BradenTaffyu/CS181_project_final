2019 i liked this game sea views booming gunfire thousands tons of heavy metall and all this kind of naval warfare stuff didn t pay much respects to these leveling tree and ranking metrics though but anyways it was a nice game not to mention the lack of real rivals in the store well the last updates were awful and i know what i m talking about i ve linked my wg account to the steam client to avoid further using different clients on my pc and it works pretty fine allowing me and my whole cbt experience play with steam autoupdating lets start from the scratch you have the choice of 4 types of ships beginning the game from simplest cruiser in fact something like corvette or frigate suits it better eventually it doesn t take long to make your way up to level iv where you can taste all the classes equally carriers too each ship class can be enjoying really though i m talking only referring to a old type of carriers new one is confusing out of elementary logic and common sense getting back to ship classes you may be attracted by fast and furious destroyers multipurpose and pretty flexible cruisers also wildly different from ship to ship or perhaps you want to handle battleship s big guns it is completely free choice with an impact on gameplay in general and in battle teamplay in particular taking in account the naval history of the game period carriers played one of the most important roles in battles of sorts well important enough to replace battleships and battlecruisers in most of the ship design campaings it is expected though that this class gameplay should be different from other ship classes it s ok it has it s own historical reasons after all there are variety of maps sorted by ship levels and sometimes by play modes some of the maps also includes dynamic weather in fact it s only storm and its only purpose is to reduce visibility either by squinting on poor graphics or lowering your detection range no dozen meters waves or howling wind no in game contents for v0 8 does not such pay to win thing from world of tanks and world of warplanes as golden shots it does have the gold painting and golden consumebles though there are also a few premium ships available for real in game or through the site nothing unsual the thing game client does not include is the huge warning billboard at the entrance with simple logtrace of all balancing changes made to the game with this one you won t be fooled by content manager s empty promises on each upgrade the reason is most of the changes contradicted themselves balance changes in particular and talking about v0 8 update these contradictions reached their peak not to mention actively moderated official forum with tons of minuses to the administration posts anyway and selectively ignored awkward questions to the developers why not just wave off and find a game better the game was really good at the beginning when i came here at cbt i thought wow it s exactly the thing i ve expected and the only thing was insufficient amount of ships not some awkward flying admiral game mechanics or soup with torpedoes in the sea but only amount of different type of ships destroyers cruisers etc and some more nations e g british naval forces which are still not even closely full but yeah here are we go with dozens of ussr france or german battleships never even planned further then conceptual design ok for example british destroyers were added to the game later in the 2018 about 3 years after cbt with nearly full american and japaneese fleets and the carriers of the royal navy are still waiting for their chance it s quite funny as one of the main official reasons given was insufficient amount of carriers in game well they almost fixed the issue their own way making their gameplay so poor and stupid that no one would like to play it for long almost there wg almost there in other words literally removing these ubnormal solutions with all the variety of ships in place would make the game worth 9 10 points score but here we are and i m leaving the game as rememberance of nice try and unfortunately try only
