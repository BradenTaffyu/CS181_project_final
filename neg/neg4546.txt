2017 it took several months but the game still has a lot of bugs it looks like a beta at best not a production ready aaa title firaxis has many game designers and screenwriters which create new nations and skins but this game is not playable as civ 5 i m talking about fair multiplayer game you cant play equitable match in vanilla civ6 you need to install third party mods that provide you better ui better balance fewer bugs for example for this 6 months hellblazer brings much more things features and bug fixes than whole firaxis dev team i do not literally understand what they really do i think hellblazer deserves my money i mean cost of the game more then firaxis
