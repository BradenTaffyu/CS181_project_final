2022 was actually really enjoying the game until the latest update with buggy textures that literally obstruct your screen when youre trying to aim went from 140fps to barely hitting 60 now aswell the game is extremely p2p sure you could play through the game without spending a penny if you dont mind playing 300 games to unlock a single vehicle constantly being outclassed by a player that just spent money to buy a premium vehicle overpowered decals that allow players that pay to hide their tanks with bush decals you can only buy with real money that give a massive advantage in realism mode dealing with buggy textures randomly that completely obstruct your view and get you killed random frame drops toxic teammates one sided matches getting killed the second you spawn on some maps playing what feels like the same 5 maps over and over again constantly getting pestered to buy premium one way or another when you login or try to use anything on the store terrible support if you have any account issues russia bias buggy hit registration a shot that scrapes the side of your tank can sometimes insta kill you and other times a clear side hit on a tank can ricochet from point blank range arcade mode is flawed with its planes feature you can spawn in and instantly jam your gun so guess what now you get to fly around for another 40 seconds without any weapons while you wait for the timer to finish so you can go back to your tankpositives cool tank graphics when you hit someone showing what happened to the shrapnel and the shell even thought half the time it isnt accurate to what actually happened planes feel pretty nicefinal note the game is fun for about aslong as you can tolerate mindless grinding with the same vehicles over and over again with no variationmaybe instead of players leaking classified tank documents they can leak how much money gajin is making from premium without actually improving their game lmao
