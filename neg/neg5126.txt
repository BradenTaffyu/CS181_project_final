2019 with the release of mortal empires i was lucky when i bought this from the get go but other than that it s inferior to the second game in every way there are obvious signs that this game was meant to be left behind with the release of the second game and serve as nothing more than a gigantic dlc gate for factions lords heroes and rosters aren t kept updated and balanced like they are in the second game you still have archaon the neverchosen in the first game even the simplest ui interface and other quality of life improvements haven t been updated to obviously better like in the second game overall performance issues crashing after mp battle was fixed on the second but not on the first game it s as if creative assembly is trying to keep the first game under a boot in hopes for people buying the second
