2018 so far this game has two modes for me absolutely amazing and utter disaster for the section of the game i found that approaches to quests and combat to be interested and quite varried i could fight or talk my way out of most encounters or approach a with a different tactic if i lost the first time most quests offered many different ways to complete their object for example the first major quest is escaping from the bad guys and i can think of at least 5 different ways to do so combat was similiar only in two or three fights did i have to start the fight over to change my positioning or spells equipment to beat the monster however this all changed when i got to the second area of the game so many times i have to restart fights to preposition characters or switch gear spells just so that i can beat the encounter many quests started having only one or two options many times being fight or pass the skill check which seems to stem from 1 talent regardless of which skill is being utilized most monsters hit for double the damage my characters do at the same level which wouldn t be much of an issue if they didn t already have more health armor magic armor and seemingly more action points than my own while i did enjoy the beginning of this game it quickly devolved into a gear level check that unless i constantly reoutfitted every character ever level or two at no small cost of gold and time and a hint of luck that vendors had what i needed being taken out of the immersion by having to exploit knowledge of fights that were coming up or reloading multiple times to reposition characters to fight the ambush and not have everyone crowd controlled on the first turn while it started very interesting and full of choice this game quickly fell into frustation of reloading and prepositioning for most fights that might have been difficult or facerolling over those that weren t add into the mix having to utilize specific methods of fighting or cheesing fights just got old quickly
