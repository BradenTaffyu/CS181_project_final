2022 early access review this is the epitome of what could have been in gaming you want a fps survival crafter shooter with rpg elements 7d2d has that as well as a super neat tower defense style gameplay with every 7 days a horde comes and you need to defend with the rpg elements you ve chosen which will dictate how you defend along with what you have built with the survival crafting aspect literally that all sounds amazing but its been in early access for almost a decade now with new alpha updates every few months alpha updates a decade later how is that possible with 12 million copies sold they clearly took the money and essentially ran leaving a skeleton crew to do bug fixes and add a new zombie or crafting options once a year to keep selling copies the game is still a buggy unoptimized mess with some of the worst combat and movement mechanics in any games ive ever seen the guns overall feel bad but nowhere near as bad as melee feels in this game holy smokes is melee in this game just god awful you can absolutely learn to use it and make it work but it is the most clunky awkward melee system i ve ever encountered movement it s somehow even worse than the combat melee systems in this game you are more or less a stick figure with legs that barely move you dont really bend at all when you jump you just kinda bounce upwards if you want to be able to have the bottom of your feet land on the platform while essentially standing straight up there s no mantling vaulting sliding etc it s an incredibly basic movement system and combat system for a game that has had this much time and money in it not to mention the vehicle movement in this game lol or bugs so many bugs so the question im sure you re asking is why a negative scathing review for a game i have 250 hours in for the same reason this has a very positive score even though everybody who plays this can more or less admit that these are problems the idea of the game is amazing and nobody else does it where else can you create and build a customized character with the rpg elements in this game to build a shelter and defend against a mass horde of zombies in an fps setting none and that sucks cause any decent dev team could in a year or two with generic unreal assets throw together a game with what this game offers but substantially better game mechanics and probably less buggy so this is a negative review because of squandered resources and little to no actual updates and real content being dropped in almost a decade
