2014 since patch 1 37 i can t recommend prior to 1 37 i put up with the following a toxic community that includes some of the most fanatically deceptive fanboys i ve ever encountered very heavy handed censorship of criticism on steam official forum bugs that don t get fixed highly suspect flight damage models particularly for soviet planes badly implemented game mechanics like ramming constant 1 shot kills if you don t pay to buff crews terrible ai crew performance even with maximum paid buffing and the list could go on developers put no emphasis on tactics or team play which lead to games where you had entire teams chasing a single plane just comical since the game has zero facility to allow for team work games are a total free for all after 1 37 all the above problems remain with more added game design punishes successful players tiny rewards and incentive to progress means an incredibly long grind we are talking years to reach jets high repair costs and high purchasing costs for planes with in game currency push players to pay to advance developers and english speaking forum helpers actively lie claiming 1 37 changes make grinding easier shorter developers ignore customer tester feedback games as short as 120 seconds thanks to base rushing newbies are now treated like fodder at the bottom of the pyramid with paying long term players able to pub stomp at whim tldr avoid patch 1 37 turned a fun shooter into a ponzi scheme its never been a good flight historical sim now its not even an enjoyable shooter for newbies the initial sandbox games can be deceptively balanced with a low grind then they get thrown to the wolves and introduced to a grind of epic proportions ignore those who say its not pay 2 win you either pay hundreds of dollars or suffer continual stomping developer response working as intended no refunds quit whining sucker
