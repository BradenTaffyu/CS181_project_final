2022 yeah i know its got great reviews but here is why i went thumbs down i own cms15 18 and now 21 18 was a decent upgrade with the addition of barns junkyards tire mount and balance shock separator cleaning kit welding machine and many different cars compared to 15 however 21 is not so much of an upgrade as it is just another coat of paint aside from the extra step of balancing the tires manually and being able to walk to each building i do not see anything new even the cars are the same cars from 15 18 unless you buy dlc s the car wash one click and done the wheel and headlights alignment a few clicks and done they cost nothing other than the time it takes to move the cars from building to building oh yeah thats just a click also why not drive the cars from shop to shop and why not drive to the tracks and barns and junkyards anyway if you are just a die hard fan then you wont be disappointed but for a loyal patron i expected more new stuff and this does not have it
