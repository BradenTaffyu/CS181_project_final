2017 i rarely post reviews but i view recent news as such a shame and injustice that i had to speak up up until the time of this review stellaris has been advertised as having 3 types of ftl travel warp wormhole and hyperlanes hyperlanes should be familiar if you have experienced most other 4x space strategy games such as sins of a solar empire at this time the development team has announced that an upcoming patch will be removing warp and wormholes a huge distinguishing feature of stellaris here forum paradoxplaza com is the official announcement and forum reactions why removing 2 3rds of the ftl is bad news false advertising they promoted the game with the promise of 3 types of ftl this was one of the things that intrigued me enough to buy it and i even pitched this to a friend as one of its selling points trust issues with such a massive core mechanic change this late into the core game not an optional expansion or mode the core game i can not trust this developer going forward the game is not marked early access on steam so the player should not have to fear that existing core systems will get changed or removed like it s still in beta reduction in scope and flexibility stellaris to me is as much a story generating toolbox as it is a game similar to another favorite game of mine rimworld i always saw stellaris as a dream game because its systems were uniquely suited to being both a simulator and a role playing experience no other game came close to offering this look at how perfect the star trek and star wars mods new horizons and a galaxy divided work within stellaris as it is and these two universes use two fundamentally different types of ftl star trek uses warp and star wars uses hyperspace which is closest to hyperlanes in stellaris the options were limitless and it seemed that the devs would only make the game bigger and better as time went on not smaller and worse maybe one could argue that different types of ftl is unbalanced because one is functionally better than the other fine then play with only one ftl type allowed to all factions at a time play a warp only game for star trek a hyperlanes only game for star wars and a wormhole only game for stargate or whatever this works for multiplayer balance as well make a match where everyone uses the same type of ftl and boom it s balanced even the messy systems become less messy if you are only playing with one ftl type at a time my point is leave all the tools on the table don t leave me with one tool to work with because i can t build as much with just one tool realism i understand the desire for galactic terrain like nebulae and whatnot i understand the desire for fleets of ships to make lines of battle and whatnot i also understand that in reality space is big and empty and 3 dimensional and you could fly around nebulae and attack other ships from any direction even in fiction in the wrath of khan it wasn t like khan had no choice but to go into the nebula he willingly pursued kirk into it of the plausible methods of distant space travel none relies on invisible naturally or precursor technology yuck space highways of travel but even if it were come on man it s space it s meant to be free the ultimate frontier not like being forced to drive on man made roads it s more like piloting on the wide free ocean many players see warfare as the weakest aspect of the game and it s a reasonable thing to try and improve but i cannot agree with how they choose to do this by making space warfare more like land warfare if land warfare was restricted to roads it s silly taking the easy way out sure they gave their argument in their announcement post keeping the other types of ftl would be messy the fact that their thread has 250 pages of people disagreeing at the time of this writing shows that people don t exactly concur hell even the messy solutions given in the original post sound far more interesting and fun than a restrictive hyperlane only playstyle like why not have the interdiction bubble cover all 3 types of ftl forcing warp civs to use hyperlanes within the bubble people aren t stupid especially people who play grand strategy games and i would give them the benefit of the doubt on being able to grasp new systems the devs could have come up with systems that build upon what they have in a fun way if they only tried instead of dismissing it outright people do like the game how it is and want more of it not less save massive changes for dumbed down sequels not mandatory updates choosing not to update isn t a real solution build upon what you have don t do things just because it makes your job easier if they couldn t find a balance with 3 ftl types i m sure modders could have but they have even taken that away from us they could even have kept all 3 ftl types but segregated them into different modes but instead it seems like the easiest path was taken to ease the burden on their shoulders make it more like every other 4x space strategy game out there because it s easier yes it s easier to handle things when you don t have to juggle rock paper and scissors but it s not nearly as fun when you have just rock favoritism i prefer warp if they announced that they were getting rid of every travel type but warp i admit i wouldn t be as peeved as i am right now but it would still be wrong and anger the wormhole and hyperlane players it would still be restricting i like the idea that i can freshen up the replay value by playing as wormhole next time or hyperlane or warp like it s a whole new game i can t help but think that the current development team prefers hyperlanes and using static defenses other playstyles be damned they try and rationalize and justify the removal of the other two ftl types by saying how they couldn t achieve the goals they want land style warfare and terrain in space and that the removal of features will bring more features but that s all it is rationalization and justification but hey you can build still play worm hole kinda extra long hyperlanes and practically play warp still if you increase the number of hyperlanes sure it s like if adobe s developers didn t use some features of photoshop so in the latest patch they stripped filters and tools because they didn t like them personally and didn t feel like keeping them updated customers that used those features would be rightfully livid slippery slope for many this isn t just one change it s writing on the wall raw gameplay over all else i don t see paradox s strength as being a traditional game developer i see it as being a role playing simulation sandbox developer that lets you play out what if scenarios like what if poland invaded germany first in hearts of iron this focus on dumbing down systems and on multiplayer balance is troubling because it feels like they are changing focus to the more casual to the e sports and multiplayer streaming crowd rather than on what many people bought the game for role playing their dream civilization in an open ended and flexible simulation it seems paradox is stepping on the toes of the latter to please the former and as a consumer i find broad changes like this without our input to be an uncaring and unfriendly act on their part it s like if you signed a marriage contract and then your spouse started changing for the worse and then started doing things without your input and stopped caring about how you feel they just do whatever they want because that s how they like it and it makes their lives easier but at least in that scenario you can get a divorce tl dr this is not the game i married
