2017 it is a good game but because of the dlc policy i just cant recommend it even major game mechanics are getting sold like major powers or other minor changes like promising your ally land if he joins your war if you see the game on a sale with all the dlc sure get it but you shouldnt even think about buying it for the regular price if you really want to enjoy the game because if you want to enjoy it with the dlc for the normal price you have to pay 100 200 euros
