2022 i played quite a bit of this game then stopped and said to myself well i ll wait until the pitt content comes out that way there ll be a whole bunch of new content when i come back and i think my time away broke me from the hold this game had on me because coming back just made me think wow this is terrible i can t believe i d developed stockholm syndrome for this game also that pitt content that got announced ages ago turns out it s crap too i played one of the missions and was faced with bullet sponge after bullet sponge i eventually just stopped trying to move around during a fight and just stood there soaking up damage because i had the stimpaks to survive it all for reference i did not do a lot of grinding in this game then the final boss literally stood in an open room and fired maybe six shots at me spending the rest of the time just standing there staring off into space as i dumped a nonstop stream of bullets into them for four minutes straight also the writing is some prime edgelord garbage when asked what he s going to do after the mission is over a character seriously says don t ask a shadow where it s going it slips into the night and comes out when it s needed holy moly that s bad i appreciate the years of effort put into this game to make up for the launch but at this point fallout 76 needs to be taken to the back and shot
