2022 this was a tough title to grade i ve played this game for a long time over the course of many dlcs and ultimately though well done is a game that is not fun where it counts the most as i began playing stellaris i tried to wrap my head around the scale scope and style of the game each new dlc seemed to add more elements and more material to play with expensive in totality but welcome as time has gone by however it has become clear that stellaris presents a scripted timeline of events wrapped around what is its worst trait warfare combat itself is fun although only the product of your production you cannot out play or out general an enemy entity or fleet you can only thrill to an automatic real time engagement very entertaining watching your custom ship designs fly around firing lasers and torpedoes that you researched and affixed to them love it but numbers trump numbers 4x strategy things to do are quite doable yet become unnecessarily complicated once your empire becomes a certain size to maintain efficiency you must add remove star systems to sectors and assign governors to them different sometimes appealing yet somehow impeding but getting back to combat the diplomatic system is complex complex to a fault to an aggravating extreme with various dlcs that add layers of politics to stellaris and that is really the true crux of my ultimate disappointment with this title the entire point to all this 4x timing is the galactic warfare the sophisticated layers of management diplomacy and politics though clever get in the way of that on top of scripted chronologically timed events that fly in the face of more randomized sandboxes all of these political mechanisms get in the way of the war of the fun as a huge player of the superb turn based warhammer 40k gladius it is driven home even more how much of a flaw in 4x design this approach is wielding firepower is too much work in stellaris which resultingly is not fun frustrating and disappointing but dissuading stellaris remains well done i want to like the title more i really do but i am participating in an arguably linear script with tightly regulated controls on the best part of strategy games the combat
