2016 i have a feeling my review about rome total war 2 not going to be popular i know total war games avoided by grand strategy game lovers as its focus was mainly allways the battlefield fight but as that is just only part of the game i cant avoid the critic about those in my review iam a hardcore strategy game player its my most played genre and i enjoy even bad strategy games if the mechanisms of the game ok its sad but i think this is the only negative review i ever wrote about any strategic game and its not easy to make me do so about a strategy game what i liked in this game well you know the battles are nice but we seen that allready in other total war games nothing else really pwhat i not liked store page says its a turn based strategy game well the onmap strategy options limited ill epxlain a bit more later missleading tutorial tutorial showed me how to build armory etc to improve the armor of my troops well then the game was total different it was built as main building on cities with iron resource i had no clue whats the problem why cant i build upgrade building in italia probably was changed later with dlc patch but really they should update tutorial then city building options too limited conquering a city not means population loss ok that sometimes ok but not even if city was under siege or encircled and captured years later after city ran out of food really useless money and unbalanced economy i not had ever money issues game is just not challenging at all economy wise for example in mediavel 2 which is i think the best total war game ever i never had enough money weird ai fleet movements they idle at the middle of nord atlantic ocean and complete faction elimination because of fleeing fleets just annoying ai takes like 5 10mins to finish turn even if i choise i dont want to see ai movement i bet ai shows slow movements for my cpu or i have no clue my pc is above recommended and still too much wait time in mid late game above option wouldnt be that annoying if you could do something else irl while ai moving but no ai just bombard you with the same diplomacy offers every 2nd turn so you just cant leave and return to play your turn when ai done no because ai diplomacy interrupts ai movements turn its like that in other games too like civ5 but ai turns fast there ai know if he can win a battle or not he dont even try to attack or it avoid battle if he cant i mean we talking about an era when army leading and strategy wasnt that great yet only for a few literated empire was it german gallic etc tribes fought even they were outnumbered and not tried strategic retreats it totally kills the feeling that i play a strategy game about a roman era unlike in medieval or rome1 in rome2 you can build units only for army you cant increase city defenses with additional units so its like a ping pong war sometimes enemy army avoid fight as ai calculate its own win chance and so just avoid battle even if they have more men for the battle so they choise another route and conquer your city leave it conquer other one while you reconquer its like a cat mouse chasing game my client states declare war on each other forcing me to either not join the defender losing defender as client state or joining on the side of the defender losing attacker as client state wtf iam not exactly sure i listed all my problems with the game i tend to give more chances for games played this a lot as i not wanted this game to ruin my avg but no i just cant recommend this game at all
