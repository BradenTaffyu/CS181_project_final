2022 it s been 6 months and the game still has the memory leak issue that occurs after an extended play sessionnot to mention that this is exclusive to the steam version as well as being absolutely cucked out of exclusive content like the deluxe coupe forza edition fh5 controller exclusive because you own the steam version this also comes with unique clothing items nothing to lose sleep over as a bonus if you are not in to painting your nails as there is a collaboration between opi and forza to which you get a ford gt with a fade pattern nothing special right wrong these cars are tagged as dlc meaning you can not trade them you can not buy them of the auction house without already owning them prior but you can sell them on the auction house for fellow owners to replace the ones they sold the game also has raytracing support in forzavista onlysome of the vehicle models are ripped from the previous games as their license plates still use fh3 fh4 s stylevehicle modifications have always been lacking even removing some isn t new like the 458 had a liberty walk kit back in horizon 3 but was removed most likely because of ferrari not liking modifications being made to their cars but removing previous wide body kits from cars such as the 95 rx 7 that is right in fh3 the rx 7 had the rocket bunny kit as a widebody option fh4 added the boss variant to the list now in fh5 no more rocket bunny but now we have the tcp magic time attack body kits though are very nice widebody kits it doesn t change the fact that we still have 2 options for that carin short if you still want this game either get it on xbox or buy it from the microsoft store or gamepass if you are one of them people
