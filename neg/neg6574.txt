2016 let me preface with thisi am a huge fan of dark souls and bloodborne i ve sunk well over 1k hours into each i have played the second ds and didn t like it big suprise and was looking forward to this one with optimisim and was hugely dissappointed dark souls 3 is unbalancedi feel as if i am playing an early build where tweaking and rebalancing is in its early stages keep in mindi have multiple max all stat all 99 characters i went to ng 9 and invested many hours into this game note i do not have very much pvp experience but i do have some i am mostly reffering to offline play in this review 1 poise is non existant and worthless poise was a major factor in combat in ds 1 it allowed you to take hits without being staggered if you had a high enough poise value this allowed you to effectively trade blows with mobs and players you could initiate an attack and not be staggered during the animation hyper armor is present in ds3 but it s situational at best this leads to stunlock gameplay the best ultimate only viable strategy for pve is to equip all light armor and a weapon with good range and wide sweeping attacks to stagger every enemy in the vacinity and stun lock all of them i e in the boreal valley i used all light armor and the wolf knight great sword to stagger ever enemy encounter before they staggered me and i got through the area unscathed however if i tried to use heavier armor and trade blows i would loose everytime so why bother using heavy armor at all this brings up two more issues sheilds being useless and enemy aggression overall combat pacing 2 shields sheilds have alway been a very usefull offensive and defensive item in previous souls games the ability to throw up a shield and block an attack was invaluable enemy s blows could bounce off your shield and staggr your opponent creating an opening for you depending on the sheild taking a blow would not consume much stamina however in ds3 i was onlyable to take 2 or 3 hits before my gaurd was broken on most normal sheilds thiswouldn t be a problem if the enemies werent so aggressive but more on thatlater the offensive side to sheilds in previous souls games in the parry riposte mechanic which also suffers in this game i mastered parrying in ds1 and as a result i could combat most enemies no problem however in this game the parrying is almost entirely luck based enemies swing so quickly parrying is very difficult to perform especially when enemies have multi hit combos combined with the lack of poise and the stamina cosumed in blocking screwing up a parry can cost you a fight great sheilds are also usless they too consume a great amount of stamina when blocking attacks leading to frequent guard breaks 3 enemy aggressionthis is more of a personal opinion but i feel it still holds weight enemies are much more aggressive than they have ever been in a souls game many enemies have multihit combos that result in the player being stunlocked due to the lack of poise blocking does not help because your guard breaks easily rolling is the only efficient method to combat armor and sheilds are way to underpowered to deal with the aggressive enemies of ds3all of these issues lead to only one viable playstyle light rolling and heavy weapons using heavy armor is pointless as it yields no benefit shields can only block a few attacks at best before your guard is broken so why bother with them the lack of poise leads to a stunlock gameplay it feels as if i am playing bloodborne with a souls skin from should have made another bloodborne since they obviously wanted to4 map designwhat is porbably my favorite design feature of ds 1 was the intricate map design the waps were wooven together vertically which allowed for shortcuts and hidden passage ways it was really interesting to explore the map and see how it folded back in on itself and how it flowed just the oter day i was playing ds 1 through again and i noticed that you can see lost izalith from the tomb of the giants bonfire it made the map feel titly knit and jammed packed being forced to explore the map and every nook and cranny due to the inability to fast travel early on made me very familliar with themap i now have it memorizeed like the back of my hand and can navigate it very quickly however ds3 is rather linear the map doesnt come together and suprise you like ds1 did its not a major issue i m just dissappointed slightly5 hub worldds2 and 3 adopted a hub approach to the game design they forced you to return to a certain area to level up upgrade weapons and to purchase items while in ds3 merchants blacksmiths andbonfires were all over the map you could all your weapon upgrading repairs and leveling up from any bonfire this allowed the game to flow and didnt interupt the exploration at all instead of warping back to a hub and going through multiple loading screens just to level up i could instead do it all at a bonfire this made my journey feel much more personal and lonely which really helped deliever the atmosphere of lonliness that dark souls nailed perfectly the game does have some pluses however it is visually stunning some of the bossfights are fantastice the music is top notchpvp from what i played is reasonably fun despite the many balancing issuesthe enviorments while linear are gorgeous and intterestingit has interesting endingsthe quests are fun and rewardingvoice acting is stellar
