2016 i do not recommend this game to players that are new to civilization games things i like 1 i love the art style very simple and easy to your eye 2 i like the district concept learning how to optimize your city using district is fun district will likely make you play again 3 barbarians are fun to deal with they are a challenge even though i would prefer more options to deal with them like declaring a joint war against them or actually interacting with their leaders king beyond the wall 4 one more turn urge early eras are fun 5 sean bean doesn t die at least so far in my game things i hate 1 freaking a i spamming denouncing button on you after i finish this review i am going back in the game to nuke every a i to teach them some manners you will get denounced for no reason you build a military to protect yourself you i am denouncing you you dare bring your units to close my borders even though they are in your terrority you i am denouncing you 2 trading with a i is pointless i wanted a luxuary resource salt and this tomyris of scythia wanted 4 luxuary resources of mine plus 100 gold per turn i mean like what the i nuked her later3 a i can t fight period just get close to their city during and they will take off their clothes and give everything to you russia declared war on me for no reason i was scared as i didn t know how much army he had turns out he had 2 horses and 1 chariot 2 warriors well it will be understatement if i say i killed them as i approached to his city with my mumulk knights and catapult and archers he his pants and gave me 300 gold per turn with 3 luxuary resources and the control over the city i was approaching in exchange for peace once the peace ended i declared war on him to finish him off 4 spying wasn t that fun maybe i didn t explore that enough but i would like more depth in espionage in previous civ games i remember you could start revolution through espionage poison city s water supply and etc etc i like more options other the current options of stealing funds art work 5 can t trade technologies can t trade maps can t trade units this one i am not sure because i got no allies forever alone 6 a i spamming missionaries if i don t have open border deal with them they shouldn t be in my territory tomyris of scythia has been sending 5 6 missionaries to my territories even though there is no open border deal and they block your units what the is that seriously she had 6 missionaries surrounding my city i nuked my own terriority in frustration to kill those there are other things that are frustrating it is so frustrating that we get our video games like this full of buggs shame on you sid meier for releasing a game in this condition doesn t matter if you patch this game you better this is not acceptable this is total rip off i don t see how anyone can defend this game i would give this game a 2 10 is this game unplayable no it is not you can play the game but the intended mechanics of the game don t work the reason why i give 2 10 is because if you are going to charge me premium price for the game then you better have something more than just a playable game just one note on technical issues i haven t been able to exit the game properly everytime i quit the game using quit to desktop the game just freezes and i have to mannually restart my pc edit thought i add to my review after playing this game in 2022 the game was and still is cosmetic update from cvi 5 no significant changes i think they hired inexperienced programmers to code this game because nothing works as intended looks good on paper but once again execution is zombie mod this what happens when you do your assignment at 11 55 pm when it is due at 12 00 am its just more barbarians endlessly spawning in your base and just in your base to kill you they will ignore the barbarians and coordinate attack with them to destroy you just like barbarians they spawn out of thin air it made kinda sense for barbarians to spawn out of thin air but zombies shouldnt be spawning like that especially within your terrority by numbers and no one was killed which triggered the zombies i have cleared the surrounding and it seems they spawn at their fav location near a trader to mess with you heoric age you go in dark age because you couldnt build enough wonders to satisfy your greedy of bastered population so 1 2 cities will rebel makes no sense don t use this option ai gets their city rebelled every era because these developers cant code ai they can t code simple game mechanic correctly so it is unrealistic to expect a working aiai denouncing still a problem less of a problem than before but problem indeed russai sends army of pedophiles into my terrority despite me asking him i dont want his stupid religion leaving me no choice but to declare war i declare war so i can kill the pedos and save children within my borders while i am waging war against pedophiles i meet three new civs one turn later they denounce me makes no sense but anyhow i expected pedos to support pedos so i continue some turns later war is ended and children are safe the who denounced me start requesting to trade with me because they wanted my luxury resources i think there should be an option to say you to your ai if they request to trade with you after denouncing you ai get advantage for no reason aka cheating i am guessing that is the only way developers can compensate for their lack of skills corporation industry another useless addition no depth it is laughable at this point how the developers are custom maps another example of developers they should join a coding boot camp or something to learn how to program i can t believe that we dont have a working editor at this point of this franchise overall playable game i didnt experience any crashes but i have a good computer maybe thats why considering what they are charging and it is the sixth game i wouldnt recommend this to new players if you civ player then you probably already own the game but if you havent then dont bother
