2023 early access review i have waited and waited and waited for this game to come out of early access so i could give an honest review based on the games final version it now seems like after 10 years in ea the devs do not intend to ever leave early access so the game has went through many different versions over it s 10 years in ea some have been fun some have been well balanced and seemed like moves in the right direction but in the end the devs have reworked most major systems once every year usually for the worse the overall gameplay is enjoyable at it s core but failure to finalize the core game mechanics have killed it for me saves are not compatible over different versions of the game nor are you able to enjoy any new cool features unless you want the new core mechanic rework from that year as well as an example their most recent game version removed all water container use from the game because having access to water makes the game to easy so you can pick up a bottle of water out of a trash can take it back to your base dump it in a pot and boil it then of course drink it but in an idiocracy moment you just toss the bottle in a pile because humanity has at this point has decided containers are the devil s work or maybe they are too complicated for our survivors but you can go down to the local pond and take a vitamin and drink directly from the filthy pool with no ill effects that doesn t matter though because in next years build it will be completely reworked with something new the devs have also leaned heavily into the trader missions which started out as just an option to add to gameplay for those who didn t like the sandbox feel of the game they are now being pushed forward as the intended way to advance in the game by the devs and forum mods so not the gameplay i payed for when i bought the game another issue is the game is still full of random bugs and is very poorly optimized you tend not to notice this at first in a new game but after a few weeks of building and as the number of zombies and automated defenses increases your frame rates will tank and the stuttering will start and that s even on a decent pc with a good cpu and gpu the developers have said repeatedly they will not work on optimization until the game is fully released and bugs are to be expected until then kinda makes you think that may be part of the reason they continue to stay in early access they may have no clue how to optimize the game after all this time and mess of coarse there have been improvements over the last decade of development new items gear and building blocks have been added along with a selection of new vehicles to build also even though the saves can t be carried over you can download previous versions of the game to continue old saves but at time this system can be a confusing system to use the random world generator has generally gotten better each year as well so that is a great plus overall i can t recommend this game since it will never leave early access and therefore never be optimized or have it s core mechanics become stable for long term play
