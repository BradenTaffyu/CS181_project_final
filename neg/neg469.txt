2020 the game can be enjoyable unfortunately the game is plagued with one of the worst scaling enemy systems i have ever seen level 20 me has been unfairly killed by a random scorchbeast spawned in by a level 80 many times intentional or not this system is basically advertising fallout 1st s private server function for those who are frustrated with that mechanic there is a battle royale mode nobody cares this game has most certainly improved just too little too late
