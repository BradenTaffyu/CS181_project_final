2019 wall of text incoming been a long standing fan of the total war franchise i own almost every game up to this point except thrones of brittania i do not think that this total war is that good as people are making it out to be yes it is running a lot smoother than previous historical total war releases namely attila and rome 2 the diplomacy panel has some added options and the unit scale has been upgraded not something you could not mod and again maybe it is just me but i have some really big gripes with this title incoming list of negativity 1 the battles are very fast and arcady compared to the legacy total war titles play an open battle in this title then go back to medieval 2 and play a battle in that game and compare the 2 i really think that the battles have taken the wrong turn i do not know if a bugs bunny reference would be appropriate archers do not fire exploding arrows they are not artillery units should not be melting with a single archer volley armor should play a bigger factor in the resilience of the units now you open the skirmish phase and half of your army is gone artillery in this game should be reworked too as they reload extremely fast they are too accurate and explode on impact 2 the ai is pretty much the same as in total war warhammer 2 even more passive now the game is pretty much unbalanced in the legendary difficulty the stat boost that the ai gets is pretty much the same as it has been for the past years but there is a discrepancy between the custom battle difficulty and the campaign battle difficulty in the custom matches the difficulty goes up until very hard but in the campaign you can set it up to legendary i do not know though if that has any impact on the stats yet 3 it seems the game is balanced around the romance mode as the battles between units play exactly the same as the unit in record mode the difference is only that in romance mode the units have higher morale and they do not tire as much 4 there is no variety in the units for different factions it is a bummer to see the same armies again and again the game as a historical fan is not providing me with anything that medieval 2 did not for me it is a step in the wrong direction instead of focusing on the ai the maps and the battles they focused on providing gimmicks the game will and is selling very good i know that but they must not see the sales and get complacent as they do not prove if the game is of quality or not i would like to hear what you think of this approach on the game maybe i am out of touch if you made it down here thank you a lot for your time
