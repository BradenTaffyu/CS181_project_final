2023 1 some maps are very beautiful and models look great 2 the ui is not great but you get used to it 3 you can get matched up with someone maxed out who s using a lower tiered vehicle to pray on newer players this get frustrating quickly 4 premium vehicles are ridiculously overpowered compared to their tech tree counterparts 5 you quickly hit a wall where you can t even pay to purchase vehicles unless you grind yourself to boredom so the game tries its best to force you to spend money it s a shame combat can be a lot of fun in this but the predatory nature of forcing you to spend real money to progress at a reasonable rate or to be even competitive in some cases is making it a very frustrating experience this is similar to world of tanks in that regard i m not sure if i want to even keep this around to play it once in a while because i don t need a game to frustrate me in ways i can t control so if you value your time i say there are hundreds of other games that are worth your time
