2016 its one of the better tw titles but as most reviews the price you start paying 60 then ypu pay 7 for one faction then another 7 for another faction sometimes you gotta pay 20 for a faction that comes with a special campaign for that faction wich most ppl wont even pay so its esentially a more expensive faction and by the time you have everything they are planning to give you youve spent over 200 and you still dont have a full game before you had every nation playable im talking the earlyest tw s and you acually bought expansions who just focused on a more specific region with extra events and what not with the occasional new nation that does have extra units but are then specifically made for that expansion nowadays its not downloadable content but rather pay us more to get your cut content right here for a ridiculous price tag so unless ca sega open their eyes and see that dlc s are not meant to complete the game but rather than to add extra content to the game then i suggest to only buy tw w and any other title when its on sale
