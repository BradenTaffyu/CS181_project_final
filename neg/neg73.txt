2020 early access review i honestly cannot recommend this game for anything reminiscent of full price the developers are without a doubt some of the slowest team to ever release an update for an early access game that is closer to a decade old of course these are the same developers who had their entire source code stolen during a break in but of course only after people had bought the game and also the developers who ve gone an entire year without any relevant content updates the entirety of which get talked about vaguely in some thursday blog where they prattle on about a bunch of half assed ideas that typically don t see the light of day an example of which is npcs which are just gone because i guess too hard and which discussion gets locked on their cult forums because its been answered by the npcs that exist there an example of an idea which actually saw the light of day was the animation update you may be thinking boy howdy ain t that something cut my asscrack sideways and call me tom zomboid devs are putting in that work except when you find out the first footage of the animation update was revealed 3 years before it came out in a test build youtube video zomboid animation clothing preview views 211 563 a preview of the upcoming animation and clothing overhaul of project zomboid re animator a nice treat for us all this mondoid which should bring us to the current test build which has the most relevant content zomboid has had since its first induction this first version of the build was released october 16 2019 and it looks like an okay update it finally allows new clothing animations that don t look like and basically seems like a pretty good baseline and hell even new weapons that didn t require mods since before a certain time you couldn t even mod weapon models into the game because the devs said it was impossible until some quacky crazy guy made a mod that allowed it then was banned and then you could add models to the game quacky but anyway this new content what s the problem well a most obvious thing is that after 253 days at the time of this review they still haven t released it as a stable version most people would assume after nearly a year of working on a test version you could push it forward a bit right well here s where it gets spicy can you name a single game you ve ever played that has had multiplayer implemented completely and utterly into the base game only for an update to not include it for 253 days oh i can only game i know that has ever done that zomboid and why you may ask has it taken 253 days to still have no online addition in sight because they re remaking it pikachuface why has it been so hard well that s just the norm for zomboid developers y see when it was first announced the update was going to not include online they remarked don t worry guys we re going to fix it up real quick and then the priority will be knocking multiplayer out because of course a timeline of 1 month maybe more was given oh no the devs had something come up those poor fragile people so why are you bullying them about such a thing they can t control you mean old player because this is the norm with these devs its inexcusable that its taken 253 days for your online to be fixed to work with this version just like its inexcusable for most of the promised content to take a year s if you wanted to remake the multiplayer why is it so apparent that the devs didn t start working on it until the only good content update in years was released why wouldn t they pretend to be any virtually developer and not hide behind a test version for a year or more as to why basic and promised features would be added in summary the game is okay mods are absolutely necessary because of the lack of actual content its pretty janky most of the time you should buy it as a product that your okay with right now not what you hope it to be since you ll likely have the finished george rr martin collection before this game even has a release date if it ever even gets one if you want to play online with friends you have to play with what is essentially a version thats years old and it doesn t appear the test version is going to have multiplayer for months would not recommend so that i can save anyone from the dayz syndrome but hey at least dayz never released a decent update after years but took out the online for it
