2016 epic title some great new features added to the series however most of the best features from previous titles have been left out this has made what could have been a great game seem half finished probably the biggest dissapointment is that multiplayer has none of the great features shogun 2 had very dissapointing for such a general magic skills based title i was really buying this game expecting to play mostly online and have a general for each faction to upgrade and customize with different weapons armours magics and skills pros well optimised and great graphicsquests touturials objectives are the best designed from any tw game until later game and it all breaks distinctive factions with their own gameplay mechanicsaddition of magic to generalsalmost no bugscons unfinished game you need to pay for the rest in the form of dlc even though you paid for the game already no thought given to multiplayerno small settlement battlesno unit formation optionsno ammo typeslimited unit types for each factionlimited upgrades armour etc for unitsbadly balanced later game mechanics the game balance is great until around turn 50 and then everything goes haywire the verdict a dissapointment buy it on sale
