2021 i have to say i don t get it i ve never quite understood the love for this game it s a fine product with very good visuals for a 4x game as well as a top notch interface the polish on stellaris is undeniable but under that shiny skin is a game with the depth of a shaving bowl to start i love paradox games i ve poured many an hour into eu3 ck2 eu4 and haven t yet purchased ck3 because i value my marriage i am a sucker for sf games and it remains one of my consistently favorite genres of games but stellaris isn t it i tried to like it i really did long after i found the game beyond boring about 15 hrs in when i figured out the core gameplay loop will never change i stuck with it for another 40 hours hoping wishing there was more than i found there wasn t so let s talk about it a little the main problem i have with the game is the loop here s every single loop of every single game of stellaris you will ever play send an explorer vessel to neighboring system put it on auto mode really discover anomaly investigate anomaly receive random anomaly story build outpost in system send mining ship to system and build every extractor and mining facility you can move to next system colonize a system as you can repeat for thousands of hoursthat s it that s the game i wish i were exaggerating in 60 hours of playtime this is the only thing i ever did i never made a choice i never actually did anything i simply sent my ships to the next star built an outpost and some mines and maybe colonize a system at some point you hit your cap of how much outposts you can build you d think that maybe this is where choices start to matter and the expansion part of things is over nope just research a technology to make that pool of points larger and start the process again hit another wall research again and continue at some point you do this enough that you ve filled up the entire map as much as you can and are now running into your neighbor s borders it s at this point the game really gets boring see up until now at least you were very minimally doing something but now you just sit there and well nothing you sit there and stare at the screen you can declare a war i guess wars boil down to this build as many ships as you can make sure it s more than your opponent meet them at whatever choke point exists between the two of you bigger navy wins take a few planets which is very much like colonizing just with lasers and that s it congratulations your space zone has increased a little bit and you can go back to staring at the screen for countless more hours the anomalies are pretty cool at first they hint at some nice atmosphere and depth to the game but after you ve scanned your 300th anomaly in the core loop and seen the same thing pop up a dozen times it gets pretty stale yes there are other things you can do you can genetically modify races you can build buildings in your colonies you can fine tune population designations those are all things that exist in the game but here s the thing none of it matters at all all races are the same and ultimately the little bonuses and desires they have don t matter because your tech research will be more powerful than the modifiers making a planet into an economic juggernaut doesn t matter because once again and i can t stress this enough the only thing you ll ever be doing is explore scan move on so you make 4 000 credits a turn you re still just going to explore scan move on until you re at your limit and then you ll do nothing more than simply stare at the screen and watch your credit pool grow oh and you ll always always always build and colonize 100 of everything available to you there s no trade off for doing so what you re ultimately playing is fog of war eraser remove the fog of war push 100 of the little buttons that exist in the newly revealed area and move on to reveal the next fog of war repeat until you stop playing the game again i wish i were making this up so all of that depth people rave about is not depth it s window dressing it s covering up one of the worst game play loops i ve ever experienced in a game you ll never make a decision other than should i build this type of mining facility first or the other one again you ll always always always build them both so this isn t really a decision so that s the loop let s talk a little about other negative aspects of the game not sure how to put this but it feels very soulless i think this is a problem with most space games however ck2 and eu4 has charm you feel like you re in old europe trying to tame the dirty peasants and their problems stellaris you re just kind of there in the void the game is extremely slow look i don t play fps at all and rarely an rts i don t need fast twitch games but honestly you could boot up stellaris for 2 hours and do literally nothing but stare at your screen that entire time on max speed nothing of consequence happens ever those anomalies and random events almost everything in the entire game is small random good modifier discovered so all you really do is just click confirm thousands of times again no choices in this game it really gets stale fast no story i know it s a paradox 4x game but eu4 has a flow and story for each country in the form of decisions story events and random trigger chances ck2 has story in that you have a family tree and can somewhat role play your way through it stellaris every single entity in the entire game is just inconsequential resource the president you just elected random resource fleet captain random resource all those techs that make your people live longer now my random resources don t get replaced by almost identical other random resources as frequently yay let s talk about at least one positive the tech tree is amazing i don t think i ve ever seen a tech tree quite as good as this one first it s huge that s awesome second the way it branches and the little purple techs that get thrown in by chance is very well done this is the only part of the game that will actually change at all from play through to play through it s very well done another positive might be the race editor if that s your thing since races don t matter at all not sure why everyone raves about this ultimately it s the worst paradox game ever made by far you may enjoy it if you re good at making stories out of watching paint dry or you want to boot up a game put it on max speed and walk away from your computer for several hours just to see how things develop if you re looking for something engaging or to capture the thrill of other paradox titles except in space stay far away
