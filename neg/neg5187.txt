2016 as youll read in pretty much all the other reviews the game is good however cocking over and taking a fat dump on your customers is not if anything total war fans have been very loyal through some dark times in the franchise and having to be charged 20 basically for each faction that should have already been in the game is not the way to repay them ill admit i caved and bought one additional faction but im taking a stand against this and am asking fellow gamers to do the same if we give in and pay the extra money alot extra theyll know they can do this and get away with it theres no reason they should charge per faction lets put a stop to this now
