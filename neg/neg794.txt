2015 okay i m a huge fallout fan from fallout 1 to fallout 4 and everything in between i also understand times are changing play styles and the market are totally different to what they used to be this game is a good game infact it s a fantastic game however this is not a good or even a nice fallout title the rpg elements have been anything but eradicated from the game dialog options are lazy and misguided combat is based on an fps from an rpg point of view this game is simply a post apocalyptic fps with ability scores there s no karma no roleplaying no skills you can use every gun in the game regardless of strength stats intelligence is practically useless due to the way the new perk system has been implelemted which in my opinion feels rushed too the perks themselves are good they re on the right track but this game doesn t feel like fallout it doesn t play like fallout it feels even less like fallout than new vegas and 3 but this game drops the penny in conclusion if you want to play this game in an rpg sense i wouldn t buy it it s very difficult to roleplay this game if you want a game where you can walk in blow up shoot things from a mile away and watch it run circles around it s programmed area buy this game because that s all it feels like again this is my personal opinion i m very much into rpging games which is why i enjoyed fallout 1 2 3 so much despite that i ve finished this game on the hardest difficulty and frankly it falls short on many occasions i personally haven t ran into any game breaking bugs at least none that werent fixed by simply reloading my game there are however things in this game i have found to be gamebreaking like the ability to find the best weapons in the game within the first hour of the game this specifically and a few other issues i personally have with the game have rendered me unable to enjoy my time playing hopefully this review helps some people who may be a bit on the fence about buying this as i said fantastic game bad fallout title
