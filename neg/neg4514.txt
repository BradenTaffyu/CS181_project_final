2018 the sid meier s series may never be as good as it was before it s very sad to see the legacy being disolved away by poor development and money hungry dlc policies although there are some positives i cannot recommend it in good faith because there are too many major flaws civilizations 4 may be the last great civilizations game ever made because civ 5 and civ 6 just never learned from their failures that being said i will go over what makes the game good and what made it fail pros lots of diverse countries dynamic diplomacy options with minor city states and even major civs simplified mechanics appeal to broader audiences if you ve never played a civ game before you can easily learn this in one campaign the civ5 setup of only allowing one miliatary unit per tile allows the potential for more strategy than stack spamming like in earlier civ games cons lack of balance with leader strengths and weaknesses some are super op and others are useless compared to civ 4 the modding community is dead and has been since civ 5 in civ 4 there were so many total conversion mods it was like ten games for the price of one fall from heaven 2 was my favorite the mods for civ6 are mostly just gui tweaks the ai has major glitches and exploits the warmongerer penalty is one of these but i would say it is a minor one the ai is very poor at standing up for itself against other ai so what will happen is if you leave a large group of ai together for too long one will be dominating all the others most commonly through religion and skew the game victory conditions it makes the game more of a rush to squash the ai in distant lands before they get squashed by one major ai i wish the game was instead multiple civilizations with equal power inteligence that you had to wisely navigate around all fighting to win that s what civ 4 was like not just 6 ai letting 1 ai win versus you winning is still easy it s just not as satisfying because you have to bum rush everything because of this design issue war weariness is bugged and has been for years according to the forums whenever i am at war for an extended period of time and wipe out another civilization my cities go into permanent unhappiness this should go down over time but never does it s happened in 3 4 playthroughs so far liberating a city from a civilization you conquored seems to make it happen more frequently new dlc policy is just greedy we should pay 60 for a complete game not 120 i got the deluxe edition and rise fall dlc for roughly 45 and i still feel the experience is not worth the money technology culture and production are all massively unbalanced worse than other civ games every game i wind up having 12th century knights lined up with ww2 infantry or i m building ancient walls around a fully modernized skyscraper city because there aren t any modern alternatives i also tend to be discovering modern democracies in medeval times i think they could update this and add in new transitions between techs and civics to balance the madness this would fix these issues but they don t seem to make any significant updates to the base game also districts take way too long to build and they are a major cornerstone to the game there is a lack of significant support they haven t made any major updates or improvements that don t require you to pay more money their attitude seems to be we have your money that s all we needed there are not enough diverse scenerios systemic inertia among the development team has made them ignore fan feedback instead they just seem to repeat their 9 10 reviews like a mantra thinking they are always on the right path they ve developed such a reputation for the sid meier name from their previous games that even if they publish a half effort trash game some famous reviewer nerd will still give it a good review just because it has sid meier in the name tldr civ 4 was way better than civ 5 or civ 6 civ 6 costs way too much because of dlc cash grab economics this likely won t change in future civ games because they like money it s a fun game kind of but they could have easily made it way better if they tried it s not worth what they charge don t pay full price unless you hate money
