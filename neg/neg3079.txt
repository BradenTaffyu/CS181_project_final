2022 rimworld is this type of game which has potential but is being held back by a myriad of bad interaction design artificial rubberbanding in difficulty and generally bad game design choices i came back to this game years after its beta and it s sad to see that barely anything has improved or changed despite it being so successful before i proceed it s worth noting that this review is for the vanilla game and not the dlcs i doubt they add much to it besides extra content let s talk about the story teller in rimworld the story teller ist basically a little script that runs in the background you can select one of three however they don t make a big difference but slightly change the time frequeny of when a strong encounter will be generated for your guys you can also set the difficulty but this only seems to affect the difficulty curve or you could say how fast the encounters ramp up this brings me to the first game design choice the difficulty is based on your colony wealth what does this mean let s say you tell your pawns to smooth a bunch of floors and walls each of them add 20 colony wealth for comparison a decent ish chain shotgun weapon can be bought for let s say 2000 this means if you smooth 100 floors it s equivalent to having another decent weapon for your pawns but you don t have it the game will generate newer encounters based on your colony wealth so you will be up against 10 guys with machine guns n but your pawns will only have a revolver a bolt and maybe an autopistol granted there are mods which can change this behaviour but i want a game where i m not required to install balancing mods to remove dumb game mechanics is that a problem well it depends do you care about your characters if yes then rimworld isn t the game for you your guys are called pawns and that s how the game thinks of them having played a lot of dwarf fortress i tend to get attached to my lads and expect my colony to get larger over time this is not the case in rimworld the story teller basically keeps a number in mind of how many pawns you should have if you have less than that you are more likely to get new ones if you have more than that you are more likely to face random bs which might kill injure weaken them with things like animal attacks diseases etc this goes so far that the game will save you when all your characters are downed by bringing in another guy as a random ish event good for story purposes but not truly a sim this makes the game very frustrating as you struggle to search for new pawns from quests and slave traders while you hope that rng will give you one with decent combat stats and whatever role you need to fill in after your favorite pawn just died and what makes it a million times worse is the passion system if your pawn has a passion for a skill they level it really fast if they don t then they don t get much exp and changing their passion isn t possible so yeah naturally you try to avoid having your pawns die but you can t well unless you just abuse game mechanics killbox you basically abuse a glitch to diagonally attack enemies which are standing on an open door you can make a box through which you funnel them while your pawns stab them to death completely safe and broken reloading and retrying you just alt f4 the game and redo the day or start from the last save which unfortunately also works even if playing permadeath permadeath autosaves every day making it like a checkpoint it baffles me that there is no system which prevents you from abusing this in permadeath mode you might think well then don t use it but no if it s available then people will use it that s why games like don t starve have a proper system in place which prevents you from save scumming what makes it really overpowered in rimworld is doing things with a chance of failure taming animals surgery expensive crafts that yield different quality items it is also possible to change the random encounters completely in one case the game generated a mechanoid attack outside my base which was easier to deal with than an insect infestation inside my base superhauling while not combat related it s still a useful technique which enables your pawn to haul more than 75x of an item which makes hauling a ton faster in some cases like hay you can easily carry 800 units or something which is a massive harvest however it also requires micromanaging them by using the caravan interface since you can train animals to haul things it isn t too overpowered but still a weird game design choice considering the artificial 75x limit for carrying an item there were also some minor annoyances which stack up over time the annoying building priority system whenever you build something pawns tend to not choose the closest errand you can t set a priority either all they do is build things with a weird priority system they first do buildings which have gotten items supplied to them then they choose roofs walls floors furniture deconstruction smoothing this leads to multiple issues where your pawns will walk halfway across the map to build a wall which was 5 bricks stored while not bringing 25 additional bricks to the walls right next to the one they want to build you also can t tell a guy to only haul things to buildings since hauling is one big category and worst of all you only have 4 priority levels anyway for the work categorys who had the brilliant idea to program it this way this makes the game painfully annoying as you have to constantly micro manage your pawns and tell them in what order they need to do things like a sims3 character and no nothing was done about this issue over the last few years nothing all this does is place the game in a weird mix between real time strategy sims3 dwarffortress however lacking the incredible depth of dwarffortress rimworld becomes boring quickly while df has a lot of different production branches rimworld basically only has food or drug related stuff which you grow cloth which you harvest directly no looms etc it basically works like reardy to use leather and different crafts which are based on metal wood yeah you can craft things like drugs weapons but they are all based on a single big crafting skill so if you are experienced in tailoring you can naturally roll a perfect joint while crafting a masterwork machinegun micromanaging your pawns behaviour works decent if you know that you can hold shift to chain work orders after each other it is worth noting though that your pawns will not take care of basic things like eating and recreation if they have orders chained some things also need to be micromanaged the game won t tell you about them since it sucks at communicating and you will need to look things up unless you find the functionality yourself this includes stuff like not having your pawns wear clothes from dead people since it causes a mood debuff which you have to configure since the game initially doesn t do it making you wonder why your pawns have a bad mood til you look it up for example the drug system was pretty neat but pawns sometimes seemed to ignore orders based on their traits chemical fascination so you had to lock drugs away behind a wall to prevent them from doing those what bothers me the most about rimworld however is how similar the areas look there aren t many different rocks bricks it s a flat 2d world and unlike dwarf fortress you can t go up or down however you can build additional settlements spoiler ain t worth it unless you wan t to mine there are rarely any dungeon like set pieces the most you will find is a little box with ancient danger which is going to be an overpowered enemy or the occassional steel table which is randomly sitting somewhere whenever i go back to rimworld i basically just feel a need to play a better game with more depth and less
